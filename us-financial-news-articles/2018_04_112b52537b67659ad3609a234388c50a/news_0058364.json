We have the same dedication to protecting Texas businesses, supporting our employees and nurturing our community. Partnering with Higginbotham multiplies our ability to do all those things while staying personally involved with every customer we service.\"\nBrent Aycock, a managing director with Higginbotham in Lubbock, said, \"Our practice has taken off since joining Higginbotham because we can do so much more for our customers, from the range of coverage we offer to the risk management and employee benefit services we perform in-house.
