Security Council in 1991. \nPayouts are made quarterly as funds become available. \nThe UNCC said in November that Baghdad should finish paying by the end of 2021 compensation for damages to states, companies and individuals caused by Iraq’s invasion and seven-month occupation of Kuwait under former president Saddam Hussein. \nKuwait and Iraq agreed last year that payments would gradually increase from 0.5 percent of Iraqi oil proceeds in 2018 to 1.5 percent in 2019 and 3 percent in both 2020 and 2021. \nIraq declared victory over Islamic State in December, five months after Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition captured the militants’ capital in the northern city of Mosul.
