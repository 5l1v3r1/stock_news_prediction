From the Durban test match, South Africa outplayed us purely on skill,” he said.\n“But we have also got some guys here who have played international cricket for a very long time and they will have to step up again now that we have lost two of the best players in the world for the foreseeable future.”\nCricket - South Africa v Australia - Fourth Test - Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - April 3, 2018 South Africa’s Vernon Philander celebrates bowling out Australia's Chad Sayers REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko MORKEL WICKETLESS Philander took six wickets for three runs in 32 balls to carve through the tourists and keep fellow seamer Morne Morkel (2-28) wicketless on his final morning of international cricket before his retirement.\nAustralia resumed on 88 for three, but lost the Marsh brothers in the opening over as Shaun (seven) got an inside edge on to his pad and was caught by Temba Bavuma, and Mitchell was snatched by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock, both off Philander.\nPeter Handscomb (24) was bowled after chopping on to his stumps and Paine (seven) edged to De Kock as the tourists struggled to cope with Philander’s seam movement.\nPat Cummins (one) left a delivery that cannoned into his off-stump and Chadd Sayers (zero) edged to Dean Elgar at gully as the Australian innings ended in a rush of failures.\nThe match ended when Nathan Lyon (nine) was run out, a chaotic end to what has been a shambolic series for the Australians.\n“This means a lot to us,” South Africa captain Faf du Plessis said. “And I believe this is the best we have been right through a series. Credit to everyone that played their part, at various times a lot of guys put their hands up so we can say this was a collective team effort.\n“We all know there were a lot of incidents in this series, but after each day I would sit in the dressing-room and sense that there was a calmness to our emotions and we were really just focused on winning games of cricket.”\nTempers boiled over in the series on a number of occasions, but Paine said he was looking forward to sharing time with the South Africans.\n“We have been invited in (for a beer), though it’s a bit early, it might be a coffee,” Paine said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “We have got some young players in our team who will learn a lot from going to have a beer with some of the experienced players in the South Africans have got. We are very happy to do that.”\nReporting by Nick Said, Editing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T13:22:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
