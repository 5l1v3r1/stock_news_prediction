European Union flags flutter outside the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman \nWhistleblowing has become an increasingly hot topic since two former accounting firm employees were prosecuted in 2016 for leaking data about Luxembourg’s tax deals with large corporations in the so-called “LuxLeaks” affair. The conviction of one was overturned by Luxembourg’s highest court this year. \nUnder the Commission’s proposed rules, both private and public companies would be required to set up internal reporting channels and do follow-up reports, according to a draft seen by Reuters. \nSuch channels will have to guarantee the confidentiality of the whistleblower’s identity. \nThe proposal would also oblige employers or authorities to prove that any lawsuits they bring are not a retaliation against the informers. \nThe draft says exposing wrongdoing, whether corruption, tax avoidance or public procurement, could save the bloc billions of euros. \nThe level of protection currently given to whistleblowers varies among the 28 EU countries, with Ireland for example considered to have good laws in place while Cyprus does not have any, according to Transparency International EU. \nThe proposal, which the Commission will unveil on Monday, will need approval from EU countries and EU lawmakers before it can become law.
