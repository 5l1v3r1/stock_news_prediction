The increase in revenue was attributable to $154 million favorable currency translation effects, 3% volume/mix growth and the pass through of increased input costs. First quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $348 million increased by 9% at actual exchange rates, compared with the same period last year. On a constant currency basis, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1%, with growth in three of our four divisions partly offset by a decline in Glass Packaging North America.\nMetal Packaging Europe\nRevenue increased by 21%, to $885 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period last year. Growth reflected favorable currency translation effects of $106 million and 6% organic growth, principally from favorable volume/mix effects and the pass through of higher input costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $134 million increased by 6% at constant currency compared with the same period last year, reflecting cost savings and synergy delivery partly offset by higher input costs.\nMetal Packaging Americas\nRevenue increased by 23% to $529 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the same period last year. The increase was due mainly to favorable volume/mix effects and the pass through of higher input costs. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $15 million, or 31% to $63 million, compared with the same period last year. Growth primarily reflected higher volume/mix effects, synergy realization and cost reductions, partly offset by higher input costs.\nGlass Packaging Europe\nRevenue increased by 17% to $397 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, compared with the same period last year, benefitting from higher volume/mix effects and favorable currency translation effects of $48 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by 18% to $80 million, compared with the same period last year, as a result of cost savings and favorable currency translation effects of $9 million.\nGlass Packaging North America\nRevenue decreased by 10% to $413 million in the first quarter, compared with the same period last year principally reflecting lower volumes. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 22% to $71 million in the first quarter, compared with the same period in 2017 as a result of lower volumes and higher freight and other operating costs compared with the same period last year.\nEarnings Webcast and Conference Call Details\nArdagh Group S.A.
