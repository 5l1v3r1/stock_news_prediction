The Endowment Index™ rose 5.51% through January 26 th , 2018 as investors focused on changes in U.S. tax policy and favorable corporate earnings. Thereafter, concerns over rising U.S. interest rates translated into a correction in global markets that pushed the Index to its quarterly low of 1,231.44, (-2.34% YTD) on February 8 th . Changes in U.S. trade policy with respect to tariffs put a damper on the ensuing bounce, and the Index closed nearly unchanged to end the quarter.\nEight of the Index's nineteen components posted gains during Q1, with natural resources-timber (+2.58%), gold (+2.09%), and emerging markets (+1.20%) posting the largest gains. Of the eleven components posting declines, domestic real estate (-8.12%), natural resources- metals & mining (-4.18%), and emerging market bonds (-2.16%) posted the greatest declines.\nThe Endowment index™ represents the investable opportunity for managers of portfolios utilizing the Endowment Investment Philosophy™ or who otherwise incorporate alternative investments within a comprehensive asset allocation.
