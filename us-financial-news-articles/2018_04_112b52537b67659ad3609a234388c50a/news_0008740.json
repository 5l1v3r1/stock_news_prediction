Justin Jackson missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer with 0.4 seconds left to give the Suns a much-needed win.\nPhoenix led by double digits in the third quarter for the third straight game, but unlike the previous two performances on the road at the Western Conference’s two best teams — losses to the Houston Rockets and Golden State Warriors — the Suns actually came away with the win this time.\nThe Suns led by 14 with 9:29 left in the third quarter after a Josh Jackson 3-pointer, but Sacramento trimmed the deficit to as little as three just eight minutes later.\nPlaying without both Devin Booker (hand) and TJ Warren (knee), the Suns looked to Josh Jackson and their reserves to put away the Kings. Alex Len had 17 points and 15 rebounds off the bench, and Danuel House Jr. (14 points) and Shaquille Harrison (10) also contributed for Phoenix, which prevailed despite shooting 64 percent from the free-throw line.\nThe Suns made 45.5 percent of their field-goal attempts while the Kings hit only 37.1 percent from the floor.\nWillie Cauley-Stein had 18 points and De’Aaron Fox added 14 points and nine rebounds for the Kings. Sacramento’s bench contributed just 14 points.\nPhoenix remains at home for two more games against New Orleans on Friday and Golden State on Sunday before concluding its season at Dallas next Tuesday.\nSacramento remains on the road for games at Memphis on Friday and at San Antonio on Monday before returning home to face Houston on April 11.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:06:30.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
