Enforcing the ban is one of the government’s priorities this year. \nBut it remains a lucrative business. The U.S. Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries said at the time of the ban that U.S. exports of scrap to China were worth $5.6 billion in 2016. \nCiting figures from the General Administration of Customs, the People’s Daily said this year’s intercepted shipments included 64,700 tonnes of waste slag from mines. It said 52 people had been arrested by April 2 this year. \nChina arrested 259 people for smuggling foreign waste last year, with some criminal gangs accused of taking containers of electronic waste from Hong Kong to North Korea and then smuggling them across the border into China in order to circumvent restrictions. \nThe newly formed Ecology and Environment Ministry said at its inaugural meeting last week that it would step up the fight against foreign waste, describing it as “a symbolic measure for the creation of an ecological civilization in China”. \nLast month, the United States asked China not to implement the ban, saying it could disrupt global scrap material supplies. \nIn a strongly-worded response, state newspaper China Daily accused the United States of hypocrisy, saying developed nations ought to have a “guilty conscience” for being “unwilling to pay the costs of processing their hazardous waste themselves”.
