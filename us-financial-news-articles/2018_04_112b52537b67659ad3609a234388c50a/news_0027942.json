Think you’re up to speed with GDPR? Soon, there could be more privacy rules to get your head around, but this time there’s a far better acronym. Digiday has a handy guide on the Customer Online Notification for Stopping Edge-provider Network Transgressions (CONSENT) Act, a bill proposed by Senate Democrats Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal that would bring GDPR-like privacy rules to the U.S. Certainly worth taking a look, especially if more U.S. digital firms start leaning in this direction in preparation for May. Lawyers say, however, the potential of the CONSENT passing is “still pretty low,” partly because there’s no Republican sponsor yet.\nFuture Islands It will take a while yet to fully digest the news that Martin Sorrell is no longer WPP’s chief executive. Right now, as Alexandra Bruell and I reported for the Journal, the ad world is still reeling and speculating on what happens next . Former Havas CEO and You & Mr Jones founder David Jones, said Mr. Sorrell’s exit will have “ramifications for the entire industry.” The WPP chief was one of the few figures who fought for the entire industry, including publicly taking on tech giants like Google and Facebook, he said. What might happen next? Analysts running the numbers have suggested the company should be broken up and sold in pieces to quickly create shareholder value. Some observers are saying the data-investment assets could be first to go. That doesn’t seem to align with WPP’s “horizontality” strategy, though, and if there’s anything clients are clamoring for at the moment, it’s more data and finding partners to help them make sense of it. Plus, most agency groups are looking to position their unique data assets as their key differentiators from their competitors.\nUn, Deux, Trois: Quarta! But perhaps the awkwardly named horizontality strategy might be one of the first things WPP’s leader seeks to overhaul. We might not know who is going to fill Mr. Sorrell’s shoes for the long haul, but in the meantime, a little-known private-equity executive has stepped in to steer good ship WPP into its next era. Roberto Quarta shifted from the chairman to executive chairman position at the company Saturday, pending the appointment of a new CEO. As WSJ reports, ironically, for a company that has bemoaned penny-pinching clients, Mr. Quarta is a renowned cost-cutter who earned the nickname “Bob the Knife” and “Spare No Quarta” earlier in his career. “He’s the only guy that scared the shit out of us,” said one former employee at Rexel, a company acquired in 2005 by Clayton Dubilier & Rice, where Mr. Quarta is European chairman. “It was all about speed and financial efficiency.” You may also recall it was Mr. Quarta who persuaded Mr. Sorrell to accept a significant pay cut in 2015.\nThe Hitmaker Even Netflix executives were surprised by the company’s blockbuster performance in its first quarter as the company beat analysts’ and its own expectations by adding 7.41 million subscribers in its first quarter--blowing past the 6.5 million expected by the Street. Revenue jumped 40% to $3.7 billion and marketing spend in the quarter rose almost 77% year-on-year to $479 million. In its letter to shareholders, Netflix said it plans to invest in more marketing of its new original titles to create “more density” of viewing and conversation around its hits. Also on the topic of marketing, Netflix talked up the success of its surprise Super Bowl ad push and drop of “The Cloverfield Paradox,” saying the event demonstrated “how a big branded film can be marketed and delivered to consumers instantaneously across the globe without a wait for the theatrical window.”\nYou’ve Got All These Great Answers to All These Great Questions “My team will get back to you on that,” was one of Mr. Zuckerberg’s most-used catchphrases during double-day grilling from lawmakers on Capitol Hill. His team have been working on it. On Monday, Facebook published a blog post to follow-up on questions on why it collects data on third-party website and app users even when they’re logged out of Facebook or don’t have a Facebook account. The blog post explained how sites use Facebook services to measure and run ads (if the person doesn’t use Facebook, its Audience Network can show them an ad encouraging them to sign up; if the person does, they can see ads from brands that target them on Facebook) and also to allow users to easily share content. Facebook uses the data for analytics and to refine its ad targeting. Facebook also reminded us that while it’s currently the one getting whacked over the knuckles over its data-driven ad model, Twitter, Pinterest and LinkedIn have similar like or share buttons, Google has a “popular analytics service,” (who knew?!) while Amazon, Google and Twitter have login features.
