He resigned in September 2015.\nThe international aid organization said in a statement it would cooperate with the inquiry by the Charity Commission.\n“We are committed to working with the Charity Commission to establish a truthful and accurate account of events and the charity’s response,” said Peter Bennett-Jones, the chair of Save the Children’s UK board of trustees.\n“If mistakes were made, we will act swiftly and decisively to address them.”\nCharities in the aid sector were put under the spotlight earlier this year after an expose by The Times newspaper revealed that some Oxfam staff paid for sex with prostitutes in Haiti after the country’s 2010 earthquake.\nThey have since pledged to overhaul their approach to dealing with allegations of sexual misconduct and harassment.\nAn exclusive survey by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in February found more than 120 staff from leading global charities were fired or lost their jobs in 2017 over sexual misconduct.\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry; Editing by Kieran Guilbert.
