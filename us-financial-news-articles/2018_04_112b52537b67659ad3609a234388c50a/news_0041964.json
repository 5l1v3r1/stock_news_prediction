The run charged to him was unearned.\nSix Twins pitchers, beginning with Berrios, matched Carrasco and his mates for 13 innings before Encarnacion connected on a full-count pitch by Trevor Hildenberger with one out in the 14th and sent his fourth homer of the season over the fence in left field.\nBut Sano launched Matt Belisle’s first pitch of the bottom of the 14th in the same direction, drawing the Twins back to even at 1-1. It was Sano’s fourth homer of the year as well.\nBoth allowing three hits. Carrasco walked one and struck out seven. He was coming off a complete-game, three-hit effort in a 5-1 win over Detroit last Wednesday.\nBerrios’ seven shutout innings extended his streak to 14. He struck out five and did not walk a batter for the second straight game.\nJoe Mauer, Rosario and Escobar added two hits apiece for the Twins, who have won four of five bridging three rainouts last week.\nMichael Brantley and Encarnacion had two hits each for the Indians, who were out-hit 13-12.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:22:54.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
