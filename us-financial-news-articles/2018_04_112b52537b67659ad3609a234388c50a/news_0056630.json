Parliament TV handout via REUTERS Rudd made the comments at a lunch with reporters which came hours after opposition lawmakers called for her to resign over the scandal and a dispute about whether or not her department had targets for removing illegal immigrants.\nRudd also told reporters she did not feel she was being used as a human shield for Prime Minister Theresa May, who as the former interior minister would have been in charge of the ministry at the time the mistreatment started.\nFor nearly two weeks, British ministers have been struggling to explain why some descendants of the “Windrush generation”, who were invited to Britain to plug labor shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, had been denied basic rights and in some cases detained and threatened with deportation.\nReporting by David Milliken and Andrew MacAskill, writing by Sarah Young, editing by Estelle Shirbon\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:14:21.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
