A new exploration and production sharing agreement will govern the petroleum rights for the round.\n“Ras Al Khaimah has significant remaining oil and gas potential within its diverse petroleum geology - in both the onshore and offshore acreage,” Nishant Dighe, Chief Executive Officer of national oil company RAK Gas said in the statement.\nRAK is one the UAE’s seven emirates. Abu Dhabi is the capital of the UAE, holding the majority of the country’s oil and gas reserves.\nReporting by Rania El Gamal, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T18:01:07.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
