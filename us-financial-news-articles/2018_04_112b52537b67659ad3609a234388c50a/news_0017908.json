Although some banks have been treading carefully in the region, fearful that close ties with Doha could hurt business relations with Saudi Arabia, investors are likely to be far less sensitive, especially given the potential yield on offer.\nThe 30-year leg will also benefit from a Taiwan listing.\n“You can expect Taiwan onshore guys to play in size there, in addition to the normal guys,” said a banker. “There is definitely demand for this credit, the fundamentals are very strong, and relative to some of their Double A peers they trade wide.”\nThe notes are expected to be rated Aa3/AA-/AA-.\nQatar was last in the bond market in June 2016, raising US$9bn through the same five, 10 and 30-year structure.\nAl Khaliji, Barclays, Credit Agricole, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Mizuho, QNB Capital and Standard Chartered are joint leads and books.
