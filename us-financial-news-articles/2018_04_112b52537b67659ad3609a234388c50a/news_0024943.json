The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang soon before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.\nThe law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the feature.\n\"(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,\" Minami said.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
