Net operating income for the quarter was $1.47 per diluted common share (1) , compared with $1.15 per diluted common share for the year-ago quarter.\nHIGHLIGHTS:\nNet income as an ROE (1) was 11.5%. Net operating income as an ROE excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities (1) was 14.6%. Life underwriting margins increased over the year-ago quarter by 7% and health underwriting margins increased over the year-ago quarter by 9%. Life premiums increased over the year-ago quarter by 9% at American Income and health premiums increased by 8% at Family Heritage. Net health sales increased over the year-ago quarter by 11%. Average producing agent counts increased over the year-ago quarter by 15% at Liberty National and 11% at Family Heritage. 1.0 million shares of common stock were repurchased during the quarter.\n(1) Includes the impact of the change in the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the recent tax reform. See further discussion of the tax reform on page 2.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nQuarter End\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nNet operating income, a non-GAAP (1) financial measure, has been used consistently by Torchmark's management for many years to evaluate the operating performance of the Company, and is a measure commonly used in the life insurance industry. It differs from net income primarily because it excludes certain non-operating items such as realized investment gains and losses and certain significant and unusual items included in net income. Management believes an analysis of net operating income is important in understanding the profitability and operating trends of the Company's business. Net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nPer Share\nQuarter Ended\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\n2018\n2017\n%\nChg.\nInsurance underwriting income (2)\n$\n1.37\n$\n1.23\n11\n$\n160.3\n$\n148.6\n8\nExcess investment income (2)\n0.53\n0.49\n8\n61.9\n59.3\n4\nParent company expense\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\n(2.3)\n(2.2)\nIncome tax (3)\n(0.37)\n(0.56)\n(34)\n(42.8)\n(67.1)\n(36)\nStock compensation benefit (expense), net of tax\n(0.04)\n—\n(5.0)\n0.1\nNet operating income\n$\n1.47\n$\n1.15\n28\n$\n172.2\n$\n138.7\n24\nReconciliation to net income (GAAP):\nReconciling items, net of tax:\nRealized gains (losses) on investments\n0.01\n(0.01)\n1.5\n(1.5)\nPart D adjustments—discontinued operations (4)\n—\n(0.03)\n(0.1)\n(3.6)\nNet income (5)\n$\n1.49\n$\n1.11\n$\n173.6\n$\n133.5\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding\n(000)\n116,750\n120,430\n(1) GAAP is defined as accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n(2) Definitions included within this document.\n(3) In 2017, new tax legislation revised the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In the first quarter of FY 2018, income tax expense was calculated based on the 21% rate as compared with a 35% rate for the first quarter of FY 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company recorded $877 million of tax benefits in net income as a result of re-measuring its deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower corporate tax rate as of the date of enactment. Based on the analysis of the tax reform, the Company was able to determine that this amount is a reasonable estimate of the impact in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. However, the Company will continue to analyze relevant information to complete the accounting for income taxes which may result in an adjustment to tax expense in 2018. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax returns are filed later in 2018. The Company did not make any adjustments to this estimate in Q1.\n(4) The remaining Part D adjustments are administrative items related to the disposition of this business.\n(5) A GAAP-basis consolidated statement of operations is included in the appendix of this report.\nNote: Tables in this news release may not sum due to rounding.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY, CONT\nManagement vs. GAAP measures\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nShareholders' equity, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, and book value per share, excluding net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, are non-GAAP measures that are utilized by management to view the business without the effect of unrealized gains or losses which are primarily attributable to fluctuation in interest rates on the available-for-sale portfolio. Management views the business in this manner because the Company has the ability and generally, the intent, to hold investments to maturity and meaningful trends can more easily be identified without the fluctuations.

Insurance underwriting income is the sum of the insurance underwriting margins of the life, health, and annuity segments, plus other income, less insurance administrative expenses. It excludes the investment segment, parent company expense and income taxes. Management believes this information helps provide a better understanding of the business and a more meaningful analysis of underwriting results by distribution channel.

It is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt.
