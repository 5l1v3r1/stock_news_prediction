The size of its stake in AstroNova could not be learned.\nA representative for Ides declined to comment. AstroNova could not be reached for comment.\nAstroNova shares closed 1 percent higher on Wednesday at $16.10, giving the Rhode Island-based company a market capitalization of $108.9 million.\nIdes Capital, co-founded in 2015 by Dianne McKeever, a former Barington Capital partner, is one of only three activist hedge funds globally that is headed by a woman, according to research firm Activist Insight.\nWashington-based Cartica Capital, which focuses on emerging markets investing, is the only woman-led activist firm, Activist Insight said.\nIdes Capital on its LinkedIn page describes itself as seeking to “constructively engage with management teams and corporate boards to improve corporate governance practices.”\nIdes’ most well known investment was in 2016 when it waged a proxy fight with airplane wireless provider Boingo Wireless Inc. It settled after Boingo added three independent directors to its board.\nReporting by Liana B.
