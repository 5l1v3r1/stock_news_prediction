Its “junk” rated bonds could no longer be accepted as collateral in regular funding operations.\nGreek central bank chief Yannis Stournaras last week appealed for Athens to maintain the ECB waiver but a clean exit, advocated by the government, would make that impossible .\nThe sources said the ECB would make no exception and would revoke the waiver, as it did in the case of Cyprus in early 2016 when it made a successful exit from its own bailout.\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.\nGreek banks now borrow 4.5 billion to 5 billion euros in regular ECB operations, the sources said. Losing access could force them to use Emergency Liquidity Assistance. Interest on ELA are 1.25 percent, compared with the zero percent main refinancing rate and 0.25 percent marginal lending rate.\n“There is a cost, yes, but a clean exit will shore up confidence in the economy and offset some of it through better and cheaper market access,” one of the sources said.\nGreek banks borrowed around 13.55 billion euros in ELA by the end of March.\nThe ECB has not bought Greek bonds in its 2.55 trillion-euro quantitative easing scheme, and Athens hoped it could finally take part in the programme once European leaders approve debt easing measures before the end of the bailout.\nSuch measures could make Greek debt sustainable. But its sovereign debt is rated as “highly speculative” by all major rating agencies, leaving Athens several steps below investment grade.
