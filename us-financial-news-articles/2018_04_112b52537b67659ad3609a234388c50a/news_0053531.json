There is something to (cities) being the right size - large enough to fund services, but small enough to pay attention,” one of the report’s authors, Erika Poethig, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“I think that being slightly smaller in a growing metropolitan area or a state that is doing well economically certainly helps your ability to adopt more inclusive practices and policies,” she said.\nThe report found that an economic downturn in a city could prove to be a useful time to put in place opportunities that promote greater racial and social inclusion.\n“We’re a diverse and wonderful country and we’ve had periods in our history, and are currently living in one, where that sense of inclusion that we all are trying to strive together is fraught,” Poethig said.\nRich and poor countries alike are tasked with creating sustainable and inclusive cities by 2030 under global development goals agreed in 2015.\nAnd with two-thirds of the global population forecast to live in cities by 2050 - compared with about half now - urban-planners and policymakers are increasingly looking at ways cities can foster inclusive development.\nThe study seeks to encourage change at the local level by equipping city leaders and officials with “building blocks” to put in place strategies that bring about greater inclusion.\nThose include providing more social services, improving local leadership, and recognizing that inclusion of low-income residents is integral to growth.\nFor Sarah Treuhaft, who oversees the All-In Cities initiative at PolicyLink, a U.S. national research institute on racial and economic equity, cities are key “crucibles” for overturning racial and social inequities, she said.\n“In the United States the neighborhoods in cities are incredibly unequal in terms of the types of opportunities they are providing their residents,” she said in a phone interview.\n“Lower-income people and people of color are often relegated to polluted neighborhoods, those that have the worst schools, that don’t have parks, transit, access to jobs - all of the things you need to have economic and social success.”\nDespite the report’s findings, no U.S. city - big or small - has cracked the code on achieving full racial or social inclusion, but cities have cause for optimism, Poethig said.\n“We’re only going to get stronger if historically marginalized people or communities where investment has flowed out rather than flowed in are reinvested in - otherwise we’re not going to succeed as a nation.”\nReporting by Adela Suliman, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
