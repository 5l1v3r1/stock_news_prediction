Shares in Softlogic Finance, which accounted for 60 percent of the day’s turnover, however, ended 0.6 percent lower. \nThe Colombo stock index ended 0.18 percent higher at 6,451.17. \nForeign investors sold shares worth net 420.8 million rupees on Wednesday, extending the net foreign outflow to 1.25 billion rupees from equities. \n“It was a very dull day as most local investors are on leave,” said Atchuthan Srirangan, assistant research manager, First Capital Holdings Plc. \nMarket sentiment improved after Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe survived a no-confidence motion last week, dealers said. \nTop fixed-phone line operator Sri Lanka Telecom closed 6.3 percent higher, while Hatton National Bank ended up 1.8 percent. \nDealers expect the stock market to be tepid this week ahead of the Sinhala-Tamil New Year on April 14. \nThe central bank unexpectedly cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, as policy makers sought to revitalise an economy growing at its weakest pace in 16 years and facing heightened political uncertainty. \nThe index fell 0.33 percent last week and dropped 1.14 percent in March. $1 = 155.6000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T15:53:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
