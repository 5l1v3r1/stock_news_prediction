Should Elliott’s slate win the majority, Vivendi could still appoint five board members one of whom would be Genish. However, the Israeli-born executive may choose not to stay if Vivendi, which brought him in last year, does not win the majority.\nThree proxy advisers recommended backing Elliott’s candidates ahead of a vote that was initially to take place on Tuesday, saying Vivendi had been damaging for governance and shareholder returns.\nGenish has made no firm commitment over his future in the post other than saying that alignment with the board and trust were key for any CEO and he hoped to get that from the new one. He added he “looked forward to working with everyone in the coming years”.\nThe Tuesday AGM happened as French billionaire Vincent Bollore, who stepped down as Vivendi chairman last week, was being questioned by police as part of an investigation into allegations of corrupt business practices in Africa.\n“STABILITY AND EXPERTISE” Since becoming a TIM shareholder in 2015, Vivendi has gradually tightened its grip and last year appointed two-thirds of TIM’s board as well as making its own CEO, Arnaud de Puyfontaine, executive chairman.\nThe hands-on approach has led to friction with Rome, concerned about an asset it considers of strategic importance, and has unnerved other investors at the telecoms group.\nElliott has said TIM’s share price, strategy and governance had suffered under Vivendi’s leadership.\nVivendi in turn had asked investors to trust its long-term strategy, saying it provided “stability and expertise” in contrast with Elliott’s “quick fixes”.\nElliott and Vivendi were meant to face off for the first time on Tuesday after the activist fund had called for six board members nominated by Vivendi to be replaced. However, a judge ruled that the motion should be excluded from the agenda because any such appointments would be temporary.\nAt the meeting, TIM shareholders approved the 2017 financial statements, the company’s remuneration policy and elected a new board of statutory auditors.\nVivendi did not comment on Tuesday, while Elliott said the May vote would allow the company “to turn the page on the governance issues” and give TIM the right conditions and team to lead its growth in the interest of all.\nIn his opening remarks, Deputy Chairman Franco Bernabe urged shareholders to put their conflicts aside to focus on boosting the company’s technological edge and competitiveness.\nHe said the recent board fights and battle of words have “worsened the climate” at TIM and caused “serious reputational damage”, adding shareholders and employees had a right to expect “support and stability inspired by a long-term vision”.
