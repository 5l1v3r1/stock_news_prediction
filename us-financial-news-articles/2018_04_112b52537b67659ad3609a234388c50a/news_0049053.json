Over the past three years, we have significantly transformed the company, starting with our clear and simple strategy to focus our resources on deploying high-speed data networks in Latin America. We are now beginning to reap benefits in the form of faster and more predictable revenue growth, improved cash flow and returns, and a stronger balance sheet.\nIn Latam, revenue growth in our mobile business improved to almost 1%, with Guatemala leading the way at more than 4%, an impressive turnaround from the 5% drop that we reported in Q1 2017 in that country. Meanwhile, our Home and B2B businesses continue to grow steadily, and we connected a record number of new homes during the quarter, as we move closer toward our plan to pass 15 million homes in the medium term.\nSubsequent events\nOn April 19th 2018, the President of Senegal issued an approval decree in respect of the proposed sale by Millicom of its Tigo operation in Senegal to a consortium consisting of NJJ, Sofima (a telecom investment vehicle managed by the Axian Group) and Teyliom Group.\nOn April 23rd 2018, the U.S. Justice Department informed Millicom that it is closing its investigation into Millicom. In October 2015, Millicom voluntarily reported to the U.S. Department of Justice potential improper payments made on behalf of the company's joint venture in Guatemala and, since then, has cooperated fully with the Justice Department's investigation.\nConference call details\nA presentation and conference call to discuss these results will take place on April 25th, 2018 at 2:00 PM (Stockholm) / 1:00 PM (London) / 8:00 AM (New York).
