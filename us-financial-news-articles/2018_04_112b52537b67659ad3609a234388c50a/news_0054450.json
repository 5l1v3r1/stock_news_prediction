Now, Musk has his sights set on a new endeavor: a cyborg dragon.\n‚ÄúOh btw I‚Äôm building a cyborg dragon,‚Äù Musk casually tweeted Wednesday afternoon. Oh btw I‚Äôm building a cyborg dragon\n‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 25, 2018\nMusk didn‚Äôt provide any other details, but that one tweet was enough to get people excited about the news. People responded with Game of Thrones jokes, the idea that a ‚Äúcyborg‚Äù dragon specifically needs a living element to it and speculation on whether Musk‚Äôs new flamethrower will come into play. The ominous part is not \"dragon\" but \"cyborg,\" since it implies there's an organic component to the whole enterprise. Will the billionaire put a pigeon inside his machine, or perhaps just some still-living part of a bird? The mind reels.\n‚Äî Kelsey D.

However, Musk has used this method before. He previously announced on Twitter that he would begin selling flamethrowers after selling 50,000 hats. Sure enough, a $600 flamethrower began selling on The Boring Company‚Äôs website. What was originally believed to be a joke on Twitter led to millions in flamethrower sales.
