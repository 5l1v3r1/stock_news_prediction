In a statement, the 73 year-old businessman said, \"WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.\" \nChairman Roberto Quarta will take on the role of executive chairman until a new CEO is found. \n\"I hope that his legacy doesn't fall by this disruption,\" Sawiris said, adding that he believed WPP should consult Sorrell on choosing the next CEO. If a successor is chosen abruptly, that could be \"very dangerous,\" the Egyptian billionaire cautioned. \nDuring his three decades in the industry, Sorrell developed a reputation for strong opinions and an autocratic management style.
