A further 11 victims are at various stages within the scheme, it said.\nAt least 13,000 people across Britain are estimated by the government to be victims of forced labor, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude - but police say the true figure could be in the tens of thousands with anti-slavery operations rising.\nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) - dubbed Britain’s FBI - received 5,145 reports of suspected slavery victims in 2017, an increase of more than a third from 3,804 for the previous year.\nWith the lucrative crime - estimated to enslave 40 million people globally and raise annual illegal profits of $150 billion - evolving and spreading, countries and charities are ramping up efforts to catch traffickers and provide support to survivors.\nBut help must go beyond shelter, and take into account that victims may suffer stigma, discrimination and trauma, and lack access to counseling, healthcare and housing, activists say.\n“The ability to access good employment can be a transformative step for a survivor of modern slavery,” Janet Fisher, UK advocacy manager for the British anti-trafficking charity Hope For Justice, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nReporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
