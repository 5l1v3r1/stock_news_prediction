It now trades from 915 outlets in the UK.\nHubbard said she did not expect a big increase in the number of new high street shops Card Factory opens this year.\n“Other businesses in the past who have accelerated their roll-out plan have got themselves into a bit of trouble after opening too many in a year,” Hubbard said adding she expects to open a further 50 new stores in the current financial year.\nOn at its online operations, sales grew 67 percent at cardfactory.co.uk in the year to Jan. 31.\nCard Factory listed in 2014 and its rivals include Clintons and Scribbler card shops.\nIts shares rose as much as 7.7 percent, helped by the company’s 2.2 percent increase in final dividend and its plan for a special dividend of between 5-10p at its interim results in September.\nAnalysts at Peel Hunt said in a note that the in-line results from Card Factory were perfectly laudable given that conditions in the wider market were very tough. The brokerage has a “hold” rating on the stock.\nRevenue increased 6 percent increased to 422.1 million pounds ($596.2 million).\nUnderlying full-year core profit fell 4.6 percent to 94 million pounds on costs linked to Britain’s National Living Wage and unfavourable currency effects, but the result was within the company’s guidance range of 93 million to 95 million pounds.
