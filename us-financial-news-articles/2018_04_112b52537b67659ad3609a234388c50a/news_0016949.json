In September, we announced positive results from a European pivotal Phase III trial of ADV7103 in dRTA. This was followed by further positive 6-month follow up data in November. Earlier in the year, the EU granted ADV7103 ODD for this indication, a key step in supporting our plans to bring this novel product to market in Europe via our own commercial organization. Achieving these key milestones positioned us to complete a successful IPO and to raise the funds needed to further advance our clinical development plan in Europe and the United States and to prepare for a commercial launch of ADV7103 in Europe. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in 2018, during which we expect to deliver multiple value creating milestones” commented Dr Luc-Andre Granier, CEO and Co-founder of Advicenne.\nA conference call in English is scheduled today at 19:15 CEST / 13:15 EST\nWebcast link to the conference call:\nhttp://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1651991-1/763B63BFC26DE8A168465070CFA26FD2\nParticipant telephone numbers: Confirmation code: 40393609# FR: +33 170750711 UK: +44 3333000804 USA: +1 6319131422 Germany: +49 6913803430 Belgium: +32 24035814 Netherlands: +31 207095189 A replay of the call will be available on the Advicenne website following the live event.\nAbout Advicenne\nAdvicenne (Euronext: ADVIC) is a late-stage pharmaceutical company developing pediatric friendly therapeutics for the treatment of orphan renal diseases.
