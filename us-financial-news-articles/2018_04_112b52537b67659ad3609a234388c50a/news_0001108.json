The tariffs on those products will be raised by an extra 15 percent.\nEight other products, including pork and scrap aluminum, would now be subject to additional tariffs of 25 percent, it said, with the measures effective starting April 2.\n“China’s suspension of its tariff concessions is a legitimate action adopted under WTO rules to safeguard China’s interests,” the finance ministry said.\nChina is moving swiftly with retaliatory action amid escalating trade tension with the United States, which has rocked global financial markets in the past week as investors fear a full-blown trade dispute between the two economic superpowers will damage world growth.\nIn response to China’s move, Washington said Beijing’s subsidies and overcapacity were behind the action on steel.\nRelated Coverage White House criticizes China for trade practices, tariff increases China metals group eyeing new counter-measures in U.S. trade row China tariffs on U.S. ethanol to cut off imports in short-term “Instead of targeting fairly traded U.S. exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming U.S national security and distorting global markets,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.\nMORE TARIFFS COMING FROM WASHINGTON U.S. President Donald Trump is separately preparing to impose tariffs of more than $50 billion on Chinese goods following an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act.\nThe U.S. administration says China has systematically misappropriated American intellectual property - allegations China denies.\nAbout the Section 301 investigation, China had “yet to unsheathe its sword,” the official Xinhua news agency said.\nSometime this week, the Trump administration is expected to unveil a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.\nU.S. technology industry officials said they expected the list to target products that benefit from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” program, which aims to upgrade the domestic manufacturing base with more advanced products.\nFILE PHOTO: Several-week-old pigs stand in a pen inside a barn at Paustian Enterprises in Walcott, Iowa, November 19, 2014. REUTERS/Daniel Acker/File Photo China has repeatedly promised to open its economy further, but many foreign companies complain of unfair treatment. China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandora’s Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe.\n“There are some people in the West who think that China looks tough for the sake of a domestic audience, and would easily make concessions,” the Global Times said.\n“But they are wrong.”\nThe Global Times is run by the ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily, although its stance does not necessarily reflect government policy.\nReaction to China’s measures varied on social media, with some saying Chinese customers would be the ones to ultimately pay for a trade war.\n“Why not directly target soybean and planes? The tariffs that China announced today don’t sound a lot to me,” said a user on the Weibo microblog platform.\nAircraft and soybeans were China’s biggest U.S. imports by value last year.\nIn a statement published on Monday morning, the commerce ministry said the United States had “seriously violated” the principles of nondiscrimination enshrined in World Trade Organization rules, and had also damaged China’s interests.\n“China’s suspension of some of its obligations to the United States is its legitimate right as a member of the World Trade Organization,” it said, adding that differences should be resolved through negotiation.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Weibo prominently featured the list of U.S. goods that China is targeting among the day’s “hot” trending topics.\n“I will never buy fruit from the U.S.,” a Weibo user wrote.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard and Tony Munroe; additional reporting by David Stanway in Shanghai and Stella Qiu and Lusha Zhang in Beijing; additional Writing by Ryan Woo; editing by Eric Meijer, Shri Navaratnam and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T02:29:33.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
