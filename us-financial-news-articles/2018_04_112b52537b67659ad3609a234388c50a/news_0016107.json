Wood, with his track record for turning around and growing retail businesses, has also worked with Britain’s largest supermarket group Tesco, Mothercare said.\nIn March, the company warned that its full-year profit would likely come in at the lower end of its already slashed guidance and that its lenders had agreed to defer testing of financial covenants.
