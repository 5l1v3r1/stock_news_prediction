It’s probably the best my swing has felt, but I just didn’t pull the shots off.”\nElvira hit 66 for the second day in a row, while Rahm struck seven birdies and bogied only once to match his compatriot’s score for the day.\nRahm, who came fourth in the Masters last week, said a victory on Sunday would be the best moment of his career so far. But if he fails to catch Dunne, he hopes Elvira takes the title instead.\n“It would be the most special victory I’ve had so far. Forgetting the majors, (the Spanish Open) is among the tournaments I want to win the most,” Rahm told reporters.\n“I would love to be a champion in my country. It would bring me so much pride.”\nThe 24-year-old added: “I hope there is a Spanish champion. If it’s not me, let it be Nacho. I would be equally as happy.”\nEnglishman Andy Sullivan roared into contention with a second consecutive show-stopping display, carding a clubhouse-best score — a seven-under-par 65 — to move to 13 under overall, four behind Dunne.\nDefending champion Andrew “Beef” Johnston is further down the leaderboard at 11 under.\nReporting by Richard Martin,; Editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T21:50:03.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
