Oil prices have recently risen to their highest levels since the end of 2014 as supply and demand balance out.\nOverall profits at the San Ramon, California-based company were $3.64 billion, up nearly 36 percent from a year ago. The company reported earnings of $1.90 per share, compared with $1.48 forecast by Thomson Reuters.\nIn the first quarter, Chevron's profits from its upstream business, which produces oil and gas, doubled from a year ago. That offset a 21-percent drop in earnings in its downstream segment, which includes refining crude oil into fuels like gasoline.\n\"Oil and gas production is increasing, most notably in our Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG Projects in Australia, and our shale developments in the Permian Basin where production grew 65 percent from a year ago,\" Chairman and CEO Michael Wirth said in a statement.\n\"Upstream volumes are expected to continue to increase in future quarters,\" Wirth added.\nRevenue rose about 13 percent to $37.76 billion from a year ago.\nChevron attributed the weakness in its refining and marketing business to lower profit margins on sales of refined products.\nChevron's cash flow from operations, a key measure of financial health in the sector, was $5 billion, up more than $1 billion from a year ago.\nShares of Chevron are up nearly 18 percent over the last year, recovering from a sharp drop following the oil giant's last quarterly earnings report , which badly missed Wall Street's expectations.\nDuring that quarter, earnings took a hit from weaker profit margins in Chevron's downstream sector, which refines crude oil into fuels like gasoline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T15:46:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
