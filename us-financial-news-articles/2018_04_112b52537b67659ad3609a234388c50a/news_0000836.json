The size of this week’s three-month and six-month bills was each $3 billion less than last week, while one-month bill issuance was $10 billion less than last week.\nThe government had ramped up its sales of short-dated government debt to help fill an expected shortfall in revenues stemming from a two-year federal budget deal in February and the massive tax overhaul in December.\n“We should see a reprieve of this with higher collection of tax receipts,” said Jason Granet, deputy head of liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in New York. “As we go through the tax season, the government should be a net collector of money.”\nThe surge in short-term federal borrowing partly propelled an increase in interest rates in money markets which companies tap to finance their trades, inventories and payrolls, analysts said.\nExpectations the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates further in 2018 have also raised public and private borrowing costs\nThe London interbank offered rate for three-month dollars , a benchmark for $200 billion in U.S. financial products, hit 2.31175 percent on Friday, which was its highest level since November 2008.\nLibor’s premium over the three-month overnight index swap rate, a gauge of risk-free borrowing cost for dollars, is hovering above 60 basis points, at its loftiest level since April 2009.\nThis rate spread blew out to 2.37 percentage points at the height of the global credit crisis nearly a decade ago, Reuters data showed.\nThe recent widening of the Libor/OIS spread kindled concerns of stress in money markets, but most analysts have blamed the move on a mismatch in supply and demand for dollars rather than an omen of troubles brewing in the banking sector.\n“We don’t think there’s stress, but it’s more expensive” to borrow, Granet said.\nEarlier Monday, the Treasury sold $48 billion in three-month bills and $42 billion in six-month bills to mediocre demand, according to analysts said.\nThe Treasury will sell $55 billion in one-month bills at 11:30 a.m. (1530 GMT) on Tuesday.\nReporting by Richard Leong Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T23:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T16:16:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
