These acquisitions build on Granite's presence in two strong, central U.S. logistic markets.\nBoth properties were built in 2017, are single tenanted and 100% occupied with a weighted average lease term of approximately 9.5 years. Together, these acquisitions represent an in-going yield of approximately 5.5% and will be immediately accretive to funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations. Granite funded the acquisitions from cash on hand.\nMichael Forsayeth, Granite's CEO, commented that \"Consistent with Granite's strategy, these acquisitions in the U.S. will further reduce Granite's Magna concentration from 61% to 59% based on gross leasable area and are a step towards replacing the revenue from properties that were sold earlier in the year.\"\nGranite also announced further progress on renewing leases with expiries in 2018 and re-leasing an existing vacancy. Since announcing its 2017 year end results on March 1, 2018, Granite has renewed or re-leased four properties having approximately 0.9 million square feet and a weighted average lease term of approximately 9.7 years. This includes the re-leasing of a 0.7 million square foot space that was acquired in October 2017 and was expected to be vacated in October 2018.\nABOUT GRANITE\nGranite is a Canadian-based REIT engaged in the acquisition, development, ownership and management of predominantly industrial, warehouse and logistics properties in North America and Europe. Granite owns over 85 rental income properties representing approximately 30 million square feet of leasable area.
