Daniels has said she and Trump had sex once in 2006. \nAsked why his lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid the money if the allegations were untrue, Trump told reporters on Air Force One, “You’ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael’s my attorney.” \nAsked if he knew about the payment to Daniels, Trump said “No.” \nAsked if he knew where the money came from to pay Daniels, Trump told reporters, “No, I don’t know.” \nCohen has said he paid Daniels out of his own pocket. \nLast month, Daniels sued Cohen to be released from the non-disclosure agreement she signed in October 2016 in exchange for the $130,000 payment from him. \nDaniels’ attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Trump’s admission that he did not know about the agreement bolstered his client’s case to be released from the deal.

You can’t have an agreement when one party claims to know nothing about it,” Avenatti said on Twitter. \nAvenatti has said he wants to question Trump and Cohen about the agreement, which was signed the month before Trump was elected president. \n“We very much look forward to testing the truthfulness of Mr. Trump’s feigned lack of knowledge concerning the $130k payment as stated on Air Force One,” Avenatti tweeted. “As history teaches us, it is one thing to deceive the press and quite another to do so under oath.” \nLast week, a federal judge said Avenatti’s request to depose Trump and Cohen was premature. \nCohen wants to force Daniels to use arbitration, as opposed to open court, to settle the dispute over the agreement. \nIn an interview that aired last week, Daniels told CBS’s “60 Minutes” programme that she and Trump had sexual relations only once, but he had kept in touch with her. She said she was not attracted to Trump, who was 60 at the time. Daniels was 27 in 2006.
