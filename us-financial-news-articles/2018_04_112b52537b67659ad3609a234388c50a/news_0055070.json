(NASDAQ:LYTS) today announced :\nThird Quarter Summary\nSales increased 1% compared to Q3 of the prior year. Adjusted Operating Income increased 74%, with adjusted operating margin improving 40 basis points Adjusted Net Income of $226,000 (See Non-GAAP reconciliation below). GAAP reported EPS was $0.01 versus loss of $(0.02) in PY Q3. Adjusted EPS was $0.01, flat compared to PY Q3. Year-to-date sales increased 4% above prior year; while adjusted operating earnings increased 37%. Through the first three quarters, adjusted EPS is $0.20 versus $0.17 in 2017.\nNet sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $78,843,000, an increase of 1% compared to the $78,156,000 reported in the third quarter of the prior year. Reported net income was $220,000 in the third quarter versus a loss of $(531,000) in Q3 FY 2017. Reported EPS of $0.01 is above reported EPS of $(0.02) for the third quarter of the prior year. Adjusted net income was $226,000 compared to $357,000 for third quarter FY 2017. Adjusted EPS of $0.01 is flat with the third quarter prior year. The Q3 tax rate was above the prior year tax rate, with both years including discrete adjustments. See reconciliation of net income and earnings per share in the Non-GAAP table below. The Company declared a regular cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable May 15 th , 2018 to shareholders of record on May 7 th , 2018.\nThe business generated positive cash flow in Q3, and debt has been reduced by $10 million fiscal year-to-date. The Board approved a quarterly dividend payment of $0.05 per share.\nManagement Comments and Outlook\nThird quarter results reflect a steadfast, balanced approach to managing in a soft market environment, while continuing progress on key priorities. These priorities include shifting our sales focus exclusively to LED solutions in Lighting, new product introductions across the business; and continued efforts on gross margin improvement. This approach generated year-over-year sales growth of 1%, gross margin improvement of 110 basis points, and an operating earnings improvement of 74%, or 40 basis points during the quarter.\nThe 1% sales growth reflects the Lighting Segment’s exclusive focus on LED solutions, combined with the continued shift away from conventional fluorescent and HID technologies. LED growth for the quarter was 14%, while our conventional technology sales decreased 58% compared to same quarter PY. While this accelerated shift has unfavorably impacted our organic sales in the short-term, this move positions LSI to dedicate the necessary business assets required to capitalize on the forward growth opportunities in LED lighting.\nThe markets for both lighting and graphics, but notably lighting, remain stubbornly soft. Various published sources indicate that the lighting market is down mid-single digits, despite overall favorable economic fundamentals. Given this overall environment, our LED growth and gross margin improvement suggests the business is sensibly executing. LED now represents 92% of all lighting product sales at LSI.\nThe business continued a disciplined approach of managing price/volume trade-off decisions during this ongoing soft market, contributing to a 110 basis point improvement in our gross margin rate versus Q3 prior year. Selling prices remain very competitive, driven in part by the soft market. The business intends to launch in Q4 the “Protector” series of products to more effectively serve a broader segment of the market. This product offering will provide a lower price point solution to market applications requiring this range while assisting in maintaining price levels of the more feature rich product range. Pricing conditions are expected to remain extremely competitive for at least the next quarter.\nThe opposite side of the margin equation is product cost inflation, specifically materials. Prices in key commodities continue to increase, compounded by the Commerce Department “Section 232” announcement of a 24% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum. Domestic metal producers have already published new price increases as a result. LSI will realize modest cost increases in these categories in fiscal Q4 and Q1 2019; however, decreases in other categories, most notably electronics, are contributing to successfully offsetting the increase. In addition, the impact of the announced tariff on a wide range of Chinese imports remains unclear. The tariffs are not yet in effect, and we continue to analyze the harmonized tariff schedule for any potential impact and developing creative sourcing alternatives.\nThe current market environment requires a high vitality level of both new product development and cost reduction engineering activity. The launch of the new Scottsdale® Vertex™ under-canopy fixture, with the intent to solidify our market leading position in petroleum and c-store applications, has exceeded initial expectations. Shipment of the Vertex product began in March and the order backlog is strong. Additionally, a record twelve new LED products will be launched over the next four months, replacing a sizeable portion of the existing current product offering.\nThe Atlas Lighting acquisition attained its one year anniversary approximately mid-Q3. The Atlas brand continues to achieve success in the market, as well as generating the synergies targeted in the acquisition case. Specifically, cross-branding opportunities continue to expand; the continuous launch of new, lower cost products provides price competitive solutions; and global sourcing leverage and distribution expansion are all actively being managed.\nThe Graphics segment generated a growth rate of 5% in Q3, driven by continued growth in the SOAR digital signage business. Significant quotation activity continues, with specific major opportunities in the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) and Grocery retail verticals. Reaction and interest to SOAR at the recent Digital Design Expo was multi-fold above prior year, reflecting growing brand recognition and proven solution. The graphics petroleum business also had a solid quarter with strong activity at all three key accounts. The outlook for petroleum looks promising, with a mix of traditional solutions, complimented by new initiative growth opportunities. Positive momentum continues to build in our Graphics business.\nIndicators for both the Lighting and Graphics market remain mixed, suggesting the current sluggish market may continue for the short-intermediate future. The soft market, combined with uncertainty surrounding materials costs, will maintain pressure on margins. In spite of the current softness, the benefits of LED lighting have been proven, yet today LED as a percent of the overall installed base is estimated to be less than 15%. Advanced technologies, including smart lighting and digital signage, provide compelling opportunities to drive further growth.\nThe previously announced search for the CEO position is in process. We are targeting a leader with the skill set to manage through market transformations that we are seeing in both the lighting and graphics markets we serve; including focusing on advancing innovation and revenue growth.\nFinancial Highlights\n(In thousands, except per share data; unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31 Nine Months Ended\nMarch 31\n2018 2017 % Change 2018 2017 % Change Net Sales $ 78,843 $ 78,156 1 % $ 258,614 $ 247,973 4 % Operating Income (Loss) as reported $ 743 $ (774 ) n/m $ (19,524 ) $ 3,110 n/m Goodwill impairment -- -- n/m 28,000 -- n/m Impairment of intangible asset -- 479 n/m -- 479\nn/m Acquisition deal costs -- 1,480 n/m -- 1,480\nn/m Fair market value inventory write-up -- 155 n/m -- 155\nn/m Restructuring costs and plant closure costs -- (957 ) n/m -- 796\nn/m Severance costs 8 49 (84 )% 91 222\n(59 )% Operating Income as adjusted (a) $ 751 $ 432 74 % $ 8,567 $ 6,242 37 % Net Income (Loss) as reported $ 220 $ (531 ) n/m $ (16,877 ) $ 2,304 n/m Net Income as adjusted $ 226 $ 357 (37 )% $ 5,227 $ 4,455 17 % Earnings (Loss) per share (diluted) as reported $ 0.01 $ (0.02 ) n/m $ (0.65 ) $ 0.09 n/m Earnings per share (diluted) as adjusted $ 0.01 $ 0.01 n/m $ 0.20 $ 0.17 18 %\n3/31/18 6/30/17 Working Capital $ 67,141 $ 61,704 Total Assets $ 228,367 $ 256,680 Long-Term Debt $ 45,289 $ 49,698 Shareholders’ Equity $ 141,829 $ 160,078 (a) The Company recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment of $28,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The Company also recorded a $479,000 pre-tax impairment of an intangible asset in the third quarter and nine month periods of fiscal 2017.

We believe that these are useful as supplemental measures in assessing the operating performance of our business. These measures are used by our management, including our chief operating decision maker, to evaluate business results. We exclude these non-recurring items because they are not representative of the ongoing results of operations of our business.
