Vectren provides energy delivery services to residential, commercial, and industrial and other contract customers.\nOn April 23, 2018, Vectren announced it had signed a definitive merger agreement with CenterPoint. Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, Vectren shareholders will receive $72 in cash for each share held.\nThe investigation concerns whether Vectren's board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for the Company's shares of common stock.\nNationally recognized Johnson Fistel is investigating whether the proposed deal represents adequate consideration, especially given that one Wall Street analyst has a $75 price target on the stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of Vectren and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
