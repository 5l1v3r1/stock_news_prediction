( bit.ly/2Irj4lr )\nQuickly ramping up Model 3 production is crucial for the Silicon Valley electric vehicle maker, whose profitability depends on the cheaper sedan, which Tesla says has about 500,000 advance reservations from customers.\nShares of the Palo Alto, California-based company, which have fallen around a fifth in value in the past week, jumped 4 percent in premarket trade in New York.\nAuto industry blogs - citing an unverified memo - had reported on Tuesday that production of the Model 3 passed the 2,000 per week production rate.
