The Company claims that its initial product offering is the Obalon balloon system, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved swallowable, gas-filled intra-gastric balloon designed to provide progressive and sustained weight loss in obese patients.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company recognized revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”); (ii) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over accounting and financial reporting; and (iii) as a result, Obalon’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn January 23, 2018, Obalon issued a press release entitled “Obalon Announces Termination of Public Offering of Common Stock,” revealing that “a purported whistleblower contacted KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent auditors, to make certain allegations relating to allegedly improper revenue recognition during the Company’s fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.” The press release further stated that “Obalon’s Audit Committee will oversee an internal investigation of these allegations.”\nOn this news, Obalon’s share price fell $1.73, or 33.33%, to close at $3.46 on January 23, 2018, on unusually heavy volume. The $3.46 closing price represented a total decline of $11.54, or nearly 77%, from the IPO price of $15.00 per share.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions.

The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members.
