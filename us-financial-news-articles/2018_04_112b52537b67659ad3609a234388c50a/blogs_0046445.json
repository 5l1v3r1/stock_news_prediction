Meanwhile, he said, Brazilian companies \"will have to search for new markets to quickly substitute these exports.\" \nThe ban also dealt a blow to Brazil's largest chicken processor, BRF SA, which had 12 plants delisted by the EU after its involvement in a food safety investigation. \nTwenty plants were affected by the EU's decision, eight of which were operated by smaller companies, according to a draft document related to the decision seen by Reuters on Thursday. \nJBS SA, Brazil's second-largest chicken meat producer, had no plants affected by the ban, a source close to the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity. \nBRF did not have an immediate comment on the ban. JBS declined to comment. \nBRF stock, which rose 10 percent in early trading, pared gains to close 4.9 percent higher despite the setback. BRF shares soared after top shareholders on Wednesday agreed to appoint a new board chairman who investors felt could pull off a successful turnaround. \nEarlier in the week the Brazilian government threatened to file a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to discuss its claims that the EU chicken import quotas breached global trade rules. \nThe government affirmed its intention after the EU decision on Thursday, claiming European trade restrictions were \"not a health issue.\" \nBrazil's basic argument is that, when domestic companies that export chicken have to pay a 1,024 euro tariff per tonne, health demands are relaxed. \"This will be what we will complain about at the WTO,\" Maggi said. \nThe EC said the ban was related to \"deficiencies detected in the Brazilian official control system.\" The ban will apply 15 days after the publication in the official journal of the European Union, it added.
