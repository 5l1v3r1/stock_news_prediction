Underlying pretax profit rose to 10 million pounds ($14 million) in the three months to March 31, compared with 2 million pounds a year earlier, driven by strong lending growth and a rise in customer numbers.\n“The money we’ll be raising is purely growth capital,” Metro’s CEO Craig Donaldson told Reuters. “We are profitable, we are investing from our profit. We don’t need to raise any money for that.”\nMetro Bank’s common equity tier-one capital ratio (CET1) - a key measure of financial strength - was 13.6 percent.\nThe CET1 capital ratio for Britain’s banking sector as a whole was 14.9 percent in the final quarter of 2017.\n“Despite the company’s efforts to assuage on capital concerns by referencing a Tier 2 debt issuance in FY18 we believe it is without question that more CET1 capital will be needed – and we expect that this could come in July again,” said Cronin.\n“The standout negative today is capital – with 170 bps of CET1 capital ratio erosion in 1Q (more than we had expected) ... the timing of an equity capital raise has to be getting closer,” Cronin added.\nThe company said first quarter lending rose 66 percent to 11 billion pounds, helped in part by the acquisition of a mortgage portfolio. Customer accounts rose by 88,000 to 1,305,000.\nMetro Bank also said its bid for a share of Royal Bank of Scotland’s 835 million pounds remedies package was progressing. The funds, set aside as a condition of RBS’s state aid, will be divided up among smaller lenders to help them compete more effectively with the taxpayer-backed bank.
