He said an improved security environment had contributed to growing interest from foreign firms.\nAlgeria has struggled to attract foreign investment in recent years and has seen its oil and gas production stagnate. A sharp fall in oil prices from 2014 hit state finances, which are heavily dependent on hydrocarbons exports.\nOuld Kaddour is pushing to reform Sonatrach and improve relations with foreign partners in an effort to entice them to make new investments and boost production.\nReporting by Lamine Chikhi; Writing by Aidan Lewis; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T20:23:42.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
