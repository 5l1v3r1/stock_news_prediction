(TSX-V:HTL), a leading provider of precision instruments, consumables, software and services to the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) and developmental biology research markets, today reported audited financial results for the fourth quarter and year-ended December 31, 2017.\nSales for the year-ended December 31, 2017 increased 110% to $22.1 million, led by the contribution from the Company’s new quality control testing services and assay business and the substantial revenues resulting from the acquisition of Gynemed & Co. GmbH in April 2017. Fourth quarter sales increased 97% to $7.2 million primarily driven by acquisitions, augmented by 14% organic growth in operations owned by the Company for more than one year.\nFor the year and quarter, including the effect of the initial realization of a deferred tax recovery of $4.2 million, the Company reported a net income of $5.7 million and $4.7 million, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the year-ended December 31, 2017 increased 172% to $5.0 million; adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 43% to $1.4 million. Cash flow from operations was $3.2 million for the year, and total cash at December 31, 2017 increased to $5.7 million.\nDavid Wolf, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton Thorne Ltd. commented, “2017 was a very successful year for Hamilton Thorne. Through a combination of new sales and marketing initiatives and the expansion of our product offerings, we were able to generate approximately 7% organic growth for the year. On the acquisition front, we completed the integration of the Embryotech Laboratories business as well as completed a significant expansion of our product line, geographic coverage and scale when we acquired Gynemed in April. The results from these acquisitions, which included a full year of Embryotech and eight months of Gynemed activities, along with our organic growth, contributed to doubling our sales and achieving over 170% EBITDA growth for the year.”\nCommenting on the quarter, Mr. Wolf added, “Sales for the fourth quarter were positively impacted by significant growth in the Company’s equipment business in the US as our expanded sales force gained traction and also by two large laboratory equipment installations in Europe. As expected, gross profit and EBITDA margins were somewhat lower due to these two unusually large sales of third-party equipment in one quarter, the strategic broadening of our product lines, as well as the substantial investments the Company has made in additional sales and marketing resources. We were particularly pleased to see our organic growth increase to 14% in the fourth quarter, up from 7% for the entire year, largely driven by increases in our US equipment business.”\n2017 Business Highlights\nIn March 2017, the Company released its new DIMENSIONS™ II Version 3.0 Strict Morphology software module for its CASA II line of automated sperm analysis systems. Focusing on ease of use plus interoperability and consistency with the Company’s other software products, DIMENSIONS II is fully compatible with Hamilton Thorne’s IVOS II and CEROS II systems.\nIn April 2017, the Company purchased Gynemed GmbH & Co. KG, a leading provider of a broad range of branded and third-party products for the ART market in central Europe. The acquisition significantly expanded the Company’s consumables product portfolio and provided a base of operations in Europe.\nIn August 2017, the Company launched its TrakJector TM micromanipulator system which offers a unique, intuitive control system for fast and accurate ICSI and embryo biopsy procedures in the ART laboratory.\nIn September 2017, the Company began to cross-sell Gynemed branded products into the Americas, starting with its line of glass micropipettes for oocyte and embryo micromanipulation.\nIn October 2017 the Company announced that, in addition to selling and supporting its own range of branded products in North America, the Company began offering a selection of best-in-class equipment and consumables to meet the evolving needs of its customers.\nAt the same time the Company announced it had augmented its direct sales force and support team in order to provide its customers in North America with the broadest array of product, service, support and purchasing options.\nIn 2017, Hamilton Thorne’s products were referenced by customers at world-leading clinics, research labs and academic institutions in over 250 papers from prestigious journals such as Fertility and Sterility , Cryobiology , Human Reproduction , Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, Theriogenology, Cell Stem Cell, and Reproductive Toxicology .\nFinancial Results Fourth Quarter and Year-Ended December 31 Three Months Year Statements of Operations: 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sales $7,180,554 $3,648,854 $22,121,066 $10,514,803 Gross profit 3,916,757 2,477,931 13,183,578 6,862,592 Operating expenses 3,354,365 1,870,097 10,759,636 5,885,122 Net income 4,656,899 507,680 5,706,710 678,947 EBITDA 1,393,492 976,703 4,971,819 1,828,052 Basic earnings per share $0.04 $0.01 $0.06 $0.01 Diluted earnings per share $0.04 $0.01 $0.05 $0.01\nStatements of Financial Position as at: Dec. 31, 2017 Dec. 31, 2016 Cash $5,743,371 $1,837,655 Working capital 4,683,298 1,917,918 Total assets 37,810,412 12,242,873 Non-current liabilities 9,505,225 6,036,966 Shareholders' equity 21,678,892 3,403,335 All amounts are in US dollars, unless specified otherwise, and results, with the exception of Adjusted EBITDA, are expressed in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nResults of Operations for Year-Ended December 31, 2017\nHamilton Thorne sales increased 110% to $22,121,066 for the year-ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $11,606,263 from $10,514,803 during the previous year. Sales into the human clinical market grew substantially, primarily driven by the contribution from its new quality control testing services and assay business, and the substantial revenues resulting from the Gynemed acquisition. Sales into the animal breeding market were down slightly while sales into research markets increased, reflecting particular strength in its toxicology testing instrument business.\nGross profit for the year increased 92% to $13,183,578 in the year-ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6,862,592 in the previous year, primarily as a function of sales growth. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was down at 59.6% for year-ended December 31, 2017 versus 65.3% for 2016 primarily due to product mix, particularly the increase in sales of somewhat lower-margin, third-party products to Gynemed customers, partially offset by increases in higher margin branded consumables and quality control testing services sales.\nOperating expenses increased 83% or $4,874,514 to $10,759,636 for the year-ended December 31, 2017, up from $5,885,122 for the previous year, primarily due to the addition of Embryotech and Gynemed expenses post-closing, acquisition expenses, and significant increases in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles. Operating expenses were also affected by continued strategic investments in research and development and sales and marketing resources, plus a significant increase in non-cash, share-based compensation expense resulting from stock option grants, all partially offset by reductions in other categories due to continued expense controls.\nNet interest expense increased $572,327 from $255,898 to $828,225, for the year-ended December 31, 2017 versus the prior year primarily due to increased borrowing to partially finance the Embryotech and Gynemed acquisitions, partially offset by a reduction in the Company’s revolving line of credit borrowings.\nNet income increased 740% to $5,706,710 for the year-ended December 31, 2017, versus net income of $678,947 for the prior year, an increase of $5,027,763, due to the initial recognition of approximately $4,300,000 of a deferred tax asset primarily attributable to historical net operating losses now realizable, together with increased revenues and profitability for the relevant periods. This increase was partially offset by increased operating expenses relating to acquired businesses, continued strategic investments in research and development and sales and marketing resources, the significant costs for the Company’s ongoing acquisition program, together with increased amortization of acquired intangibles, stock-based payments, and increased interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year-ended December 31, 2017 increased 172% to $4,971,819 versus $1,828,052 in the prior year, due to revenue and gross profit growth offset by increased operating expenses in the periods.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, sales were up 97% from $3,648,854 to $7,180,554. Gross profit was up 58% to $3,916,757 versus $2,477,931 for the prior year. Sales and gross profit were up primarily due to the added revenues and gross profit from the Gynemed acquisition augmented by 14% organic growth. Gross profit percentage was down due to product mix, and was particularly affected by two large, European laboratory installation projects in the quarter. Operating expenses were up 79% to $3,354,365 versus $1,870,097 for the prior year primarily due to the addition of Gynemed operating expenses post-closing, continued strategic investments in research and development and sales and marketing resources, expenses incurred to complete the Gynemed acquisition, increased amortization of intangibles, and increases in share-based compensation expense, all partially offset by reductions in other categories due to continued expense controls.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s net income increased to $4,656,899 while Adjusted EBITDA increased 43% to $1,393,492 versus net income of $507,680 and Adjusted EBITDA of $976,703 for the prior year’s fourth quarter. These changes were due primarily, in the case of net income, to the recognition of the deferred tax asset and associated deferred tax recovery described above, and in the case of Adjusted EBITDA to increased sales and gross profits partially offset by increased operating expenses.\nOutlook\nMr. Wolf added, “Now that the work of integrating our acquired businesses is largely behind us, we are focusing on organic growth, including the significant expansion of our US-based sales team, as well as additional cross-selling and marketing synergies between our North American and European-based businesses. Looking forward into 2018, we expect to see accelerating growth in our worldwide business, driven by continued strong performance of our services and consumables brands, augmented by substantial growth in the US, as our new direct-sales team hits its stride.”\n“We expect gross profit margins to normalize as we manage product mix between our own higher margin products and services and third-party products. We will also continue to make investments in sales and marketing and R&D personnel and programs, which may marginally impact EBITDA margins in the short term but should continue to set us up for long term success. With continued earnings growth, strong cash flow from operations and our cash balance of $5.7 million, we believe we are well positioned to continue our acquisition program.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Wednesday April 25, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. EDT to review highlights of results. All interested parties are welcome to join the conference call by dialing toll free 1-855-223-7309 in North America, or 647-788-4929 from other locations, and requesting Conference ID 3284638.
