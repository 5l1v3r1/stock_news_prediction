Both the Western-backed government in Kabul and the main Islamist militant group, the Taliban, are fighting Islamic State. \nThe militant group first appeared in Afghanistan three years ago. Its fighters have been active in the north of the country as well as in its main stronghold area in the eastern province of Nangarhar on the border with Pakistan. \nWhile sectarian violence in mainly Sunni Muslim Afghanistan was previously rare, a series of attacks over recent years - many claimed by IS - have killed hundreds of Shi’ites. \nReporting by Hamid Shalizi in Kabul; Additional reporting and writing by Rod Nickel in Kabul; Editing by Michael Perry and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T18:16:23.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
