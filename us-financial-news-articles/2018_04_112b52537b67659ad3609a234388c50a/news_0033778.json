Reuters could not verify the authenticity or date of the pictures. \nForeign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters the defence and military establishments had been asked to confirm the presence of the aircraft, after which the Philippines could ask China to explain it. \n“Filing a protest is one of the diplomatic actions being considered, pending a confirmation from the defence department,” Cayetano said, adding the Philippines has proposed claimants reverse defence enhancements in the Spratly islands. \n“Many claimants are putting embankments, radar, and other defensive mechanisms, the challenge now is how to stop it and roll it back,” he added. \nChina claims almost the entire South China Sea, a strategic waterway where about $3 trillion worth of sea-borne goods pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims in the sea. \nThe Inquirer showed what it said were surveillance photos obtained from an unnamed source, showing what appeared to be two Xian Y-7 transport planes. \nThe military declined to comment and China’s embassy in Manila did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \nChina’s Defence Ministry also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nCayetano said claimants were talking to each other as well as “non-regional players” to resolve disputes and avoid a regional arms race. \nChina and Southeast Asian countries started negotiations in Vietnam last month on a code of conduct in the South China Sea, starting with “less sensitive and less controversial” issues, he said. \nCayetano said they had identified common issues before discussing contentious provisions, such as whether the code would be legally binding and include sanctions against offenders. \nHe said there was no time frame for conclusion and adoption of the code. \nThe drafting of the code has been met with widespread scepticism, with some experts convinced China’s uncharacteristic support for it is aimed at placating Southeast Asian states while buying time to completes its military installations in the sea.
