Rubrik helped Compeer Financial to consolidate and simplify three disparate IT systems following a merger and eliminate tape by archiving to the cloud. Rubrik delivers self-service capabilities to Compeer Financial's SQL database administrators which has resulted in reduced management time and significant cost savings.\nCompeer Financial provides a reliable source of capital for farm operations in over 140 counties across the upper Midwest. The company was created in 2017 out of a merger of AgStar Financial Services, Badgerland Financial, and 1st Farm Credit Services to better meet the needs of rural America. The merger required Compeer Financial's IT team to overcome numerous challenges associated with unifying three disparate IT environments. At the same time, the team was focused on modernizing its IT environment by increasing virtualization and moving to the cloud. Compeer Financial found its legacy backup solution was unable to deliver the speed, simplicity, and self-service capabilities needed to meet its ambitious IT goals.\nRubrik's intuitive interface provides visibility across Compeer Financial's entire environment and enables self-service access for SQL database administrators. With Rubrik Live Mount, Compeer Financial's SQL database administrators can instantly restore any of its 500 SQL databases to quickly access records, perform backup health checks, or use for testing and development.\nAfter deploying Rubrik, Compeer Financial was able to:\nProvide self-service capabilities for SQL database administrators, creating operational efficiencies. Leverage reporting and compliance tools to prove adherence to financial regulations. Achieve near-zero data recovery time objectives (RTO) and reduce data recovery point objectives (RPOs) by 400%. Significantly reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) through data center consolidation, footprint reduction, and eliminate tape in favor of archiving to the cloud.\nComments on the News:\n\"Rubrik is built from the ground up for hybrid cloud environments,\" said Scott Ament, IT operations lead at Compeer Financial. \"We decided that if we were going to overhaul our environment, we should use the vendor that is best suited for where we want to go. With Rubrik, we have the tools that we need to execute our cloud strategy.\"\n\"Compeer Financial had a complex and rapidly expanding environment due to a recent merger,\" said Arvind Nithrakashyap, chief technology officer at Rubrik. \"Consolidating multiple IT environments is no easy task but Rubrik was not only able to simplify the process for Scott and his team, but also reduce their restore time down from eight hours to just 30 seconds.\"\nResources\n[CASE STUDY] Compeer Financial Uses Rubrik to Deliver Self-Service Access to Hybrid Cloud Resources\nAbout Rubrik\nRubrik delivers instant application availability with data protection, search, analytics, archival and copy data management in the Hybrid Cloud.
