REUTERS/NASA/Handout via Reuters The five-year research, involving 100 scientists, would be the two nations’ biggest joint scientific project in Antarctica since the 1940s. Ice is thawing from Greenland to Antarctica and man-made global warming is accelerating the trend.\nThe scientists would study the Thwaites Glacier, which is roughly the size of Florida or Britain, in West Antarctica, the UK Natural Environment Research Council and U.S. National Science Foundation said in a joint statement.\n“Rising sea levels are a globally important issue which cannot be tackled by one country alone,” UK science minister Sam Gyimah said.\nThwaites and the nearby Pine Island Glacier are two of the biggest and fastest-retreating glaciers in Antarctica.\nIf both abruptly collapsed, allowing ice far inland to flow faster into the oceans, world sea levels could rise by more than a meter (3 feet), threatening cities from Shanghai to San Francisco and low-lying coastal regions.\nThe scientists would deploy planes, hot water drills, satellite measurements, ships and robot submarines to one of the remotest parts of the planet to see “whether the glacier’s collapse could begin in the next few decades or centuries,” the statement said.\nDespite satellites, “there are still many aspects of the ice and ocean that cannot be determined from space,” said Ted Scambos, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and the lead U.S. scientific coordinator.\nOther scientists from South Korea, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand and Finland would also contribute.\nThe United States is keeping up research even though U.S. President Donald Trump doubts mainstream scientific findings that human activities, led by the burning of fossil fuels, are the main cause of global warming.\nReporting By Alister Doyle; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:35:26.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
