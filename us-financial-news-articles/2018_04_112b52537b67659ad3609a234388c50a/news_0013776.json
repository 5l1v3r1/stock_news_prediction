I’m just a guy who got lucky.” \nNow 61, O’Meara said he could no longer hit the ball far enough to compete around Augusta National. \n“It’s a big course,” the American said. “I don’t want to shoot 76, 77, 78, 79 or 80. I’m OK with it. I’ll always enjoy this tournament.” \nO’Meara has made the cut only once since 2005, finishing tied 22nd in 2015.
