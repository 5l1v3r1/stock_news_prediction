REUTERS/Francois Lenoir The European Commission is expected to hand out its most critical report on talks with Turkey since the country launched its bid to join the European Union over a decade ago.\n“It is in the hands of those responsible in Turkey to decide whether they want to be a member of this European community of values,” Michael Roth said on arrival to a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg.\n“I would suggest we do not slam the door shut. That would be a wrong signal toward those in Turkey who still long for European values,” he added.\nBut Austria’s minister Gernot Bluemel said the talks should be halted. “We don’t believe Turkey should become a part of the European Union,” Bluemel said.\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska, Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T15:28:53.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
