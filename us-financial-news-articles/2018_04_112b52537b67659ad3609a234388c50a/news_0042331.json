The series shifts back to Washington for Game 5 on Saturday afternoon.\nThe visiting team has won all four games.\nThe Capitals got goals from Wilson in the first period, T.J. Oshie in the second and Ovechkin and Kuznetsov in the third.\nGoalie Braden Holtby made his second consecutive start after Philipp Grubauer started the first two games. Holtby again gave Washington a solid performance, making 23 saves.\nHoltby said, according to the Washington Post, “There was no other option (than winning both games in Columbus). Our goal is to win a Stanley Cup, and that’s what we viewed as our best chance after losing the first two. We’ve been a confident group all year — I think that’s been our strongest asset — so I don’t think we’ve ever doubted ourselves.”\nThe Capitals helped Holtby by playing consistent defense throughout, much better than in the first three games and especially in five-on-five situations. Washington blocked 20 shots, and Columbus was not able to find as many scoring chances as it did in Games 1, 2 and 3.\nThat is a big reason why Washington held a 33-24 edge in shots and controlled the pace of play.\n“We weren’t good. There’s no sense asking me things about the game,” Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said. “I’m telling you, we laid an egg, so I’m not going to break it down for you. We sucked. We sucked. So let’s move by it and see if we play better Saturday afternoon.”\nThe Capitals scored the first goal for the fourth consecutive game. Wilson got it at 6:16 of the first period by ripping a shot past Columbus goalie Sergei Bobrovsky from near the blue line after Washington nearly scored moments before.\nOshie made it 2-0 with a power-play goal at 9:19 of the second period after shots from John Carlson and Ovechkin. Oshie grabbed the rebound of the Ovechkin shot and put it away from in front.\nCarlson, a defenseman, has seven assists in the first four games of the series.\nOvechkin scored at 2:49 of the third period from the right side to extend Washington’s lead to 3-0.\nBoone Jenner scored for the Blue Jackets 6:22 into the third, cutting the deficit to 3-1, before Kuznetsov struck for an empty-net goal with 2:19 left.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:53:33.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
