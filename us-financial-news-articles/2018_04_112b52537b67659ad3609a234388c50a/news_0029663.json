Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the No. 4 Republican in the House and the highest-ranking GOP woman, is locked in an unexpectedly competitive race this year in her eastern Washington district. Republicans are running on the recently passed tax cuts and the growing economy but face energized Democratic voters, putting seats held by longtime, powerful lawmakers into play.\nMrs. McMorris Rodgers, currently in her seventh term, is squaring off in November against Democrat Lisa Brown in a district that President Donald Trump won with 52% of the vote. That is a slimmer margin than in the Pennsylvania district that Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb won last month, where Mr. Trump had coasted by 20 points in 2016. Polls by both parties currently show Mrs. McMorris Rodgers with a small lead.\nDemocrat Lisa Brown, right, as a state senator in 2012. Photo: Ted S. Warren/Associated Press “Her standing after seven terms in Congress is pretty tenuous back home compared to other Republican leaders,” said David Wasserman, the House editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Cook Political has changed its assessment of the district twice this year, including earlier this month to “lean Republican,” each time indicating the race is becoming more competitive.\nMrs. McMorris Rodgers acknowledged that Democrats in her district are revved up this year but said Ms. Brown was too liberal for most of her constituents.\n“Lisa’s definitely more from the left wing, the Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party—they’re energized right now. That does not reflect eastern Washington,” Mrs. McMorris Rodgers said in an interview.\nIn a sign of Republican officials moving to bolster her chances, the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC controlled by Mr. Ryan, opened one of its 31 offices in Mrs. McMorris Rodgers’s district late last year.\n“There’s about a dozen races outside of the top tier that will determine which party controls the [House] majority, and that’s why CLF invested early in many of those races,” said Corry Bliss, the super PAC’s executive director, referring to those races beyond the handful of most competitive.\nDemocrats need a net gain of 23 House seats to win the majority, and election watchers say control of the chamber is up for grabs.\nIt is rare for members of party leadership to be defeated in re-election contests, because of their fundraising abilities and backing from party leaders. But it has precedent—in Mrs. McMorris Rodgers’s district. Two decades earlier, voters in the same eastern Washington seat ousted Democratic Rep. Tom Foley, the only sitting speaker to be defeated in a re-election bid in more than a century.\nThe most notable recent defeat for a member of party leadership was that of Republican Rep. Eric Cantor, then in the No. 2 post as House majority leader, who lost in the Virginia GOP primary in June 2014.\nMrs. McMorris Rodgers, known for her advocacy for special-needs children, has come under criticism from some constituents for hewing too closely to Mr. Trump and not coming back to her district frequently enough.\n“She’s pretty much a clone of Donald Trump,” said LaMont Worden, a retired emergency-room physician and Air Force veteran who cast a write-in vote for former Vice President Joe Biden in the 2016 presidential race and now supports Ms. Brown.\nMr. Worden complains that Mrs. McMorris Rodgers makes only rare appearances at home, and he owns a shirt reading “Dump Cathy Ignores Us Rodgers.”\nMrs. McMorris Rodgers has held five traditional town halls since August 2017, including four in the last recess period, for a total of 38 since August 2013, her staff said. She also holds frequent smaller events, an aide said.\nDemocrats coalesced early around Ms. Brown, a former state Senate majority leader and chancellor of Washington State University Spokane, who raised more than $600,000 in her first six months campaigning last year.\nRepublicans believe Ms. Brown’s long legislative record will be a liability, particularly her support for a state income tax in Washington state, which currently doesn’t have one.\n“Lisa Brown to me is just another Gov. [Jay] Inslee toady,” said Gloria LeKander, a Spokane resident and Republican who manages rental properties, referring to the state’s Democratic governor. “There’s not another rock they don’t turn over to tax you.”\nWashington is one of the states most reliant on sales taxes, behind Texas and Florida, according to Census Bureau data compiled by the Federation of Tax Administrators. Sales taxes are often more regressive than income taxes, because lower-income households spend a larger portion of their money on taxable goods than high-income households do.\n“As an economist, it was very troubling to me that low-income people pay such a higher percentage of their taxes in Washington state,” Ms. Brown said in an interview.\nMs. Brown strikes a more centrist tone on other issues, arguing that steps can be taken to reduce gun violence without infringing on Second Amendment rights. She hasn’t endorsed Nancy Pelosi to remain the House Democratic leader next year, saying she will decide when she sees who is running.\nMrs. McMorris Rodgers’s supporters acknowledge a tough race ahead. She faces “probably one of the best opponents since Foley,” said real-estate developer Al Payne, who plans to vote for her, referring to the ousted House speaker.\n—Richard Rubin and Reid J.
