The peso strengthened 0.11 percent against the U.S. dollar, compared to Wednesday's reference price, as Mexico, the United States and Canada near a hard-fought conclusion to talks to overhaul NAFTA. The benchmark IPC stock index rose 0.52 percent, led by Grupo Bimbo, which rose 3.92 percent after it successfully placed a $500 million bond. The Brazilian real fell 0.63 percent against the dollar on Thursday, as weak retail sales figures raised bets of more monetary easing in Latin America's largest economy. The Brazilian government said February retail sales unexpectedly contracted, falling 0.2 percent from January, below even the most pessimistic forecast of a 0.3 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists. Traders said the data cleared the way for the nation's central bank to keep cutting the benchmark Selic rate, which currently stands at 6.5 percent, keeping a lid on the real.
