Some yelled “oppressors” as they faced off against several officers standing on the other side of police tape. \nThe shooting follows a number of killings of unarmed black men by police that triggered street protests and fuelled a national debate about bias in the U.S. criminal justice system. \nPolice were investigating, Monahan said, adding that surveillance video obtained from stores nearby showed the man brandishing an object that looked like a firearm. \nThe man, whose name and age were not immediately released, was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead. \nA police shooting of an unarmed black man in Sacramento, California, has sparked several days of protests. \nIn that incident, officers responding to a report of someone breaking windows shot to death 22-year-old Stephon Clark in his grandmother’s backyard on March 18. The officers feared he had a gun, but he was found to have been holding a cellphone, Sacramento police have said.
