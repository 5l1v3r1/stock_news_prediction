He repeated his criticism of the deal after Netanyahu spoke, and suggested he approved of the Israeli leader’s remarks.\n“Iran’s leaders repeatedly deny ever pursuing nuclear weapons,” Netanyahu said at Israel’s Defence Ministry, standing in front of stacks of files representing what he described as a vault full of Iranian nuclear documents obtained weeks before.\n“Tonight I’m here to tell you one thing: Iran lied.”\nRelated Coverage Israel to send experts to Germany, France to share Iran intelligence Trump is jumping on rehash of old allegations to 'nix' nuclear deal: Zarif tweets Iran says Netanyahu's allegations were 'ridiculous and childish': report “Iran lied about never having a nuclear weapons program,” he said. “100,000 secret files prove it did. Second, even after the deal, Iran continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use,” Netanyahu said.\nAlthough the presentation was live on Israeli television, Netanyahu made clear that his audience was abroad: he delivered most of his speech in English, before switching to Hebrew.\nTehran has denied ever seeking nuclear weapons and accuses its arch-foe Israel of stirring up world suspicions against it.\nHowever, much of what Netanyahu presented is unlikely to surprise world powers, which have long concluded that Iran was pursuing atomic weapons before the agreement was signed in 2015: that is why they imposed sanctions in the first place.\nWashington’s European allies say Tehran has generally abided by the terms of the deal since then, and have urged Trump not to scrap it. Some independent analysts and diplomats said Netanyahu appeared to be presenting old evidence.\nIsraeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference at the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, Israel April 30, 2018. REUTERS/ Amir Cohen “Netanyahu is telling us something we already knew - that Iran had a nuclear weapons program,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said on Twitter.\nA senior European diplomat told Reuters: “We knew all of this and what especially stands out is that Netanyahu doesn’t speak of any recorded violations of the (2015 Iran deal).”\nSpeaking after Netanyahu’s presentation, Trump told a White House news conference the nuclear deal was “a horrible agreement for the United States”. He said it would let Tehran develop nuclear arms after seven years and had “proven right what Israel has done today” with Netanyahu’s disclosures.\nHowever, Washington itself has concluded that Iran has not violated the terms of the deal, and two U.S. intelligence officials who have monitored Iran’s nuclear weapons program for years said on Monday nothing in Netanyahu’s remarks appeared to contradict that view.\n“We have seen no new and credible evidence that Iran is violating the agreement, wither in the Prime Minister’s remarks today or from other sources,” said one of the officials, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nMoments before Netanyahu spoke Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted: “The boy who can’t stop crying wolf is at it again.”\nThe head of Iran’s Atomic Energy organization said on Monday that Iran has the technical capability to enrich uranium to a higher level than it could before the multinational deal was reached.
