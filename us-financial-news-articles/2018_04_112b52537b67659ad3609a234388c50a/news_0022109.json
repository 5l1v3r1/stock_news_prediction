And the results are pretty scary.\nStrawberries showed 20 pesticides on them in one sample, says the group. And spinach samples had, on average, 1.8 times as much pesticide residue by weight than any other crop.\nBefore going full carnivore or swearing off of anything that’s non-organic , though, the group also put out its Clean Fifteen list, which lists the fruits and vegetables that showed the produce that was least likely to have pesticide residues—and it includes an especially popular item among foodies at the top:\nAvocados Sweet corn Pineapples Cabbages Onions Frozen sweet peas Papayas Asparagus Mangoes Eggplants Honeydews Kiwis Cantaloupes Cauliflower Broccoli Less than 1% of samples of avocados and sweet corn showed any detectable pesticides and 80% of pineapples, papayas, asparagus, onions, and cabbages showed no residue.", "external_links": ["https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary.php"], "published": "2018-04-11T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T22:45:15.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
