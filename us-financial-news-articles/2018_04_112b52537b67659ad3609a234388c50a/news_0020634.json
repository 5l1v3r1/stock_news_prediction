U.S. President Donald Trump takes part in a welcoming ceremony with China's President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China, November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Damir Sagolj - RC1CB94FD460 \nXi on Tuesday vowed to open the country’s economy further and lower import tariffs on products like cars. U.S. President Donald Trump responded in a tweet saying he was “thankful” for Xi’s kind words on tariffs and access for U.S. automakers, as well as his “enlightenment” on the issue of intellectual property. \nIt would be misleading to say Xi’s pledge at the Boao Forum this week - Asia’ version of Davos - was a concession to the United States, commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. \nXi was merely outlining China’s strategy to open up further, which had nothing to do with its trade friction with the United States, Gao said.
