The company also will oversee $3.8 million in renovations and enhancements to the hotels.\n“These properties meet many of the characteristics of our stringent deal criteria that should allow us to meet or exceed our investment return expectations and thresholds,” said Andy Chopra, founding principal and chief investment officer. “We were able to purchase institutional assets built above prototype standards at below replacement costs. Furthermore, these hotels benefit from their ideal location in a market buoyed by a military base, state university and numerous fortune 1000 companies that have a permanent presence in Columbus.”\nHilton Garden Inn Columbus\nSituated in the Brookstone Center Office Park close to I-185 at 1500 Bradley Lake Blvd., the Hilton Garden Inn Columbus is convenient to the Columbus Metropolitan Airport, the Columbus Georgia Convention and Trade Center, Lawson Army Airfield and Fort Benning. Hotel amenities include complimentary Wi-Fi throughout the hotel, 24-hour business center and fitness room with weights and cardio equipment. The hotel also provides 1,500 square feet of flexible function space that is ideal for events of up to 200 people, from family weddings to military reunions. Guests are invited to dine on-site at the Great American Grill, serving breakfast and dinner daily, or grab a drink in the Pavilion Lounge with fully stocked bar.\nGuest rooms feature a spacious work desk and comfortable chair, as well as two, two-line telephones, each with speaker phone and data port for working guests. Each room also provides a microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker, as well as a 40-inch television with premium channels, to help visitors relax.\nHomewood Suites by Hilton Columbus\nLocated in the vicinity of Peachtree Mall and Columbus State University at 6614 Whittlesey Blvd., the Homewood Suites is convenient to Heath Park and Hughson Clinic. Built with extended-stay guests staying five-plus nights in mind, suites contain separate sleeping and living areas designed to provide all the necessities of home. Kitchens are equipped with full-sized refrigerators/freezers and stovetops, while bathrooms provide deep soaking tubs, walk-in showers and hair dryers. Hotel amenities include an outdoor pool, fully equipped fitness room, laundry facilities and 24/7 business center. The hotel also serves a complimentary, hot/cold breakfast buffet daily and an evening manager’s reception held Mondays through Thursdays.\n“To better serve the business and leisure travelers of Georgia’s second largest city, Columbus, the two hotels shortly will commence a combined $3.8 million renovation to update and refresh exteriors, guest rooms and public spaces,” Chopra added. “From outdoor adventures like rafting on the longest urban whitewater course in the world to world-class museums including the National Infantry Museum and the Coca-Cola Space Science Center, the area offers activities suitable for all levels of adventurers. Combined with the numerous colleges, universities, medical centers and corporate offices/headquarters, Columbus has something for virtually all travelers. These two hotels are well positioned to meet the various needs of all area visitors. Following the completion of the renovation process and implementation of our proprietary management and marketing systems, we expect the properties to quickly take their place as their individual segment market leaders. This ultimately should allow us to deliver the economic returns which our investors have come to expect from Banyan Investment Group.”\nBanyan Investment Group\nWith offices in Florida and Georgia, Banyan Investment Group is a hotel investment and management company that acquires and manages select-service hotels in the United States.
