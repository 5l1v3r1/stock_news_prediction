(NASDAQ:CLFD), the specialist in fiber management for communications providers, reported results for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFiscal Q2 2018 Financial Summary (in millions except per share data and percentages) Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017 Change Change (%) Revenue $ 16.8 $ 17.7 $ (0.9 ) -5 % Gross Profit ($) $ 6.8 $ 7.4 $ (0.6 ) -9 % Gross Profit (%) 40.3 % 42.2 % -1.9 % -4 % (Loss) Income from Operations $ (0.5 ) $ 1.3 $ (1.8 ) -141 % Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (0.1 ) $ 0.4 $ (0.5 ) -123 % Net (Loss) Income $ (0.3 ) $ 0.9 $ (1.2 ) -134 % Net (Loss) Income per Diluted Share $ (0.02 ) $ 0.07 $ (0.09 ) -129 % Fiscal Q2 YTD 2018 Financial Summary (in millions except per share data and percentages) 2018 YTD vs. 2017 YTD Change Change (%) Revenue $ 33.7 $ 35.9 $ (2.2 ) -6 % Gross Profit ($) $ 13.9 $ 14.7 $ (0.8 ) -5 % Gross Profit (%) 41.2 % 40.8 % 0.4 % 1 % Income from Operations $ 0.1 $ 2.5 $ (2.4 ) -95 % Income Tax (Benefit) Expense $ (0.3 ) $ 0.8 $ (1.1 ) -138 % Net Income $ 0.6 $ 1.8 $ (1.2 ) -64 % Net Income per Diluted Share $ 0.05 $ 0.13 $ (0.08 ) -62 % Management Commentary\n“During the quarter, we took significant steps to improve the Company’s financial and market position,” said Clearfield CEO, Cheri Beranek. “First, we settled the patent infringement litigation, which has allowed us to put the expenses associated with the litigation behind us and to concentrate on the development and customer adoption of our market-leading product technologies. Second, we acquired a new product platform of powered cabinets that will expand our portfolio of fiber management offerings and total addressable market.\n“However, our revenue for the first half of the fiscal year has been disappointing, primarily due to some of the spending pauses in the market that we’re continuing to experience with our Tier 1 wireline, wireless and international customers. A merger-related review and slowdown in spending at our largest Tier 1 customer continued into the second quarter. While we are seeing revenues with other Tier 1 customers improve, it was not at a rate to compensate for this slowdown in the first half of the year. As part of our efforts to enhance and diversify our topline, we are excited to welcome Rosa Burns as our Chief Revenue Officer. We believe Rosa’s twenty-year experience in the Tier 1 wireline, wireless and international markets will add greater focus and sharpened strategy to our market development efforts. This hire was a continuing part of our organizational realignment to ensure we deliver the right resources to address the changing market dynamic.\n“With the distraction of the patent lawsuit behind us, we’re focusing on the integration of the powered cabinet line and extending our product design methodologies for 5G. With revenues of this product line expected to scale to our $10 million annualized forecast, we believe further integration will help drive incremental profitability, due to the product’s topline contribution and low incremental SG&A spend. We believe this focus on integrating the product line and adapting it to formulate a new modular architecture for 5G will help improve our long term profitability and position in the marketplace, while preparing us for some immediate and multi-year growth opportunities.\n“Given the continuing developments and associated spending pauses we are experiencing in the market, we are updating our guidance for the full fiscal year. While the update to our revenue for fiscal 2018 is lower than our original guidance issued at the beginning of the fiscal year, we believe our progress to put the challenges we have been facing behind us has been significant. Moreover, the enhancement of Clearfield’s management team with dedicated focus on new market and revenue development will enhance our ability to lead the market in product innovation. Throughout this entire process, our goals have always remained the same—revenue and market share expansion in 2019 and beyond, while continuing our long track record of profitability.”\nFiscal Q2 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 5% to $16.8 million from $17.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales to the Company’s Tier 1 wireline, wireless and international customers, and was partially offset by an increase in sales to the Company’s domestic core wireline customers.\nGross profit decreased 9% to $6.8 million, or 40.3% of revenue, from $7.4 million, or 42.2% of revenue, in the fiscal second quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit percent was due to decreased volume and increased costs related to sales to the Company’s Tier 1 customers.\nOperating expenses were $7.3 million, an increase of 19% compared to $6.2 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to $1.3 million in expenses incurred for the defense and one-time settlement payment relating to the patent infringement lawsuit.\nLoss from operations was $526,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 141% from income from operations of $1.3 million in the same year-ago quarter. Income tax expense decreased 123% from an expense of $433,000 in the second quarter of 2017 to a benefit of $101,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net loss was $305,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, a decrease of 134% from net income of $908,000, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. The net loss per diluted share of $0.02 was negatively impacted by $1.3 million in selling, general, and administrative expense associated with the defense and settlement of the patent infringement litigation.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased to $35.6 million from $46.2 million at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to the $10.4 million purchase of the outdoor powered cabinet product portfolio from Calix in February 2018. The Company had no debt at quarter end. In addition, during the quarter, the Company repurchased 18,682 shares under its stock repurchase program, utilizing $225,000 in cash.\nOrder backlog (defined as purchase orders received but not yet fulfilled) at March 31, 2018 increased 105% to $4.9 million from $2.4 million at December 31, 2017, and decreased 18% from $6.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nFiscal Six Month 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue decreased 6% to $33.7 million for the six month period ending March 31, 2018 from $35.9 million during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nGross profit was $13.9 million, or 41.2% of revenue, for the six month period ending March 31, 2018, a decrease of 5% from $14.7 million, 40.8% of revenue, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nOperating expenses increased 13% to $13.8 million for the six month period ending March 31, 2018 from $12.2 million during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nIncome from operations totaled $119,000 for the six month period ending March 31, 2018 compared to $2.5 million during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nIncome tax expense decreased 138% to a benefit of $304,000 for the six month period ending March 31, 2018 from an expense of $800,000 during the same period in fiscal 2017. Net income totaled $638,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the six month period ending March 31, 2018, a decrease of 64% from $1.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, during the same period in fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\nThe outlook for second half revenue is $40 to $42 million resulting in annual revenue guidance of $74 to $76 million. This represents 5% to 10% revenue growth for the six month period and flat to 2% growth for the year-over-year period. The fiscal year outlook is gross profit margins to be at least 40% and operating expenses to be between 35% and 37%. Due to the 2017 tax reform legislation which has lowered the corporate tax rate, Clearfield expects net income for the year as a percentage of revenue to be between 3% and 5%.\nConference Call\nClearfield management will hold a conference call today, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (4:00 p.m. Central Standard Time) to discuss these results and provide an update on business conditions.\nClearfield’s President and CEO Cheri Beranek and CFO Dan Herzog will host the presentation, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Thursday, April 26, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (4:00 p.m. Central time)\nU.S. dial-in: 1-877-407-0792\nInternational dial-in: 1-201-689-8263\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here .\nPlease call the conference telephone number 10 minutes prior to the start time.
