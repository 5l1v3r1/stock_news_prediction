Seritage has recaptured the space, based on their contractual agreement, and is able to bring in new tenants, he said.\nSeritage didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nThe Sears store will stay open until mid-July, and the Sears Auto Center, also at Six Corners, will close next month. Liquidation sales at this location are expected to start on April 27.\n\"The Sears at Six Corners was the shopping district's anchor business since it first opened to large crowds on October 20, 1938,\" Sears said in a statement. \"For more than 120 years, Sears has called Illinois home and that is not changing. Although we are disappointed by this last store closure in Chicago, by no means does this change our commitment to our customers and presence to Chicago's residents.\"\nHoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears declined to comment on how many employees would be impacted by the closure. Though it said it would keep about 150 employees at one of its offices in Chicago \"dedicated to serving our members and customers, as we pursue our vision of an integrated retailer.\"\nEarlier this year, Sears announced a round of more than 100 store closures, all expected to be complete by this month. The company also recently raised enough money to pay $407 million toward its pension plan in order to unlock and allow for the sale of 140 other properties.\nIn selling unprofitable assets, Sears has said it hopes to raise liquidity and get back to profitability. The retailer's total revenue for the holiday period declined more than 25 percent.\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to say Sears was based in Chicago for more than a century. It was founded in Minneapolis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T20:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T20:55:13.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
