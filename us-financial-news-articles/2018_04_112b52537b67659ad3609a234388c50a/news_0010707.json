On Tuesday, he heard boos after his fourth strikeout and described his performance as “garbage” afterward despite it occurring in an 11-4 win.\nStanton quickly generated a different reaction in his sixth at-bat at Yankee Stadium for the Yankees.\nWith one out in the first inning, Stanton launched a 1-2 slider from Blake Snell (0-1) about halfway up the left-field bleachers. Stanton’s third homer of the season traveled an estimated 458 feet with an exit velocity of 117.9 miles per hour.\nStanton also struck out three times after his second career homer at Yankee Stadium but this time did not hear any boos.\nSanchez ended a 0-for-17 skid by hitting Snell’s 3-1 changeup 369 feet at 106.4 miles per hour into the left-field seats with one on in the third to give the Yankees a 4-1 lead\nJudge slugged his first homer when he capped an eight-pitch at-bat by lifting a full-count changeup from Matt Andriese 419 feet with an exit velocity of 108.9 into the left-field seats for a 7-1 advantage with one out in the fourth.\nRonald Torreyes preceded Judge’s homer with an RBI single that made it 5-1.\nLuis Severino (2-0) allowed two runs and five hits in 7 1/3 effective innings and won at home for the sixth time in his last nine starts. He became the first Yankee to pitch into the seventh this season.\nSeverino struck out seven, walked one, got a pair of double plays and threw 92 pitches while maintaining his velocity in the late innings.\nSnell allowed five runs and four hits while laboring through 3 1/3 innings. He saw a modest 13-inning scoreless streak ended when Stanton homered.\nTampa Bay’s lone runs were on a double by C.J. Cron in the first inning and a sacrifice fly by Denard Span in the eighth off Adam Warren. After Cron’s double, Severino retired 19 of the final 23 hitters before exiting to a standing ovation.\nThe Rays dropped their fifth straight since coming back to beat Boston on Opening Day Thursday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T05:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:22:12.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
