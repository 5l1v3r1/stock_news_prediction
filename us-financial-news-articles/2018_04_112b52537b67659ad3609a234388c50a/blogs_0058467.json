It hasn't been announced yet,\" he said in a \"Squawk Box\" interview.\n\"So, don't tell anybody,\" he joked. \"Breaking news.\"\n\"This will be the biggest tour we've done, the biggest show we've done,\" he added, but didn't give any other details.\nKiss currently has a few dates on its 2018 schedule, all in July in Spain and Portugal.\nStanley alluded to a new tour on ABC Radio on the red carpet for the ASCAP Pop Music Awards in Los Angeles on Monday.\nGetty Images Paul Stanley of KISS \"Kiss is very interesting at this point because it's become a tribe,\" Stanley said. \"Many bands are based upon a certain demographic, whereas Kiss has young children up to grandparents. Everybody shares the experience. It's incredibly gratifying to look out and see really families, neighbors, all kinds of people there. It's a good job.\"\nIn the four decades since Kiss started, the music industry has changed dramatically.\nStanley said he's glad the band isn't just starting out nowadays.\n\"That pot of gold at the end the rainbow isn't there for many,\" he said. \"At this point, you're virtually owned by the corporations\" that won't stick by musicians like the old days.\n\"Sustaining success over the long haul is something that's very challenging,\" he said. \"At this point, we're 40 years in, 100 million albums. So we've done quite well.\"\nWhen he's not on the road with Kiss, Stanley finds refuge in painting.\n\"I originally started doing it as a way to depressurize and itself has turned into a multiple seven-figure diversion,\" he said. \"It's a five-day-a-week job at this point.\"\nCNBC Stanley — currently on a national art tour with his work, sponsored by Wentworth Galleries — said that having no formal art training did not deter him.\n\"I guess I'm a punk impressionist,\" he said. \"I'm a big believer that a lot of people have abilities that they don't really tap into because people around them are telling them that it's not good or impossible.\"\n\"So pick up a paintbrush. Or invest. Find something, go in incrementally, and you'll see how successful you can be,\" he added.\nStanley said he approaches investing like everything he does: He relies on the people around him. \"I tend to listen to the people around me ... and perhaps tell them what I'm more bullish on than other things.\"\n\"You're only as good as the team around you; whether you're a politician, whether you're president, or any CEO, you are defined by the people around you,\" he said. \"I tend to surround myself with people who can go the distance.\"\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
