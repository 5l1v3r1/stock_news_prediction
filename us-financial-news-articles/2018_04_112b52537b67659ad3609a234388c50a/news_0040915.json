Bush, advised President Donald Trump’s transition team on defense issues in late 2016 and early 2017.\nMr. Bolton, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and ex-Fox News commentator, said in a statement that he had tapped Ms. Ricardel for the role because of her “broad-based” expertise.\n“Mira Ricardel has a track record of successfully managing teams and diverse organizations, as well as addressing complex issues,” he said. \"Her policy-making and interagency experience will make her a great addition to the National Security Council. I look forward to her joining our team and working together to ensure President Trump’s foreign policy agenda is executed.”\nMr. Trump nominated Ms. Ricardel to serve as undersecretary of commerce for export administration last April. She was confirmed by the Senate in August.\nMs. Ricardel will join a team that has lost a number of officials in recent weeks, as Mr. Bolton has moved to reshape the White House national security team since coming onboard. Former NSC spokesman Michael Anton left his post a day before Mr. Bolton officially started in his role. Nadia Schadlow, who served as deputy national security adviser for strategy, resigned last week. Tom Bossert, former homeland security adviser, was forced out of his role at Mr. Bolton’s instigation, according to people familiar with the matter.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T04:15:16.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
