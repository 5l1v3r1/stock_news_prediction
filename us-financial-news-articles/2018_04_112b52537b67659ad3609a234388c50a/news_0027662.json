The whole point is to keep Renova below 50 percent and if we did that Renova would go back up,” Poux-Guillaume said in an interview.\n“We will push the shares back into the market when the timing is right and when the price is right. We have no timeline on this, we have no deadline and we have no downside,” he said, noting Renova would make up any losses Sulzer took on the shares.\n“Renova is essentially footing the bill at this point and we have 180 days to actually raise the money” to finance the share purchase, he added.\nThe pumpmaker said earlier that it was free of U.S. sanctions after authorities approved its buyback of shares that has reduced Vekselberg’s stake to less than half.\nIts stock, which had tumbled by a fifth on the sanctions news, rebounded 15 percent in early trading and was up 10 percent by midday.\nReporting by John Revill and John Miller, Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:50:45.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
