Photo: Rentokil Initial \nBritain’s Rentokil Initial PLC is hunting for takeover targets in the U.S., encouraged by a lower tax rate and strong growth in its core business, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Townsend said.\nThe company, which provides pest control, hygiene and workwear services, has allocated £200 to £250 million ($285 million to $356 million) for mergers and acquisitions this year, predominantly for bolt-on deals, said Mr. Townsend. It already has completed 12 such transactions in the first quarter, five of those in the U.S., Mr. Townsend said.\n“Half of the world’s pest control [market] is in North America,” Mr. Townsend said Thursday in an interview with CFO Journal. “There are new pests occurring in the U.S. all the time.”\nThe company has around 300 branches and 8,000 employees in the U.S., according to a spokesman.\nPrior-year revenues for those businesses acquired in the first quarter total £103 million. “Some of the deals we have done were quite small,” he said. Mr. Townsend did not disclose how much of this year’s mergers and acquisitions budget has been used up. \nRentokil is one of several European buyers zeroing in on U.S. companies , helped by lower U.S. corporate taxes, a positive economic outlook and the decline in the U.S. dollar. \nMergers and acquisitions are “an integral part of Rentokil’s growth and margin improvement story,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note.\nRising prices for potential acquisition targets in the U.S. mean Rentokil has to stick to its goal of a 13% rate of return on investment in North America, said Mr. Townsend. “We have to make sure we are doing the right deal,” said Mr. Townsend.\nBesides the U.S., Rentokil is also searching for targets in Asia and Latin America.\nThe company had £300 million cash at the beginning of 2018 and plans to finance its acquisitions with existing capital. “We have plenty of space in our balance sheet,” said Mr. Townsend.\nRentokil on Thursday said revenue in the first quarter was £550.7 million, down 1.5% compared to the previous-year period at constant exchange rates. \nShare this: MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS U.S. TAX OVERHAUL Previous The Morning Ledger: Consumer-Goods Companies Struggle to Raise Prices  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T19:41:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
