The metric measures an insurer’s expenditure on claims against the premiums it earns. \nThe decrease was primarily driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 and improved medical cost performance across its businesses, the company said. \nTotal revenue was largely flat at $22.54 billion. \nThe insurer said it now expects 2018 adjusted net earnings to be greater than $15.30 per share, up from its previous estimate of earnings of greater than $15 per share.
