They blamed Russian government-backed hackers for the campaign against government agencies, businesses, and critical infrastructure operators.\nJoyce was scheduled to speak at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco this week but canceled, prompting speculation that he would be the latest official to leave the White House.\n\"It's a huge loss for the country,\" said Curtis Dukes, former head of cyber defense at the NSA who worked with Joyce. \"He was very effective in that role.\"\nDukes, now vice president at the Center for Internet Security, said Joyce was an asset for all federal agencies and was instrumental in revamping the way the U.S. government decided whether to disclose or exploit cyber vulnerabilities discovered by spy agencies.\nRobert Lee, a former U.S. intelligence officer and president of the cyber-firm Dragos, said Joyce was technically competent and that many of the previous White House cyber coordinators had backgrounds ill-suited for the job.\n\"He'll be missed in the position but hopefully set a standard that future appointments to the position will follow,\" Lee said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:58:57.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
