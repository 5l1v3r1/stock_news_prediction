This is a very positive step in the right direction,” he added.\nThe main points regarding power units were that they should be cheaper, simpler and louder with more power as well as reducing the need for grid penalties as a result of unreliability.\nFormula One said the engine would remain a hybrid and must also be ‘road relevant’, allowing manufacturers to build unique and original power units.\nThe future rules must also ensure that ‘customer teams’ who buy their engines from a manufacturer are assured of the same performance as the works team.\nOwned by Italian private equity fund Investindustrial and a group of Kuwaiti investors, Aston Martin in February delivered its first annual pre-tax profit since 2010 after last year’s sales reached a nine-year high.
