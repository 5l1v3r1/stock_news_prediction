Audi says the coolant pumps are vulnerable to moisture, capable of causing an electric short, or debris blockage from the cooling system, according to government documents obtained by the AP.\nAudi told the AP there have been reports of fires, but did not specify details of the incidents. The Volkswagen-owned brand did not immediately respond to Fortune for a request for comment.\nIf you believe your Audi vehicle may be affected, the manufacturer says dealers will replace the coolant pumps for free with a new version of the current model until a redesigned pump is available in November.\nAudi tried to address the mechanical problem before with a software update last year ,but turned to a recall after the coolant pump issues continued, according to documents posted by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nAudi is slated to send out recall letters to people with the faulty pumps by June 11. But if you have any questions or believe your car has the problematic pump, you can call Audiâ€™s customer service line at (888) 237-2834.", "external_links": ["https://nypost.com/2018/04/25/audi-recalls-more-than-1-2-million-vehicles/"], "published": "2018-04-25T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:04:54.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
