He says he will retain his 40 percent stake and continue to run the company. \nAlso named was Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud, whom the New York Times has identified as the proxy buyer on behalf of the crown prince of Salvator Mundi, a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting. \nPrince Mohammed denied the report in an interview with TIME magazine published on Thursday, during his official visit to the United States. \nPrince Bader serves as chairman of the Saudi Research and Marketing Group, which is closely linked to King Salman’s branch of the royal family, and was last year appointed governor of a commission to develop a historic tourism destination. \nTurki Al al-Sheikh, the chairman of the General Sports Authority and a close adviser to the crown prince, was appointed as well.
