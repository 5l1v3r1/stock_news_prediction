(Germany) should meet the goals that they agreed to ... that’s the expectation, not only for Germany but for everyone.”\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo smiles as he attends a news conference after a NATO foreign ministers meeting at the Alliance’s headquarters, in Brussels, Belgium April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman “We’re hopeful that at the NATO summit that every NATO partner will deliver a credible plan to achieve that goal.”\nCONSENSUS ON RUSSIA Still, Pompeo was quick to praise NATO as “invaluable” just minutes after getting off his plane, in his first meeting of the day, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, a sharp contrast to Trump’s earlier rebuke of the alliance.\n“There’s no more fitting destination for my first foreign trip,” Pompeo later told reporters.\nDespite European confusion about Trump’s foreign policy and his “America First” rhetoric, Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said it was “impressive to come here one night after being inaugurated. It’s an impressive start.”\nPompeo, a former Army officer who was a Republican congressman, is regarded as a loyal supporter of Trump with hawkish views. But on Russia those views are largely shared by European allies because of Moscow’s seizure of Crimea.\nNATO allies believe the alliance needs to respond to what the West says is the Kremlin’s mix of not just the conventional military threat but covert and cyber warfare.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The NATO foreign ministers meeting follows the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian agent in Britain, and Western air strikes against Russia-allied Syria, which the United States accused of a chemical attack in Douma on April 7.\n“When I was a young soldier, it was T72 tanks and T60 tanks rolling across the then East German plain. Today, it’s different,” he said, recalling the Cold War.\n“There were a lot of ideas, an enormous consensus of the risk those hybrid it poses to the West,” he said of the NATO meeting. “There is a real commitment to work together to mitigate those risks and deter them,” he said.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton and Robin Emmott; Editing by Toby Chopra, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:04:54.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
