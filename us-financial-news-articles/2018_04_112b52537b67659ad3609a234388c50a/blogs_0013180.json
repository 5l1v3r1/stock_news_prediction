The balls are still on back order, but it doesn't look like the hype will ease up anytime soon.\nEven the products Woods is not using are still being sold at a high rate as a result of his ability to draw attention, according to Ilagan.\n\"If he wins, we're in a whole lot of trouble because we're not going to be able to make enough product,\" he joked.\nWoods' comeback is a big deal for golf. A child prodigy, he won his first Masters in 1997 at age 21, the youngest player ever to win the tournament. He is credited with reinvigorating the sport by drawing more spectators and inspiring more kids to play, but he hasn't played himself in four years due to a back injury. After undergoing a fourth surgery just last year, he is finally back on the green and playing like his old self.\nHis presence alone has already increased network viewership by as much as 150 percent, according to Nielsen, and brought badge demand up 20 percent, according to StubHub.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T00:37:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
