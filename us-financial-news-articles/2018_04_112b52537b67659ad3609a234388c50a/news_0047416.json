As a result, the state’s unpaid bill backlog ballooned to a record $16.67 billion last year. After enacting a fiscal 2018 budget in July, Illinois used proceeds from a $6 billion October bond sale to deflate the bill pile, which currently totals about $8.15 billion. Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza’s office estimated late payment fees spanning fiscal 2016 through three quarters of fiscal 2018 at nearly $1.14 billion, $100 million more than the late fees the state paid in the previous 18 years. The office made $143 million in late fee payments in 2017 and $86.5 million so far this year.\nJamey Dunn, Mendoza’s spokeswoman, said the comptroller’s office is still in triage mode. “Providers and vendors all over the state are still experiencing payment delays. The comptroller has been clear that given these pressures, she’s prioritizing funding for programs that assist the state’s most vulnerable residents and education funding,” she said. The state’s biggest qualified lender, Vendor Assistance Program (VAP), which has bought $3.2 billion in receivables, is owed about $250 million in late fees, according to Brian Hynes, one of the firm’s founders. He said conversations with VAP’s lenders were getting more difficult and that litigation over the lack of payments has been looked at but is not imminent.\nSome of the qualified lenders had listed major banks, including Citibank N.A., as funding sources in their state disclosure documents.\nReporting by Karen Pierog Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:21:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
