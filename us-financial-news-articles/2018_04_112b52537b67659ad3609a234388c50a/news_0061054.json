He threw 91 pitches, 60 for strikes.\nThe Reds threatened again in the top of the seventh. Duvall hit a ground-rule double to center field, and Twins manager Paul Molitor brought in lefty reliever Zach Duke.\nMesoraco greeted Duke with a single to right field to send Duvall to third, but Duke rallied to get Hamilton on another popout, then struck out Winker and got Peraza on a shallow fly ball to right.\nThe Twins, playing without third baseman Miguel Sano, who has tightness in one of his hamstrings, got a single from Eddie Rosario to begin the fourth inning.\nEscobar then doubled down the right field line, and Rosario scored from first when the ball kicked off the side wall into right field and Winker bobbled the ball for an error, Escobar taking third. Max Kepler flew out to short center, but Grossman hit a fly ball to Winker in deep enough right field to allow Escobar to score.\nGarver led off the Twins’ fifth inning by clubbing a home run to left field on an 0-1 offspeed pitch.\nReds relievers Austin Brice and Dylan Floro kept the game close with 3 1/3 shutout innings, and the Reds had one last chance in the ninth inning.\nWith Twins reliever Fernando Rodney in search of his third save, he walked Schebler to lead off the inning. After a flyout, he also walked Mesoraco, but Rodney got Tucker Barnhart on a weak popout behind second base and got Winker on a first-pitch popout that the third baseman Escobar caught near home plate.\nRodney had blown saves in his three of his four previous appearances.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T17:43:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
