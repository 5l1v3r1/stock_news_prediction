The refugees arrived so quickly and in such great numbers, there was little time to prepare the camps and direct people to safe areas.\nAbout 700,000 refugees have crossed into Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar District since Myanmar launched “clearing operations” after deadly attacks on its security forces by Rohingya militants in August.\nMyanmar has rejected evidence its soldiers perpetrated widespread atrocities against Rohingya civilians.\nMost of the fleeing Rohingya crowded into the mega-camp, which grew to more than 580,000 people from about 100,000 in just four months, according to UNHCR figures.\n“The scale and speed of this crisis has been unmatched in recent history,” Mallawa said.\nNATURE UNDER PRESSURE Bangladesh prohibits refugees from earning a wage, but has allowed aid agencies to run “cash for work” projects that employ them to prepare the camps for the rainy season.\nDust rises as hundreds of workers use pickaxes to level more than a dozen hilltops, making way for heavy machinery to flatten 800 acres (324 hectares) the government has granted to expand the camp.\nIn the winding valleys below, refugees scour the land for firewood, between hills pockmarked with spots where they have resorted to digging up roots.\nAgencies plan to move 24,000 of those most at risk to the new site as soon it is ready.\nMore will follow, but there is not enough space to relocate all 203,000 people now in areas prone to landslides and floods.\nECHO’s Mallawa told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that an additional 1,500 acres of flat land is needed urgently.\nAnother concern is sanitation.\nIn Unchiprang camp, laborers wearing masks and blue overalls extract sludge from latrines, filling barrels they sling from bamboo poles and carry up a steep hillside to the treatment area.\nAbout 20,000 latrines need to be “de-sludged”, according to French charity Solidarités International.\nIf the work is not completed before the rains come - especially the most intense monsoon months from June to September - sewage could be washed into inhabited areas, causing outbreaks of diseases, including cholera.\nOther workers reinforce slopes with bags of dirt, while the International Organization for Migration (IOM) runs workshops to provide refugees with techniques and kits to shore up shelters.\nThe IOM is also training some in first aid, and working with the World Food Programme to stock up on emergency supplies, including food and materials to repair shelters.\nLight machinery is being stored at 10 “hubs” across the mega-camp for the purpose of repairing washed-out roads, which will cause “severe challenges” in delivering aid, said IOM emergency coordinator Manuel Pereira.\nAlthough the first major influx of Rohingya refugees arrived in Bangladesh in the 1970s, this year the government has agreed to set up an emergency operations center in Cox’s Bazar, staffed with its own experts and international specialists.\nLACK OF FUNDS The future maintenance of the camp depends on money that has yet to materialize.\nIn March, the United Nations appealed for $951 million for the rest of the year. But less than a tenth of that is covered so far, said Mallawa.\nECHO has hiked its annual budget for disaster preparedness in Bangladesh to $7 million from $3 million last year.\nThat funding usually goes into projects across the country, but this year it will all be directed to the camps in Cox’s Bazar, Mallawa said.\nMohammed Abul Kalam, Bangladesh’s relief and refugee repatriation commissioner, called for international pressure on Myanmar to end the crisis by enabling the Rohingya to return home and restoring their citizenship.\n“It’s not possible for us to host them for an indefinite period of time,” he said in his office in Cox’s Bazar, a beachside town that is the district capital.\n“We are actually acting as the custodian of this population on behalf of the entire world.”\nReporting by Jared Ferrie; Editing by Megan Rowling; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilience and climate change.
