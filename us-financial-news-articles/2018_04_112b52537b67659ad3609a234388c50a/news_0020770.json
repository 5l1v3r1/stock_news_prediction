SECURITY TRUMPS CELEBRATION \nThe conundrum for police will be ensuring that security does not overshadow the event, said Broadhurst, who was also in charge of policing the 2012 London Olympics and the wedding of Harry’s father, Prince Charles, to his second wife Camilla in Windsor in 2005. \n“Essentially you’re managing somebody’s wedding and you want it to be joyous and happy for the couple, for the family and for the visitors,” Broadhurst told Reuters. \n“The trick for those planning the policing of this particular event will be to make the security as unobtrusive as possible so it doesn’t impinge on the celebration,” he said. \n“That is a really tricky thing to do - in this day and age, security must always trump celebration.” \nBritain is on its second-highest threat level - “severe” - meaning an attack is considered highly likely. Last year there were five incidents classified as terrorism in which 36 people were killed. \nThree of those involved a vehicle being driven at crowds, and in two the assailants then attacked passers-by with knives. The move towards such simple tactics poses a greater threat than in the past, Broadhurst said.

You just need a kitchen knife, a gun up your jumper, or even just a hire car,” he said. \n“I very much doubt if the wedding itself will be targeted because of all the security implications, but there’s still the town centre, there’s still central London. What you don’t want is a celebratory event in Windsor and an attack of some sort in London.” \nIn 1981 the queen was shot at by a teenager in New Zealand and the same year six blank shots were fired at her during the annual Trooping of the Colour ceremony in London. \nAside from terrorism, security officials will be concerned about protests - 18 were held on the day of William’s wedding amid hostility to the government’s austerity measures, Broadhurst said. \nWindsor Castle, whose website says it is the oldest and largest inhabited fortress in the world, will provide a secure location for the wedding and reception, but even its walls have been breached. STUNT \nIn 2003, Aaron Barschak, who called himself “the comedy terrorist”, managed to bypass castle security wearing a pink dress and an Osama bin Laden-style beard to crash William’s 21st birthday party and give him a kiss. \n“It can just be a stunt that’s not going to harm anybody but it becomes headline news and it kind of then takes the gloss off the wedding itself,” Broadhurst said. \n“Those reputation issues are always there and what they do is they undermine the confidence of the people in the police and the security services to get things right.” \nPolice commanders will have envisaged all such scenarios during the six months of preparation, but even the best-laid plans can be severely tested. \nOn the day of William’s wedding, minutes before Kate was due to set off, officers discovered a car had been abandoned around the corner and considered sending her a different route - which would have involved missing the crowds. In the end they were able to confirm in time that it was not a security risk. \nThis time, the most tense moment for the police will be when the newlyweds ride in an open-top carriage through Windsor. \n“That will be the bit where the Gold Commander will be holding his breath for a while because it is that point where they are most vulnerable,” said Broadhurst.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files \nGiven that Britain regularly stages large public events without serious problems, Broadhurst is confident the wedding will pass off without incident. \nBut he cautioned: “Even with the best of intelligence there is still a small risk, but it’s a risk that’s accepted by the royal family, it’s accepted by the police.” Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T09:44:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
