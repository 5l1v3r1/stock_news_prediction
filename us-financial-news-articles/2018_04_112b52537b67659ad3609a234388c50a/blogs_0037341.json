The FCC opened the investigation after T-Mobile callers were unable to reach consumers served by three rural carriers in Wisconsin, even though T-Mobile said it had \"resolved\" the issue.\nThe FCC has been trying to improve rural connectivity for years , encouraging users to report periods of \"dead air\" after dialing, choppy or echoing voice quality, or hearing \"10-20 rings even though you are reasonably sure someone should be there to answer.\"\nIn 2015, Verizon paid $5 million to address similar issues . The FCC said T-Mobile's latest fine is the sixth settlement related to rural connectivity.\n\"T-Mobile is committed to all of our customers across the country,\" the company told CNBC in a statement. \"Our actions have always been focused on better serving our customers and the ringtone oversight, which was corrected in January 2017, was unintentional. We have settled this matter — and will continue to focus on our mission.\"\n— CNBC's Todd Haselton contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T21:31:27.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
