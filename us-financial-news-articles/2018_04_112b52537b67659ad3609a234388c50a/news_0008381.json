(Theratechnologies) (TSX:TH) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 financial highlights\nRecord first quarter net sales of $10.2 million, up 13% from the same quarter last year In U.S. dollars, first quarter net sales up 18.7% year over year Continued investment made to prepare the launch of Trogarzo™ (ibalizumab-uiyk) injection, resulting in Adjusted EBITDA of minus $2,021,000 1 Stable cash position of $32,466,000\n“We have every reason to be excited and proud of where we are today with the recent approval of Trogarzo™. We are seeing strong interest from both physicians and patients. As Trogarzo™ will soon be commercially available, our fully-trained sales force started calling on more than 5,000 physicians who treat the vast majority of people living with multidrug resistant HIV. Moreover, we had our strongest first quarter ever in terms of net sales of EGRIFTA ® ,” said Luc Tanguay, President and CEO, Theratechnologies Inc.\nFirst quarter 2018 financial results\nConsolidated revenue for the three-month period ended February 28, 2018 was $10,218,000 compared to $9,035,000 in the three-month period ended February 28, 2017.\nRevenue generated from net sales increased by 13.1% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the comparable period in fiscal 2017, due to higher unit volumes and prices, partially offset by exchange rate fluctuations and higher discounts due to changes in the mix of private payors versus government drug reimbursement plans.\nCost of Sales\nFor the three months ended February 28, 2018, cost of sales was $2,146,000 compared to $2,050,000 in the comparable period of fiscal 2017. Cost of goods sold was $1,185,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,086,000 for the same quarter the previous year. Other production-related costs, due to the reversal of a loss provision, amounted to $(160,000) in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $178,000, which included an inventory write-down of $125,000, for the same period of 2017.\nCost of sales also includes royalties due under the terms of the agreement terminating the collaboration and licensing agreement with EMD Serono, Inc. In the first quarter of 2018, royalties recorded on EGRIFTA ® sales amounted to $1,121,000 compared to $786,000 for the first quarter of 2017, due to higher sales levels.\nR&D Expenses\nR&D expenses amounted to $2,398,000 in the three-month period ended February 28, 2018 compared to $2,020,000 for the same period in 2017. While R&D expenses were higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, they were significantly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nR&D expenses include medical affairs initiatives aimed at raising awareness among physicians and nurses who interact with patients living with MDR HIV-1 or lipodystrophy. R&D expenses also encompass regulatory affairs activities, such as preparing for the European filing of Trogarzo™, quality assurance, the development of the F4 Formulation and post-approval commitments related to EGRIFTA ® .\nSelling and Market Development Expenses\nSelling and market development expenses amounted to $6,693,000 for the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the size increase of our sales force and other investment made after the first quarter of 2017 in preparation of the launch of Trogarzo™. This compares to $3,767,000 for the same three-month period last year. Again, selling and market development expenses were lower in the first quarter of 2018 than in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSelling and market development expenses include branded and non-branded campaigns to support EGRIFTA ® , the launch of Trogarzo™ in the United States and the development of the European regulatory strategy for Trogarzo™.\nIt also factors in the amortization of the intangible asset value established for the EGRIFTA ® commercialization rights which represented an amount of $476,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $499,000 for the same period in 2017. This variation is due to the exchange rate fluctuations.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to $1,513,000 in the three months ended February 28, 2018 compared to $1,234,000 after the first quarter of 2017. The increase is attributable to the growth of our business and expenses related to our preparatory work for our European expansion.\nFinance Income\nFinance income, consisting of interest income, amounted to $100,000 at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to $65,000 following the first three months of last year.\nFinance Costs\nFinance costs for the three months ended February 28, 2018 were $195,000 compared to $2,272,000 for the comparable period of 2017. Finance costs no longer include losses related to the change in the fair value of warrant liability ($1,909,000 in the first quarter of 2017) as the last outstanding warrants were exercised in the third quarter of 2017. Accretion expense on the long-term obligation was $282,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $418,000 for the same quarter last year, reflecting the lower average balance outstanding during the year.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nFor the reasons noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was $(2,021,000) for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $725,000 for the same period of 2017. See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” below.\nNet Loss\nTaking into account the revenue and expense variations described above, we recorded a net loss of $2,627,000 or $(0.04) per share in the first three months of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $2,243,000 or $(0.03) per share for the same period last year.\nFinancial Position\nFor the three-month period ended February 28, 2018, cash flow from operating activities was $(1,145,000) compared to $2,560,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The changes in cash flow can be attributed to the increase in spending to prepare for the launch of Trogarzo™.\nAs at February 28, 2018, cash, bonds and money market funds amounted to $32,466,000 compared to $32,929,000 at the end of the previous fiscal year.\nSubsequent Event\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trogarzo™, on March 6, 2018, for heavily treatment-experienced adults with multidrug resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1infection failing their current antiretroviral regimen.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nReconciliation of net profit or loss to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS financial measure. A reconciliation of the Adjusted EBITDA to net profit (loss) is presented in the table below. We use adjusted financial measures to assess our operating performance. Securities regulations require that companies caution readers that earnings and other measures adjusted to a basis other than IFRS do not have standardized meanings and are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure operating performance from one period to the next without the variation caused by certain adjustments that could potentially distort the analysis of trends in our business, and because we believe it provides meaningful information on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe obtain our Adjusted EBITDA measurement by adding to net profit or loss, finance income and costs, depreciation and amortization, and income taxes. We also exclude the effects of certain non-monetary transactions recorded, such as share-based compensation for the stock option plan and write-downs (or related reversals) of inventories, for our Adjusted EBITDA calculation. We believe it is useful to exclude these items as they are either non-cash expenses, items that cannot be influenced by management in the short term, or items that do not impact core operating performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily nonrecurring. Share-based compensation costs are a component of employee remuneration and can vary significantly with changes in the market price of the Company’s shares. In addition, other items that do not impact core operating performance of the Company may vary significantly from one period to another. As such, Adjusted EBITDA provides improved continuity with respect to the comparison of our operating results over a period of time. Our method for calculating Adjusted EBITDA may differ from that used by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(In thousands of Canadian dollars)\nThree-month periods ended February 28, 2018 2017 $ $ Net loss (2,627 ) (2,243 ) Add (deduct): Depreciation and amortization 480 504 Finance costs 195 2,272 Finance income (100 ) (65 ) Share-based compensation for stock option plan 195 132 (Reversal of inventory write-downs) Write-down of inventories (164 ) 125 Adjusted EBITDA (2,021 ) 725 Conference Call Details\nA conference call will be held today at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the results.
