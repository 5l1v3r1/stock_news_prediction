After 40 years in important roles he has decided the time is right to step down, there is nothing else behind this,” said his spokesman.\n“He has full confidence in Chief Executive Jan Jenisch and the board, and fully supports the current strategy. His departure will not lead to any changes in the company’s strategy.”\nThe spokesman said Schmidheiny had no plans to sell his stakeholding and would remain a major shareholder “whatever happens”.\nFormer Lafarge Chairman and Chief Executive Bertrand Collomb will also be standing down from the board at the AGM on May 8, LafargeHolcim said.\nReporting by John Revill; Editing by Michael Shields and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T08:31:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
