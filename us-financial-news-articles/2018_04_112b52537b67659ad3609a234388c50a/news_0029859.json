REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo “I don’t have a problem with being restrictive,” Kaplan said, adding that monetary policy would be restrictive if interest rates rise above the 2.5 percent or 2.75 percent that he estimates is their “neutral” level. But, he said, he would not want rate hikes to proceed so fast or far that the yield curve inverts. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, currently around 2.85 percent, rises higher, acts to “limit the pace and the slope of how fast we can raise rates.”\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T21:22:18.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
