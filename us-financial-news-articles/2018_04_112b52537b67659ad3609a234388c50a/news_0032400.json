Where can they go? Even a burial ground was denied to the child because their right over it was disputed.”\nNearly 40 percent of Gujjars and Bakkarwals in the state have given up migration because of land disputes and are now impoverished, said Rahi.\nIndigenous people in India are protected by several laws that acknowledge their way of life, including customary rights to land. But these rights are often disregarded as demand for land for industry increases, activists say.\nRestive Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional “special status” - a provision that allows the state to make its own laws - has kept it from implementing the Forest Rights Act, which gives indigenous people the right to inhabit and live off forests.\nState chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has said a tribal policy is being drafted, and that nomadic tribes cannot be evicted without government permission.\nBut elsewhere too, lands of indigenous people are becoming increasingly contentious. In northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state, individual ownership rights to tribal communities can trigger more conflicts, analysts say.\nConservationists have also criticized the slow progress of the Forest Rights Act and a move to promote commercial plantations.\n“Land rights are precarious for forest dwellers across the country, and the Bakkarwals have to cope with many layers of disadvantage,” said Anita Sharma, a sociologist who has studied the community.\n“The relationship of the pastoral nomad with settled populations has changed drastically, owing to the continued marginalization of the pastoralist. The migration of the nomad is increasingly viewed as an indulgence.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Katy Migiro.
