Its non-hardware revenue streams are linked to its user interface, \"MIUI\", and include entertainment subscriptions and financial services.\nThe five percent cap only applies to the company's consumer hardware products, it said.\nXiaomi has also invested in making its own chipsets and microprocessors, which will not fall under the cap.\nXiaomi rose rapidly to become the world's largest startup in 2014 by selling its smartphones with thin margins, cutting costs by using online retail channels and doing minimal marketing.\nAfter a slump in sales in 2016, the company has since undergone a strategic shift, opening hundreds of offline stores to sell its growing collection of smart devices and reclaiming a large part of its previous market share.\nIt has also expanded heavily into foreign markets, including India, where it is now the top smartphone vendor, according to research firm Canalys.
