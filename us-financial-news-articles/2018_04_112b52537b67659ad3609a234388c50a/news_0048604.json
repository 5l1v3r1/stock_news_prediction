The deals builds on Humana’s focus on using healthcare providers in members’ homes to improve patient care and save costs.\nSoaring healthcare costs have been a national issue, and the federal government has been restricting spending for healthcare, putting pressure on insurers.\nLast year, Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) announced a $69 billion deal to be bought by CVS Health Corp ( CVS.N ), fueling interest in how smaller rival Humana will compete.\nHumana will get a 40 percent interest in Curo and the deal is anticipated to close in summer.\nEvercore is the exclusive financial adviser to Humana. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP are legal advisers to Humana.\nDebevoise & Plimpton LLP and Mintz Levin are legal advisers to TPG and WCAS. Ropes & Gray LLP is also acting as legal adviser to WCAS.\nJefferies LLC is the exclusive financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis LLP legal adviser to Curo.\nReporting by Ankur Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-23T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T14:28:21.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
