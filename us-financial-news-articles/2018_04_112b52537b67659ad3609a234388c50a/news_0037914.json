The brokerage has a “buy” rating on the stock.\nJD Sports has overtaken billionaire Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct as Britain’s leading sportswear retailer by market value.\nIt has already begun to spread its wings beyond its home British market.\nIt has agreed a $558 million deal for NASDAQ-listed Finish Line to tap into the lucrative U.S. sportswear market and is expanding into South Korean market via a joint venture.\nJD Sport’s deal for Finish Line, the exclusive retailer of athletic shoes for Macy’s, will increase the British company’s importance to international brands, particularly Nike and Adidas.\nIn Britain, it sell brands such as Superdry, Nike, The North Face and Adidas at its JD stores. The company also offers a number of exclusive items from Nike and Adidas under the “Only At JD” range.\nWith steady demand at its home UK market fuelling its overseas expansion, JD Sports has also tapped into markets in France, Spain, Finland and Malaysia in the recent years.
