I'm in the future. Thank you Elon,\" West said in one tweet.\nHe continued saying that he heard Tesla's electric vehicles were good for the environment, and went on to call the car the \"funnest\" he has ever driven.\nTWEET\nTWEET\nWest and Musk appear to have a growing friendship that started 3 years ago. Writing for Time in 2015, Musk praised the rapper.\n\"Kanye's belief in himself and his incredible tenacity — he performed his first single with his jaw wired shut — got him to where he is today. And he fought for his place in the cultural pantheon with a purpose,\" Musk said.\nAnd earlier this year, the Tesla CEO said that West inspires him.\nMusk will likely be hoping for all the support he can get given the spate of bad news Tesla has recently faced, including a probe into workplace safety . Shares of Tesla are down nearly 7 percent since the start of the year.\nWATCH: A visit to the only Tesla Supercharger station with a lounge show chapters CNBC visits the only Telsa Supercharger station with a lounge 8:59 AM ET Sat, 27 Jan 2018 | 02:20", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T14:56:46.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
