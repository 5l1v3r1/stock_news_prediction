Mr. Cherry will continue to serve as a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and the Bank as well.\n“These changes reflect the transition anticipated in our long-term management succession plan,” said Larry Dillon. “While I plan to continue to be very active in the affairs of the Company, we have been developing Tom for this leadership role and he is well-prepared and ready to handle it.
