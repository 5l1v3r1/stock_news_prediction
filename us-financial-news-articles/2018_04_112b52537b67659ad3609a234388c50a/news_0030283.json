The government said these rules will be eliminated this year for companies building electric vehicles--a move that could benefit Tesla Inc. TSLA, -3.04% --and for all vehicles by 2022. \n“This will completely change the situation in China within 10 years,” said Yale Zhang, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. \nThe action could bolster President Donald Trump’s assertions that his policy of pressurizing China to modify its trade behavior is yielding swift results. Even so, people in the industry said the reshaping of China’s auto sector wouldn’t necessarily hand an advantage to foreign players, as the implications of the reforms would take years to become clear.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:32:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
