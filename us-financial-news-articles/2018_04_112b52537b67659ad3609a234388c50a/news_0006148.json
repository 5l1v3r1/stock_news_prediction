REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko \nSmith and former vice captain David Warner were handed 12-month bans, while Bancroft was suspended for nine months after the latter was caught using a piece of sandpaper on the ball in the third test in Cape Town. \n“I would give anything to have this behind me and be back representing my country,” Smith said on his verified Twitter account. “But I meant what I said about taking full responsibility as Captain of the team. \n“I won’t be challenging the sanctions. They’ve been imposed by CA to send a strong message and I have accepted them.” \nBancroft followed suit and accepted his punishment. \n“Today I lodged the paperwork with Cricket Australia and will be accepting the sanction handed down,” tweeted the 25-year-old. \n“I would love to put this behind me and will do whatever it takes to earn back the trust of the Australian public. Thank you to all those who have sent messages of support.” \nThe players have until Thursday to appeal their bans with Warner the only player left to announce his decision. \nSmith and Warner were stripped of their leadership positions for their role in the March 24 incident and are set to lose substantial earnings after sponsors dropped them and they were banned from this year’s Indian Premier League.
