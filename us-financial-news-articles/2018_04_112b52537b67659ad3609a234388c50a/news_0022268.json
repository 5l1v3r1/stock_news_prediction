REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte \nOnly one parliament sitting was scheduled before May 8 and the new cabinet will swear in on April 23, two government legislators said. \n“The president has prorogued parliament until May 8,” President Maithripala Sirisena’s secretary, Austin Fernando, said, declining to say why. \nA senior minister, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said : “The prorogation means all the existing parliament committees will be lapsed and new committees have to be appointed when the parliament is reconvened.” \nSome main parliament committees including those looking into public enterprises and accounts are headed by opposition lawmakers. \nPrime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe survived the confidence vote which was sponsored by opponents who blame him for failing to prevent an alleged scam in the bond market and anti-Muslim riots last month. \nBut 16 lawmakers, most of them ministers, from Sirisena’s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) voted in favour of the no-confidence motion. They resigned their portfolios and decided to sit with the opposition, weakening the SLFP’s coalition with Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP). \nSirisena appointed four ministers on a temporary basis to handle the main ministries. \nLakshman Yapa Abeywardena, one of the 16 legislators who decided to join the opposition said: “We were to cross over and sit with the opposition on April 19. Now we will do that on May 8.” Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Euan Rocha and Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T22:29:53.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
