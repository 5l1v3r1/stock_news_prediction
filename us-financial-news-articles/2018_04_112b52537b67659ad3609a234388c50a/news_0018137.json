Paris, one of the most visited cities in the world, is its biggest single market, with around 65,000 homes listed.\n($1 = 0.8088 euros) (Reporting by Myriam Rivet; Writing by Matthias Blamont; Editing by Dominique Vidalon/Sudip Kar-Gupta)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T12:08:02.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
