One said Cinven was bidding together with Belgiums’s Etex ( BE0941244536.BR ).\nImerys the banks and the bidders declined to comment.\nImerys is a multinational company with a market capitalization of almost 6 billion euros and 2017 revenue of 4.6 billion euros and 890 million euros of EBITDA.\nThe tiles unit is part of Imerys’ ceramic materials unit, which saw its sales and earnings decline last year as it struggled with a mix of weak house renovation markets, a challenging paper market for its kaolin ops and robust emerging markets demand for houseware and technical ceramics.\nThe private equity bidders for the roofing tiles business are no strangers to the industry. Lone Star in 2016 bought German-based building materials maker Xella. Cinven owns Chryso, a French maker of additives for construction materials and Carlyle is invested in Spanish building materials group Cupa.\nJohnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and a unit of Imerys, Imerys Talc America, were recently told to pay $117 million in damages in a case linking cancer to asbestos in talc.\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:28:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
