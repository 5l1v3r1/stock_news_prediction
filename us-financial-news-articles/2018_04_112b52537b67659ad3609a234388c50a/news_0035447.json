A D-SIB is a bank that could broadly impact the domestic economy should it fail.\nThe bail-in power is a tool that CDIC can use to convert some of a failing D-SIB’s debt into common shares in order to recapitalize the bank and allow it to remain open and operating. Bail-in legislation was introduced as part of Federal Budget 2016 and the regulations provide details for operationalizing this important resolution tool.\nThe regulations set out key features for the bail-in regime including which instruments are subject to the bail-in power, factors that CDIC must consider in exercising the bail-in power, and the requirements that D-SIBs must follow when issuing the bail-in debt:\nBank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Issuance Regulations Bank Recapitalization (Bail-in) Conversion Regulations\n“Bail-in is an important step in strengthening Canada’s bank resolution regime,” said CDIC President and CEO Michèle Bourque. “Deposits, including deposits in chequing accounts, savings accounts and term deposits, are not affected by the bail-in regime.”\nAn overview of the bail-in tool is available on CDIC’s website at www.cdic.ca .\nThe Canadian bail-in regime aligns with the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) Key Attributes for Effective Resolution Regimes, a set of international standards developed following the global financial crisis.\nThe Government has also published new compensation regulations which set out an updated process for providing compensation to shareholders and creditors in the unlikely event that they have been made worse off as a result of CDIC’s resolution actions than they would have been if the bank had been liquidated or wound up. An overview of the compensation regime is available here.\nCDIC is a federal Crown corporation established in 1967 to protect the savings of Canadians, and we contribute to financial stability by safeguarding over $770 billion in deposits. As resolution authority, we are responsible for handling the failure of any of our members, from the smallest to the largest. Our members include banks, federally regulated credit unions as well as loan and trust companies and associations governed by the Cooperative Credit Associations Act that take deposits. We are funded by premiums paid by member institutions and do not receive public funds to operate.\nFurther information:\nBrad Evenson\nDirector, Communications and Public Affairs\nTel: 613.943.4395\nE-mail: media@cdic.ca\nSource:Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/92e96cfe-617b-47a3-a3b1-9f804c8cfe15", "http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2018/2018-04-18/html/sor-dors58-eng.html", "http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2018/2018-04-18/html/sor-dors57-eng.html", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=GAf77i4NLD9mrhjUt-7pCxZIDwvegOkouLXi41TomdaMsuDiT0duXgmCWRbNFyvsjXBkAXva_HjwXe7ikGbq6043rJfCF-jfBPLndsp_c_piDWQlTp0zhy7sYI1v-RoJ9asPCFTg7JKjDgnmax7ezg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ZLHLFwgSOsEYLa-yQKDtW1BXRS6ModrbNvqeC1VupXczlASFG7iZBUmZMAKqCQ5LzZapU33PmhdSMOr1xZ1RvuyWacB_ECr-zbCyzryDZb_Nj7pW4ecJ21S8ow3H081XDmemvgmKejvAa1j5cj3Qow==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=IOPcKV-kQJnT3OXAE-x73aHN-rdEHohsYRQ6j9WaNMGwl3tDw3mVQxVGa6hewypB_6kEJTOGNMlDrvhTuAR0bQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1FsQbt8EGCgsS6V1MTwUWz1EU7Qrh__FpLVXM8KQ_qWBavEoBv-upUP_sooJZdor517xATqhGhs5wCIXhVRAmQ=="], "published": "2018-04-18T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T22:04:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
