Attorney General Jeff Sessions dismissed him last month two days before his scheduled retirement for what he described as a lack of candor.\nMcCabe has disputed that assessment, and issued a point-by-point rebuttal on Friday. He says that when he believed his answers to the inspector general were misunderstood, he went back and tried to correct them. His lawyer says the inspector general unfairly tried to conclude its work before McCabe could retire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T22:49:59.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
