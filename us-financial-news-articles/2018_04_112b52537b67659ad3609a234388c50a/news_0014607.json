REUTERS/Amir Levy/File Photo \nPrince Mohammed, Saudi defence minister and one of the kingdom’s most powerful policymakers, is due to meet President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday. \nOn the agenda for his two-day stay in Paris are the conflicts in Yemen, Syria and the Iran nuclear deal. He will also attend cultural events and an economic forum. \nPrince Mohammed just completed a three-week visit to the United States. \nA tourism project between Paris and Riyadh is expected to be announced but he is not expected to clinch any mega-deals. \nThe visit comes amid growing pressure on Macron at home from lawmakers and rights groups over France’s weapons sales to the Saudi-led coalition fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.
