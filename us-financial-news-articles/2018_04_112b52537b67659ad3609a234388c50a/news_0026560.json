He did not allow a hit for the opening 4 2/3 innings before Amed Rosario bounced an infield single behind second base.\nAnderson’s abbreviated no-hit bid came one day before the 31st anniversary of the Brewers’ only no-hitter, which was thrown by Juan Nieves against the Baltimore Orioles.\nJeremy Jeffress got the final two outs of the seventh before Josh Hader struck out five in two perfect innings for his first big-league save.\nJonathan Villar provided Anderson all the support he’d need with a three-run homer in the second inning. The Brewers received insurance runs via solo homers from Jett Bandy (fourth inning) and Orlando Arcia (ninth inning).\nBandy and Travis Shaw had two hits apiece.\nBrewers left fielder Ryan Braun left in the fifth inning due to back tightness.\nThe Mets scored their only run in the sixth when Michael Conforto was hit by a pitch with one out, went to second on Asdrubal Cabrera’s groundout and scored on Yoenis Cespedes’ single.\nCabrera went 0-for-4 to end his 11-game hitting streak.\nMets right-hander Matt Harvey (0-1) took the loss after allowing four runs on eight hits and one walk while striking out six over five innings. Paul Sewald followed with three perfect innings.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:02:53.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
