The Japan Core Alpha Equity Fund lost 7 percent. \nCEO Ellis had said in February that recent market moves had affected the group’s investment performance in some areas, particularly for momentum strategies. \nHowever, some long-only and long-short strategies generated returns, such as the GLG European Long Short Fund, which made a gain of 3.8 percent. \nAssets rose mainly in alternative risk premia but also due to the launch of a $400 million European credit fund and modest flows into computer-driven and discretionary long-only strategies.
