It has also partnered with Eli Lilly to co-develop three cancer treatments in China and overseas.\nAscentage, founded in 2010, has seven products in clinical development and 17 in total approved for clinical studies in China, the United States and Australia. Besides U.S. Oriza Ventures, it also counts Chinese state-backed SDIC Fund Management among its investors.
