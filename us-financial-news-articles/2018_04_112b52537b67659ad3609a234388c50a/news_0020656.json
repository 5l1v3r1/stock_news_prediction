Local newspaper Ambito Financiero reported 1,000 employers had accepted the deal, citing an anonymous source.\nCarrefour representatives in Argentina declined to comment when asked about the deal. A government spokesman confirmed the meeting was scheduled with the company and labor ministry.\nCarrefour, which has previously denied plans to exit Argentina, said last week it had filed a “crisis prevention” application with Argentina’s labor ministry.\nArgentina represented 4 percent of Carrefour’s global sales in 2017 at $3.5 billion euros. The company started operating in Argentina in 1982 and employs 19,000 workers.\nDouble-digit inflation has made Argentina a challenging environment for supermarkets. Business friendly President Mauricio Macri told Spanish newspaper ABC over the weekend his government was working to crack down on informal, Chinese-run grocery stores he accused of not paying taxes and undercutting formal businesses.
