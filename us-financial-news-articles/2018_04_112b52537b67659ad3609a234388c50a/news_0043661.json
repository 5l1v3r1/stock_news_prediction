Kenney, president and chief executive officer of GATX, stated, “The condition of the North American railcar leasing market in the first quarter was consistent with our expectations entering the year. Rail industry carload data and operating metrics showed mixed performance relative to 2017, and 2018 improvement in the railcar leasing market remains uncertain due to the oversupply of existing railcars and the large railcar manufacturing backlog.\n“GATX’s fleet utilization remained stable at 98.2% in the quarter due to outstanding execution by our commercial team. We continue to effectively deploy railcars and have currently placed new railcar deliveries with customers through the end of 2018. The renewal lease rate change of GATX’s Lease Price Index (“LPI”) was negative 11.6%, with an average renewal term of 34 months. While this LPI metric improved, we expected quarterly volatility in 2018, and we still anticipate the 2018 annual change to be at least negative 25% as market lease rates remain at low levels. The secondary railcar market was strong as evidenced by our remarketing income of $50.0 million for the quarter, which represents the majority of our expected remarketing activity for 2018.\n“Rail International produced solid operating results, with GATX Rail Europe’s fleet utilization at 96.7%. The lease rate environment in Europe has stabilized and demand for new cars remains steady. American Steamship Company’s sailing season began at the end of March, and ten vessels are currently scheduled to operate in 2018. The Rolls-Royce and Partners Finance affiliates had another excellent quarter as demand for spare aircraft engines continues to be strong.”\nMr. Kenney concluded, “The year is progressing as we expected, and therefore at this time our 2018 full-year earnings estimate is unchanged at $4.55 - $4.75 per diluted share.”\nRAIL NORTH AMERICA\nRail North America reported segment profit of $108.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $93.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Higher gains on asset dispositions in the first quarter of 2018 were partially offset by lower lease revenue, resulting in higher segment profit in 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, Rail North America’s wholly owned fleet comprised approximately 119,000 railcars, including approximately 16,200 boxcars. The following fleet statistics and performance discussion exclude the boxcar fleet.\nFleet utilization was 98.2% at the end of the first quarter, compared to 98.2% at the end of the prior quarter and 99.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the renewal lease rate change of the GATX Lease Price Index (“LPI”) was negative 11.6%. This compares to negative 32.4% in the prior quarter and negative 32.6% in the first quarter of 2017. The average lease renewal term for cars included in the LPI during the first quarter was 34 months, compared to 36 months in the prior quarter and 29 months in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter renewal success rate was 76.7%. Rail North America’s investment volume during the first quarter was approximately $137 million.\nAdditional fleet statistics, including information about the boxcar fleet, and macroeconomic data related to Rail North America’s business are provided on the last page of this press release.\nRAIL INTERNATIONAL\nRail International’s segment profit was $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $13.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in segment profit was primarily driven by more cars on lease and a favorable foreign exchange variance.\nAt March 31, 2018, GATX Rail Europe’s (GRE) fleet consisted of approximately 23,000 cars and utilization was 96.7%, compared to 96.8% at the end of the prior quarter and 95.0% at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Additional fleet statistics for GRE are provided on the last page of this press release.\nAMERICAN STEAMSHIP COMPANY\nAmerican Steamship Company (ASC) reported a segment profit of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a segment loss of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. ASC’s operations are limited during the first quarter as the vessels are in winter lay-up from mid-January through late-March.\nPORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\nPortfolio Management reported segment profit of $13.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The operating environment at Rolls-Royce and Partners Finance affiliates is positive with higher affiliate income in the first quarter of 2018.\nCOMPANY DESCRIPTION\nGATX Corporation (NYSE:GATX) strives to be recognized as the finest railcar leasing company in the world by its customers, its shareholders, its employees and the communities where it operates.
