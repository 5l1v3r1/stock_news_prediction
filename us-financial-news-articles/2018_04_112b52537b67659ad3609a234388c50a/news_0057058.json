Also pictured are cancer researchers from Stand Up to Cancer and cancer survivors who work at American Airlines.\nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations.\nThe custom aircraft isn’t just meant to be a poster for Marvel heroes, though. It’s part of a broader cancer awareness and fundraising campaign called “Save Lives Now.” You can make a donation to the campaign here , and American Airlines AAdvantage members who do so will receive 10 miles per donated dollar.\nThe Avengers-stacked airplane will travel between New York and Los Angeles. It was unveiled at the Los Angeles International Airport this week.
