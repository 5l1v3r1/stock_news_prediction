Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected 225,000 new claims last week.\nInitial claims remain near levels last seen in the 1970s. They have held below 300,000 for 163 consecutive weeks, the longest streak in weekly records going back to 1967.\nData can be volatile from week to week. The four-week moving average of claims, a more-stable measure, rose by 1,250 to 231,250 last week.\nThe low level of claims is among multiple signs of health in the U.S. labor market. The unemployment rate has held at 4.1% since October , the lowest level since late 2000. Employers have added to nonfarm payrolls for 90 straight months in the longest continuous job expansion on record.\nThursday’s report showed the number of claims workers made for longer than a week fell by 15,000 to 1,863,000 in the week ended April 7. That figure, known as continuing claims, is reported with a one-week lag.\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Sharon Nunn at sharon.nunn@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T16:27:59.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
