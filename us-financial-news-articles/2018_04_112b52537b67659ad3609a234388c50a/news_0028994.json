Uber gets a 27.5 percent stake in Grab, which was last valued at $6 billion after a financing round in July. \n“We trust that the CCCS’ review takes into account a dynamic industry that is constantly evolving, highly competitive, and being disrupted by technology and new services,” said Lim Kell Jay, head of Grab Singapore. \nOther measures include ensuring that drivers are not subjected to exclusivity obligations and making sure both the ride-hailing companies maintain their pre-merger pricing and commission levels. \nThe watchdog also requires Grab to cease its exclusivity arrangements with all taxi fleets in Singapore, subject to provisions. \nThe Singapore-based company may, however, receive personal data of drivers, riders and merchants who choose to shift to the Grab platform, the CCCS said in a statement. \nThe interim measures are necessary because the two firms are each other’s closest competitors and have a significant combined market share, the competition watchdog said, adding that barriers to entry were likely to be high. \n“In particular, many drivers are constrained by exclusivity arrangements such that they can only drive for one ride-hailing platform. This makes it difficult for a new ride-hailing platform to attract drivers,” it said. \nAny new entrant in the ride-hailing business would likely have to make significant investments to attract passengers and drivers, and to compete with the existing player, added the agency, which began its probe last month. \nBoth companies should also ensure that drivers who rent a vehicle from Uber’s car leasing company are free to drive for any ride-hailing platform. \nUnless revoked by the agency, the order will be in place until the investigation is completed or concerns over the deal are resolved. \nSingapore’s Land Transport Authority (LTA) said on Friday that CCCS’ measures on the removal of exclusivity obligations and impediments to market contestability will further promote market competition in the point-to-point transport sector. \nThe LTA was in the process of reviewing the broader regulatory framework for the industry, including studying how to structure the sector and license private hire car booking service operators, it added. \nThe Philippines’ anti-trust agency had also ordered Uber to delay its shutdown. \nLawyers and analysts had previously told Reuters that regulatory scrutiny could complicate Grab’s takeover of Uber’s business, but there is little the authorities can do to stop U.S. firm from simply exiting the region.
