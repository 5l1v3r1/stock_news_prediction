Apr 21, 2018; Oakland, CA, USA; Oakland Athletics pitcher Sean Manaea (55) throws a pitch during the second inning against the Boston Red Sox at Oakland Coliseum. Mandatory Credit: Kiel Maddox-USA TODAY Sports \nManaea struck out 10 batters and walked just two on a night the Red Sox were no-hit for the first time since 1993. \nBoston’s Hanley Ramirez grounded into a fielder’s choice for the game’s final out, as Manaea was mobbed by his Oakland team mates. \n“Oh man, my heart was beating out of my chest, and I was trying to do everything I could (to stay calm),” Manaea said in a post-game interview. The 26-year-old had yet to throw a complete game before Saturday.

Only Oakland (4,242) has gone longer without being no-hit.
