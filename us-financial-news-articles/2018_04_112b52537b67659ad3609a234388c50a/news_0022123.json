The Brazilian government said February retail sales unexpectedly contracted, falling 0.2 percent from January, below even the most pessimistic forecast of a 0.3 percent increase in a Reuters poll of economists. Traders said the data cleared the way for the nation's central bank to keep cutting the benchmark Selic rate, which currently stands at 6.5 percent, keeping a lid on the real. \"The retail statistics open the door for a 6.25 percent Selic rate without issues,\" said a Sao Paulo derivatives trader. \"If retail is weak, it doesn't generate inflation, and the central bank can keep cutting.\" The Brazilian real had climbed a modest 0.02 percent against the dollar in late morning trade, lagging other major currencies in Latin America. The Mexican peso climbed 0.55 percent on Thursday amid optimism over North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations and a decision by Moody's on Wednesday to revise the nation's credit outlook to \"stable\" from \"negative.\" Colombia's peso currency jumped 0.52 percent, following higher oil prices, which hovered near four-year highs amid shrinking global inventories and expectations of a supply cut extension by OPEC. Across Latin America, equities markets were mixed. Among the largest winners on the Bovespa, which was off 0.06 percent, was state electricity company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, known as Eletrobras. The country's newly appointed finance minister said on Wednesday night that the company needed to be privatized before the end of June, and a congressional committee approved hearings on the matter after several delays and cancellations.
