REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo In an interview with a WDRB-TV television reporter on Friday, the Republican governor said he could guarantee that somewhere in Kentucky a child was sexually assaulted after being left home with no supervision because of the walkout.\nIn a video statement on Sunday, Bevin said: “I’m sorry for those of you, every single one of you, that has been hurt by things that I’ve said.”\nKentucky’s Republican-majority House of Representatives passed a bipartisan resolution on Saturday criticizing the governor’s comments, and the Republican state Senate president said Bevin should apologize, according to local media.\nTeachers in Kentucky, as well as in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona, have held recent walkouts or protests demanding more funds for education, including teachers’ salaries and pensions.\nKentucky legislators voted on Friday to override Bevin’s veto of a two-year state budget that increased education funding through a $480 million tax increase.\nBevin said on Friday that single-parent households in the state had been forced to leave children at home and in peril of not just sexual assault, but of ingesting poison or being offered drugs for the first time.\nIn his apology video on Sunday, Bevin appeared to defend some of the comments he had made.\n“We can’t be so consumed with the financial that we fail to appreciate the ripple effect of the real people that are involved,” Bevin said on Sunday.\nReporting by Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Additional reporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T00:37:36.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
