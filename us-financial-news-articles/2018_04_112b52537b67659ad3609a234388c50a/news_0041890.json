Heyward added two runs of insurance in the fifth inning with his second home run of the season, a blast to right field that plated Addison Russell.\nLester (2-0) allowed one unearned run on two hits with seven strikeouts and one walk in six innings of work. Lester had a wild pitch that led to a first-inning run for the Cardinals, but didn’t allow a hit until the fifth inning.\nSt. Louis starter Luke Weaver (2-1) allowed six runs on nine hits with three strikeouts and one walk in four innings.\nWith Lester out, the Cardinals took advantage of the Cubs’ bullpen to close the gap. They scored four in the seventh inning, capitalizing on a walk, a hit batsman and a throwing error by Chicago second baseman Javier Baez.\nTrailing 8-5, St. Louis put runners on first and second in the eighth inning, but Cubs reliever Carl Edwards struck out Paul DeJong to get out of the jam.\nEvery Cubs player in the starting lineup had a hit. Kris Bryant had two RBIs, and Anthony Rizzo had three hits and an RBI.\nBrandon Morrow retired the side in order in the ninth inning to finish off the Cardinals.\nMonday’s and Wednesday’s games were postponed due to inclement weather, the third and fourth postponements of the Cubs’ homestand. Monday’s game will be made up as part of a day-night doubleheader on July 21.\nChicago now heads out on a five-game road trip beginning in Colorado and finishing in Cleveland.\nThe Cardinals return home to host the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets during a six-game home stand that begins Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:41:12.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
