Police officers guard the cordoned off area around the home of former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, Britain, April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nIt said officials at the MI6 intelligence agency have had discussions with their counterparts in the CIA about resettling the victims poisoned last month in the English city of Salisbury. \n“They will be offered new identities,” it quoted an unidentified source as saying. \nThe paper said its sources believed Britain would want to ensure their safety by resettling them in one of the so-called “five eyes” countries, the intelligence-sharing partnership that \nalso includes the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. \n“The obvious place to resettle them is America because \nthey’re less likely to be killed there and it’s easier to protect them there under a new identity,” it quoted what it called an intelligence source familiar with the negotiations as saying. \n“There’s a preference for them to be resettled in a five-eyes nation because their case would have huge security implications,” the source added.
