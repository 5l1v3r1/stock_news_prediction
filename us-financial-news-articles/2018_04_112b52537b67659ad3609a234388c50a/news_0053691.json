Emerging-market currencies plummeted in recent days as concerns over a widening U.S. fiscal deficit and accelerating inflation lifted U.S. Treasury yields, dampening demand for high-risk assets. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds slipped back below 3 percent on Thursday as buyers emerged following a week-long sell-off, soothing angst among emerging-market investors. But caution remained as investors feared newfound strength in the U.S. dollar may be here to stay. The Mexican and Chilean pesos were both nearly flat, while the Brazilian real extended a recent stretch of underperformance by weakening 0.4 percent. Concerns over elections in Brazil have weighed on its currency in recent weeks. The benchmark Bovespa stock index, however, was up 1 percent after a heavy batch of corporate earnings. Shares of shopping mall operator Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliário SA were among the biggest gainers after it reported an 81 percent increase in first-quarter net profit. Miner Vale SA, lender Banco Bradesco SA , toll-road operator Ecorodovias Infraestrutura e Logística SA, wood pulp producer Klabin SA and college operator Estácio Participações SA also reacted to recently-published quarterly earnings.
