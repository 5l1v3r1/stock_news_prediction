That beat the 543 million euros expected by analysts.\nRevenue fell 3.4 percent to 1.4 billion euros, as European rules limiting roaming fees for the use of mobile phones abroad hurt earnings.\nAfter selling international operations in recent years, KPN now fully focuses on the Dutch market, offering bundles of mobile telephone, internet and television services.\nAlthough the number of customers buying multiple services grew, sales on the consumer market fell by 2.6 percent, as KPN sold fewer handsets to go with its telephone subscriptions and roaming fees fell.\nSales at its business division fell 2.4 percent as customers continued to switch from fixed lines to IP alternatives.\n$1 = 0.8214 euros Reporting by Bart Meijer; editing by Christian Schmollinger and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:37:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
