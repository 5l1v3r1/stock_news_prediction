He was arrested on Saturday and charged with rape on Monday and is being held on the nearby island of Koh Samui. \n“The suspect has admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim, but he said that it was consensual and not rape,” Police Lieutenant Colonel Piyapong Boonkaew of Koh Tao police told Reuters. \n“We are now investigating the case and waiting for forensic examination,” Piyapong said. \nReuters was unable to contact both the suspect’s and the victim’s lawyers.
