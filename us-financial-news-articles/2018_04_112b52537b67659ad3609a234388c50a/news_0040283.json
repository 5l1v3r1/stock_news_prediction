Demonstrators take part in a protest demanding an end to profiteering in the education system in Santiago, Chile April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido \nThe marches, attended by students and professors, follow a recent decision by the country’s constitutional court to overturn a law that prohibited for-profit companies from controlling universities. \nProfit-making from higher education is illegal in Chile. But critics have long claimed that some companies that operate universities have found ways to exploit loopholes in the law, allowing them to turn a profit without re-investing the money in reduced tuition or improved education. \n“We would prefer to be in the classroom...but unfortunately, we can’t do it with dignity because there continues to be profiteering (in education) in Chile,” said Sandra Beltrami, a spokeswoman for the students.
