I am pleased to announce that we have substantially achieved that goal in 2017 where our two largest customers accounted for only 19% of our total revenue. The acquisition of Innotech in late 2016 and the increase in revenue generated by the CohuHD business segment provide improved earnings quality for the Company and our investors. In 2017, we delivered record revenue and continued margin improvement. We also received our largest single order with the new RISE 4290 camera. With our refreshed product portfolio, expanded retail markets and share gains in the transportation market, we anticipate ongoing revenue and earnings growth in the future.\"\nThe Company reevaluated its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 in relation to the new tax regulations effective in 2018.
