His track record of building organizations, and leading and creating value for large healthcare and medical device companies makes him not only an ideal fit with our organization, but the right leader to grow the brand.”\nThe new organization structure further solidifies the company as a pioneer and a disruptor of the traditional healthcare model. “As Americans grapple with the state of the healthcare system and spiraling costs, the OrthoNOW model allows patients to see the right clinician at the right time,” said Co-Founder and CFO Justin Irizarry. “This ‘Orthopedics on Demand’ approach eliminates redundancy in the system, therefore maximizing the clinical outcome while minimizing cost and changing the true value of healthcare.”\n“This is both an exciting and important time to join OrthoNOW,” said Mendez. “With the company poised to grow globally, and a dedicated and talented team behind the brand, I look forward to working with everyone to continue its momentum and accelerate growth. I have spent my career with the elevating purpose of making a difference in the lives of the people we serve — physicians, clinicians and ultimately, the patient. OrthoNOW does just that.”\nAn experienced leader in the healthcare and medical device sectors, Mendez has an extensive track record building intrinsic value through opportunity, purpose and leadership on a global level. He has served as President and CEO of Enovate Medical, a manufacturer of IT equipment for the healthcare industry based in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He also served in leadership roles for Gambro AB, now part of Baxter, including President of both Gambro Americas and Gambro Global Acute Business, and led the efforts as Vice President–OM Specialties of Owens & Minor, a Richmond, Virginia-based healthcare logistics company.\nOrthoNOW has grown into a national go-to resource for orthopedic issues and is poised to have a major footprint in orthopedic care across the nation. Strong interest in the brand is being fueled by the model’s innovative transformation of healthcare delivery that is prime for retailization.\nFor more information, or to schedule an interview with Mendez, contact Michelle Alban at michelle@latin2latin.com or by calling 954.376.4800.\nABOUT OrthoNOW:\nOrthoNOW® , the nation’s only orthopedic care franchise, is focused on the assessment and treatment of a range of orthopedic and sports injuries, chronic conditions and preventative protocols — all on a walk-in basis.
