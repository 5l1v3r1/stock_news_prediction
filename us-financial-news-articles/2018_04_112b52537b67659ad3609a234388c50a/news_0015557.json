The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nUnder the terms of the deal, FARC has 10 guaranteed congress seats through 2026, one of which the party awarded to Hernandez.\nThe arrest sparked condemnation by the FARC, which said it was an attack on the peace process. It was unclear whether the party was planing on replacing Hernandez and with whom.\n“This is the worst moment the peace process has been through,” the FARC added on Twitter. “The government should act and stop judicial set-ups from leading to events like this, which cause great mistrust.”\nCrimes committed by FARC members during the war are set to be adjudicated by a special tribunal, but those committed after demobilization are subject to regular judicial procedure, which includes the possiblity of extradition.\nThe FARC kept its initials but renamed itself the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force when it became a political party.\nThe group has repeatedly expressed fear it will be targeted by assassins and persecuted by authorities now it has demobilized. The group says more than 50 party members and relatives have been killed since peace was signed.\nReporting by Julia Symmes Cobb and Nelson Bocanegra; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T04:02:23.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
