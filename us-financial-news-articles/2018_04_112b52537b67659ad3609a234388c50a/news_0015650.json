(Reuters) - Patrick Reed fought off furious back-nine challenges from Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler to record a one-shot victory at the U.S. Masters on Sunday, trading in his ‘Captain America’ cap for a Green Jacket.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder \nThe final round began with Reed holding a three-shot advantage over Rory McIlroy, but while the Northern Irishman’s challenge faded Reed had to hold off his hard-charging U.S. Ryder Cup team mates to claim his first major championship. \nNeeding a two-putt par from 26 feet at the 18th to clinch the title, Reed ran his first putt four feet past the hole, took a deep breath and held his nerve rolling a knee-knocker into the cup for a one-under 71 that ended Fowler’s hopes of a playoff. \nThe fiery leader of recent U.S. Ryder and Presidents Cup efforts, Reed displayed plenty of the same brash spirit that earned him the ‘Captain America’ moniker while adding his name to the list of Masters champions. \n“Today was definitely probably the hardest mentally a round of golf could possibly be,” said Reed, who posted a 15-under 273 total. “It was going to be tough, anytime trying to close off a golf tournament is really tough.” \nFowler, who remains without a major title, had put the pressure on with a back nine charge that featured six birdies over his final 11 holes, including one at the last, but his 67 and 14-under total would not be enough.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \nWhile Reed had established his championship credentials with five PGA Tour wins and runnerup finish at the last major the 2017 PGA Championships at Quail Hollow, Reed, who had never had round under 70 at Augusta National, was not rated among the hot favourites when the year’s first major got underway. \nBut after opening the tournament with three straight rounds in the 60s Reed had everyone’s attention. \nOnly is final round 71 kept Reed from writing his name in the Masters record books as the first golfer to post four sub-70 rounds. \n“You know, just kind of one of those things that you expect that trying to go win your first major that people are going to make runs and it’s not going to be easy,” said Reed. “You’re going to have to go out and play a good round of golf and shoot under par.” \nMcIlroy, three shots back and playing in the final pair with Reed, had to get off to a quick start and he did just that, chopping two shots off the deficit in just two holes. \nReed sent his opening tee shot deep into the pines and opened his account with a bogey and McIlroy amped up the pressure with a birdie at the second while Reed settled for a par as the American’s advantage narrowed to one stroke.

That’s all I wanted to do. \n“The last four years I’ve had top 10s but I haven’t been close enough to the lead. Today I got myself there. \n“I didn’t quite do enough. But, you know, come back again next year and try.” \n(The story was refiled to fix headline to ‘cap’) Editing by Pritha Sarkar/Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T02:16:05.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
