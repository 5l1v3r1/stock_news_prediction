REUTERS/Brian Snyder \nThe talks are at an early stage and may not result in a deal, the report said. The Boston Harbor resort is scheduled to open next year and would cost about $2.5 billion to build. \nMGM has been planning to open a casino in Springfield. However, regulatory issues surrounding a potential deal would be complex as Massachusetts forbids companies from operating more than one casino in the state, the report said. \nA spokesman for MGM said while the company was committed to the “opening and success of MGM Springfield”, it does not comment on rumor or speculation. \nWynn Resorts declined to comment. \nThe deal talks follow the exit of Steve Wynn, the former chief executive of Wynn Resorts, in February, following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. Wynn has denied the accusations. \nIn March, Wynn disposed his entire 11.8 percent stake in the firm that he founded over 16 years ago for $2.1 billion. \nShares of both MGM and Wynn were up about 4 percent in late afternoon trading.
