CBA noted there was no change to its rating, saying it was standard practice for ratings agencies to consider multiple scenarios.\nFitch said credit ratings could come under pressure in severe scenarios where banks also suffer from follow-on economic effects including a fall in consumer spending and higher losses from banks’ business loan portfolios.\n“The severe scenarios would involve a negative shift in Fitch’s view of the operating environment for Australian banks, as well as our assessment of asset quality, capitalisation, profitability and, potentially, funding,” it said.\nTo be sure, Fitch’s base case is not a sharp or substantial correction in Australia’s housing market. The test, in fact, showed the banks could still withstand “a significant housing market downturn.”\nHouse price growth across Australia’s major cities have already tempered since late last year.\nThis run of losses is generally seen likely to continue in 2018 as banks clamp down on so called “liar loans” amid an exhaustive year-long judicial inquiry which has uncovered a series of wrongdoings.\nIn a separate statement, rival ratings agency Moody’s said tighter lending regulation on banks was a “credit positive”.\nAustralia’s prudential regulator removed a cap on lending to property investors last week, replacing it with stricter requirements for bank boards to comply with its underwriting guidelines.\nBank shares advanced in a firm Australian market with Westpac and NAB both up more than 1.5 percent. ANZ added about 1 percent while CBA rose 0.6 percent.\nThe gains reflected a market perception that retail wealth management was in the inquiry’s crosshairs, rather than general banking.\nThe benchmark ASX 200 share index climbed 0.5 percent.
