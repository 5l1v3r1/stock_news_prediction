Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS Struggling with a deep economic recession, failed socialist policies, debt default, and U.S. financial sanctions, Venezuela’s crude production slipped to 1.586 million barrels per day in February, according to OPEC.\nMaduro’s decree, seen by Reuters, gives Quevedo, a major general, powers to “create, annul or modify” deals involving state energy company PDVSA and its subsidiaries. The oil minister is also head of PDVSA.\nIt was not immediately clear what that might mean for PDVSA’s joint ventures. But Quevedo met late on Friday with some foreign partners including representatives of Total ( TOTF.PA ), Statoil ( STL.OL ), Chevron ( CVX.N ), Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC).\nFILE PHOTO: Venezuela's Oil Minister and President of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA Manuel Quevedo attends the event launching the new Venezuelan cryptocurrency \"Petro\" in Caracas, Venezuela February 20, 2018.
