When the Journal asked for comment on its report about the subpoena, the company said it has nothing to hide and is cooperating fully. \nThe U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn told the Journal it couldn't confirm or deny the existence of any subpoena or investigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T02:20:51.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
