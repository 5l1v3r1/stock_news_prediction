Madrid's regional president Cristina Cifuentes gestures while announcing her resignation in Madrid, Spain, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Susana Vera \nMadrid has always been a stronghold for the centre-right party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, but is under growing pressure from market-friendly Ciudadanos which has jumped ahead in the polls amid PP corruption scandals. \nA close circuit TV video published by newspaper OK Diario on Wednesday showed Cifuentes emptying her handbag for a security guard in a local supermarket after being accused of taking anti-aging cream. \nCifuentes, before tending her resignation, said taking the cream, worth around 40 euros, had been an “involuntarily error”.
