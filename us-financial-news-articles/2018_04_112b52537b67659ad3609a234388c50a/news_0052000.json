The broader market fell 0.2 percent.\n“The overall sales picture was not as positive as the market was looking for,” said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets.\nSame-store sales for Wesfarmers’ laggard British hardware unit tumbled 15.4 percent, as unseasonal snowstorms crimped gardening tool purchases.\nThe unit is under review, pending either a turnaround plan or a sale, after Wesfarmers booked a $1 billion writedown on it in February.\nManaging Director Rob Scott said a decision would be taken before a strategy day in June and added that recent media speculation of a imminent Wesfarmers acquisition was “incorrect”.\n“It would be quite possible that we’ll be sitting here this time next year and I’ll be explaining to you why we haven’t done anything,” he told journalists on a conference call.\n“I think that’s just as likely as sitting here in a year’s time talking about what we may have done from an M&A point of view.” ($1 = 1.3205 Australian dollars) (Reporting Tom Westbrook in Sydney and Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen Coates and Muralikumar Anantharaman)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T11:23:39.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
