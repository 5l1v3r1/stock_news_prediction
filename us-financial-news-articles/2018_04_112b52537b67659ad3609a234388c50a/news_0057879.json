It was recently down 0.1%, at 85.39, on the day.\nRobust U.S. economic numbers have helped buoy the U.S. currency and bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace this year. Most recently, a Friday report showed that the U.S. economy grew at 2.3% in the first quarter, faster than analysts were expecting.\nExpectations of rising rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors.\nMeanwhile, evidence of a slowdown in Europe has piled up. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday that policy makers needed to better understand what has caused a moderation in economic growth before they can decide on the future of the bank’s bond-buying program.\nThe euro was up 0.2% Friday, at $1.2131.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T05:43:01.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
