But he declined to say precisely how high it was.\nHe said examiners also found traces of an over-the-counter antihistamine that can cause drowsiness in the systems of the wife and two children.\nPolice have said a search of the family’s home in Woodland, Washington, turned up no suicide note.\nReporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T02:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T02:37:21.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
