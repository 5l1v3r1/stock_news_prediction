He also had a pair with the Anaheim Ducks in 2017.\nJonathan Quick had 27 saves for the Kings.\nTheodore gave Vegas a 1-0 lead just 3:23 into the first period when his long wrist shot from near the middle of the blue line found its way through traffic and past Quick’s left skate into the net.\nThe Kings had a chance to tie it early in the second period when James Neal was in the penalty box for tripping Adrian Kempe. Drew Doughty’s shot from the top of the left circle caromed off the dasher boards to Dustin Brown who failed to put the bouncing puck into a wide-open net as he skated by.\nMidway through the third period, Anze Kopitar had another chance to tie when he came in alone from the right side of the net but his backhand attempt hit the post by Fleury’s skate and then bounced onto the back of the net.\nVegas improved to 35-5-2 when scoring first. The two teams combined for 127 hits, including 68 by the Kings.\nA standing room only crowd of 18,479, the largest in Vegas franchise history, watched the first-ever Stanley Cup playoff game played in Las Vegas.\nGame 2 of the series is Friday night at T-Mobile Arena before the series shifts to Staples Center in Los Angeles for games on Sunday and Tuesday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:39:28.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
