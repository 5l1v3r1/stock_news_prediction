REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Icahn, who owns about 13.5 percent of SandRidge and is the company’s single largest shareholder, said he had “grave concerns” about current directors’ ability to decide the company’s future and will nominate his own slate at the annual meeting.\nThe current board “had a history of making poor decisions on behalf of stockholders,” Icahn wrote in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAshley Wilemon, a representative of SandRidge, said the company would not comment on Icahn’s characterization of the board or proposal to nominate his own slate of directors.\nIcahn also said he may be willing to make an all-cash offer for SandRidge shares that would allow existing shareholders to sell or continue with their holdings, according to the filing.\nThe billionaire investor last year successfully fought to block SandRidge’s $746 million deal to acquire rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc.\nSandRidge shares have fallen 37 percent this year. They closed down 10 cents at $13.34 on Wednesday, giving the company a market value of $475.5 million.\nReporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T04:37:13.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
