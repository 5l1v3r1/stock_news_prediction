Violence spiked when former colonial power France ended its peacekeeping mission in 2016.\nSince then, a United Nations Central African Republic mission known as MINUSCA has struggled to restore order to a country where government control barely extends beyond Bangui.\nOn Sunday, dozens of U.N. peacekeepers, civilians and militia fighters were injured as peacekeepers and domestic security forces moved in to dismantle militia bases in the Muslim PK5 neighborhood of majority-Christian Bangui.\nMINUSCA said PK5 residents had called on it to stamp out armed groups responsible for extortion and attacks on civilians.\nIt raided the bases of several PK5 groups, made arrests and seized weapons, ammunition and drugs, it said.\nThe raids are not universally popular. On Monday, a few dozen people peacefully demonstrated outside the U.N. headquarters in Bangui calling for the U.N. to pull out of PK5, a Reuters witness said.\nAfter Bozize was ousted in 2013 and anti-balaka groups carried out revenge killings, Muslim self-defense groups sprang up in PK5, claiming to protect the Muslim civilians concentrated there against ethnic violence.\nReporting By Crispin Dembassa-Kette; Writing by Edward McAllister; Editing by Aaron Ross and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T21:34:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
