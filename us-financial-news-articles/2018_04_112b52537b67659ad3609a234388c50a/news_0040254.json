Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the index to rise by 0.3%.\nComprising 10 components, including initial claims for jobless benefits, factory orders and the S&P 500’s price change, the index is intended to signal swings in the business cycle and to smooth out some of the volatility of individual indicators.\n“The LEI points to robust economic growth throughout 2018,” said Ataman Ozyildirim, director of business cycles and growth research at the Conference Board. “While the Federal Reserve is on track to continue raising its benchmark rate for the rest of the year, the recent weakness in residential construction and stock prices—important leading indicators—should be monitored closely.”\nWhile the index’s rise in March was slower than in previous months, “its six-month growth rate increased further and points to continued solid growth in the U.S. economy for the rest of the year,” Mr. Ozyildirim said.\n“The strengths among the components of the leading index have been very widespread over the last six months. However, labor market components made negative contributions in March and bear watching in the near future,” he said.\nThe board’s coincident index, designed to reflect current economic conditions, rose 0.2% in March from the prior month. The lagging index increased by 0.1%.\nWrite to Bowdeya Tweh at Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T18:26:49.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
