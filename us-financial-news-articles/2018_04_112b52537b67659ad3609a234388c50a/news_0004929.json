For us, the monsoons are coming. The camps of almost one million people are not built to withstand monsoon,” Kobsak Chutikul, the head of the secretariat of the board, said at a press conference in Singapore.\n“There will be enormous deaths if all parties do not move to some understanding on repatriation, on aid.”\nBecause a repatriation deal between the neighboring countries has been delayed, Bangladesh is racing to prepare new homes on a nearby island, called Bhasan Char, before the monsoons that could arrive later this month.\nThe Advisory Board for the Committee for Implementation of the Recommendations on Rakhine State was set up by Myanmar last year to advise on ways of adopting the findings of an earlier commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\nComputer modeling by the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) shows that more than 100,000 refugees will be threatened by landslides and floods in the coming monsoons. The rains typically begin in April and peak in July, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department.\nChutikul’s comments came as Malaysia intercepted a boat 56 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar off its northern island of Langkawi after a storm.\nMalaysia will allow them to enter on humanitarian grounds, with rights groups expecting further such perilous journeys by sea.\nThe Rohingya fled their homes in Rakhine into Bangladesh after militant attacks in August last year sparked a military crackdown that the United Nations and Western countries have said constitutes ethnic cleansing.\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that charge, saying its forces have been waging a legitimate campaign against “terrorists” who attacked government forces.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku; Editing by John Geddie and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:40:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
