The Marlins (5-17) lost their fifth consecutive game and have now dropped eight of their past nine.\nThe Marlins tied the score 1-1 in the top of the eighth inning with a little help from the Dodgers’ defense. Catcher-turned-second baseman Austin Barnes couldn’t turn a double play, throwing the ball into the Marlins’ dugout instead.\nWith Starlin Castro on second base after the overthrow, Brian Anderson rolled a game-tying single into center field against Dodgers reliever JT Chargois.\nAdam Liberatore (1-0) earned the victory, pitching two-thirds of an inning. Josh Fields tossed a scoreless ninth inning for his first save.\nHernandez gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the fourth inning on a home run to center, his third of the year.\nHernandez, a Marlin before he was traded to Los Angeles after the 2014 season, had two hits against Miami starter Jarlin Garcia. He added a bunt single in the eighth when the Dodgers put together their game-winning rally. Hernandez’s home run was the first hit Garcia allowed in the game.\nGarcia again was impressive in his third start with the Marlins. He entered with just one hit allowed over his first 11 innings in the rotation, and he gave up four hits and one run in six innings Monday. The second hit, a double, came from another former Marlins prospect, Barnes.\nWalker Buehler pitched five scoreless innings in his debut as a Dodgers starter, but he did not factor into the decision. The hard-throwing right-hander struck out five while giving up four hits and walking three. The rookie did have 9 1/3 innings in relief last year after rosters expanded in September.\nThe Dodgers’ Yasmani Grandal went 0-for-4 and saw his 11-game hitting streak end.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:37:40.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
