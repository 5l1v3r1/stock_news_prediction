Iran and Hezbollah are two of Assad’s chief allies.\nTrump has threatened strikes against Syria after a suspected gas attack on the town of Douma where dozens of people died, and a Russian envoy has voiced fears of a wider conflict between Washington and Moscow.\nHowever, the White House said “no final decision has been made” on Syria after Trump met his national security team on Thursday.\nNasrallah said in his speech that under Trump, U.S. policy was inconsistent and hard to understand.\nISRAELI STRIKE Damascus has accused rebels and rescuers of fabricating reports of the Douma attack and Washington of seeking to use it as a pretext for attacking the Syrian army.\nAsked about possible spillover into Lebanon, Qassem said: “If the assault on Syria has a very limited scope, then it’s expected that reactions from the concerned sides in Syria will be tied to the Syrian arena.”\nIran’s expanding power in Syria has caused deep alarm in Israel, which has mounted air strikes in Syria against what it describes as Hezbollah and Iranian targets.\nTehran has threatened to respond to the air strike on a Syrian military base on Monday which it blamed on Israel, as did Damascus and Moscow.\nQassem said the strike, which killed seven Iranians, was an assault “on both Syria and Iran that has consequences which I do not know the limit of now”.\nHezbollah, which last fought a major war with Israel in 2006, would not open a new front against its arch-foe from Lebanon, he said. “But the resistance is ready for surprises.”\nHezbollah does not expect Israel to launch a war for now but is prepared for one, Qassem told Reuters in an interview last month.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Laila Bassam; Editing by Tom Perry, Andrew Roche and David Stamp\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
