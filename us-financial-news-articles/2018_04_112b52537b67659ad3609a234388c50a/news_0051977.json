While the S&P 500 Household Products index has fallen more than 18 percent in this year, Colgate shares are down 12 percent. In comparison, P&G's shares are down 21 percent.\nNet income rose to $634 million, or 72 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $570 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding certain items, the company earned 74 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 72 cents.\nShares of the New York-based company fell 3.6 percent to $64.20 before the bell on Thursday, set to hit a fifteen-month low.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T23:12:52.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
