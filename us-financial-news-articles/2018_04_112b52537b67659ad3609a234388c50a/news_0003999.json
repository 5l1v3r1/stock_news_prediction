REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nThe former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a so-called “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees it a high degree of autonomy and far greater freedoms than exist on the mainland. \nBeijing, which considers the freewheeling financial hub an “inalienable” part of China, has been extremely critical of recent calls by more radical activists for greater self-determination for Hong Kong, and even outright independence. \nComments by law professor Benny Tai at a forum in Taiwan last month drew the ire of the People’s Daily, China’s mouthpiece newspaper, which urged Hong Kong authorities on Monday to take legal action against him under existing laws. \nThe Hong Kong government also condemned Tai, saying in a statement it was “shocked by the remarks made by a university teaching staff member that Hong Kong could consider becoming an independent state”. \nThe latest salvo came from the Federation of Hong Kong Shenzhen Associations, a pro-Beijing group of nearly 70 bodies, which took out full-page advertisements in several newspapers, including the pro-Beijing Ta Kung Pao. \nIn the advertisements, the federation, backed by 68 clan and patriotic groups and businesses, urged Tai’s employer, the University of Hong Kong, to fire him immediately.
