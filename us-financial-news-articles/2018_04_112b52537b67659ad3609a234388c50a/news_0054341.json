Dutch Foreign Minister Stef Blok said it was “impressive to come here one night after being inaugurated. It’s an impressive start.”\nStoltenberg said Pompeo’s visit to Brussels was “a great expression of the importance of the alliance.”\nPompeo, a former Army officer who was a Republican congressman, is regarded as a loyal supporter of Trump with hawkish views. But on Russia those views are largely shared by European allies because of Moscow’s 2014 seizure of Crimea.\nPompeo’s presence at NATO was seen as crucial as the alliance prepares for a July 11-12 summit in Brussels where NATO leaders are set to agree a new deterrent to Moscow, including a command to defend the Atlantic in the case of conflict.\nEven before his confirmation on Thursday, the former CIA director was already involved in U.S. diplomacy, although this is first meeting at NATO, an organisation founded on defence against the threat from the former Soviet Union.\nBritish Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said NATO needed to respond to what the West says is the Kremlin’s mix of not just the conventional military threat but covert and cyber warfare.\n“One of the key things we’re doing is looking again at ... how we strengthen our collective response to the kind of hybrid attacks that so many NATO allies are experiencing from Russia,” he told reporters.\nThe NATO foreign ministers meeting follows the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian agent in Britain, and Western air strikes against Russia-allied Syria, which the United States accused of a chemical attack in Douma on April 7.

Virginia Mayo/Pool via Reuters\nThe allies discussed Russia with Pompeo, focussing on the Skripal affair and Syria, and a push for NATO to find new ways to counter Russian tactics.\n“There was consensus on Russian aggression, the scale of Russian aggression and this being a problem that requires a response,” said a U.S. official present at the closed-door session, adding that decisions on the issue will be left to NATO leaders. MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY\nPompeo pressed allies to increase their military budgets to meet a target of two percent of economic output spent on defence every year by 2024, as well as ensuring 20 percent of the outlay is on equipment, a U.S. official said.\nThe issue is sensitive to Europeans because the region is recovering from a long economic crisis and defence spending is less of a priority. But the United States insists that allies, especially Germany, pay their fair share of defending Europe.\nAs he left Washington on Thursday, the State Department said Pompeo would also visit Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Israel during the weekend. He will have to quickly address a wide array of pressing international issues, including long conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, as well as Russian assertiveness.\nWashington is also working with European allies France, Germany, and Britain on toughening a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, an issue Pompeo is expected to discuss while in Brussels.\nPompeo opposed the Iran nuclear accord while in Congress.\nHe once suggested the answer to Tehran’s nuclear programme - which Iran has always said was for peaceful means only - was 2,000 bombing sorties.\nPompeo said during his confirmation he was open to fixing, rather than blowing apart, the pact, which the West believes is essential to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear bomb.

In Jerusalem, he will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and in Jordan hold talks with King Abdullah.
