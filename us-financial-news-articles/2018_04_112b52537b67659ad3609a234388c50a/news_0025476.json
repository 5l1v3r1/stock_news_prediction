The ministry of mining was set up five years ago and legislation to regulate the industry passed in 2016. The sector accounts for less than 1 percent of the country’s gross domestic product.\nLegal experts and academics said cited disputes between communities and miners across Kenya’s mineral belt - stretching from the northwest to the southern coast - largely due to people feeling aggrieved over shares of revenues and access to jobs.\nThey said Kenya’s mining legislation and constitution provided enough regulation to ensure communities were given their fair share of mining revenues as well as other benefits, but that laws need to be enforced and people empowered.\n“The problem is not the law, the problem is the lack of governance and implementation of legislation,” said Nicholas Orago from University of Nairobi’s School of Law who conducted a study on titanium mining in Kenya’s coastal region of Kwale.\n“In many cases, resources are found where in areas people are vulnerable, yet those who come to mine have both economic and political power - and this creates an unequal relationship leaving people open to exploitation.”\nReporting by Nita Bhalla @nitabhalla, Editing by Katy Migiro.
