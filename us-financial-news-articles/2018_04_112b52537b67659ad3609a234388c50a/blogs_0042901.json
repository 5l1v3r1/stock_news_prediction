Here’s essential reading on today’s developments. \nMUST READS FROM WSJ CITY \nPhoto: Getty Images \nAs oil prices have soared, hedge funds and other big investors have amassed a record number of bullish bets on crude, putting the market at risk of a swift fall if the outlook sours, analysts say. Last week, bullish bets on Brent hit the highest level since records began in 2011. But the oil market could be vulnerable to a swift reversal if the support falters. Friday was a volatile day, and oil futures fell after President Donald Trump weighed in, tweeting that oil prices were ‘artificially very high,’ and that high crude prices ‘will not be accepted.’\nAluminium from United Co Rusal , the recently-sanctioned Russian miner, is looking for a new home. But nobody knows where that home can be. Rusal produced 3.7 million tonnes of aluminium last year, but US sanctions mean that almost no Western buyer, or Washington’s allies like Japan, will touch the metal not placed on exchanges before Rusal-branded products were banned, analysts say.\nInvestors shifted their attention from geopolitical risk to fundamentals this week, leading to some sharp moves in individual stocks, but greater quiet in the wider markets. It was a standout week for commodities, with oil hitting multi-year highs and metals including aluminium soaring. That helped the commodity-firm heavy FTSE 100, which also got a late boost from falling sterling. Here’s what’s been happening in the markets this week. \nJapan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical id it had made a sweetened proposal to buy Shire, just a day after it had a bid rejected for the rival drugmaker. The proposed £47 a share offer is marginally higher than the £46.50 it offered on Thursday, but it represented a higher proportion in cash. Earlier, Dublin-headquartered Allergan said it wouldn’t bid for Shire, having previously disclosed its interest.\nWPP’s interim management is criticising analyst demands for a breakup of the world’s largest advertising group following founder Martin Sorrell’s departure. The 73-year-old’s exit as WPP chief executive last weekend, after an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct, has financial analysts performing sum-of-parts valuations for WPP’s sprawling ad empire.\nWeekend Reading: Emmanuel Macron’s lonely road to save globalism from itself, how North Korea’s hackers became dangerously good and the short version of Facebook new data policy.\nIN THE PAPERS \nDemocratic National Committee Sues Trump Campaign, Russia and WikiLeaks – WSJ \nBrexit Divorce Bill Could Surpass £39 Billion, Warns Whitehall Watchdog – The Guardian \nA Clearinghouse Gained $35 Billion Thanks to Deutsche Bank Error – Bloomberg \nBank of England’s Michael Saunders Backs Quarter-Point UK Rate Rise – WSJ \nEffort to Break Italian Impasse Continues to Falter – Politico \nMARKETS TODAY \nUS stocks struggled for traction on Friday, but remained on course for weekly gains, supported by a mostly upbeat earnings season that has helped restore investors’ confidence.\nShares of General Electric jumped 4%, giving the Dow a boost, after the company said it was making progress on its cost-cutting efforts and reaffirmed its 2018 financial target. The Nasdaq Composite was more than 1% lower, weighed down by Apple, which dropped more than 3% after Morgan Stanley cut its estimate for the company’s iPhone sales.\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 closed flat, while London’s FTSE 100 was up 0.5%, helped by a fall in sterling. The pound slid 0.4% against the dollar after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney dampened down expectations of a rate rise in May.\nShire was among the biggest fallers on the UK benchmark, shedding 3.9% after hope of a takeover battle fell when rival Allergan said it would not pursue a bid and Takeda Pharmaceuticals marginally increased its original offer.\nPresident Donald Trump dented oil prices by tweeting that they were artificially very high.\nShare this: WSJ City Previous Do Index Funds Cost 100 Times As Much As You Think?
