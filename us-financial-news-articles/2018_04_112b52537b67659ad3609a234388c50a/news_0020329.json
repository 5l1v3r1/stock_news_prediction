Its investment banking arm, for example, saw $2.14 billion in net revenues for the fourth quarter and $7.37 billion for the year, its second best ever. \nThese fundamental changes will likely buoy the company's shares, added Bolu, whose $300 price target implies nearly 19 percent upside over the next 12 months. The Dow Jones industrial average component is outperforming the market so far this year, down 1 percent versus the S&P 500's 2.2 percent decline since January. \nShares of Goldman rose 2 percent Tuesday. \nLast month, Goldman named David Solomon as president and chief operating officer at Goldman, putting him in line to succeed Lloyd Blankfein. Solomon's background is in investment banking. \n\"Fast growing 'strategic growth' businesses – Investment Banking, Investment Management and Lending – have overtaken Trading as the dominant driver of firm revenues,\" Bolu wrote. \"A revamped management team refocused on growth has laid out a credible growth plan underpinned by Goldman's expertise in engineering.\" \nGoldman Sachs is set to report first-quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell. Bernstein expects net revenues of $9.22 billion and diluted earnings per share of $5.75, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations as reported by FactSet.
