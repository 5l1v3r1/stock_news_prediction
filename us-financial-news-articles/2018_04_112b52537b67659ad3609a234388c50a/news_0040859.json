REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo The European Commission’s decision could come as early as next week, with the timing subject to change, the source said.\nThe sanction by the EU competition enforcer is expected to send a warning to companies that fail to respect procedural rules, such as jumping the gun and taking control of their targets or giving incorrect data before gaining the regulatory go-ahead.\nFacebook was fined 110 million euros last year for giving misleading information during a vetting of its deal to acquire messaging service WhatsApp in 2014.\nThe Commission, which accused Altice of the violation in May last year, can impose fines up to 10 percent of a company’s global turnover for breaching EU rules. The company posted 23.43 billion euros in revenues last year.\nBoth the Commission and Altice, which is controlled by billionaire founder Patrick Drahi, declined to comment.\nFrance’ s competition regulator imposed an 80 million euro fine on Altice two years ago for engaging in plans to buy SFR and Virgin Mobile before getting the necessary clearance.\nThe Commission last year also charged Merck ( MRCG.DE ) and Sigma-Aldrich, General Electric ( GE.N ), and Canon ( 7751.T ) with breaching EU procedural rules in their respective merger deals. Rulings are expected in the coming months.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee, additional reporting by Mathieu Rosemain in Paris; Editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:43:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
