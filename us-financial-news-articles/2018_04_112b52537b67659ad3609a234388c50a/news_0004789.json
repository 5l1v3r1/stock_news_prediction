REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo The trade tensions brewing between the top two world economies hit stock markets, with shares of industrial companies with exposure to Chinese markets such as Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc among the hardest hit.\nFollowing are some of the possible winners and losers among U.S. companies and sectors.\nCAR COMPANIES * U.S. auto maker General Motors Co urged the two countries to engage in constructive dialogue over trade. The company’s stock fell as much as 3 percent before reversing course to trade slightly higher.\n* GM rival Ford Motor Co lost as much as 3 percent while electric carmaker Tesla Inc, which depends on China for 17 percent of its revenue, dropped 2.5 percent. Shares of Fiat Chrysler fell as much as 3.4 percent before recovering.\nFILE PHOTO: Boeing's logo is seen during the Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo, Japan, October 12, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo * Ford said it encouraged both governments to work together to resolve issues.\nBOEING * Aircraft maker Boeing Co was last down 2.5 percent, weighing the most on the Dow Jones Industrial Average as documents from China’s Ministry of Commerce and the U.S. manufacturer showed the move would affect some older Boeing narrowbody models. It was not immediately clear how much the tariffs would impact its newer aircraft.\nBoeing said it was assessing the situation while analysts from JP Morgan said the proposals from China looked to have been calibrated carefully to avoid a major impact on the planemaker.\nFILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton TECH MAJORS * The S&P 500 technology sector, which has the biggest revenue exposure to China among the benchmark’s 11 major sectors, dipped 0.5 percent.\n* Worst hit in the sector were chip stocks Intel Corp, Nvidia Corp and Broadcom Ltd. China’s position as an assembly hub for electronic devices makes it the biggest consumer of semiconductors.\nSOYBEANS AND WHISKEY * Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman Corp slipped about 1 percent before recovering after whiskey was singled out as the only spirit on which China planned to impose more tariffs.\n* U.S. meat processor Tyson Foods Inc, meat exporter Hormel Foods Corp and Sanderson Farms Inc all rose on the prospect of a drop in prices of feedstock soybean following higher Chinese tariffs on U.S. exports.\n* DowDuPont Inc said its agriculture unit could be affected by the escalating conflict, warning of price declines for soybeans, and a negative impact on U.S. farmers.\n* Grain traders Archer Daniels Midlands Co and Bunge Ltd, which trade U.S. soybeans in China, were both off 1.5 percent.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T21:27:38.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
