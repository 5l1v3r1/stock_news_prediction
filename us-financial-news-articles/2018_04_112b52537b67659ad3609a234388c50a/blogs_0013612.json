Luckily that pared off.\" \nHad it come to fruition, Cashin said, stocks \"would have closed in a very ugly fashion, probably on the lows of the day.\" \nFears of a potential trade war weighed on the market as the conflict between the U.S . and China appeared to escalate. After China announced new tariffs on 106 U.S. products Wednesday, President Donald Trump threatened $100 billion in additional tariffs against China . \nChina's Commerce Ministry said Friday the country will not hesitate to react with a \" major response \" to the new U.S. tariffs. \n\"You're getting a heightened degree of nervousness, not full panic quite yet,\" Cashin said. \nHe expects the market to be \"jumpy\" for several days because \"both sides want to declare victory.\" \nChina President Xi Jinping \"wants to say he's protecting the Chinese people from the trading aggression of the United States and Mr. Trump wants to say very much the same thing on the other side,\" Cashin said. \nHowever, he said there may be some \"big help\" early next week when Xi is expected to give a big speech. Everyone will be watching to see if he wades into the trade issue and where things may go from there, Cashin said. \nâ€” CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.
