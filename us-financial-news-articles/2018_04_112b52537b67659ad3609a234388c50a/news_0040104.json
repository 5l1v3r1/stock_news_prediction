It did not mention the reason for increasing its stake.\nThe disclosure came nearly three months after Reuters reported that another activist investor, Sachem Head, wanted Whitbread’s management to examine a breakup as a way to boost the value of its individual businesses. The Sachem Head hedge fund holds a 3.38 percent stake in Whitbread, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data.\nInvestors and analysts have long raised the idea that Whitbread should spin off its popular Costa coffee-shop chain.\nThe company has become more streamlined in the past few years, selling off its brewing business and some pubs to focus mainly on Premier Inn, Costa, the Beefeater restaurant brand and the Brewers Fayre pub restaurant chain.\nWhitbread declined to comment on Elliott’s disclosure. The company’s shares are down nearly 5 percent in the past 12 months.\nReporting by Sangameswaran S in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T02:46:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
