The crackdown will continue this week.”\nHe said police were trying to ascertain the number of children working in this sector while the parents of the rescued youngsters were being contacted and the children sent home.\nSo far the police have arrested about 25 people, mainly employers and traffickers.\nWith about 700 firms, Rajkot is one of the biggest imitation jewelery hubs in India with annual turnover estimated at about $8 billion.\nBracelets, earrings and other trinkets made in Rajkot are exported to Britain, Germany, the United States, Pakistan and the Middle East, according to Narendra Mehta, president of the Rajkot Imitation Jewelery Association.\nMehta said most of the work was based in homes and done by women who were paid by the number of pieces they worked on and earned between 5,000 to 7,000 rupees ($75 to $100) a month.\nHe said he had not been not been aware of children working in this sector as it was impossible to visit each household involved but the association will now start visiting manufacturing units.\n“This is the first such crackdown and we called a meeting and announced that small children should not be employed,” Mehta told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nReporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
