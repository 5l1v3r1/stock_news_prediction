I can foresee some consolidation in the sector,” Bussemaker said.\nBad debts as a proportion of total bank loans rose to nearly 12 percent in December, central bank data showed.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged the government to tackle bad loans to reduce financial sector vulnerabilities and revive credit growth.\nFive Tanzanian banks had their licences revoked in January due to under-capitalisation.\nTanzanian President John Magufuli said last month his government will not bail out struggling banks and that it was better to have a few viable banks than dozens of struggling ones.\nNMB posted a 37 percent decline in profits after tax in 2017. Bussemaker attributed this almost entirely to a much larger provision for loan losses, of 131 billion shillings compared with 31 billion the previous year.\nShe said the government’s decision to fire almost 10,000 civil servants in 2017, some of whom had “unsecured personal facilities with NMB” and a declining economic environment contributed to the rise in bad loans.\nMagufuli took office in 2015 pledging to reform an economy hobbled by red tape and corruption and boost infrastructure.\nThe president, nicknamed “the Bulldozer”, is criticised by investors for what they see as arbitrary new policies and regulations that have slowed foreign direct investment.\nThe IMF says that although the government’s official data shows strong macroeconomic performance, other data “suggests much weaker economic activity”. The government said this month that Tanzania’s economy grew by around 7.1 percent last year.\n($1 = 2,261.0000 Tanzanian shillings)\nReporting by Omar Mohammed Editing by Maggie Fick and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:45:48.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
