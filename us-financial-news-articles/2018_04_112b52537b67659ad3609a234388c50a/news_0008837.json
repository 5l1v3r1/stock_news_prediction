After documenting numerous examples of abuse, Buzzfeed declared it \"no longer a helpful place to follow breaking news.\" \nPeople on 4chan coordinated to highlight false suspects. \nSomeone hacked and posted from the account of a YouTube employee who was on the scene. \nRegular people spread unconfirmed reports. \nIn a blog post titled Serving the Public Conversation During Breaking Events , Twitter says that in the past few months it has gotten better and faster at responding to these issues, but that it never wants to be an \"arbiter of truth.\" \nWhen it sees accounts \"deliberately sharing deceptive, malicious information\" it can suspend them or delete tweets based on policies it has on abusive behavior, hateful conduct, violent threats, and against spam. After Buzzfeed posted its painstaking documentation of hoaxes, many of the accounts and tweets were in fact deleted . \nThe company highlighted that it also tried to mitigate the problem by creating a Twitter \"Moment\" of trusted content within 10 minutes of the first tweets. In the future, it said it would continue to try to improve its technology to catch bad actors, find automated accounts, and more quickly employ human review. \nProviding more human content moderation alongside algorithmic flagging has become one of the main solutions touted by Facebook and YouTube, too, which have also become hotbeds for spreading false information after tragedies . \n\"This work is ongoing,\" the company writes. \"We are continuing to explore and invest in what more we can do with our technology, enforcement options, and policies â€“ not just in the U.S., but to everyone we serve around the world.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T02:33:41.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
