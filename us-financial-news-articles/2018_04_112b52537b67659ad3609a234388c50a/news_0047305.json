Before the ban, Lisu hunters traditionally went for larger game such as bears and wild boar.\nLisu technically must have a crossbow licence, which are regulated by district crossbow associations.\nAs more young people move to urban areas for work, Cha Hairong, head of the Liuku Township Crossbow Association of Lushui city, fears the crossbow is dying out.

REUTERS/Aly Song\nCha wants to preserve the tradition by promoting crossbow shooting as a sport and attract new enthusiasts far beyond the Nu River Valley.\n“Our people’s crossbow culture must enter the National Games of China. It must enter the Asian Games. It must enter the Olympic Games! So that people all over world will understand our people’s culture,” said Cha.\nThe Lushui government has said it is committed to the preservation of the crossbow culture.\nCrossbow tournaments offering cash prizes have been held in recent years in a bid to boost interest in the sport.
