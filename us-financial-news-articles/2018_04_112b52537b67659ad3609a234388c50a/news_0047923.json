Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nFirst-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion. \nJefferies analyst Michael Yee said the results marked “a good quarter and a good start to the year” for Amgen, while noting that expectations for large-cap biotechnology companies were low after weak performance so far this year as investors see a lack of meaningful catalysts to boost shares. \nAmgen’s sales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion. Sales of Repatha more than doubled to $123 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $104 million. \nFor the full year, Amgen said it now expected adjusted EPS of $12.80 to $13.70, compared with $12.60 to $13.70 previously. It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion. \nAmgen looks forward “to further expanding our new product portfolio with the expected U.S. launch of Aimovig (erenumab), our first-in-class migraine prevention therapy, in the second quarter and the European launch of Amgevita (biosimilar adalimumab) ... later this year,” Chief Executive Officer Robert Bradway said in a statement.
