The Nasdaq-listed stock, which closed at $36.84 on Friday, was trading at $11.15 in early dealings on Monday. \nWoodford acknowledged the trial result was “undoubtedly a blow” but insisted Prothena had options. \n“Prothena still has an early and mid-stage clinical pipeline. It has a technology platform and a world-leading specialism in misfolding proteins, which are implicated in a number of different neurological disorders,” he said. \nDublin-based Prothena, which was spun out of Irish drugmaker Elan in 2012, specialises in developing immune system-based drugs to fight progressive diseases. \nNEOD001, its lead product, is an antibody drug for AL amyloidosis, a serious condition caused by a build-up of an abnormal protein called amyloid that impairs proper tissue function. It can lead to heart, kidney and other organ failure. \nThere is currently no cure and NEOD001 had been granted orphan drug designation by both the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. \nHowever, hedge funds Kerrisdale Capital and Muddy Waters had both targeted the company by taking short positions in its stock in the belief that the drug would not work. \nHolding a such short positions means hedge funds will now profit from the share fall.
