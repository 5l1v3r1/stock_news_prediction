The newspaper's coverage won the Pulitzer 's investigative reporting award.\nMoscow refers to Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, which was the subject of numerous reports in the Post and The New York Times, which shared the Pulitzer for national reporting.\nTweet \nTrump has repeatedly attacked Bezos and the two companies he owns, Amazon and the Post, accusing them of dodging taxes or publishing \"fake news,\" among other things.\nBezos has largely remained silent in response to Trump's many attacks.
