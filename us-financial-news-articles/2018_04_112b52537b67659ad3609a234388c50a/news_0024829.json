Previously, Nestle had also made an approach, he added.\nJAB Holdings and Nestle declined to comment.\nLavazza posted revenue of 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) last year. JAB and Nestle do not break out their coffee-related revenue but are much bigger competitors. Nestle owns coffee pods specialist Nespresso and JAB has the Jacobs Douwe Egberts brand.\n“We have always attracted suitors,” Giuseppe Lavazza said.\nHis co-vice president, Marco Lavazza, added: “Being courted is something that pleases us and we talk with everyone ... but we are clear in mind we want to be independent.”\nNestle, JAB and coffee chain Starbucks are the three largest players in the global coffee market, followed by several mid-tier players including Lavazza.\n“We think we can reduce the risk of being cornered by increasing our sales to around 2.2 billion euros by 2020, we are nearly there,” Giuseppe Lavazza said, adding that the group was big enough to defend itself from rivals.\nThe group, which ended 2017 with 460 million euros in cash, could fund more acquisitions with internal funds and through a potential bond issuance, Giuseppe Lavazza said.\n“The valuations (for coffee companies) have increased a lot so you have to look carefully at what you want to buy,” he said, adding that he expected a recent acquisition spree in the sector to slow down in the future.\nThe two vice-presidents reiterated that an initial public offering was not on the table at the moment.\n$1 = 0.8118 euros Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T00:24:48.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
