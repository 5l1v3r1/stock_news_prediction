Arcade Fire? Imagine Dragons? Lady Antebellum? Those aren’t cheap shows, either.\nThis week, though, if you’ve got a little luck on your side, you can catch these and dozens of other big musical acts (along with magicians, comedians, and even politicians) for just $20. Live Nation has kicked off National Concert Week , from April 30 through May 8, offering severely reduced tickets to select shows this summer.\nThe list of artists is extensive and are often top draws (though, in fairness, none of 2017’s top-grossing acts are participating in National Concert Week). Maroon 5, for instance, grossed more than $71 million in 2015. Comedian Kevin Hart had the top-grossing comedy tour of all time that same year.\nWhile there are plenty of smaller artists taking part in the promotion, here are some of the biggest acts (and one former vice president) offering discount tickets. If you’re interested, though, act fast—as supplies are sure to be limited.\n311 / The Offspring 3 Doors Down / Collective Soul Alan Jackson Arcade Fire Avenged Sevenfold / Prophets of Rage Backstreet Boys Beck Bon Jovi Brad Paisley Breaking Benjamin / Five Finger Death Punch Bush / Stone Temple Pilots / The Cult Charlie Puth Chicago / REO Speedwagon Chris Brown Counting Crows / Live David Blaine Dead & Company Def Leppard / Journey Dierks Bentley Dwight Yoakam / Lucinda Williams / Steve Earle Erasure Foreigner / Whitesnake / Jason Bonham’s Led Zeppelin Evening G-Eazy Godsmack / Shinedown Gov’t Mule / The Avett Brothers Hall & Oates / Train Halsey Imagine Dragons Janet Jackson Jason Aldean Jeff Beck / Paul Rodgers Joe Biden Juanes / Mon Laferte Keith Urban Kesha / Macklemore Kevin Hart Kid Rock Kidz Bop Live Kygo Lady Antebellum / Darius Rucker Logic Luis Miguel Luke Bryan Lynyrd Skynyrd Maroon 5 Miranda Lambert / Little Big Town Needtobreathe / Johnnyswim Niall Horan Odesza Ozzy Osbourne Paramore Pentatonix Poison / Cheap Trick Post Malone Rascal Flatts Ray LaMontagne Rise Against / AFI Rob Zombie / Marilyn Manson Rod Stewart / Cyndi Lauper Shakira Shania Twain Steely Dan / The Doobie Brothers Styx / Joan Jett and the Heartbreakers The Smashing Pumpkins Thirty Seconds To Mars Vans Warped Tour Weezer / Pixies Zac Brown Band", "external_links": ["https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2017/12/2017YearEndTop20WorldwideTours_619.pdf", "https://ncw.livenation.com/", "https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/6494723/kevin-hart-biggest-comedy-tour-ever-what-now"], "published": "2018-04-30T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T18:44:40.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
