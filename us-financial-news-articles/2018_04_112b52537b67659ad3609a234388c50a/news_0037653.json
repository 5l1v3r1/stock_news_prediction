Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Athletic Bilbao - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - April 18, 2018 Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo in action REUTERS/Susana Vera \nThe Portuguese forward flicked Luka Modric’s low drive into the back of the net in the 87th minute with a deft touch, his 24th league goal of the season cancelling out a first-half chipped goal from Inaki Williams for the visitors. \nReal were set for defeat until Ronaldo, who also hit the bar with a header early on, struck with his 24th league goal of the season to snatch the draw that left them third on 68 points after 33 games. \nThey are three points behind cross-city rivals Atletico, who play their game in hand at Real Sociedad on Thursday. Barcelona lead the way on 83 points, 12 clear of Atletico.

We played well, above all in the first half,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane said. \nRaul Garcia wasted an excellent chance to double Bilbao’s lead before Ronaldo’s goal, striking the crossbar with Keylor Navas out of position after a scramble in the box.

We have a week to work on that, we’re doing well. We’re confident and we are playing well,” Real winger Lucas Vazquez said. \nEarlier on Wednesday, fourth-placed Valencia lost 2-1 at home to Getafe and had Dani Parejo sent off for an elbow on Jorge Molina. \nThe defeat left Valencia three points behind Real Madrid.
