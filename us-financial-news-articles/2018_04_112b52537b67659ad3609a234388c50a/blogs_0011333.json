He did not elaborate.\nTaiwan is one of China’s most sensitive issues. The island is claimed by Beijing as its sacred territory, part of “one China”, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring under Chinese control what it considers to be a wayward province.\nThe U.S. State Department over the weekend declined to confirm the details of the Taiwan news report.\nA State Department official had said the agency continued to review Taiwan’s defense needs and referred questions about specific procurement plans to Taiwanese authorities.\nChina’s hostility to Taiwan has grown since Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party was elected Taiwanese president in 2016. China fears she wants to push for formal independence, though Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and is committed to peace.\nReporting by Michael Martina\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T15:48:25.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
