For some reason this has not yet been decided,” Trappier said. \nHe said the Franco-German cooperation was different, with it being for a larger system for a manned fighter, whereas the Franco-British project was for an unmanned aircraft. \nThe two companies have not yet announced who will lead the partnership for the Franco-German FCAS. Trappier said they would each decide who had the best skills and competencies to lead each part of the system. \n“The role on both sides is to find the right compromises. If we play egos we will end up with a project that won’t be successful,” Hoke said. \nAirbus and Dassault said it was important for France and Germany to launch an initial joint study this year so they could get demonstrators done for 2025. \nThe fighter aircraft will replace the current generation of Eurofighter and Rafale aircraft. \nTrappier said it would not be a copy of the U.S. F-35 fighter, but would be more ambitious. \nHoke said if Germany decided to buy the F-35 to replace its Tornados, that would mean the FCAS would no longer be feasible.
