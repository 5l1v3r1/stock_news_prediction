We demand that Poland is responsible for the completeness of research into the Holocaust,” he said. \nDuda said Poland’s intention was not to restrict Holocaust remembrance. \n“On the contrary, we want to defend historical truth ... including those elements that are difficult for the Poles,” he said. “But there was never a systemic enmity towards the Jews.” \nMore than 3 million of Poland’s 3.2 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of the Jews killed in the Holocaust. Jews from across Europe were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by the Germans on Polish soil, including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel \nAccording to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians. \nThousands of Poles risked their lives to protect their Jewish neighbours; Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust centre recognises 6,706 Poles as “righteous among nations” for bravery in resisting the Holocaust, more than any other nationality. \nBut in recent years research showed thousands of Poles participated in the Nazi atrocities, a challenge to the national narrative that the country was solely a victim. \nGovernment critics accuse the PiS of politicising World War Two to build a nationalist sense of grievance among Poles. \nAlongside the presidents at the annual “March of the Living”, many people waved or were draped in the Israeli flag. \n“I was 13 years old when they took us all in, in 1944,” said Zoltan Matyah, 87, a Jewish Russian survivor of the camp where 1.5 million people, mostly Jews, were killed. Matyah’s mother, four sisters and a brother perished in Auschwitz.
