Rehn belongs to Prime Minister Juha Sipila’s Centre Party.\nNine other people, all of them men, applied for the governor post. Rehn has declined to comment before final appointment.\nRehn will succeed Erkki Liikanen, 67, who will complete his second and final seven-year term in July. Major policy changes are not expected.\nAnalysts said Finland was seen as a moderately hawkish euro member that largely backed ECB President Mario Draghi, while the central bank’s analysis was well regarded at the ECB.\n“Rehn is not filling any small shoes here, Liikanen has made an impact at the ECB,” said economist Pasi Kuoppamaki from Danske Bank.\nLiikanen has been speculated upon as a possible compromise candidate from a northern country to succeed Draghi in 2019.
