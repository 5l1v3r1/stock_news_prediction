It’s too early to commit to targets without knowing what the effect is on the supply chain.”\nMTU has made a good start to the year, Winkler added, although said it was too early in the year to make changes to its annual guidance.\nMTU is due to report first-quarter results on May 3.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:15:00.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
