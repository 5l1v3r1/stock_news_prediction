Businesses are looking to adopt similar strategies in all areas of the enterprise that enable them to achieve those same benefits. Extreme Networks, Inc. (Nasdaq: EXTR) today introduced Extreme Capital Solutions, dedicated to providing competitive and flexible financing to customers, partners and prospects looking to acquire Extreme Networks' solutions. Extreme Capital Solutions is the combination of Extreme's CPEaaS (CPE As a Service) offerings with the Brocade Network Subscriptions business that recently became part of Extreme. The combined offering includes subscription, capital leasing and usage business models that provide flexibility for our partners and customers.\nDesigned to support partner demand, the new offering provides several financing solutions under one umbrella, including leasing, 0% interest financing and Extreme Network Subscription, an industry-leading acquisition model giving customers the ability to acquire network infrastructure without the upfront capital investment. With Extreme Capital Solutions, customers are able to invest in Extreme's technologies, solutions and services by bundling hardware, software, maintenance and training costs into one, manageable financing plan. The result enables Extreme to sell more solutions, generating net new revenue and gross margin, while enhancing and expanding relationships with customers to help them better respond to competitive business pressures in today's market.\nExtreme Capital Solutions professionals work alongside Extreme's sales teams and partners to offer customers flexible financing options to acquire Extreme Networks' technologies. Customers may access Extreme Capital Solutions directly from Extreme Networks and through Extreme's global partner network including system integrators, value-added resellers, direct market resellers and distribution partners.\nKey Features:\nExtreme Network Subscription: This subscription model allows organizations to refresh their network infrastructure or adjust capacity without needing to purchase equipment, eliminating fixed term commitments and enabling customers to continue investing in scaling their businesses instead of their network infrastructure. Through this model, Extreme customers are able to reevaluate their subscription with 60 days' notice, giving the customer additional flexibility. Customized Lease Programs : Personalized lease programs enable organizations to acquire the equipment they need today while spreading the payments over several fiscal budgets, giving organizations greater flexibility to upgrade and continue to meet increasing performance and availability requirements with little cost upfront. Total Solution Financing: With Total Solution Financing, organizations can fund Extreme Networks hardware, software, services and associated third-party equipment and services, making it possible for these organizations to fund these acquisitions and still retain their cash reserves. Compensation Plans Available Through Resellers: Extreme is offering two compensation plans available through approved Extreme partners, including a VAR-enabled managed service provider model and a traditional resale model. Technical Support Options: Extreme Capital Solutions can offer financing across all Extreme Networks Service Level Agreements (SLA), giving organizations the personalized and proactive support needed for large networking environments.\nExecutive Perspectives\nEd Meyercord, Chief Executive Officer, Extreme Networks, Inc.\n\"Today's announcement represents another milestone for Extreme Networks following the close of its acquisition of Brocade's SRA business.
