The Company's lead product candidate, SGT-001, is a gene transfer under development to restore functional dystrophin protein expression in patients' muscles. The Company's therapy uses adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver the transgene into the patient.\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Solid Biosciences' lead drug candidate SGT-001 had a high likelihood of causing adverse events in patients; (ii) Solid Biosciences misled investors regarding the toxicity of SGT-001; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Solid Biosciences' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn January 30, 2018, a report entitled \"Severe Toxicity in Nonhuman Primates and Piglets Following High-Dose Intravenous Administration of an Adeno-Associated Virus Vector Expressing Human SMN,\" was published by prominent scientists, including researcher James Wilson (\"Wilson\"). The report revealed safety concerns linked to high doses of gene therapies using an adeno-associated virus (AAV). Wilson resigned from the scientific advisory board at Solid Biosciences shortly before the Company's IPO, citing \"emerging concerns about the possible risks of high systemic dosing of AVV.\"\nOn this news, Solid Biosciences' share price fell $1.20, or 5.06%, to close at $22.50 per share on January 30, 2018.\nOn March 14, 2018, post-market, Solid Biosciences issued a press release entitled \"Solid Biosciences Announces Clinical Hold On SGT-001 Phase I/II Clinical Trial for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,\" announcing that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has placed a clinical hold on Solid's study of SGT-001, a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, after a patient experienced an unexpected adverse reaction.\nOn this news, Solid Biosciences' share price fell $16.99, or 64.57%, to close at $9.32 on March 15, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation.
