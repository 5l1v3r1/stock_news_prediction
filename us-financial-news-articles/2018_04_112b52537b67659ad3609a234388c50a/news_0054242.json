(NYSE:TRN) today announced earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, including the following highlights:\nEarnings per common diluted share of $0.26 compared to $0.30 per share in 2017 Earnings per share includes $7.9 million, or $0.04 per share, of transaction costs incurred related to the planned spin-off transaction, resulting in adjusted earnings per common diluted share of $0.30 Railcar deliveries and orders totaling 5,725 and 4,705 railcars, respectively, in the Rail Group, compared to 3,770 and 970 railcars, respectively, in 2017 Inland Barge Group receives orders with a value of $57.1 million Repurchases of common stock totaling $50.0 million under the current authorization Issues notice to call $449.4 million convertible subordinated notes on June 1, 2018 Anticipates full year 2018 earnings per common diluted share of between $1.20 and $1.40, excluding spin-off related transaction costs of approximately $30 to $35 million, compared to previous earnings guidance of between $1.15 and $1.35 per share, excluding spin-off related transaction costs of approximately $25 million\nConsolidated Results\nTrinity Industries, Inc. reported net income attributable to Trinity stockholders of $40.2 million, or $0.26 per common diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Net income for the same quarter of 2017 was $46.0 million, or $0.30 per common diluted share. Revenues for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $831.3 million compared to revenues of $877.3 million for the same quarter of 2017. In the first quarter, the Company incurred approximately $7.9 million of transaction costs, or $0.04 per share, related to the expected spin-off transaction. First quarter 2018 results benefitted from a lower effective tax rate of 26.2% due primarily to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (“the Act”) compared to 28.7% in the same quarter of 2017 which benefitted from the settlement of certain tax audits. For the full year 2018, the Company continues to expect a 24.0% effective tax rate compared to 36.2% in full year 2017, excluding the positive one-time impact from the Act in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“We are off to a good start in 2018, in what will be a transformational year for our Company,” said Timothy R. Wallace, Trinity’s Chairman, CEO and President. “Our financial performance for the first quarter reflects varying conditions across our businesses. We achieved year-over-year increases in operating profit for the Rail and Construction Products Groups. Our railcar and inland barge manufacturing businesses received a moderate level of orders during the quarter, a positive outcome in what continues to be challenging, but improving, market conditions.”\nMr. Wallace added, “I continue to be pleased with the progress we are making on our planned spin-off of our infrastructure-related businesses to Trinity’s stockholders, and we remain on track for an expected transaction close in the fourth quarter of this year.”\nQuarterly Business Group Results\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Rail Group reported revenues of $598.5 million compared to revenues of $478.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating profit and profit margin for the Rail Group were $58.9 million and 9.8% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $50.5 million and 10.6% in the first quarter of 2017. The increases in revenues and operating profit were primarily due to higher railcar deliveries. The Rail Group delivered 5,725 railcars and received orders for 4,705 railcars during the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3,770 and 970 railcars, respectively, in the same quarter last year. The railcar backlog in the Rail Group was $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2018, representing 21,365 railcars, compared to a railcar backlog of $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2017, representing 22,585 railcars.\nThe Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group (“Leasing Group”) reported revenues and operating profit of $174.6 million and $71.1 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 2.4% and 16.4%, respectively, compared to the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower average lease rates and utilization partially offset by additions to the lease fleet. There were no revenues from sales of railcars owned one year or less reported in either period. The decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of lower revenues and higher fleet maintenance and compliance expenses partially offset by $2.1 million of profit from railcar sales owned for more than one year that are not included in revenues.\nTotal proceeds from the sale of leased railcars owned for more than one year were $15.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to no sales of leased railcars in the first quarter of 2017. Supplemental information for the Leasing Group is provided in the accompanying tables.\nThe Inland Barge Group reported revenues of $30.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenues of $62.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss for this Group was $0.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a profit of $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decreases in revenues and operating profit compared to the same quarter last year were primarily due to significantly lower barge deliveries. The Inland Barge Group received orders of $57.1 million during the quarter and, as of March 31, 2018, had a backlog of $124.5 million compared to a backlog of $98.2 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Energy Equipment Group reported revenues of $226.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenues of $255.4 million in the same quarter of 2017. Operating profit and profit margin for this Group were $21.3 million and 9.4% compared to $29.6 million and 11.6% in the same quarter last year. A decrease in volumes in the Group's structural wind towers product line was partially offset by improved pricing and increased volumes in the Group's utility structures product line. Additionally, the required adoption of new revenue accounting rules as of January 1, 2018 resulted in a decrease in the Group's revenues and operating profit in the first quarter of $18.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively. Prior periods were not required to be adjusted for the new rules. Also, in accordance with the new revenue rules, we are now reporting combined backlog for wind towers and utility structures, which represents open contracts at the end of the period that are either non-cancellable or contain penalties for termination. The backlog for wind towers and utility structures as of March 31, 2018 was $809.7 million compared to a backlog of $924.8 million as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Construction Products Group reported revenues of $125.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenues of $123.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating profit and profit margin were $19.4 million and 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $15.5 million and 12.6% in the same quarter last year. The increases in revenues compared to the same quarter last year were primarily due to higher volumes in our construction aggregates business and other businesses, partially offset by lower volumes in our highway products business. The increase in revenues from other businesses was primarily a result of our trench shoring products acquisition in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in operating profit compared to the same quarter last year was related to volumes discussed, in addition to lower operating costs and $1.5 million in insurance proceeds related to a previously disclosed equipment failure at one of our highway products plants.\nShare Repurchase\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 1,519,503 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $50.0 million, leaving $450 million remaining under its current authorization through December 31, 2019.\nProposed Spin-off\nOn December 12, 2017, the Company announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved a plan to pursue a spin-off of the Company's infrastructure-related businesses to Trinity stockholders. The separation is planned as a tax-free spin-off transaction to the Company's stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The transaction is expected to result in two separate public companies: (1) Trinity, the currently existing company which will be comprised primarily of Trinity’s rail-related businesses and (2) a new infrastructure company focused on infrastructure-related products and services.\nCompletion of the spin-off will be subject to, among other things, the effectiveness of appropriate filings Commission, final approval from the Company's Board of Directors, and other customary conditions. The Company may, at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the separation or modify or change its terms. The separation is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018, but there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the separation or that the separation will ultimately occur.\nCompany's $449.4 million Convertible Subordinated Notes\nPursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Notes, the Notes are callable by the Company, in whole or part, beginning June 1, 2018. On April 23, 2018, the Company gave notice of its election to redeem all of the Notes on June 1, 2018 for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the Company notified the trustee that the Notes became convertible as a result of its election to redeem the Notes. As a result, holders may convert their Notes at any time until May 30, 2018. The current conversion price of the Notes is $24.13 per share as of April 13, 2018. Upon conversion, the Company will deliver to the holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of Notes being converted a “settlement amount,” as defined in the Indenture governing the Notes, equal to the sum of the daily settlement amounts for each of the 20 consecutive trading days of the cash settlement averaging period. Although the Company has the option to make the conversion payment in cash and shares of the Company's common stock (or cash in lieu of some or all of the shares of common stock), the Company intends to make the entire conversion payment with respect to all Notes converted solely in cash. The Company currently expects to fund the redemption and conversion payments through a combination of cash on hand and the proceeds from one or more debt financing transactions by the Company on a non-recourse basis.\nEarnings Guidance for 2018\nThe 2018 earnings guidance reflects consolidated results for the Company and has not been adjusted to incorporate the completion of a potential spin-off transaction.\nThe Company expects full year 2018 earnings per common diluted share of between $0.95 and $1.20, including spin-off related transaction costs of approximately $30 to $35 million, compared to its previous earnings guidance of between $1.00 and $1.20 per share, including spin-off related transaction costs of approximately $25 million. Excluding transaction costs, the Company anticipates full year 2018 earnings per common diluted share of between $1.20 and $1.40 compared to its previous guidance of between $1.15 and $1.35 per share. Refer to the 2018 Full Year Guidance and Outlook table for further information regarding the spin-off related transaction costs and other supplemental guidance details.\nActual results in 2018 may differ from present expectations and could be impacted by a number of factors including, among others, the risk factors disclosed in \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward-Looking Statements\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year.\nConference Call\nTrinity will hold a conference call at 11:00 a.m. Eastern on April 26, 2018 to discuss its first quarter results.

The unvested restricted shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the purposes of determining earnings per share. The two-class method results in a lower earnings per share than is calculated from the face of the income statement. See Earnings Per Share Calculation table below.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. In December 2017, we recorded a tax benefit after the initial assessment of the tax effects of the Act, and we will continue refining this amount throughout 2018. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we adjusted our initial assessment of the tax effects of the Act to record an additional benefit related to the transition tax. We are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of our deferred tax balance or give rise to new deferred tax amounts in future periods of 2018. The impact of the Act may differ from our estimate due to changes in the regulations, rulings, guidance, and interpretations issued by the IRS and the FASB as well as interpretations and assumptions made by the Company. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized an additional provisional net benefit of $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, which is included as a component of income tax expense.\nTrinity Industries, Inc.

Amortization of deferred profit on railcars sold from the Rail Group to the Leasing Group is included in the operating profit of the Leasing Group resulting in the recognition of depreciation expense based on the Company's original manufacturing cost of the railcars.

EBITDA is not a calculation based on generally accepted accounting principles. The amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are, however, derived from amounts included in the historical consolidated statements of operations data. In addition, EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity. We believe EBITDA assists investors in comparing a company’s performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation and amortization, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. However, the EBITDA measure presented in this press release may not always be comparable to similarly titled measures by other companies due to differences in the components of the calculation.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 41.6 $ 51.7 Add: Interest expense 46.3 45.0 Provision (benefit) for income taxes 14.8 20.8 Depreciation and amortization expense 75.3 72.8 Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense $ 178.0 $ 190.3 Trinity Industries, Inc. 2018 Full Year Guidance and Outlook (unaudited)\nTotal Company: Total earnings per share (1) $0.95 - $1.20 per share Earnings per share, excluding spin-off transaction costs (1) $1.20 - $1.40 per share Corporate expense, excluding spin-off transaction costs $130 - $150 million Spin-off transaction costs $30 - $35 million Interest expense, net $165 million Tax rate, excluding spin-off transaction costs 24% Rail Group: Revenue $2.2 billion Operating margin 8.0% Railcar deliveries 20,500 railcars Revenue elimination from sales to Leasing Group (2) $860 million Operating profit elimination from sales to Leasing Group (2) $95 million Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group: Leasing and management revenues (3) $720 million Leasing and management operating profit (4) $290 million Proceeds from sales of leased railcars $350 million Inland Barge Group: Revenue $155 million Operating profit margin 0.0% Construction Products Group: Revenue $545 million Operating profit margin 13.0% Energy Equipment Group: Revenue $875 million Operating profit margin 8.5% (1) The range for earnings per share guidance reflects variability in the point estimates provided above for each business segment.\n(2) Revenue and operating profit elimination from sales to the Leasing Group include maintenance services in addition to railcar sales.\n(3) Excludes sales of railcars owned one year or less at time of sale.\n(4) Excludes operating profit from railcar sales.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006477/en/\nTrinity Industries, Inc.\nInvestor Contact:\nPreston Bass, 214-631-4420\nDirector, Investor Relations\nor\nMedia Contact:\nJack Todd, 214-589-8909\nVice President, Public Affairs\nSource: Trinity Industries, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006477/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trin.net&esheet=51795101&newsitemid=20180425006477&lan=en-US&anchor=www.trin.net&index=2&md5=06063c194553b59090cda2d6d5630984", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.trin.net&esheet=51795101&newsitemid=20180425006477&lan=en-US&anchor=www.trin.net&index=1&md5=a28fa63b9fa943d9c413eb828f3931d3"], "published": "2018-04-26T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T01:26:13.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
