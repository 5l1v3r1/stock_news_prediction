We neither ordered nor supported these buy recommendations,” he wrote in an email.\nShares in Switzerland, which made their debut in March at 12.40 Swiss francs, were last down 43.9 percent at 12.40 francs.\nBaFin said it had started an investigation into suspicion of market manipulation of the shares, which are listed in Germany as well as Switzerland. “At the Frankfurt am Main trading venue (including Xetra), price determination was suspended until further notice with effect from 3 April 2018,” it said.\nThe Swiss company has been dubbed the “Myspace for millionaires” or “Facebook for rich kids”.
