Within an hour and a half, participants could recognize 100 words, MIT Technology Review reported. \nResearchers hope the technology can ultimately be applied for use in smart devices, helping convey messages through vibrations, rather than the crude notifications they are used for now. \nThe research will be presented in April at the CHI conference in Montreal. \nHere's a video showing a version of the device: Chloe Aiello News Associate for CNBC.com Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T02:21:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
