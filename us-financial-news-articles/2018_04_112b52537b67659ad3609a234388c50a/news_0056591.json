That’s less clear, as it often is with crypto fluctuations. Some analysts say now that the “ tax selling pressure ” is behind investors, prices are certain to rise. (Bitcoin bull Tom Lee is predicting that crypto will hit $25,000 by year’s end, and John Pfeffer says it could hit as high as $700,000 .) And Ethereum has turned into an unlikely ally in China’s #MeToo movement , which could have helped it.\nThe increases are continuing today as well.
