Anyone caught bathing in Rome’s plethora of fountains faces a 500-euro fine. \n“He has apologised. In a moment of exuberance he carried out this action, but he realises the importance of the example he has given, and he will clearly pay the fine,” Raggi said. \nCity Hall said Pallotta had also promised funds to help with the restoration of a fountain in front of the ancient Pantheon — now a church and formerly a Roman temple. \n($1 = 0.8079 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:49:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
