(TSXV:BGM) (\" Barkerville \" or the \" Corporation \") is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement to purchase twelve mineral claims covering an area of 5300 hectares (the \" Purchased Claims \") located in the Cariboo Gold District in British Columbia (the \" Acquisition \").\nThe Purchased Claims, which are contiguous with other mineral tenures currently held by Barkerville, are accessible by highway, exploration trails and partially deactivated logging roads. The area, which includes the Lightening Creek alluvial field, has been explored intermittently since the 1870s with such recent exploration consisting of geological mapping, geochemical sampling, diamond drilling and geophysics. Most of the area's major creeks have also hosted placer operations. The acquisition of these claims is in line with Barkerville's current strategy to acquire neighbouring claims of geological importance.\nAs consideration for the Acquisition, the Corporation has agreed to pay the vendor a cash purchase price of $300,000 in immediately available funds, and to issue the vendor an aggregate of three million common shares in the capital of the Corporation (\" Common Shares \"). The Common Shares issuable in connection with the Acquisition will be subject to a four-month and one day hold period in accordance with applicable securities legislation. The Acquisition remains subject to TSXV approval.\nFor more information on Barkerville Gold Mines Ltd., please contact:\nChris Lodder\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n155 University Avenue, Suite 1410\nToronto, Ontario, Canada\nclodder@barkervillegold.com\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation based on expectations, estimates and projections as at the date of this news release.
