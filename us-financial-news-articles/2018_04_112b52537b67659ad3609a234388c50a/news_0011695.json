It was lifted briefly in 2013 before being reimposed.\nSince disputed elections in 2014, Libya has been split between competing political and military factions in the west and east of the country.\nThe Tripoli government is rejected by its eastern-based rivals. Political turmoil and armed conflict have led to economic collapse, allowing migrant smugglers to flourish and giving space to Islamist militants.
