Cameron Beard, Partner at Blank Rome LLP, was unanimously elected President of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce, at a meeting of Board of Directors held in New York City on April 17, 2018. Mr. Beard succeeds Giacomo Landi, Head of DNB Americas.\nMr. Beard writes: \"On April 17, 2018, I was elected as the 28th President of the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce. I am honored, but also recognize that I have big shoes to fill. Having served on the board of the NACC for more than twenty years, I have had the opportunity to witness and admire the work of a number of very able NACC presidents, all of whose contributions to the organization have been substantial. I am therefore especially grateful for the opportunity I have been given to serve the interests of the NACC membership, and to work with the NACC during an exciting period of growth and development.\nIt goes without saying that we are deeply indebted to our departing president, Giacomo Landi. During Giacomo's presidency the NACC made a number of great strides forward, including but not limited to: hiring its first new general manager in almost four decades, implementing a new management software that will streamline the activities of the NACC organization nationwide, and moving the NACC's national offices to the vibrant WeWork facility above Grand Central Station in Manhattan, where NACC staff can work closely with representatives of a number of other Nordic organizations.\" Read the full statement here: https://www.naccusa.org/blog/w-cameron-beard-elected-as-president-of-the-nacc/\nOther officers elected:\nSteven Peri, Partner, Peri & Stewart, will serve as Executive Vice President\nJohn Benson, Partner, Watson Farley & Williams, will serve as Treasurer\nJovi Tenev, Partner, Holland & Knight, will serve as Secretary\nNACC Chapter Presidents (automatically) are elected to serve as Vice Presidents\nNew Director joining the NACC National Board:\nCheryl Acker, Senior Claims Executive, Gard (North America) Inc.\nThe following Directors accepted re-election by the NACC membership:\nEven Johansen EPJ Corp.\nTerje Korsnes Nordic Group\nOivind Lorentsen III Investor\nMartin Lunder Nordea\nClay Maitland IRI/The Marshall Island Registry\nSteven Peri Peri & Stewart\nJan Eystein Saeboe Voss Water\nMorten Sohlberg Smorgas Chef/Blenheim\nJovi Tenev Holland & Knight\nAbout the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce\nFrom the time that it gained independence in 1905, Norway has been a close ally and significant trading partner of the United States. The need to foster and protect Norwegian-American trade was recognized from the outset, and in 1915 the Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce was established in New York City for that purpose. Since then, as Norway has risen to its position as a dominant force in an expanding number of industries, technologies and arts, the NACC has played various roles, promoting Norwegian-American interests, and providing a forum, through its chapters nationwide, in which companies and individuals with interests in Norwegian-American commerce can interact and pursue common goals.\nThe Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce (NACC) is a private membership organization with headquarters in New York City and chapters in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.\nVisit NACC website http://www.naccusa.org\nContact Information:\nLive Sletten Diakolios\nThe Norwegian American Chamber of Commerce\n450 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor\nNew York, NY 10017\nlive.diakolios@naccusa.org\nPh: 1 646 883 1760\nSOURCE Norwegian-American Chamber of Commerce", "external_links": ["https://www.naccusa.org/blog/w-cameron-beard-elected-as-president-of-the-nacc/", "http://www.naccusa.org/"], "published": "2018-04-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T13:19:58.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
