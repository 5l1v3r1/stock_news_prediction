It was just the second game Barkov missed all season.\nBut even without Barkov, the Panthers had plenty of offense as Jonathan Huberdeau, Colton Sceviour, Nick Bjugstad and Vincent Trocheck all scored goals.\nHuberdeau, Sceviour and Trocheck were moved up to a reworked top line, making up for the loss of Barkov.\nBackup goalie James Reimer (38 saves) earned the win as starter Roberto Luongo rested. On Thursday, Luongo became just the third NHL goalie to play 1,000 games.\nThe win was Florida’s 27th home victory of the season, breaking the previous franchise record.\nWhile Florida has one more game remaining — at the Boston Bruins on Sunday — Buffalo (25-45-12) finished last in the NHL with 62 points. The Sabres also allowed the second-most goals in the league. In their past six games, they allowed 30 goals.\nSabres goalie Chad Johnson (nine saves) allowed three goals in the first period and was then replaced by 25-year-old Adam Wilcox, who made his NHL debut and stopped all 14 shots he faced.\nThe Sabres avoided a shutout when they scored two goals - from Jason Pominville and Sam Reinhart — within 21 seconds late in the third period.\nFlorida scored three goals within 11 minutes in a dominant first period.\nAfter Buffalo’s Josh Gorges and Brendan Guhle were sent off, each for tripping, the Panthers took advantage and scored on a 5-on-3 power play. Huberdeau scored by deflecting a Trocheck shot.\nThe Panthers made it 2-0 when Frank Vatrano’s rebound bounced in off of Sceviour’s body. The period’s final highlight was Bjugstad’s goal, which was set up by Evgenii Dadonov’s brilliant behind-the-back touch pass.\nThe Panthers then held on after Pominville’s wrist shot went in after hitting Reimer’s glove and Reinhart’s goal — with 4:09 left in the third — made things interesting.\nTrocheck’s goal, his team-best 31st of the season, came on an empty-netter with 1:23 left in the game. And a power-play goal by Buffalo’s Ryan O’Reilly closed the scoring with 17 seconds remaining.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:10:14.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
