In 2013, according to the lawsuit, he had the artwork painted over in the middle of the night; the following year the buildings were torn down.\nIn response, 5Pointz organizers filed a lawsuit under the 1990 federal law, the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA).\nCory L. Stowers, an artist and organizer in Washington, called the white-washing “the end of an era” and said the recent verdict had ramifications across the board for artists as a way to protect their work.\nSURGE IN MURALS Matthieu Prin of London-based BOP Consulting, which focuses on culture, said over the past 10 years cities had increasingly been recognizing street art as both a valid art form and as a tool for economic development.\n“A key milestone in this shift has been the work of renowned street artist Banksy and London boroughs’ efforts to protect his works from damage,” said Prin, a city partnerships manager for the World Cities Culture Forum, a grouping of 32 cities.\nThe rise in the use of social media, which has made it easier to share images of street art, has helped cities see the value of promoting cultural tourism around the works, particularly to millennials, he said.\nStowers said increased collaboration between cities and street artists is visible in Washington, D.C., which today has more murals than ever before.\nThe city’s main murals project, which started a decade ago as a way to combat illegal graffiti, pairs aerosol artists with communities or property owners to create 10 projects a year.\nThe idea is to cover a wall that is the frequent target of illegal “tagging” - spray-painting a name or logo - while also having the artist work with local youth, said Jeffrey Scott with the D.C. Commission on the Arts and Humanities.\nWhile these opportunities help artists, weak or nonexistent policies mean their work, typically painted on the side of a building or wall, is not protected from development.\n“In D.C., we’ve had a large problem with public murals being destroyed or covered over,” Stowers said.\nAnd in response, he said, there was a “shoulder shrug, because there’s no real policy, no option to protect” them.\nOne option would be to have art created on panels rather than directly on buildings, so that they could be removed if needed. That, though, would cost more.\n“We typically want to see the murals have a lifespan of several years, and there are some that have been up for many years,” said Scott.\nBut he acknowledged that agreements with property owners tended to be less formal than with the artists.\n“Usually on a privately owned site we try to get some sort of provision of some sort of longevity — whatever they can promise,” he said.\nWashington is not alone: no U.S. city has a significant policy to protect the surge in public murals — although many are starting to recognize the need for such policies, Stowers said.\nGLOBAL CONVERSATION Stowers said the 5Pointz decision could act as a “flashpoint” that forces cities to approach the issue more seriously.\nUnder the United Nations’ sustainable development framework, authorities are urged to consider local culture as an important driver of development.\n“(The verdict) is a clear and strong sign of the growing recognition of the importance to protect and promote local forms of cultural expressions by a wider range of local institutions and authorities,” the United Cities and Local Governments, a global network of cities, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBOP’s Prin said U.S. cities could learn from other countries.\n“Cities around the world have been adopting policy in recent years specifically addressing street art,” said BOP’s Prin.\nThe two main threads, he said, were “policies that protect existing street art pieces and those that establish dedicated spaces for new street art”.\nIn Bogota and Lisbon, for instance, officials have unveiled new graffiti policies aimed at strengthening the role of street art in urban life while also bolstering related regulation.\nBrussels and Montreal, on the other hand, have undertaken efforts with tourists in mind, developing official maps and street art trails, said Prin.\nReporting by Carey L.
