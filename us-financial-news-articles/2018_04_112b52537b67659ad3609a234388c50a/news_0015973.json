WPP declined to comment.\nThe longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, Sorrell built WPP into the world's biggest advertising group by three decades of relentless dealmaking.\nIn his time the group has expanded to own top creative agencies including J. Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, as well as media planners and buyers and market-research and public-relations groups such as Finsbury.\nPresent in 112 countries and employing more than 200,000 people, WPP provides services to clients including Ford , Unilever , P&G and a string of major corporations. It has been hit in the last 18 months by a downturn in consumer spending and rapid technological change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:54:34.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
