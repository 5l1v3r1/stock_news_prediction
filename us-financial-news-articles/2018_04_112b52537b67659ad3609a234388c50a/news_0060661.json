Mr. Trump suggested farmers may need to accept short-term pain so the U.S. can achieve better trade deals with nations such as China.\nPromises from Chinese President Xi Jinping to open Chinese markets were “not enough,” Mr. Trump said. The U.S. will match Chinese policies by insisting that other countries must build factories here if they want to sell products such as cars in the U.S., he said, and he complained about alleged Chinese theft of U.S. intellectual property.\nSome farm-state lawmakers have been concerned about Mr. Trump’s efforts, which they fear will invite retaliation from other countries against American agricultural exports. Mr. Trump acknowledged those worries but said the country had other considerations.\nFarmers are “great patriots” but “there may be pain for a little while,” he said. “Short term, you may have to take some problems; long term you’re going to be so happy,” Mr. Trump said.\nThe Trump administration is in the midst of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada. Some Republican and Democratic lawmakers worry that he will force U.S. trading partners—and Congress itself—to choose between exiting the deal or accepting an alternative that they dislike.\n“If they don’t make a fair deal, I’m terminating Nafta,” Mr. Trump said Saturday.\nMr. Trump also referred to the $1.6 billion that Congress this year had approved for physical barriers, including 60 miles of replacement or secondary fencing along the Mexican border. He threatened to shut down the government if Congress withholds money for border security in the next spending bill.\n“If we don’t get border security, we’ll have no choice—we’ll close down the country,” Mr. Trump said.\nThe president also lobbed a broadside at Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who this week circulated allegations from what he said were current and former colleagues of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, the White House doctor, who was Mr. Trump’s nominee to serve as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. The allegations included assertions that the doctor drank to excess while accompanying President Barack Obama on overseas trips and had engaged in reckless behavior by dispensing prescription drugs without any paperwork.\nThe White House said its own review of documents turned up no records to support that or other allegations . Dr. Jackson said the allegations were untrue but withdrew from consideration for the VA post.\n“Tester started throwing out things that he’s heard,” Mr. Trump said. “I know things about Tester that I could say, too, and if I said them he’d never be elected again.” He didn’t elaborate.\nEarlier Saturday, Mr. Trump had called on the senator to resign for releasing the allegations against the doctor.\nMr. Tester is up for re-election in a state that Mr. Trump won by almost 21 percentage points. Mr. Tester has said it is his job to make sure Montana veterans are well-served and he was “absolutely” comfortable with his decision to air the allegations publicly without proof.\nMr. Trump compared Mr. Tester to the news media, saying “we need to vote against guys like Jon Tester that can destroy a man with innuendo, and we have to be very careful with the press because they do the same damn thing.”\nComedian Michelle Wolf headlined this year's White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, the annual event President Trump skipped for a second time in a row. Here's a short look at her performance. Please note this video contains mature themes. Photo: AP It was the second year that Mr. Trump skipped the annual White House Correspondents’ Association dinner. He isn’t the first president to skip the dinner, but presidents have regularly attended in recent years.\nUnlike last year, the White House allowed staff and administration officials to participate in the event, which raises money for college scholarships and other awards to benefit aspiring journalists.\nAttendees included White House press secretary Sarah Sanders, legislative affairs director Marc Short, deputy press secretary Raj Shah, spokesman Hogan Gidley, Council of Economic Advisers director Kevin Hassett and senior adviser Kellyanne Conway.\nThe evening featured comedian Michelle Wolf, who delivered an edgy monologue skewering Mr. Trump and Washington politicos in both parties, as well as the media.\n“Mr. President, I don’t think you’re very rich. You might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you’re doing fine,” Ms. Wolf said in her monologue.\n“Democrats are harder to make fun of, because you guys don’t do anything,” Ms. Wolf joked, predicting that the Democrats would fare poorly in the 2018 congressional elections.\n—Byron Tau contributed to this article.\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T09:03:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
