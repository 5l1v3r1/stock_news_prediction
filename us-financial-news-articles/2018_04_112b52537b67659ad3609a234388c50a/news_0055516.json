FILE PHOTO - Christine Graeff, Director general communications of the ECB (BCE) (L) speaks with European advisor Philippe Leglise-Costa at the Elysee Palace in Paris March 11, 2015. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer\n“The ambassador left the room to show his disapproval,” one EU diplomat said of Philippe Leglise-Costa’s decision to quit a meeting on Wednesday on the EU budget after discovering that no interpretation facilities would be provided.\nOfficials involved in organising the talks said the format of the meeting was one under which translators are not present in order to ease the logistics of calling informal discussions.\nThat, however, irks French diplomats seeking to assert the leading role their language long played in the Union that France co-founded six decades ago; without interpreters, nearly all other countries’ officials converse by default in English.\nThat trend has been particularly acute since many eastern and northern countries joined in the past 25 years. Paris sees in next year’s departure of Britain, the only state for which English is the official EU language, a chance for change.\nFrench officials speak of Brexit being a “catalyst” for a shift in the Brussels linguistic power balance, and President Emmanuel Macron - a fluent English speaker - has vowed to promote French, calling the rise of English “paradoxical” at a time when Britain is leaving the EU.
