Year-on-year, revenue increased 30 percent, from $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\n“The widening of steel product/raw material price spreads, gains from completed capex projects, and operational efficiency gains were the key drivers behind the growth of EBITDA to a 10-year high,” acting CFO Sergey Karataev said in a statement.\n“A significant liquidity cushion and a strong balance (sheet) create favourable conditions for high dividend payments,” he added.\nNLMK’s shares were up 0.6 percent at 154.89 in Moscow by 0833 GMT.\nIn March, NLMK’s board recommended a fourth-quarter dividend payout of 3.36 roubles ($0.0590) per share.\nNLMK said first quarter net profit totalled $502 million, up 56 percent from $323 million in the same period last year.
