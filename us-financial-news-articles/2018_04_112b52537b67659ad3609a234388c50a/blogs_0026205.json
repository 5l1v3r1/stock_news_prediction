Mr. Broidy, a Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, works on the Republican committee with Mr. Cohen, who is also a national deputy finance chairman. \nThe deal, which hasn’t previously been reported, prohibits the Los Angeles woman from disclosing her alleged relationship with Mr. Broidy in exchange for $1.6 million to be paid to her over two years in quarterly installments, these people said. The first payment was due Dec. 1, according to one of the people. \n“I acknowledge I had a consensual relationship with a Playboy Playmate,” Mr. Broidy said in a statement provided by a spokesman. “At the end of our relationship, this woman shared with me that she was pregnant. She alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period.” \nMr. Cohen didn’t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the woman’s lawyer, \nKeith Davidson, \nsaid he couldn’t confirm or deny the existence of the agreement. \nThe disclosure of the agreement puts additional attention on Mr. Cohen, 51 years old, a longtime lawyer and self-described fixer for Mr. Trump. Federal prosecutors are combing through documents they seized during the raids, looking for evidence of bank fraud, among other things, according to a person familiar with the matter. \nInvestigators are seeking records related to payments to two women who say they had sexual relationships with Mr. Trump, as well as files connected to Mr. Cohen’s taxi business, people familiar with the matter have said. \nMr. Cohen’s lawyer, \nStephen Ryan, \nthis week called the use of search warrants “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” President Trump called the raids a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt.” \nMr. Broidy, 60, and Mr. Cohen were appointed to the posts of RNC national deputy finance chairman in April 2017. Mr. Broidy was a vice chairman for the Trump campaign’s joint fund with the Republican Party during the 2016 presidential campaign, helping it raise more than $108 million. He gave more than $160,000 last year to the Republican National Committee, the Journal previously reported. \nSince Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Broidy has often met with the president at the White House and at Mr. Trump’s Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to people familiar with the matter. He helped organize a fundraiser in Los Angeles last month that Mr. Trump attended, the people said. \nThe nondisclosure agreement involving Mr. Broidy resembles an October 2016 pact in which Mr. Cohen agreed to pay $130,000 to former adult-film actress \nStephanie Clifford \nto prevent her from publicly discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The White House and Mr. Cohen have denied any encounter took place. \nMs. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, is engaged in a legal battle with Messrs. Cohen and Trump over the validity of that contract. \nThe Broidy agreement uses the same pseudonyms for Mr. Broidy and the woman with whom he was allegedly involved—David Dennison and Peggy Peterson—as the earlier agreement used for Mr. Trump and Ms. Clifford, respectively, the person familiar with the matter said. Both agreements had separate side letters that listed the real names of the parties, this person said. \nIn the Broidy agreement, Mr. Cohen, who represented Mr. Broidy, is referred to as Dennis Donohue; Mr. Davidson, the Los Angeles lawyer who represented the woman alleged to have had a sexual relationship with Mr. Broidy, is referred to as Paul Patterson, according to the person familiar with the matter. \nMr. Davidson also represented Ms. Clifford in her deal with Mr. Cohen less than two weeks before the 2016 election. He negotiated a $150,000 payment in August 2016 for \nKaren McDougal, \nanother former Playboy model, from American Media Inc., the publisher of the National Enquirer, for the rights to her story of an affair with Mr. Trump . Mr. Cohen discussed that deal with American Media as the company negotiated with Ms. McDougal, according to people familiar with the matter. \nAmerican Media, run by Trump friend David Pecker, declined to run the story, the Journal reported in November 2016, a practice known in the tabloid world as “catch and kill.” American Media said it paid Ms. McDougal for fitness columns and magazine covers and has denied it paid people to kill damaging stories about Mr. Trump. \nMs. McDougal and Ms. Clifford have hired new lawyers as they wage legal battles to nullify those agreements. The White House has denied Mr. Trump had any relationship with Ms. McDougal. \nAs part of the contract, the woman alleging a sexual relationship with Mr. Broidy agreed not to pursue what she said were potential legal claims against Mr. Broidy, according the person familiar with the matter. \nIn the contract, Mr. Broidy denied the allegations and agreed not to make any legal claims against the woman in return for her signing the contract, the person said. \nThe woman claimed that she became pregnant and that Mr. Broidy was the father, but the contract states that matters relating to the alleged pregnancy and paternity of the alleged child are excluded from the claims resolved in the agreement, the person familiar with the matter said. The woman declined to provide proof that she was pregnant with Mr. Broidy’s child, the contract says, according to the person familiar with the matter. \nThe contract said the woman reserved the right to seek child support in the future, but she has told Mr. Broidy’s camp that she had an abortion, the people familiar with the matter said. \nThe woman alleged that Mr. Broidy had paid her for an exclusive sexual relationship of one to two years, one of the people said. \nIn his statement, Mr. Broidy apologized to his family. “It is unfortunate that this personal matter between two consenting adults is the subject of national discussion just because of Michael Cohen’s involvement,” his statement said. “Mr. Cohen reached out to me after being contacted by this woman’s attorney, Keith Davidson. Although I had not previously hired Mr. Cohen, I retained Mr. Cohen after he informed me about his prior relationship with Mr. Davidson.” \nMr. Broidy has been a big supporter of the Trump campaign. In May 2016, as Mr. Trump moved to claim the Republican nomination, Mr. Broidy was named as vice chairman of the Trump Victory Fund, a joint fundraising effort of Mr. Trump’s campaign and state and national Republican committees. \nThere have been other recent troubles for RNC leadership. Former RNC finance chairman \nSteve Wynn \nresigned from that post in January following a Wall Street Journal report in which employees recounted what would amount to a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct by him. Mr. Wynn has denied the accusations, saying, “The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous.” —Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article. \nWrite to Joe Palazzolo at [email protected] and Michael Rothfeld at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:19:27.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
