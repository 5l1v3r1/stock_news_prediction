Traffic has been picking up as the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country, approaches.\nMarine unions have strongly resisted reforms liberalising the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of proud seafarers and shipowners.\nSince its worst debt crisis in decades broke out in 2010, Greece has sold management rights and majority stakes at its two largest ports, as demanded by its foreign lenders, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.\nThe Greek state is considering concession deals for the development of about 850 small ports and marinas.
