This, along with the fact that rallies in the 10-year futures have also been accompanied by high volume, has Ciana believing that the bond market could soon rally.\n\nThe strategist also sees bullish signs in the charts for gold, which is generally considered a safe haven trade once stocks start to fall. As of Thursday, gold was on pace for its longest quarterly winning streak since 2011, and according to Ciana could start second quarter on strong footing.\n\"6 of the last 7 big rallies in gold did have substantially high volume compared to the declines that happened before that,\" said Ciana referring to a weekly chart of gold.\nOn the same chart, Ciana also points out that a bull flag scenario could be forming, another sign that gold may take a leg higher. \"So I think with gold sitting here at about $1,320 or so, you have a great risk reward where you could probably target somewhere in the mid-1,400s if a bull flag scenario does in fact follow.\"\n\nAll of this leads Ciana to believe that the market volatility seen in the early months of 2018 could be replicated in the next few months.\n\"Enjoy the little bit of calm in the middle of the storm, and get ready to hunker down as Q2 is probably going to be a bit more similar to Q1,\" he added.\nOn Thursday to end last week, the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all saw their first gains in three days.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
