Hungarian central bank Deputy Governor Marton Nagy projected robust 10-15 percent annual growth in corporate lending over the next few years. \nThe Czech central bank, which has the lowest inflation goal in the region, is seen increasing its interest rates further. \nThe crown bucked the trend, firming mildly. \nThe Czech annual industrial producer price index for March came in at 0.1 percent, compared with analysts’ forecast for a 0.2 percent decline, a figure showing some inflation pressure.
