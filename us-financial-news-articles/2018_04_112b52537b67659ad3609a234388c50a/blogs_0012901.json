Trump also repeated his call for more security at the border in remarks Thursday while making claims about an immigrant \"caravan\" in Mexico heading toward the U.S. border.\nThe DHS official also said \"the crisis at our Southwest border is real.

That was up 37 percent from March 2017, when there were 16,588 people stopped, and up 203 percent from February 2018's tally of 36,695 people.\nDHS considers a person \"inadmissible\" when they appear at a port of entry without proper documentation for legal entry into the U.S. Those apprehended are individuals \"caught trying to enter illegally between ports of entry.\" The government's data also tracks the number of family units attempting to cross at the Southwest border as well as what the agency calls UAC, or \"unaccompanied alien children.\"\nU.S. Border Patrol Apprehensions FY2018 YTD (October 1 - March 31) Field Operations and Demographic OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR Total Southwest Border UAC 3,155 3,977 4,070 3,213 3,134 4,171 21,720 Southwest Border Family Units 4,837 7,016 8,120 5,654 5,475 8,882 39,984 Southwest Border Total Apprehensions 25,484 29,084 28,998 25,978 26,662 37,393 173,599 Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection While 37 percent is the highest month-over-month increase since 2011, the actual number of people — 50,308 — is lower than what was experienced last fall. For example, October and November 2017 both produced monthly totals exceeding 63,000 attempted crossings.\nSo far this year, the biggest number of apprehensions have been recorded in the Rio Grande sector in Texas, followed by the Tucson and Yuma sectors in Arizona, according to the government. The Rio Grande sector accounted for about 60 percent of the apprehensions on the Southwest border last year.\nU.S. Border Patrol Inadmissibles FY2018 YTD (October 1 - March 31) Field operations and demographic OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR Total Southwest Border UAC 630 672 906 688 610 1,099 4,605 Southwest Border Family Units 3,230 3,680 4,906 3,562 3,941 5,127 24,446 Southwest Border Total Inadmissibles 9,361 9,909 11,511 9,839 10,021 12,915 63,556 Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"Illegal aliens continue to exploit our immigration laws,\" Houlton said. \"We need to close these dangerous loopholes that are being taken advantage of each and every day, gain operational control of the border, and fully fund the border wall system.
