That was in line with the deal a union representative had told Reuters the parties reached last week.\nThe spokesman did not say how many workers the company expected to accept the proposal. The company employs 19,000 workers in Argentina, where it has been operating since 1982. Argentina represented 4 percent of Carrefour’s global sales in 2017.\nIn its statement, the ministry said workers who accepted the buyouts would have access to retraining courses and that the company would give additional benefits to pregnant or elderly employees.\nDouble-digit inflation has made Argentina a challenging environment for supermarkets\nReporting by Walter Bianchi and Luc Cohen; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-21T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:56:21.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
