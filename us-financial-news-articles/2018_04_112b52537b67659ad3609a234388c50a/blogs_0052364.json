Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press\nToday was supposed to be the day Dr. Ronny Jackson came to the Senate for his confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of Veterans Affairs. Instead, those hearings are postponed indefinitely, and President Donald Trump has openly mused about whether his pick to lead the VA should even continue with the process. “I really don’t think, personally, he should do it,” the president said of Dr. Jackson yesterday, with French President Emmanuel Macron standing beside him at the White House.\nTurbulence at the top of the Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to its founding, at the tail end of the Reagan administration, which elevated the VA chief to cabinet rank in the late 1980s. Since then, there have been nine secretaries. Six of them have been fired or resigned in scandal and three have left on their own terms. One in the latter category was Bob McDonald . He was secretary before Mr. Trump appointed David Shulkin , who was ousted last month, to the post at the start of his term.\n“The frequent leadership turnover at VA hurts efforts to sustain excellence and that hurts veterans,” Mr. McDonald told me yesterday. The Obama appointee–who was previously CEO of Procter & Gamble, a former Army captain and a longtime Republican–said secretaries should come into the job with not only with experience in the armed services, but also managerial experience. “I think President Obama got it right when he looked for someone who had successfully run a large company,” he said.\nMr. McDonald declined to comment on Dr. Jackson’s nomination specifically, but three other past VA secretaries, all who served under President George W. Bush , recently penned a letter of support for him. That support was not enough to assuage concerns from many lawmakers, who, even before studying Dr. Jackson’s record, had raised concerns, saying the presidential physician’s record showed scant experience running a bureaucracy on the scale he would inherit.\nAnd there are fresh concerns. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, in a CNN interview Tuesday night, laid out allegations he received that Dr. Jackson belittled lower-ranking employees, drank to excess on overseas trips, and handed out prescriptions “like candy,” walking down the aisle during flights doling out drugs to help people fall asleep and wake up. “In the White House, they call him the candy man,” Mr. Tester told CNN. Dr. Jackson will continue to seek confirmation and told the president the allegations weren’t true, Peter Nicholas , Louise Radnofsky and Siobhan Hughes report.\nJoe Chenelly , national executive director of Amvets, a veterans advocacy group, told me yesterday that he’s still looking forward to a hearing. “But if the allegations are true, maybe there’s no need for a hearing.” He added that if Dr. Jackson “isn’t all in, he better walk away because this is nasty, nasty stuff.” Dr. Jackson, appearing on Capitol Hill for meetings, said yesterday: “I’m looking forward to getting (a hearing) rescheduled and answering all the questions.”\nTrump, Macron Talk Iran and Break Bread\nThe administration has vowed to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord unless European allies agree to address administration concerns. Mr. Trump says the deal gives Iran too much in sanctions relief for too few curbs on its nuclear program. Yesterday at the White House, Mr. Macron said he sees the deal differently, but he noted that the two leaders both want to stem nuclear proliferation and stated his desire “to work as from now on a new deal.” American and European officials have been discussing ways to address Mr. Trump’s concerns ahead of a May 12 deadline Mr. Trump set for the U.S. to see its worries addressed or leave the pact.\nAt the first state dinner at the Trump White House, the menu featured greens from the garden planted by former first lady Michelle Obama , writes Michael C.
