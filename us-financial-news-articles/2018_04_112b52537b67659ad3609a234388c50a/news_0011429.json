Suva said a $100 billion increase is double the amount Apple has added in each of the previous two years.\nAs a result, the analyst said Apple will more than double its annual share buyback, which averaged $32 billion a year in the last five years.\n\"We believe that the shares remain attractively valued relative to the market and can undergo sustainable multiple expansion,\" he wrote.\nApple is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings results on May 1, according to its website .\nDisclaimer", "external_links": ["https://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/"], "published": "2018-04-05T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T15:31:35.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
