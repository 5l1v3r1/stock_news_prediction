It owned 307 of them. Sears has also listed 16 of its stores, mostly at malls in the Midwest and Texas, for sale online, asking for bids by May 1.\n“I’ve enjoyed my time with (Sears) and working closely with Eddie and the other leaders,” Stollenwerck said in a statement. “After 15 years, I’m ready for a new challenge and I wish all of Sears Holdings the very best in the future.”\nStollenwerck worked in Kmart’s real estate division before its merger with Sears in 2005. Before then, he worked at Lampert’s hedge fund ESL as a vice president of research.
