Another group that witnessed the accident alerted authorities. \nRescue crews had to suspend their search for survivors on Saturday evening due to bad weather. Days of heavy snowfalls have blanketed the Alps, prompting avalanche warnings. \nCantonal police posted a warning on their website on Thursday advising skiers of the danger of avalanches ahead of the long Easter weekend. \nA police spokesman said the search was being ended and no one else was believed missing. The two slightly injured members of the group were taken to hospital for treatment.
