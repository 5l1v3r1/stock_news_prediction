Bush , Trump used words that ultimately came back to haunt his predecessor, by pronouncing \"Mission Accomplished.\" That characterization raised questions about whether Western forces would intervene again if Assad used chemical weapons again, or if the conflict escalated amid Russia's growing bellicosity.\n\"A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!\" Trump said in a Twitter post.\nDefense Secretary James Mattis called the strikes a \"one time shot\" aimed at the Syrian government's chemical weapons infrastructure.\n\"Clearly, the Assad regime did not get the message last year,\" Mattis told reporters on Friday from the Pentagon.\n\"Together we have sent a clear message to Assad and his murderous lieutenants that they should not perpetrate another chemical weapons attack for which they will be held accountable.\"\nBack in May 2003, Bush prematurely declared the Iraq war as being over, in the wake of U.S. forces successfully toppling the government of Saddam Hussein. The event, staged on a U.S. bomber under a massive banner that screamed \"Mission Accomplished,\" overshadowed the years of conflict and bloodshed that followed.\nIn a briefing on Saturday, Pentagon officials also described the Syria bombing as having successfully accomplished its goals .\nTrump's declaration came as Moscow, which is backing Syria in its long civil conflict, has denounced the bombing campaign with undisguised contempt. In the wake of Friday's strike, Russia's ambassador to the U.S. warned of \"consequences,\" while Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly called the intervention an \"act of aggression.\"\n--CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this article.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/985130802668294144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Frealdonaldtrump%2Fstatus%2F985130802668294144"], "published": "2018-04-14T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T16:13:51.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
