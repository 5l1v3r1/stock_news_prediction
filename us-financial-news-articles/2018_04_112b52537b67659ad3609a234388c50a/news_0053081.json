Investors see a roughly 50-50 chance of a hike in May.\nHowever, a shortage of homes for sale is expected to continue to shore up the housing market.\nAn industry group said earlier on Friday that in 2017/18 financial year, housing starts of 154,698 were 2 percent lower than a record high in 2016/17.\nPrime Minister Theresa May wants construction of new homes to rise to 300,000 a year to tackle a shortage of housing.
