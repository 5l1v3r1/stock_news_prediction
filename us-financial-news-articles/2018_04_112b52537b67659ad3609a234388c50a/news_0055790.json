It also projected inflation of 1.8 percent for the following fiscal year ending in March 2021.\nThe decision on maintaining its interest rate targets was made by an 8-1 vote with board member Goushi Kataoka dissenting.\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision.
