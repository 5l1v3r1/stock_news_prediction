Mobile Posse also announced the appointment of Steve Drill as Chief Technology Officer. The move comes on the heels of Mobile Posse’s announcement that it recorded revenue growth of over 60 percent for the third year in a row, while doubling advertising reach in the past year to 25 million users per month and delivering three billion frictionless content experiences per month.\n“One Ballston Plaza and the surrounding area have provided a great home for Mobile Posse, and we wanted to grow and invest in this community as we continue to expand our business and employee base,” said Jon Jackson, Founder and CEO, Mobile Posse. “We expect 40 percent employee growth in the year ahead. We are thrilled to welcome Steve to the team - he is an expert in building, transforming and inspiring the highest-performing engineering teams, and will help Mobile Posse get to the next level.”\nDrill brings more than three decades of engineering experience to Mobile Posse’s growing team. He started as a self-taught software developer at Johns Hopkins University before becoming an acclaimed engineering leader. Most recently, Drill served as VP of Engineering at Resonate and Principal Engineering Manager at Microsoft.\nThe new expanded headquarters feature an open floor plan, providing employees with a flexible environment that allows them to select and choose how they want to work depending on the day, mood or task. The expanded space will support plans to hire across the product, engineering, data science and quality assurance teams.\n“Mobile Posse eliminates the unnecessary friction that hinders mobile users, who are looking to find and enjoy content on their smartphones,” said Drill. “As wireless carriers look to take back revenue from giants like Facebook and Google, Mobile Posse’s cutting-edge solutions not only provide more significant revenue opportunities, but also better understand consumers’ content consumption as they move along the mobile journey. I look forward to being part of a company that constantly pushes the industry forward.”\nAbout Mobile Posse\nMobile Posse is the leading platform for creating frictionless content experiences on smartphones.
