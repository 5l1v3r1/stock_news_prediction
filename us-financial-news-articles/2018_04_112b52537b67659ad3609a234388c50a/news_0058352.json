Southwest has also been canceling flights following the incident in order to perform engine inspections across its fleet of planes .\nThe airline says that it expects its revenue per available seat mile to decline between 1% and 3% in the second quarter, due in part to the recent bookings decline.\nSouthwest and other rival airlines are also facing a huge increase in fuel costs, leading them to raise fares.
