A passed ball by catcher Omar Narvaez put Escobar into scoring position, and after Drew Butera popped out on a bunt attempt, Merrifield grounded his hit into center.\nKevin McCarthy (2-0) pitched 1 1/3 scoreless innings to claim the win, while Blaine Boyer worked the ninth to earn his first save as the Royals garnered their second straight victory over Chicago after five straight losses.\nCheslor Cuthbert carried the Kansas City attack prior to Merrifield’s single, clouting two homers and knocking in four runs. Cuthbert cut a 2-0 deficit in half in the bottom of the fourth with his first homer of the year into the bullpen in left-\nIn his next at-bat, Cuthbert doubled his home run total, golfing a down-and-in fastball from reliever Chris Volstad just over the wall in left-center with Salvador Perez and Jorge Soler aboard to give the Royals a 4-2 lead.\nThe White Sox fought back to tie the game with single runs in the sixth and seventh. Leury Garcia’s RBI triple to center plated Trayce Thompson in the sixth, while Nicky Delmonico evened the score an inning later when he lofted an RBI double to right that chased Jose Abreu home.\nDaniel Palka gave Chicago a 2-0 edge in the fourth when he doubled to score Abreu and Delmonico. Both teams wasted plenty of chances throughout the day, the White Sox stranding 11 men on base and Kansas City leaving 10.\nNeither starter was involved in the decision. Chicago’s Hector Santiago lasted 4 2/3 innings, yielding five hits and two runs with three walks and five strikeouts.\nRoyals righthander Ian Kennedy pitched five innings, permitting four hits and two runs. He walked two and whiffed six.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:15:53.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
