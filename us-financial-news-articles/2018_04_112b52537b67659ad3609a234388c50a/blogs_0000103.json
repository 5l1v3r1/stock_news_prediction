The company’s still reeling after a tweet from Kylie Jenner, suggesting that no one used the app any more, caused a huge dip in the company’s stock, costing it $1 billion in market value. Then, earlier this month, pop singer Rihanna called on fans to delete the app after it ran an ad she felt made a joke of a domestic violence incident from her past. Snapchat removed the ad, which was placed by a mobile-gaming company, and apologized, saying it was a mistake.\nThe two PR disasters follow a very disappointing IPO by the company last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T18:13:42.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
