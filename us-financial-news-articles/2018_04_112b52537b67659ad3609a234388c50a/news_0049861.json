Adjusted net income of $5.41 per share grew by 15.6% year over year. Benefit Expense Ratio came in better than expected at 81.5%, reflecting the impact of Anthem's integrated clinical and care management programs on overall healthcare costs for our members. Medical enrollment declined sequentially by approximately 0.6 million members, or 1.5%, totaling approximately 39.6 million members as of March 31, 2018. The Company now expects medical enrollment to be between 40.1 - 40.3 million for the full year 2018. Generated operating cash flows of $2.2 billion, or 1.7 times net income. Completed the acquisition of America's 1st Choice during the quarter, adding 135 thousand Medicare Advantage lives in central Florida, including a 5 STAR plan. Second quarter 2018 dividend of $0.75 per share declared to shareholders.\nINDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Anthem, Inc. (NYSE: ANTM) reported strong first quarter 2018 financial results and improved margins while continuing to make strategic investments in growth initiatives.\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter 2018 financial performance, which reflects our commitment to strong medical cost performance by effectively leveraging community based innovative and integrated clinical and value based care models across our markets,\" said Gail K. Boudreaux, President and CEO. \"Throughout 2018, we are prioritizing investments to create a more flexible infrastructure that can quickly respond to the evolving needs of our customers and the changing healthcare environment. We are also driving an increased focus on executional excellence across the organization. I see further opportunity for Anthem as we continue to unlock the full potential of our company to deliver consistently strong financial performance and future growth.\"\nBased on first quarter results and the business outlook for the remainder of the year, Anthem has increased its outlook for 2018 adjusted net earnings to be greater than $15.30* per share.\n* Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.\nCONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS\nMembership: Medical enrollment totaled approximately 39.6 million members at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 1.0 million members, or 2.5% percent, from 40.6 million at March 31, 2017. The enrollment decrease was driven predominantly by a reduced footprint in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace. Enrollment gains in fee-based services were partially offset by declines in Local Group insured membership. Medicaid enrollment declined by 120,000 individuals while Medicare grew by 237,000 lives.\nMedical enrollment declined by 616 thousand lives sequentially during the first quarter of 2018. The decrease reflected enrollment declines in the Individual and Local Group fully-insured businesses, partially offset by growth in the National, Medicare, and BlueCard ® businesses.\nOperating Revenue: Operating revenue was $22.3 billion in the first quarter of 2018, flat compared to the $22.3 billion in the prior year quarter. The results reflected premium rate increases to cover overall cost trends across our business as well as the return of the health insurance tax in 2018. Revenues also increased due to the acquisitions of Health Sun and America's 1st Choice as well as organic membership growth in the Medicare business. These increases were offset by a reduced footprint in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace and membership declines in the Local Group fully-insured and Medicaid businesses.\nBenefit Expense Ratio: The benefit expense ratio was 81.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 220 basis points from 83.7 percent in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 and improved medical cost performance across our business segments.\nMedical claims reserves established at December 31, 2017 developed moderately better than the Company’s expectation during the first quarter of 2018.\nMedical Cost Trend: For the full year 2018, the Company continues to expect underlying Local Group medical cost trend to be in the range of 6.0% +/- 50 basis points.\nDays in Claims Payable: Days in Claims Payable (“DCP”) was 40.3 days as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 0.9 days from 39.4 days as of December 31, 2017.\nSG&A Expense Ratio: The SG&A expense ratio was 15.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 100 basis points from 14.3 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The increase, as expected, was primarily driven by the return of the health insurance tax in 2018 as well as the impact of increased investment spend in 2018 to support growth initiatives. The increase was partially offset by the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and lower administrative spend from expense efficiency initiatives.\nOperating Cash Flow: Operating cash flow was $2.2 billion, or 1.7 times net income in the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2017, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion, or 2.7 times net income.\nShare Repurchase Program : During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 1.7 million shares of its common stock for $395 million, or a weighted-average price of $233.51. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $6.8 billion of Board-approved share repurchase authorization remaining.\nCash Dividend: During the first quarter of 2018, the Company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.75 per share, representing a distribution of cash totaling $191.9 million.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Audit Committee declared a second quarter 2018 dividend to shareholders of $0.75 per share. On an annualized basis, this equates to a dividend of $3.00 per share. The second quarter dividend is payable on June 25, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 8, 2018.\nInvestment Portfolio & Capital Position: During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded net realized losses on financial instruments totaling $26.1 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $7.9 million. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net realized gains of $7.3 million and other-than-temporary impairment losses totaling $8.1 million.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s net unrealized gain position in the investment portfolio was $18.7 million, consisting entirely of fixed maturity securities. The adoption of a change in accounting standards has resulted in the Company accounting for changes in the value of equity securities in realized gains or losses. As of March 31, 2018 cash and investments at the parent company totaled approximately $1.1 billion.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\nAnthem, Inc. has three reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business (comprised of the Local Group, National Accounts, Individual and Specialty businesses); Government Business (comprised of the Medicaid and Medicare businesses, National Government Services, and the Federal Employee Program); and Other (comprised of unallocated corporate expenses and certain other businesses that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate reportable segment disclosure).\nAnthem, Inc.

The increase was primarily driven by the Penn Treaty assessments that were recorded in the first quarter of 2017 and improved medical cost performance. The increase was partially offset by a reduced footprint in the Individual ACA-compliant marketplace and increased investment spend to support our growth initiatives.\nGovernment Business: Operating gain in the Government Business segment was $490.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $172.3 million, or 54.1 percent, from $318.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase reflects the impact of the HealthSun and America's 1st Choice acquisitions as well as organic membership increases in the Medicare business, and retroactive revenue adjustments in the Medicaid business. The increase was partially offset by increased investment spend to support our growth initiatives.\nOther: The Company reported an operating loss of $31.4 million in the Other segment for the first quarter of 2018, compared with an operating loss of $35.6 million in the prior year quarter.\nOUTLOOK\nFull Year 2018:\nNet income is now expected to be greater than $14.12 per share, including approximately $1.18 per share of net unfavorable items. Excluding these items, adjusted net income is now expected to be greater than $15.30 per share. Medical membership is now expected to be in the range of 40,100,000 - 40,300,000. Fully-insured membership is expected to be in the range of 14,800,000 - 14,900,000 and self-funded membership is now expected to be in the range of 25,300,000 - 25,400,000. Operating revenue is now expected to be in the range of $91.0 - $92.0 billion. Benefit expense ratio is now expected to be in the range of 84.4% plus or minus 30 basis points. SG&A ratio is now expected to be in the range of 15.4% plus or minus 30 basis points. Operating cash flow is expected to be greater than $4.0 billion.\nBasis of Presentation\n1. Operating revenue and operating gain are the key measures used by management to evaluate performance in each of its reporting segments, allocate resources, set incentive compensation targets and to forecast future operating performance. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense and selling, general and administrative expense. It does not include net investment income, net realized gains/losses on financial instruments, other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in income, interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt or income taxes, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of operating segment management. Refer to the GAAP reconciliation tables.\n2. Operating margin is defined as operating gain divided by operating revenue.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (“EDT”) to discuss the company’s first quarter results and outlook.
