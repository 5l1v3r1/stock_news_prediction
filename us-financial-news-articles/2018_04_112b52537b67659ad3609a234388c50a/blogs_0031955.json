The Fed raised rates at its March policy meeting but is not expected to do so when it meets again in about two weeks.\nPrice increases nationally were described as \"moderate,\" with steel costs rising \"dramatically\" in some areas due to the Trump administration's announcement of tariffs on imports of the metal.\nBusinesses repeated recent frustrations with labor shortages across a variety of sectors including high-skilled jobs in engineering, information technology and healthcare. There were also shortages seen in construction and transportation.\nIn some cases that is leading to long-anticipated wage increases, though overall wage growth remained \"only modest.\"\n\"Businesses were responding to labor shortages in a variety of ways, from raising pay to enhancing training to increasing their use of overtime and/or automation,\" the Fed reported. \"Upward wage pressures persisted but generally did not escalate.\"\nThe Beige Book was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before April 9, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T21:30:01.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
