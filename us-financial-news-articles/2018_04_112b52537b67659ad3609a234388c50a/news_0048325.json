Monday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of modern China’s navy.\nThe report said the carrier was likely being readied for its first sea trials.\nChina’s Defense Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\nPictures of the carrier have been widely leaked on the Chinese internet, with little apparent concern from the government.\nState media has previously Quote: d military experts as saying the carrier, China’s second, is not expected to enter service until 2020, once it has been fully kitted out and armed.\nLittle is known about China’s aircraft carrier program, which is a state secret.\nBut the government has said the new carrier’s design draws on experiences from the country’s first carrier, the Liaoning, bought second-hand from Ukraine in 1998 and refitted in China.\nThe new conventionally powered carrier will be able to operate China’s Shenyang J-15 fighter jets.\nUnlike the U.S. navy’s longer-range nuclear carriers, both of China’s feature Soviet-design ski-jump bows, intended to give fighter jets enough lift to take off from their shorter decks. But they lack the powerful catapult technology for launching aircraft of their U.S. counterparts.\nThe Liaoning has taken part in military exercises, including in the South China Sea and Western Pacific, but is expected to serve more as a training vessel.\nTaiwan has said China is actually building two new aircraft carriers, but China has not officially confirmed the existence of another carrier.\nChinese state media has Quote: d experts as saying that the country needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more.\nMost experts agree that developing such a force will be a decades-long endeavor for China but the launch of the second carrier holds a certain prestige value for Beijing, seen by many analysts as keen to eventually erode U.S. military prominence in the region.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
