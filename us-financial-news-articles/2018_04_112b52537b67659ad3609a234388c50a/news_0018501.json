It could have a role in budget surveillance of the member states and could play a coordinating role in the orderly restructuring of sovereign debt. \nIn a potential race for Draghi’s job, Weidmann is likely to face criticism that he often sides with the minority on the rate-setting Governing Council, having opposed key stimulus measures that kick-started European growth.
