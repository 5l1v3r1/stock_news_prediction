Global output this year is estimated at 65 million tonnes.\nCME warehouses in the United States hold nearly 54,000 tonnes of aluminum, and most of that is in Owensboro.\nThe London Metal Exchange also on Tuesday said Rusal’s aluminum would be suspended from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling contracts with sanctions-hit companies.\nRusal’s metal in LME warehouses before April 6 is not affected, but sources say few companies will want to hold it.\nReporting by Pratima Desai in London and Melanie Burton in Melbourne; Editing by Jason Neely and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:22:17.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
