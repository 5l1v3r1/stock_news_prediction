REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo \nThe offer values Santos at US$4.98 per share, or A$6.50, per share, a 28 percent premium to the company’s last closing share price of A$5.07. \nSantos said it was Harbour Energy’s fourth unsolicited bid for the Adelaide-based company, which has stakes in several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in a region where gas demand is soaring. \n“The Santos board considers that, based on the indicative offer price of A$6.50 per share, it is in the interests of shareholders to engage further with Harbour,” Santos said in a statement to shareholders. \nThe bid from Washington-based Harbour, a private equity-backed firm led by a former Royal Dutch Shell Plc executive director Linda Cook, consists of $4.70 per share in cash and a special dividend of $0.28 per share. \nHarbour plans to fund the takeover through a combination of debt and equity, with J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley underwriting $7.75 billion of debt. \n“With the support of these providers of capital, Harbour stands ready to move expeditiously towards entering into a Scheme Implementation Agreement and to commencing all necessary government and regulatory review processes,” said Cook, Chief Executive of Harbour Energy. \nSantos said last year it had rebuffed a A$9.5 billion takeover approach from Harbour Energy in August, saying it undervalued the company. \nSantos also disclosed on Tuesday that Harbour had approached the company on two occasions in March, with bids of A$6.25 per share and A$6.37. \nSantos’ Australian and offshore gas assets includes a prized stake in the Papua New Guinea (PNG) LNG project, run by ExxonMobil Corp. \nPNG project partners are still assessing damage of a powerful 7.5 magnitude quake that struck Papua New Guinea on Feb. 26, killing dozens of people and halting production at the site. \nSantos shares are due to start trading at around 0100 GMT, one hour after the open, the company said.
