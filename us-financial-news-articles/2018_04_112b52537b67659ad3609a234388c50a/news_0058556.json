The Company’s earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were driven by higher natural gas and electric sales and margins, reflecting: customer growth, colder winter weather and new distribution rates compared to the first quarter of 2017.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results, which benefited from continued growth in our customer base, cold winter weather and our regulatory agenda,” said Thomas P. Meissner, Jr., Unitil’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We will continue to focus on expanding and upgrading our distribution system to support future growth while delivering safe and reliable service to customers.”\nNatural gas sales margin was $39.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.9 million compared to the same period in 2017. Gas sales margin in the first quarter of 2018 was positively affected by colder weather and customer growth of $1.8 million and higher natural gas distribution rates of $1.6 million, partially offset by lower revenue of $1.5 million to account for the reduction in rates due to the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).\nNatural gas therm sales increased 9.5% in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Based on weather data collected in the Company’s natural gas service areas, there were 10% more Heating Degree Days in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the number of total natural gas customers served has increased by 1,478 in the last twelve months.\nElectric sales margin was $22.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the same period in 2017. Electric sales margin in the first quarter of 2018 was positively affected by higher electric distribution rates of $0.9 million as well as colder weather and customer growth of $0.2 million, partially offset by lower revenue of $0.8 million to account for the reduction in rates due to the lower corporate income tax rate of 21% under the TCJA.\nTotal electric kWh sales increased 5.8% compared to the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the number of total electric customers served has increased by 516 in the last twelve months.\nOperation and Maintenance (O&M) expenses increased $1.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The change in O&M expenses reflects an increase in compensation and benefit costs of $0.7 million, bad debt expenses of $0.2 million and utility operating costs of $0.4 million.\nDepreciation and Amortization expense decreased $0.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting lower amortization of deferred major storm costs, partially offset by higher utility plant in service and amortization of information system and software costs.\nTaxes Other Than Income Taxes increased $0.3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, primarily reflecting higher local property taxes on higher levels of utility plant assets in service.\nInterest Expense, net was essentially unchanged in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting higher interest on long-term debt offset by lower net interest expense on net regulatory assets/liabilities and lower levels of short-term debt.\nIncome Taxes decreased by $2.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, reflecting $2.3 million from a lower tax rate on higher pre-tax earnings in Q1 2018 (see revenue discussion above) and the current tax benefit of $0.6 million on book/tax items not previously included in customers’ utility rates.\nAt its January 2018 and April 2018 meetings, the Unitil Corporation Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends on the Company’s common stock of $0.365 per share. These quarterly dividends result in a current effective annualized dividend rate to $1.46 per share, representing an unbroken record of quarterly dividend payments since trading began in Unitil’s common stock.\nThe Company’s earnings are seasonal and are typically higher in the first and fourth quarters when customers use natural gas for heating purposes.\nThe Company will hold a quarterly conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
