It causes half a million life-threatening infections and kills about 20,000 people, mostly children, annually.\nSanofi’s vaccine, marketed under the brand Dengvaxia and the world’s first licensed against dengue, is the centre of a health scare in the Philippines where the government suspended its use last year amid widespread safety fears.\nA vaccination campaign using Dengvaxia has also been taking place in the state of Parana, Brazil.
