The United States Geological Service Survey (USGS) measured the initial quake at magnitude 5.6 at a depth of 7 kms. \nA JMA official warned at a press briefing that the region could experience further jolts over the next week, particularly in the coming two or three days. \nNo injuries have so far been reported as a result of the earthquakes, public broadcaster NHK said.
