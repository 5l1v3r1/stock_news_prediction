I was pressing too hard,” said Thomas. “I was trying to make things happen early in the round when in reality basically every Sunday, when there’s anywhere from five to ten people that have a chance to win, about five to seven of them are going to take themselves out of the tournament. \n“And it’s not the fact that they’re bad players, it’s just the fact that you’re not going to get ten players and all of them play great. It’s just how it is.” \nThomas, whose best finish at Augusta National was a share of 22nd place last year, said he will enter the year’s first major with less pressure having already triumphed in one of golf’s four blue riband events. \n“Not getting questions on a day like today (such as) when do you feel like you’re going to get your first major, or do you feel like you’re one of the best players without a major, so I was glad to get that over with as quick as I could,” said Thomas. \n“But it’s just more than anything when I get in those scenarios or when I have a chance to win a big tournament or any tournament, I’m able to look back at the PGA Championship and just remember the things that I went through and the feelings I felt, the emotions that I had, and just try to kind of learn from that and use it to my advantage.” Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T20:28:07.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
