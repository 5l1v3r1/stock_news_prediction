Usiminas expects increased sales in Brazil this year, he said, but the company will not export to the United States in 2018.\nShares in Usiminas rose as much as 4.2 percent on Tuesday on news of the restarted furnace in Ipatinga, but later pared gains to close 2.1 percent higher at 10.24 reais.\nReporting by Alberto Alerigi; writing by Gram Slattery, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:37:41.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
