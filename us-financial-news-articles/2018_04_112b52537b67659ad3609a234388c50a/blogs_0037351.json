But you'd never know it from his lifestyle. \nThe 87-year-old billionaire still lives in the five-bedroom home in Omaha, Nebraska, that he bought in 1958 for $31,500 . And he never spends more than $3.17 on breakfast. \nOn his five-minute drive to the office, which he's been making for the past five decades, Buffett stops by McDonald's and orders one of three items: two sausage patties, a sausage, egg and cheese or a bacon, egg and cheese. Contributor | Bloomberg | Getty Images Warren Buffett drinks several cans of Coke a day. \n\"I tell my wife, as I shave in the morning, I say, 'Either $2.61, $2.95 or $3.17.' And she puts that amount in the little cup by me here [in the car],\" he explains in the HBO documentary, \" Becoming Warren Buffett .\" \nEach amount corresponds to one of his three go-to breakfast items. \n\"When I'm not feeling quite so prosperous, I might go with the $2.61, which is two sausage patties, and then I put them together and pour myself a Coke,\" he tells the documentary director Peter Kunhardt in the McDonald's drive-through. \"$3.17 is a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit, but the market's down this morning, so I'll pass up the $3.17 and go with the $2.95.\" \nBuffett proceeds to order a sausage, egg and cheese and pay using exact change.
