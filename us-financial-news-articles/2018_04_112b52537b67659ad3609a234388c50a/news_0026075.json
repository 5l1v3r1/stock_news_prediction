It rose 0.2 percent the previous day, ending a four-day losing streak.\nThe index managed to bounce as Treasury yields spiked, with that of the 10-year surging 5 basis points overnight to its highest since late March.\nYields rose as Wall Street gained on Thursday in anticipation of strong corporate earnings, and as geopolitical worries eased on U.S. President Donald Trump’s suggestion that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent.\n“The dollar had not shown a strong correlation with U.S. yields recently. But the correlation returned somewhat, with currencies taking notice of such a spike in yields,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n“Risk aversion in equities will need to keep receding for the dollar to remain supported. There is no change to the equation of ‘Trump risk’ dictating market direction.”\nThe dollar was down 0.1 percent at 107.245 yen after rising more than 0.5 percent overnight. The greenback has gained about 0.3 percent versus the yen this week.\nThe euro was little changed at $1.2392 after losing 0.3 percent the previous day, when it ended a four-day winning run.\nThe common currency has risen 0.4 percent this week, supported by comments from European Central bank officials that reinforced expectations towards monetary policy normalisation.\nThe Australian dollar was steady at $0.7757 and the New Zealand dollar was a shade higher at $0.7379.
