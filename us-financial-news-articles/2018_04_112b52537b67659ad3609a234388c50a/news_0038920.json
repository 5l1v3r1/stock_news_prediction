One of them shot dead a police officer in Bavaria in October.\nThe home in eastern Germany of a fifth individual, who was not a suspect, was also searched. The timing of any possible planned attack was not yet known. No arrests had yet been made as part of the investigation, which continues.\nReporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T15:28:58.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
