He made another three birdies over his closing stretch, including at his final two holes. \nKuchar, who also started on the back nine, birdied his final two holes to join a group sitting two shots off the lead, while Huh fired a six-under 30 over an electric front nine in which he made four birdies along with an eagle at the par-five fifth. \nWorld number one Dustin Johnson, fresh off a 10th place finish at the Masters on Sunday, was five shots off the pace after mixing four bogeys with six birdies for a two-under 69. \nThat left the long-hitting American in a share of 20th place along with defending champion Wesley Bryan, who entered this week after having missed four consecutive cuts. \nU.S. Ryder Cup vice captain Davis Love III, a five-times champion here, was two-over par while his son Dru Love, who received a sponsor exemption for the event, was six over.
