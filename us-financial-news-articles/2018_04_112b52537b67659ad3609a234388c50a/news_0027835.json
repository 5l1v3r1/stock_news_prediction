Formula One F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 15, 2018 Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen on the podium after finishing third in the race REUTERS/Aly Song \nFerrari dominated Saturday’s qualifying at the Shanghai circuit with Vettel leading a front-row lockout for the Maranello-based squad after narrowly beating Raikkonen to pole. \nBut the Finn’s third place is the best Ferrari managed to come away with at the end of Sunday’s race won by Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo. \n“Today’s result was definitely not the one we were aiming for, given that we were starting from the front row,” said team principal Maurizio Arrivabene. \nVettel kept the lead off the line, chopping across the bows of Raikkonen, who dropped to fourth behind the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas and Max Verstappen’s fast-starting Red Bull. \nThe German led in the early stages but lost position to Bottas through the pitstops, despite having built a comfortable advantage. \nThe Finn had stopped one lap earlier and made use of his fresher tyres to bridge the gap. \nVettel’s pitstop, Ferrari’s first in race conditions after their botched effort in Bahrain left a mechanic with a broken leg, was also slower than Mercedes’ pit work for Bottas. \nHaving lost the effective lead to the Mercedes, Ferrari kept Raikkonen, who was now at the front but yet to stop, out on the track. \nThe Finn’s pace on fading tyres was dropping off and hurting his race. But Ferrari, it appeared, hoped Raikkonen would trip Bottas up and create an opportunity for Vettel to regain the lead. \nThey eventually brought him in on lap 27, after Bottas and Vettel overtook him without a change in positions. \n“I don’t know,” said Raikkonen when asked if he had fallen victim to Ferrari strategy in the first stint. \n“On the last lap with the Mercedes it was Seb who benefited for me but then we had the Safety Car.” \nThe safety car bunched the pack up and allowed Raikkonen to make up the time he had lost staying out. \nVettel’s race, meanwhile, unravelled after Verstappen collided with him and punted him into a spin. \nDespite being pre-race favourite to chalk up a third win in a row, Vettel finished only eighth, behind even McLaren’s Fernando Alonso. \nRaikkonen, on the other hand, almost snatched second from Bottas but was unable to get past. \n“A little bit of luck with the safety car,” he said later. \n“But I’ll take what I got, because at one point it didn’t look good at all.” Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:18:51.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
