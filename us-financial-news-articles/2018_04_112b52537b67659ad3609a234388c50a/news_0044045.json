It seeks information on the identities of the third parties hired by the company to file documents with the New York City Department of Buildings and the city Department of Finance, according to a person familiar with it.\nThough the filings occurred during a period when Mr. Kushner was CEO, none of the documents had his signature, the Associated Press reported.\nThe subpoena to the company, which is now run by Mr. Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, comes as it is also facing scrutiny on the same subject from the New York attorney general’s office, which has launched an inquiry into the matter, according to Eric Soufer, a spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. \nAs a part of that, attorneys from the Attorney General’s office have met with tenant representatives, Mr. Soufer said.\nThe New York City Council has also opened an investigation into the filings.\nSince early last year, Brooklyn federal prosecutors, along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, have also been reviewing Kushner Cos.’s use of a federal investment-for-visa program known as EB-5, The Wall Street Journal has reported . The company has since ceased using the EB-5 program to finance its projects. Kushner Cos. has said it did nothing improper with the program and is cooperating with legal requests for information. \nAnd the Brooklyn U.S. attorney’s office is also investigating a $285 million loan the company received one month before the 2016 presidential election from Deutsche Bank AG , the Journal has reported. Kushner Cos. has said it “has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with any reasonable request for information.” A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nIn that inquiry, prosecutors sent a document request in mid-November of last year to the Kushner Cos. asking for contracts and other information about the loan.\nWrite to Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T01:04:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
