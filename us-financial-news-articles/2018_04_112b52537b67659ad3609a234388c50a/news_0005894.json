That is down 16 percent from $106 a month last year.

It also has proposed putting cheaper insurance policies offering bare-bones medical coverage on the Obamacare market in 2019 or 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T00:25:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
