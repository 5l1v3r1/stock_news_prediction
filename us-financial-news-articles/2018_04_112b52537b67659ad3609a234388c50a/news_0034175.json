The company’s stock trades on the Oslo and New York stock exchanges and it has corporate offices around the world.\nFollowing a deep drop in oil prices beginning in 2014, the offshore service industry suffered from a glut of capacity and low market rates, a problem that lingers today.\nSeadrill filed for bankruptcy in September.\nMark Morris, the company’s chief financial officer, told the court that Seadrill has a modern fleet, good safety record and a strong customer base, but was burdened with more than $10 billion in liabilities. “This was all about fixing the balance sheet,” he said.\nSeadrill had broad support from its creditors for its plan, and much of the negotiation in the restructuring centered on a push by bondholders to provide a bigger portion of the $1 billion new investment.\nThe company still needs to complete various steps before it can exit bankruptcy, including payments of fees and receiving regulatory approvals.
