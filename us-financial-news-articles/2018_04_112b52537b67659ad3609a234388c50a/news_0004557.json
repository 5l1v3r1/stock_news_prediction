REUTERS/Paul Childs \nThe tourists, without a win in their last 12 overseas tests and needing victory to save the two-test series after losing the opener in Auckland, declared their second innings closed on 352-9 earlier on day four at Hagley Oval. \nNew Zealand openers Tom Latham, who had made 25 not out, and Jeet Raval, unbeaten on 17, will resume on the final day on Tuesday after weathering an early storm from the seamers and a period where declining light forced England to bowl spin. \nEngland’s Jonny Bairstow, who backed up his first innings century with a bright 36 from 54 balls, said the tourists were confident they could take the 10 wickets to get the job done on Tuesday. \n“We’ve seen that if you put the ball in the right areas, we’ve beaten the outside edge consistently,” he told reporters.

REUTERS/Paul Childs \nProblems in getting a full day’s play at a ground without floodlights might have been expected this far into the year, especially after the official end of New Zealand’s summer came with the changing of the clocks at the weekend. \nEngland had still looked in a strong position to get the win they required to stymie New Zealand’s hopes of a first series triumph against them since 1999 when bad light also brought an early end to day three on Sunday. \nHaving made 307 in their first innings before dismissing New Zealand for 278, they resumed on 202-3 and pushed cautiously towards a position where they might declare later in the day.
