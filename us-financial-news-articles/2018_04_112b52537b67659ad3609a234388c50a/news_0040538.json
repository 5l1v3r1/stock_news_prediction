China and the broader Asia-Pacific region recorded double-digit increases in sales.\nShares in the company were up 2.1 percent at 0823 GMT, the second biggest gainer on France’s blue-chip CAC40 index.\nThe company markets a wide range of products for homes and businesses, ranging from electrical car chargers and lighting control to transformers and software.\nRestocking by distributors in China spurred the growth in the Asia-Pacific region, the company said.\nHowever, results were hit by a strong euro and the company said Brexit uncertainty in Britain was causing concern.\nSchneider last month completed a deal to take a 60 percent stake in an enlarged industrial software business worth about 3 billion pounds ($4.25 billion) after agreeing to combine with Britain’s Aveva Group.\n“The only country that is a little worrying is Britain because Brexit creates a climate of uncertainty and wait-and-see that is starting to materialise in a number of projects,” Chief Financial Officer Emmanuel Babeau told Reuters.\nThe British market was tepid on low backlog with utilities and a general slowdown of the economy, the company said.\nSales in western Europe were flat. The region suffered a setback in the first quarter from a decline in orders in the Medium Voltage segment of its Energy Management business.\nThe firm, which generates roughly three-quarters of its revenue outside the euro zone, suffered a negative foreign exchange impact from the strong euro of 453 million euros (-8.4 percent) in January-March.\nThe group expects the negative currency impact on revenues to come in a range of 1.0-1.1 billion euros in 2018.\nIt expects about 80 percent of the foreign exchange impact on both top-line and margin to occur in the first half of the year, while in February the expectations were for over half.\nThe electrical equipment maker confirmed its annual forecast for adjusted EBITA organic growth towards the upper end of a 4-7 percent range on organic revenue growth of 3-5 percent.\nIt expects organic improvement in the adjusted EBITA margin at the upper end of a range of 20-50 basis points.\nSchneider, which recently took control of software designer IGE+XAO, said the positive net impact of acquisitions in the first quarter was 88 million euros.\n$1 = 0.8078 euros $1 = 0.7054 pounds Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer in Paris and Piotr Lipinski in Gdynia; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:35:32.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
