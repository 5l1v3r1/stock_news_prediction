Dallet received the support of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, according to the report. \nDallet, who has been a Milwaukee County circuit judge since 2008, will join the higher court in August, AP reported. \nThe Democrats scored an upset in a Wisconsin state Senate special election in January, capturing a conservative district held by Republicans since 2000. \nA judge had ruled in March that Governor Walker must hold special elections in two state districts in Wisconsin after Democrats said he was putting off the votes over fears of losing the formerly Republican-held seats. \nWisconsin was among the handful of battleground states that helped Trump win the presidency over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 elections. Trump carried Wisconsin by 22,748 votes.
