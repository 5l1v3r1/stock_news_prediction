We had some tough moments during the last five months after a couple of injuries in a row,” Nadal said. \n“It’s always special for me to be back here, having this trophy. It’s one of the most important events of the year for me.” \nNishikori, who missed a large part of last season with a wrist injury, grabbed an early break in the Monaco sunshine before his 31-year-old opponent won four games in a row to take control of the match. \nNadal took the opening set with a blistering forehand and went on to convert two breakpoint opportunities in the second to lift the title. \nDespite the defeat, world number 36 Nishikori will take plenty of positives from the tournament as he continues to work his way back to form and full fitness. \nNadal and Nishikori will next feature at the Barcelona Open, which begins on Monday.
