He first described a group of children with the condition as “autistic psychopaths” in 1938. Asperger’s syndrome, a mild form of autism where those affected are relatively high-functioning, was later named after him. \nVienna’s medical faculty was purged and its ranks filled with Nazi ideologues after the country’s annexation by Hitler’s Germany in 1938. \nThe paper said that after that annexation, Asperger tried to prove his loyalty to the Nazi regime, giving public lectures in which he declared his allegiance to central elements of Nazi medicine, including “race hygiene”. He also signed off on reports with “Heil Hitler”. \nHis involvement in the Nazis’ child “euthanasia” program included being on a commission that screened more than 200 patients at a home for mentally disabled children, the report said. Of those, 35 were deemed “uneducable” and sent to be killed at Spiegelgrund, where they died, it added. \n“The (child euthanasia) program served the Nazi goal of eugenically engineering a genetically ‘pure’ society through ‘racial hygiene’ and the elimination of lives deemed a ‘burden’ and ‘not worthy of life’,” the report’s publishers said in a statement. \nAsperger, who died in 1980, also recommended the transfer of two girls, one aged two and the other five, to Spiegelgrund, it said.
