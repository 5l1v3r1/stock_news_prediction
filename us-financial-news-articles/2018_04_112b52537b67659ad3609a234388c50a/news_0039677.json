The agency typically reviews an employer's log of work-related injuries and illnesses to make sure that serious injuries are reported directly to the administration within eight hours, she added.\nA Tesla spokesman said Cal-OSHA is required to investigate any claims, whether they have merit or are baseless.\n\"We have never in the entire history of our company received a violation for inaccurate or incomplete injury record-keeping,\" he said in an emailed statement.\nThe injury rate at the Fremont factory, which it had taken over from General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp , is half what it was in its final years under the previous owners, the spokesman added.\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T03:44:10.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
