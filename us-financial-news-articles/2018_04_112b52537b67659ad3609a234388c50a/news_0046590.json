I told Son to play well in Russia before we meet at the Asian Games.” \nKim said he had met with Son in Britain as part of his trip to look at candidates for Asian Games selection. \nSon, who could be selected as one of three overage wild card, was refused permission by his former club team Bayer Leverkusen to play in the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon when the South beat North Korea in the gold medal match. \nSince the Asian Games soccer tournament is not on the official FIFA calendar, clubs are under no obligation to release players but reports in Britain say Spurs are weighing up the possibility of giving Son the chance to earn an exemption. \nThe 2018/19 English Premier League season is scheduled to kick off on Aug. 11 with the final of the Asian Games football tournament taking place on Sept. 1. \n“It’s a sensitive issue,” Kim said. “I believe the Korea Football Association will handle this matter well. The men’s senior national team, the U-23 team, the KFA and the player’s club should all work closely.” Writing by Peter Rutherford; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T07:53:47.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
