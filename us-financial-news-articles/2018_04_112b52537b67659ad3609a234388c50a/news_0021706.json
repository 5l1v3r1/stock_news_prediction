(TSX:CSU) announced today it will release its first quarter results on April 25, 2018.\nThe Company’s quarterly results will be disseminated via press release and made available on the Company’s website ( www.csisoftware.com ) and SEDAR, after the Toronto Stock Exchange closes on Wednesday, April 25, 2018. As outlined in Constellation’s press release on February 23, 2018, Constellation has ceased holding conference calls to discuss the Company’s quarterly financial results. In lieu of the quarterly calls the Company has created a link on its website where shareholders can submit questions to management. Periodically the Company will publish responses to selected questions received. The Company believes this Q&A facility will eventually prove to be a more effective tool than the conference calls because it will be searchable and will provide an archive of all previous responses.\nThe Company’s goal in establishing this policy is to allow all investors ongoing access to information disclosed about Constellation’s strategy, operations, and ongoing business plans.\nWebsite link: http://www.csisoftware.com/shareholder-qa/\nAbout Constellation Software Inc.\nConstellation Software acquires, manages and builds vertical market software businesses.\nContact:\nJamal Baksh\nChief Financial Officer\n416-861-9677\nSource:Constellation Software Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.csisoftware.com/shareholder-qa/"], "published": "2018-04-12T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:38:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
