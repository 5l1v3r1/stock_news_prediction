The dossier was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele about Trump’s ties to Russia and included an allegation that involved prostitutes.\nComey told ABC that Trump denied the allegations and said he may want the FBI to investigate allegations in the dossier to prove they were not true.\nTrump was worried there was a chance his wife, Melania Trump, would believe the allegations.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:04:32.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
