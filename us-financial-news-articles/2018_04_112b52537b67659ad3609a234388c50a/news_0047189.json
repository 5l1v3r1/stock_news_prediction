Sullivan, Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, High Representative for the European Union's Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs Angelino Alfano, Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs Taro Kono and Minister of Foreign Affairs for Germany Heiko Maas prior to a reception at the Royal Ontario Museum on the first day of meetings for foreign ministers' from G7 countries in Toronto, Ontario, Canada April 22, 2018. REUTERS/Fred Thornhill Tensions with the West have increased steadily over recent years as Russia becomes involved in conflicts in Syria and Ukraine. Russia is also blamed for a nerve agent attack on a former spy in Britain last month.\nJohnson said the G7, meeting in Toronto, had agreed on the need to be vigilant about Russia, which denies involvement in the attack.\n“What we decided yesterday was that we were going to set up a G7 group that would look at Russian malign behavior in all its manifestations - whether it’s cyber warfare, whether it’s disinformation, assassination attempts, whatever it happens to be and collectively try to call it out,” he told reporters.\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas earlier told reporters that the G7 would formally call on Moscow to contribute to solving the crisis in Syria, where Russia and Iran are backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nAsked what the final statement from the two-day meeting would say, Maas told reporters that “It establishes again that there will be no political solution in Syria without Russia ... and that Russia has to contribute its share to such a solution.”\nThe G7 meeting is the first high-level gathering of the allies since the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles targeting chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack on April 7.\nThe Western countries blame Assad for the attack that killed dozens of people. The Syrian government and its Russian ally deny involvement or using poison gas on April 7.\nMaas also said the leaders of France and Germany would urge U.S. President Donald Trump not to pull out of an Iran nuclear deal with major powers.\nTrump has given the European signatories of the deal a May 12 deadline to “fix the terrible flaws” of the 2015 nuclear agreement, or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran.\nThe agreement offered Tehran relief from sanctions in exchange for curbing its nuclear program.\n“We accept that Iranian behavior has been disruptive in the region, we accept the president has some valid points that need to be addressed but we believe they are capable of being addressed (inside the deal),” said Johnson.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold and David Ljunggren; Editing by Frances Kerry and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:45:01.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
