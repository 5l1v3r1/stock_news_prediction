Soccer Football - FA Cup Semi-Final - Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 21, 2018 Manchester United's Paul Pogba celebrates after the match REUTERS/David Klein\nThe France international has scored five goals and provided 10 assists in 23 Premier League appearances this season but has been criticised on multiple occasions as United fell behind Manchester City in the title race.\nUnited were also knocked out of the Champions League and League Cup and their only hope of silverware lie in the FA Cup, where they face Chelsea in the final on May 19.\n“It’s quite funny because we don’t judge me on the midfield part,” Pogba told Sky Sports. “We judge me on assists and goals and that’s the truth.\n“I can make an outstanding game, but if I don’t score or make an assist they will say, ‘that is normal’, or whatever.\n“But if someone else does it, it is different. They will maybe be man of the match.”\nPogba’s form has improved in recent weeks as he helped United beat City and Bournemouth in the league and Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup semi-finals. He, however, had a poor performance in the shock defeat by West Bromwich Albion.\nThe Frenchman believes he is up to the task to deliver up front while still excelling in his midfield duties.\n“I think I’m judged differently, but it’s good,” he added. “It makes me improve as well, it is a challenge for me and I take it in a good way.\n“I don’t take it in a bad way. I’ll try to score and make assists and that’s it. I still want to do my job in midfield.\n“If I can help the team in attack and defence and make a difference I will do it. If I can score and assist it is even better.”\nUnited are second in the league and host rivals Arsenal on Sunday.
