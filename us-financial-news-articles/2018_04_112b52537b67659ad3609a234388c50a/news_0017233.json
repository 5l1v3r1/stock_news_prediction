The company does not publish profit figures for its first quarter.\nGivaudan has made several acquisitions to widen its footprint in natural ingredients and is implementing price increases to compensate for higher input costs.\nGivaudan confirmed its mid-term targets that include 4-5 percent sales growth on average over a five-year period.\nThe Geneva-based company last month said it was planning to launch an offer for French natural ingredients group Naturex after agreeing to buy a half-billion euro minority stake in the firm.\n$1 = 0.9567 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T09:32:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
