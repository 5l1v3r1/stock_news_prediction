It has complained in the past that it was missing good opportunities because it could not invest in them at an earlier stage. \n“This move by the ruling Conservatives will act as a strong signal to other investors and sovereign funds, from London and New York to Tokyo and Seoul,” Paul Fisher, a former director of the Bank of England who is Senior Associate at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, told Reuters. \n“This prudent Conservative Party decision is a major turning point which should now pave the way for the Parliament to instruct the fund to enter and profit from the trillion dollar unlisted renewable infrastructure market,” said Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance for the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \nFinance Minister Siv Jensen will present a white paper on the fund on Tuesday. \nShe has in the past rejected the possibility to allow the fund to invest in unlisted infrastructure as a whole, not just for renewables, citing political risk. \n“Now Parliament needs to follow up. I can’t see any good reasons why the (finance) ministry should come to a different conclusion,” Martin Norman, the head of Greenpeace Nordic’s Sustainable Finance Campaign, told Reuters. \n(This version of the story corrects spelling of interviewee’s name in 10th paragraph.)
