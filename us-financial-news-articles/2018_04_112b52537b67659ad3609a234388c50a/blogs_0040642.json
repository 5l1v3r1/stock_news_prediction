The new standard shifts revenue to later in the contract duration, analysts said.\nCompanies typically use the cost of providing services as a basis for estimating future revenue from the contracts, but the process can lead to over- or under-estimating the value of the contracts as assets on the balance sheet, experts say.\nGE's contract asset tally has soared 70 percent to $28.8 billion in 2017, from $16.9 billion in 2014, most of it in its power and aviation units. The majority of the total reflects revenue GE has already booked but for which it has not billed customers, which creates the gap between profit and cash flow, according to GE's regulatory filings.\nGE also made adjustments for new accounting standards for pensions, cash flow and taxes on Friday.\nGE's accounting is under scrutiny after earnings swung to a loss last year and GE said its 2018 results would be at the low end of its forecasted range of between $1.00 and $1.07 a share.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into GE's accounting for contract assets, raising investor concern but GE has said it is not overly concerned about the investigation.\nGE said in February that it expects to make the adjustments as it switches to the new accounting standards for contracts.\nGE said it chose to restate 2016 and 2017 earnings, a more exacting standard under the new rules, because it will allow investors to compare 2018 results with the prior years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T18:59:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
