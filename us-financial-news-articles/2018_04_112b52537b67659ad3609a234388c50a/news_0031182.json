Companies such as Volkswagen (vlkay) and General Motors (gm) abide by these rules in order to tap the Chinese market.\nTesla (tsla) seems likely to benefit from the new move, as it has shunned the joint venture option —its insistence on going it alone in China, with a production facility in the Shanghai free trade zone, seemed certain to earn it that 25% price bump, but no longer.\nAccording to the Associated Press , the Chinese authorities will start by eliminating limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers this year. In 2020, the same limits will be removed for makers of commercial vehicles, and passenger vehicles will follow a couple years later.\nThe move suggests particular confidence in China’s electric car industry. The country said last year that it was moving towards complete electrification of its automobiles, and would be phasing out the production and sale of cars that run on fossil fuels.\nSome have suggested that China’s electrification push, combined with its insistence on joint ventures, have given the country’s electric vehicle industry an unfair advantage.", "external_links": ["https://www.apnews.com/0a3c9adf61074a5da42604f648e967c4"], "published": "2018-04-17T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T17:05:17.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
