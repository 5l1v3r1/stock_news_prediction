He's one of two analysts with a sell rating, according to FactSet. \"One of Zuckerberg or Sandberg will not be in the same jobs in 12 months time.\"\nThe social media giant came under fire over its privacy practices in the wake of revelations that Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to data from some 87 million user profiles, then used it to target political ads.\nIt's important to note, a Zuckerberg resignation would be unlikely as the co-founder, CEO and chairman is the controlling shareholder of the company.\nShortly after the revelation of the data scandal, there was some speculation as to whether Facebook's board would ask Zuckerberg to step down from his current role. Zuckerberg quickly dismissed those rumors, saying he is not aware of any board discussions and that he's the \"best person to run the company.\" He also said no has been be fired as a result of the data leak.

He said that over the next few months there will be a headline risk on the social network's stock.\n\"When we look out for the next several years at Facebook and we think about the number of users ... we think they can actually manage through this,\" Josey, who has an outperform rating on Facebook, told \"Squawk Box.\"\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
