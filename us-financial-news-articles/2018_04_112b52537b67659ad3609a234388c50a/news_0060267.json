We have to go back to the polls as soon as possible,\" Luigi Di Maio said in a post on Facebook .\nThe March 4 election also saw big gains for the center-right alliance led by the anti-immigrant Lega party.

In his Facebook post, Di Maio appealed to Salvini to join his push for a snap election in June.\n\"Since parties are afraid of change, then let the citizens choose between revolution and restoration,\" he said.\nDi Maio has said previously that he would only strike a coalition with Lega if Salvini dropped his electoral ally Forza Italia, which is led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
