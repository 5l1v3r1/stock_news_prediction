(NYSE American: NBH), Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NBW) and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal Fund Inc. (NYSE American: NBO) (each a \"Fund\" and collectively, the \"Funds\") have announced a decrease in their monthly distribution rates. NBH decreased its monthly distribution rate to $0.06244 per share of common stock from the prior monthly distribution rate of $0.0675 per share. NBW decreased its monthly distribution rate to $0.04480 per share of common stock from the prior monthly distribution rate of $0.0512 per share. NBO decreased its monthly distribution rate to $0.03933 per share of common stock from the prior monthly distribution rate of $0.0437 per share.\nThe Funds have also declared their next monthly distributions, at the new rates, which are payable on May 15, 2018, with a record date of April 30, 2017 and an ex-date of April 27, 2017.\nNBH's annual distribution per share of common stock is now $0.74928 versus the prior annual amount of $0.81. The new distribution rate represents an annualized distribution rate of approximately 4.97% per share of common stock based on the Fund's net asset value of $15.07 per share on April 13, 2018.\nNBW's annual distribution per share of common stock is now $0.5376 versus the prior annual amount of $0.6144. The new distribution rate represents an annualized distribution rate of approximately 3.62% per share of common stock based on the Fund's net asset value of $14.85 per share on April 13, 2018.\nNBO's annual distribution per share of common stock is now $0.47196 versus the prior annual amount of $0.5244. The new distribution rate represents an annualized distribution rate of approximately 3.45% per share of common stock based on the Fund's net asset value of $13.69 per share on April 13, 2018.\nThe Funds' decrease in distribution rates is the result of numerous factors, including the current level of yields available in the municipal market and the impact on the Funds' levels of earnings, expected increased costs of leverage associated with forecasted interest-rate hikes and the amount of available undistributed net investment income (UNII), and with respect to NBW and NBO, the lack thereof.\nThe Funds seek to provide income that is exempt from regular federal income tax. Additionally, NBW seeks to provide income that is exempt from California personal income tax and NBO seeks to provide income that is exempt from New York State and New York City personal income tax.\nIn compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, a notice would accompany any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. This notice would be for informational purposes, and would disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital.\nAbout Neuberger Berman\nNeuberger Berman, founded in 1939, is a private, independent, employee-owned investment manager.
