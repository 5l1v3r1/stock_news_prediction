The FAA has been operating on a series of short-term extensions since 2012.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement that the \"long-term reauthorization brings the certainty our aviation industry needs to make important improvements.\"\nThe bill includes new authority for the FAA to allow additional use of drones and a provision that would make it illegal for an airline to bump an already boarded passenger from a flight. In April 2017, a United Airlines passenger was forcibly removed from his seat, prompting public outrage and congressional hearings. The airline banned the practice.\nThe bill also requires large and medium-sized airports to provide private rooms in every terminal for nursing mothers.\nGetty Images Last June, Trump unveiled a plan to privatize air traffic control which he said would modernize the system and lower flying costs. Democrats contended it would hand control of a key asset to special interests and big airlines, and some Republicans opposed it.\nUnited , Hawaiian Airlines , American Airlines and Southwest Airlines , backed the plan.\nThe bill also includes a provision after a fatal Southwest accident prompted by an engine blowout last week to require regulators to take new steps to ensure airline engine safety and report to Congress.\nThe measure will bring airlines, manufacturers, regulators and others \"together to share best practices and implement actions to address airline engine safety\" and require a review of regulations, guidance, and directives related to airline engine operation.\nThe House bill does not include some provisions opposed by airlines.\nA Senate FAA bill approved last year would require new rules prohibiting cancellation, baggage, seat selection and same-day change fees that are not \"reasonable and proportional.\"\nReporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T20:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T21:55:28.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
