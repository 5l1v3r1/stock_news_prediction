(“CME” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ/Prague Stock Exchange - CETV) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFollowing the previously announced agreement to sell our Croatia and Slovenia operations, these businesses are classified as held for sale and presented as discontinued operations for all periods. The discussion in this release relates to our continuing operations in the four remaining operating segments.\nOperational and financial highlights:\nTV advertising revenues increased 26% at actual rates and 7% at constant rates. Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased 23% at actual rates and 8% at constant rates. OIBDA increased 45% at actual rates and 26% at constant rates, resulting in OIBDA margin expansion to 22% from 19%. The increase in OIBDA improved operating income 61% at actual rates and 43% at constant rates. Unlevered free cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 37%. The improvement in our operations reduced our net leverage ratio to 4.8x at the end of the quarter. Following the agreed debt repricing, our cost of borrowing will decrease by nearly 200 basis points to about 4.0% beginning in May 2018. On April 25, 2018, Time Warner exercised 100,926,996 warrants and we will apply the proceeds of US$ 100.9 million, along with excess cash on hand, to repay EUR 110.0 million of the outstanding principal balance of the 2018 Euro Term Loan. Proceeds from the sale of our operations in Croatia and Slovenia, which we expect to close in the second quarter subject to remaining regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, will be used to repay debt, and together with the agreed repricing would decrease our cost of borrowing by an additional 80 basis points to approximately 3.2%.\nMichael Del Nin, Co-Chief Executive Officer, commented: \"Today’s series of announcements bode very well for the future of CME. Firstly, the financial results for Q1 represent our strongest start to any year in a decade. The increase in profitability and cash flow generation in the quarter have helped drive down our leverage ratio and, when paired with the proceeds from warrants that have now been exercised, allow us to complete another key step in our ongoing deleveraging plan. But just as importantly, the new refinancing transactions, which address the maturity profile of our debt and significantly cut our borrowing costs to record lows, put in place the capital structure that we need for the exciting next phase of the company’s future.\"\nChristoph Mainusch, Co-Chief Executive Officer, added: \"We won the prime time grid in each country nearly every night during the quarter, which contributed to significant revenue growth. Our channels provide extensive reach for advertisers because they continue to be the most popular source of news and entertainment in our countries. We will invest in local content, while focusing on controlling costs overall, and remain market leaders in our territories.\"\nIn this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow and constant currency percentage movements. Please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information, including definitions and reconciliations to US GAAP financial measures.\nConsolidated results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were:\n(US$ 000's, except per share data) For the Three Months Ended March 31, (unaudited) 2018 2017 % Actual % Lfl (1) Net revenues $ 139,182 $ 111,732 24.6% 6.8% Operating income 20,945 13,024 60.8% 43.3% Operating margin 15.0% 11.7% 3.3 p.p. 3.8 p.p.

These segments reflect how CME Ltd.’s operating performance is evaluated by our chief operating decision makers, who we have identified as our co-Chief Executive Officers, how operations are managed by segment managers, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.\nWe evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. From January 1, 2018, stock-based compensation and certain operating costs incurred on behalf of our segments at the corporate level have been allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Intersegment revenues and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBelow are tables showing our net revenues and OIBDA by segment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\n(US$ 000's) For the Three Months Ended March 31, (unaudited) 2018 2017 % Actual % Lfl (1) Net revenues Bulgaria $ 19,433 $ 15,305 27.0% 10.2% Czech Republic 51,534 39,474 30.6% 6.5% Romania 45,961 38,944 18.0% 5.4% Slovak Republic 22,953 18,340 25.2% 8.6% Intersegment revenues (699) (331) NM (2) NM (2) Total net revenues $ 139,182 $ 111,732 24.6% 6.8% US$ 000's) For the Three Months Ended March 31, (unaudited) 2018 2017 % Act % Lfl (1) OIBDA Bulgaria $ 2,981 $ 1,258 137.0% 105.4% Czech Republic 15,370 10,747 43.0% 16.6% Romania 18,893 14,460 30.7% 16.7% Slovak Republic 1,103 748 47.5% 27.2% Elimination 12 (8) NM (2) NM (2) Total Operating Segments 38,359 27,205 41.0% 21.3% Corporate (7,692) (6,113) (25.8)% (4.4)% Total OIBDA $ 30,667 $ 21,092 45.4% 26.4% (1) % Lfl (like-for-like) variance reflects the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs. (2) Number is not meaningful. Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. We believe that each of these metrics is useful to investors for the reasons outlined below. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, US GAAP financial measures.\nWe evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. We believe OIBDA is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance, as it excludes certain items that do not impact either our cash flows or the operating results of our operations. OIBDA and unlevered free cash flow are also used as components in determining management bonuses.\nOIBDA includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income / loss before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating our performance. From January 1, 2018, stock-based compensation and certain operating costs incurred on behalf of our segments at the corporate level have been allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance. Prior period information has been recast to conform to the current period presentation. Our key performance measure of the efficiency of our consolidated operations and our segments is OIBDA margin. We define OIBDA margin as the ratio of OIBDA to net revenues.\nFollowing a repricing of our Guarantee Fees in March 2017, the proportion of interest and related Guarantee Fees on our outstanding indebtedness that must be paid in cash has increased. In addition to this obligation to pay more Guarantee Fees in cash, we expect to use cash generated by the business to pay certain Guarantee Fees that are payable in kind. These cash payments are all reflected in free cash flow; accordingly we believe unlevered free cash flow, defined as free cash flow before cash payments for interest and Guarantee Fees, best illustrates the cash generated by our operations when comparing periods. We define free cash flow as net cash generated from continuing operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and excluding the cash impact of certain unusual or infrequent items that are not included in costs charged in arriving at OIBDA because they are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating performance.\nFor additional information regarding our business segments, see Item 1, Note 19, \"Segment Data\" in our Form 10-Q.\nWhile our reporting currency is the dollar, our consolidated revenues and costs are divided across a range of European currencies and CME Ltd.’s function currency is the Euro. Given the significant movement of the currencies in the markets in which we operate against the dollar, we believe that it is useful to provide percentage movements based on actual percentage movements (“% Act”), which includes the effect of foreign exchange, as well as like-for-like percentage movements (“% Lfl”). The like-for-like percentage movement references reflect the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs. Since the difference between like-for-like and actual percentage movements is solely the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, our discussion in this release includes constant currency percentage movements in order to highlight those factors influencing operational performance. The incremental impact of foreign exchange rates is presented in the tables accompanying such analysis.\n(US$ 000's) For the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n(unaudited) 2018 2017 Operating income $ 20,945 $ 13,024 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 7,366 5,959 Amortization of intangible assets 2,356 2,109 Total OIBDA $ 30,667 $ 21,092 (US$ 000's) For the Three Months Ended March 31, (unaudited) 2018 2017 Net cash generated from continuing operating activities $ 66,525 $ 50,420 Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from disposals (4,085 ) (5,933 ) Free cash flow 62,440 44,487 Cash paid for interest (including mandatory cash-pay guarantee fees) 4,232 4,133 Unlevered free cash flow from continuing operating activities $ 66,672 $ 48,620\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006949/en/\nCentral European Media Enterprises\nMark Kobal\nHead of Investor Relations\n+420 242 465 576\nmark.kobal@cme.net\nSource: Central European Media Enterprises Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=7&md5=6b29396cf97b38cb6fd605b083d02b8d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=4&md5=448091cf89fd9a511c6192ce458f52d0", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=5&md5=56eca7d371da82c0125b94683f76b3e3", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=1&md5=d9f3b0b28b467638ef32930d73c8d98b", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006949/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=2&md5=ea6a919d46f2d469d733dea88e67f938", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=6&md5=24151b9d516bd0b32f7a152175e7e70b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cme.net&esheet=51795134&newsitemid=20180425006949&lan=en-US&anchor=www.cme.net&index=3&md5=a069574f2df33e01d4874fc1bd12499d"], "published": "2018-04-26T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T11:59:14.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
