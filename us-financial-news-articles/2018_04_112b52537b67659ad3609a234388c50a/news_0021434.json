Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact. \nThe currency traded at 7.8499 against the U.S. dollar at 1208 GMT. It has been weakening steadily since November owing to an abundance of cash in the banking system and a widening spread between interest rates in Hong Kong and the United States. \nThe HKMA last intervened in the market in 2015, selling Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the stronger end of its trading band.
