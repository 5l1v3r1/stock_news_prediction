Published 3 Hours Ago CNBC.com \nSelf-employed or have a side gig? Filing your 2017 return isn't the only thing you're supposed to do by April 17. \nEstimated taxes owed for the first quarter of 2018 are also due on Tax Day, marking the first of four payment deadlines (see chart below). \nThe U.S. tax system is a pay-as-you-earn deal. Workers who don't have an employer withholding taxes from their paychecks are expected to pony up to the IRS as they make money throughout the year. Otherwise, look out. Payment period January 1 to March 31 April 17, 2018 April 1 to May 31 June 15, 2018 June 1 to August 31 September 17, 2018 September 1 to December 31 January 15, 2019 \n\"If you owe more than $1,000 at the end of the year and you don't qualify for one of the [exceptions], you will be penalized,\" said certified financial planner and certified public accountant DeDe Jones, managing director of Innovative Financial in Lakewood, Colorado. \nThe IRS can assess underpayment penalties above that threshold unless: \n1) You earn below $150,000 and paid 90 percent of your current-year tax burden or 100 percent of the previous year's tax bill; or \n2) You earn more than $150,000 and paid at least 90 percent of your current-year tax burden or 110 percent of what you paid the previous year. \nWhile the above generally holds true for all workers, those with taxes withheld by an employer typically are less likely to underpay by enough to generate a penalty.

A self-employed person — as both the employer and employee — pays both shares. However, half of that tax generally can be deducted, which lowers your adjusted gross income. \nTo make sure you can pay your estimated taxes when the four yearly deadlines roll around, it's wise to regularly set aside a portion of your income for that purpose. \n\"You should be putting away 30 cents of every dollar that comes through the door in preparation of taxes,\" Jones said. \"If you never the see the money, you can trick yourself into thinking you don't have it.\" \nMore from Your Money, Your Future: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T20:53:07.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
