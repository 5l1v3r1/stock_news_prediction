U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen leaves federal court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued last month to end a non-disclosure agreement related to a $130,000 payment she received from the lawyer, Michael Cohen, before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, to keep quiet about her alleged relationship with Trump a decade earlier. \nAt a hearing in Los Angeles federal court, U.S. District Judge James Otero said he needed more time to review Cohen’s and Trump’s request to put Daniels’ case on hold for 90 days. \nBut the judge told Cohen’s lawyer Brent Blakely that “there’s some gaping holes” in the request for a stay. \nThat request followed the FBI’s April 9 raids of Cohen’s home, office and a hotel room, and seizure of several boxes of documents and electronic media on various subjects. \nFederal prosecutors have been conducting a criminal probe of Cohen’s business affairs, and lawyers for Trump and Cohen have said Daniels’ civil lawsuit overlaps it. Michael Avenatti (C), lawyer for adult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, speaks to the media outside the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California after a hearing regarding Clifford's case against Donald J. Trump in Los Angeles, California, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nThey said letting her case proceed could both impair Cohen’s constitutional right under the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, and make it harder for Trump to defend himself. \nDuring Friday’s hearing, Daniels’ lawyer Michael Avenatti complained that Cohen presumably “knows where a lot of bodies are buried,” and that the defense strategy has left his client “in a room of darkness” in a case of “critical importance” to the public. \nBlakely countered by estimating that Avenatti has made 53 public appearances discussing Daniels’ case. \n“Quite frankly, I can’t think of any situation they haven’t talked,” he said, drawing courtroom laughter.
