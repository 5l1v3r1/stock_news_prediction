He has not been criminally charged.\nDuring the raids last week, FBI agents seized the contents of numerous electronic devices as well as paper documents belonging to Cohen.\nAmong other things, agents reportedly seized records related to a $130,000 payment that Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election that Trump won.\nDaniels has recently said that payment was in exchange for her silence about an affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of the president's youngest son by first lady Melania Trump.\nThe White House has denied Trump had sex with Daniels.\nOn Monday, a judge denied Cohen's and Trump's request that they be allowed to be the ones who first determine what specific records seized from Cohen should not be seen by prosecutors because they are protected by attorney-client privilege.\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood has yet to decide whether she will allow a so-called filter team made of up federal prosecutors not involved in the case to make that determination before Cohen's files can be seen by prosecutors handling the case.\nWood is also considering whether she will appoint an independent watchdog known as a special master to do all or some of that work.\nOn Wednesday, Wood signed an order allowing Trump's company, the Trump Organization, to be heard going forward in any discussion about the evidence seized from Cohen.\nCohen had been a lawyer for the Trump Organization for a decade.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:12:29.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
