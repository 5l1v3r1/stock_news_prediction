Parliament is currently discussing a bill to legalize their work.\nTaxi drivers have long complained that both companies enjoy unfair advantages as they neither pay the same taxes nor follow comparable licensing procedures.\nUber was founded in 2010 in San Francisco while its competitor Careem was founded in 2012 in Dubai.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T22:35:41.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
