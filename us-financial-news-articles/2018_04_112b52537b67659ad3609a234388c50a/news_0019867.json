MUFG has about 500 branches in Japan.\nAn MUFG spokesman declined to comment.\nThe bank had forecast a net profit of 950 billion yen for the financial year. At the end of the first nine months, it had already earned 90 percent of the full-year profit forecast. The bank is scheduled to announce its annual results in May.\n$1 = 107.0200 yen Reporting by Taro Fuse Writing by Taiga Uranaka Editing by William Mallard\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:05:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
