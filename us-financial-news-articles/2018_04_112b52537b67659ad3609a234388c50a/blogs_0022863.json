The stock is down more than 55 percent over the past year. \nIn its earnings announcement for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017, the retailer said earnings per share in fiscal 2018 would be in the low- to mid-$2 range, compared with expected guidance of $2.76 a share, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. \nIn better news, it beat analysts' expectations on both the top and bottom line for the quarter. It reported revenue of $3.72 billion, compared with expectations of $3.68 billion, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.48, outpacing estimates of $1.39. \nThe home retailer, like many of its competitors, has struggled to protect its margins amid costly investments in e-commerce. Meantime, growing online businesses must be accompanied by a right-sized and well-managed store base in order to maintain profits, and Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled with that, too. \n\"Too many of Bed Bath & Beyond's stores — especially older ones — are a mess. They are a hodge-podge of product, tightly crammed into a space that is largely devoid of inspiration. This makes them hard and sometimes unpleasant to shop,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, in an email. \n\"At peak times, lines can be long, and it can be hard to find associates to assist on the shop-floor,\" he added. \n— CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.
