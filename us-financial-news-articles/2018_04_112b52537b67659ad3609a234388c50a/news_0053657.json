Prosecutors said they would retry the case. Cosby’s second trial began in April of 2018 and ended today with the jury’s guilty verdict.\nMore than 50 women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, according to CNN. Constand was the first person to go public with her allegations against Cosby. She settled a civil suit with Cosby in March of 2005. Thirteen other Jane Does were attached to that suit. In 2015, criminal charges were filed against Cosby relating to Constand’s accusations.
