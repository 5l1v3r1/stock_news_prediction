The player, who Reuters was unable to identify, was also black. \nCSKA, who did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, said in a statement on Saturday that they were “outraged” by what they called a “slanderous” report. \n“The match, which will be remembered for its bright soccer, was held in an excellent atmosphere,” the CSKA statement said, characterising the report as a “cheap provocation”. \nReuters stood by its story, a company spokesperson said. \nWelbeck and Iwobi did not reply to messages sent to their verified Instagram accounts. \nRussia has pledged to crack down on racism in sport as it faces increased scrutiny before it hosts the soccer World Cup from June 14 to July 15. \nUEFA told Reuters on Friday that no racist behaviour had been reported to it by match officials at the game. \nHowever, UEFA said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA for infractions, including throwing objects and setting off fireworks, that were not connected to racist or discriminatory behaviour. \n“UEFA opened the case, not us,” CSKA spokesman Sergei Aksyonov said on Saturday. “There were no fireworks, and as for the objects, there were only papers carried by the wind.” \nArsenal’s draw with CSKA saw them reach the Europa League semi-finals 6-3 on aggregate after a 4-1 win in the first leg. They face Spanish club Atletico Madrid in the last four.
