In 2016 state-run utilities bought shares in PGG, helping it avoid collapse.\n“We are generating positive cash flows at the moment, which enable financing investment, this is why we do not need financing from our shareholders,” PGG Chief Executive Tomasz Rogala told reporters.\nPGG trade unions have demanded a 10 percent rise in employee salaries and have threatened to strike on April 25 as talks with the management board have so far failed to lead to an agreement.\n$1 = 3.3699 zlotys Reporting by Wojciech Zurawski Writing by Agnieszka Barteczko Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:11:34.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
