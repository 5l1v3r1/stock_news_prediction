The Syrian government and Russia have called reports of the attack bogus.\n“The raised state flag over a building in the town of Douma has heralded the control over this location and therefore over the whole of eastern Ghouta,” Major-General Yuri Yevtushenko, head of the Russian Peace and Reconciliation Centre in Syria, was Quote: d as saying by Russian news agencies.\nRussian military police were deployed in Douma on Thursday in accordance with the rebel surrender deal, Russia’s RIA news agency reported.
