Some 40,000 have been reinstated, Turkish authorities say. \nThe government says its security measures are necessary given the severity of the threats faced by Turkey, a NATO member, which shares a land border with Iraq and Syria. \nTurkey began talks to join the EU in 2005, 18 years after applying and while a series of issues, notably Cyprus and resistance to Turkish membership in Germany and France, slowed negotiations, membership talks have been stalled since 2016. \nHowever, Erdogan said last month he remained committed to seeking EU membership.
