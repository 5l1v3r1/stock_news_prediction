It will submit a complete report next year.\nThailand has more than 3 million migrant workers, according to the International Organization for Migration.\nGiving migrant workers the right to form unions, and allowing campaigners to speak up can empower them, said Surya Deva, another member of the U.N. group.\n“A critical challenge will be to end recurring attacks, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders, union leaders and community representatives,” he said.\nThe International Labour Organization last month reported continuing forced labor in the fishing industry, including abusive working conditions and excessive overtime, despite improvements.\nThe U.N. children’s agency (UNICEF) also said last week that women migrant construction workers and their children in Thailand are exposed to violence and abuse in hazardous living conditions.\nBusinesses must also apply best practices to their overseas operations to prevent abuse, Surya said.\n“If Thai companies are investing outside and benefiting from these investments, then for any rights violations that occur there, there must be a remedy mechanism in Thailand,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nLast week, farmers in Cambodia filed a lawsuit in a Thai civil court against a Thai sugar producer, accusing it of rights abuses and of kicking them off their land. It is the first such lawsuit by plaintiffs from another country.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Katy Migiro.
