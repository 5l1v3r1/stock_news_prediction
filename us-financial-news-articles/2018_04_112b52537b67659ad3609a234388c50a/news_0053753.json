Russia’s antitrust regulator FAS approved it last week and the European Commission last month gave conditional clearance, following a conditional nod in Brazil.\nAlso last week, the German group raised 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) by selling new shares to Singapore’s state investment company, with further moves expected to increase its capital.\nBayer previously said it would only launch a cash call once it had sufficient clarity that the deal, signed in September 2016, would get the go-ahead.
