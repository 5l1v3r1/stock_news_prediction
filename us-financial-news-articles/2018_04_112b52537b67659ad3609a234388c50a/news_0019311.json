There was no problem with the (approval) process,” Abe told the parliamentary panel in response to a question about the memo.\nAsked repeatedly whether he had at least had casual talks about the plan with Kake, Abe said his friend had neither consulted him nor asked for favors.\nJapan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attends a lower house budget committee session at the parliament in Tokyo, Japan, April 11, 2018.
