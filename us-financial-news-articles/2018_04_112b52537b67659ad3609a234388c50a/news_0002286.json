It did not give any details on the oil reserves discovered.\n“Initial analysis demonstrates the find is at substantial levels, capable of supporting the long-term extraction of tight oil and deep gas,” Bahrain’s Minister of Oil, Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al-Khalifa said in a statement.\nThe small non-OPEC Gulf oil producer gets it oil revenues from two fields: the onshore Bahrain field, and the offshore Abu Safah field, which is jointly shared with Saudi Arabia.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch; Editing by Mark Potter and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T20:10:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
