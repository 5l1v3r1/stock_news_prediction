Traders will probably prefer to take long positions in the yen, bracing for the possible next wave of risk version, he added.\nThe dollar, however, could extend its gains if it manages to rise above 108 yen, Innes said, adding that some stop-loss dollar buying could emerge at such levels.\nRussia and the United States tangled on Tuesday at the United Nations over the use of chemical weapons in Syria as Washington and its allies considered whether to strike at President Bashar al-Assad’s forces over a suspected poison gas attack last weekend.\nLater on Wednesday, the dollar could take its cues from U.S. consumer inflation data for March, as well as the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting.\nThe euro held steady at $1.2360, hovering near Tuesday’s high of $1.2378, its strongest level since March 28.\nThe common currency had gained a boost on Tuesday after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters in an interview that its 2.55-trillion euro ($3.15 trillion) bond buying programme would be wound down by the end of this year, which would then pave the way for the bank’s first rate rise since a fumbled move in 2011.\nThe euro gave up some gains against the dollar on Tuesday after an ECB spokesman said Nowotny’s comments about the future path of ECB rates do not represent views of the bank’s rate setting Governing Council.\nThe Canadian dollar stood at C$1.2595 per U.S. dollar. On Tuesday it had set a seven-week high of C$1.2588, helped by higher oil prices and the easing concerns about the U.S.-China trade row.
