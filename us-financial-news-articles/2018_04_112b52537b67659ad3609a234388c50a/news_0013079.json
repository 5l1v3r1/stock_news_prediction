Former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva turned himself in to police on Saturday to begin serving a 12-year prison sentence for corruption that derails his bid to return to power. Lula, who had criticized the government's efforts to cut social security spending, had easily led voting polls, unnerving traders who saw those austerity plans as key to curbing growth of public debt. Investors expect him to continue to exert influence over an election that is now without an obvious front-runner. \"With all that uncertainty, it is natural that local markets demand a higher risk premium,\" said a manager at a Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 0.7 percent, the only decliner among Latin America's main equity indexes that were mostly range-bound. Marfrig shares posted their biggest daily gain in over six years after the meatpacker unveiled a $969 million acquisition of National Beef Packing, which would make it the world's No. 2 beef processor after JBS SA. Marfrig also said it was seeking to sell an existing U.S. unit, Keystone Food LLC, with the proceeds repaying $1 billion in loans taken out to finance the acquisition of 51 percent of National Beef, the United States' fourth largest beef processor.
