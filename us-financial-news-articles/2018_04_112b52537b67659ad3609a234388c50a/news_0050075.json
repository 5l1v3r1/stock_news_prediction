It said on Sunday the 2018 targets did not include the effect of the disposal.\nIt is due to report full first quarter results on May 3.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan and Caroline Copley, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:20:54.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
