The test, in fact, showed the banks could still withstand “a significant housing market downturn” without experiencing losses that threaten their viability.\nIt expects house price growth to moderate further in 2018 although a rapid rise in Australia’s unemployment rate could drive a sharper correction, while steep interest rates could pressure some borrowers given record high household debt.\nThe household debt to income ratio in the country is at an all-time high of 190 percent as Australians took advantage of record low interest rates to invest in the housing market, worrying policymakers.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has repeatedly said its official interest rate will remain unchanged at 1.50 percent for a while yet as it awaits a pick-up in wage growth and a fall in the unemployment rate from 5.5 percent.
