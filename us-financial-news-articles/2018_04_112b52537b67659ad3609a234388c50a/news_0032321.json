Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports / Reuters “We just want to try and experience how Buboy will handle this one fight and after that we go back to Freddie,” said Pacquiao, who last fought in a unanimous points loss to Australian Jeff Horn in July last year.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Pacquiao also expressed his desire for a bout in Manila, possibly against Ukrainian Vasyl Lomachenko, after he fights Matthysse.\n“That’s one of my plans, fighting Lomachenko, and also my plan is to have a fight here in Manila. So either Lomachenko or anybody as long as it’s here in Manila, no problem. It’s going to be exciting.”\nMatthysse, who beat Thailand’s Tewa Kiram to win the vacant WBA welterweight belt in January, said he would fiercely defend the title.\n“Sure, you know, Manny’s won so many titles. He’s done so much in boxing. I’ve only won one title and I’m not going to give it up. I’ll die for it if I have to.\n“He’s had a great history in boxing and this is my time, this is my time, and I’m going to defend this title until death,” added the 35-year-old.\nReporting by Ronn Bautista; Writing by Amlan Chakraborty; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T15:05:32.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
