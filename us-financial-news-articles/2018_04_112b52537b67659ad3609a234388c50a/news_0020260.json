The tool will allow users to download data including their photos, videos and messages, he added.\nIf the tool is launched before May 25, it will help Instagram comply with upcoming European privacy laws that require data portability, technology news website TechCrunch, which first reported the news on Wednesday, said.\nInstagram, which has some 800 million users worldwide, did not say when it expects to launch the tool.\nSeparately on Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions from U.S. lawmakers about data privacy in the wake of revelations last month that several millions of Facebook users' personal data was wrongly harvested from the platform by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy.
