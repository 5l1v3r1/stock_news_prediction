Values had been surging at more than 20 percent a year at the peak of the boom.\nMelbourne saw a dip of 0.2 percent in the month, although annual growth stayed positive at 5.3 percent.\nHome prices outside the major cities edged up 0.4 percent in March to be 2.6 percent higher on the year. Combined, prices across the nation were flat for the month and up 1.2 percent for the year.\n“The stronger combined regional markets performance continues a trend that began to emerge in October last year,” noted CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless.\nThe cool-down in the major cities has been much desired by Australia’s bank watchdog. It tightened standards on investment and interest-only loans, leading banks to raise rates on some mortgage products.\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia has also been concerned that debt-fuelled speculation in property could ultimately hurt both consumers and banks.\nThe inexorable rise of prices in the major cities put homes out of the reach of many first-time buyers, becoming a political flashpoint.\nYet the boom has also been a boon for household wealth, with the government statistician estimating that housing stock is worth a heady A$6.9 trillion ($5.29 trillion) - four times the size of annual gross domestic product.\nThe explosion in wealth had helped offset weakness in wages, so a sustained downturn in home prices could now act as a drag on consumer confidence and spending.
