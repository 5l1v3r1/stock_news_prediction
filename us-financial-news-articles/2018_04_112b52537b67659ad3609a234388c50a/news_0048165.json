We are not a security threat,” one of the officials involved in the discussions told Reuters. \nEarlier this month, U.S. Assistant Trade Representative Mark Linscott held talks with India’s trade minister, Suresh Prabhu, and other senior officials in New Delhi. \nIndia exported less than 1 million tonnes of steel to the U.S. in 2017, and was the tenth biggest supplier, according to an internal note prepared by the steel ministry. Steel exports to the United States account for 2.2 percent of India’s total steel exports, it showed. \nIndia’s goods trade deficit with the United States fell by nearly six percent to less than $23 billion last year. \nThe three Indian officials involved in the trade talks said New Delhi could seek support, if needed, from other WTO member nations worried about the direction of U.S. trade policy. The commerce ministry did not respond to Reuters’ emails seeking comment.
