Total operating revenue rose to $31.77 billion from $29.81 billion a year earlier.\nAnalysts had expected adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $31.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nVerizon added 66,000 Fios internet customers during the quarter and lost 22,000 Fios video subscribers.\nVerizon’s first-quarter 2018 earnings per share included approximately 21 cents due to tax reform and accounting changes for revenue recognition.\nThe company expects savings from tax reform will generate a net $3.5 billion to $4 billion benefit to cash flow from operations in 2018, resulting in a 55 to 65 cent increase in 2018 earnings per share.
