South Korea summoned the Chinese ambassador in February to formally complain.\nChina’s Defence Ministry did not respond immediately to a request for comment on Saturday, the start of a long holiday weekend.\nThe Foreign Ministry in Beijing said in February the flights were completely in line with international law and practice and that “air defense identification zones are not territorial air space”.\nChina’s air force is increasingly active far from the country’s shores, including flying missions into the Western Pacific that often pass through a southern Japanese island chain and around self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by Beijing as its own.\nChina generally says that it has no hostile intent.\nHowever the government has said drills near Taiwan are aimed at sending the democratic island the message that there will be consequences if it tries to push for formal independence.\nAdditional reporting by Ben Blanchard in BEIJING; Writing by Josh Smith; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T11:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T11:27:55.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
