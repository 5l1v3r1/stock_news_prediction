The REIT expects to finance the Acquisition by drawing down on its operating credit facility and by obtaining a first mortgage secured by the Acquired Properties.\nAcquisition Highlights\nThe Acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to the REIT’s adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) per unit. The Acquired Properties are well-located in the Northeast Dallas sub-market. The sub-market benefits from a dense surrounding labour pool. Dallas/Fort Worth is the 4 th largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States and one of the strongest U.S. employment markets. The Acquired Properties reflect a diverse tenant roster, with the largest tenant occupying only 24% of the gross leasable area of the Acquired Properties.\n“The REIT is excited to expand its presence in Dallas/Fort Worth,” said Frank Camenzuli, Chief Executive Officer of the REIT. “The Dallas/Fort Worth industrial market is the fifth largest industrial market in the U.S. and the REIT expects to benefit from its extensive knowledge and experience in several Houston sub-markets.”\nThe Acquisition is expected to close prior to the end of the second quarter of 2018. Closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions typical for a transaction of this type. There can be no assurance that all conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived.\nAbout Agellan Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust\nThe REIT is an unincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust established pursuant to a declaration of trust under the laws of the Province of Ontario.
