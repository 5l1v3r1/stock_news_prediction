(Nasdaq:AUTO), a pioneer and leading provider of digital automotive services connecting in-market car buyers with dealers and OEMs, has appointed Jared Rowe as director, president and chief executive officer, succeeding Jeffrey Coats effective April 12, 2018.\nRowe brings more than two decades of key management experience across the automotive and marketing industries, holding senior positions at FordDirect, Cox Automotive, and Cerberus-backed YP Holdings.

We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nThis will be Rowe’s second stint with AutoWeb, as he previously served as manager of strategic business development in 1998.\nRowe commented on his appointment: “It’s been nearly 20 years since I kicked off my digital marketing career at the former Autobytel. I am excited to rejoin AutoWeb to lead the continued evolution of this digital marketing platform that specializes in providing OEMs and dealers with high-quality, performance managed campaigns. It is important to provide our clients with detailed attribution that enables them to understand the value and ROI our services and products provide.\n“We have a solid foundation to build from with an established brand, advanced technology, an extremely talented team and clients that value the quality of our products. I look forward to leveraging my experiences to help return AutoWeb to growth by introducing new strategies and initiatives that I believe will unlock the company’s full potential and maximize shareholder value.”\nRowe holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Michigan, as well as a dual Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Business Management and Automotive Marketing from Northwood University.\nAbout AutoWeb, Inc.\nAutoWeb, Inc. provides high-quality consumer leads, clicks and associated marketing services to automotive dealers and manufacturers throughout the United States.
