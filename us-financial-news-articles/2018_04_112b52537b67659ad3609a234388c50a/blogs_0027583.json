Of those who were asked to hand over money, 73 percent did. \n\"Never pay any kind of fee, no matter how reasonable it seems, when applying for a scholarship,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and publisher at the website Private Student Loans Guru . \nWhile the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 2000 helped to reduce these scams by creating stricter penalties, they do still pop up. \nAn application fee as small as $3 may not sound like much. But if there are more than 100,000 applicants and the scholarship is only around $180,000, for example, the profits from those fees will exceed the actual scholarship, Kantrowitz said. \nAnd the chances you will actually be awarded the money could be small. \nRemember, too, that these organizations do not need your Social Security number, according to Kantrowitz. \nAlso, watch out for scholarships that require work as part of the application. Kantrowitz cited one application that required law students to come up with solutions to a hypothetical legal scenario. It turns out the case was actually real for the party that was offering the scholarship. \nBecause there are a number of free scholarship search websites available, you shouldn't have to pay to search for these opportunities, Ashe said. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T16:31:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
