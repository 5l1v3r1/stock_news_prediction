At least three major chief executives took up gun control after the shooting.\nWe cant keep being reactive to this, thinking and praying it wont happen again at our schools, jobs, or our community spots, tweeted Twitter Inc and Square Inc CEO Jack Dorsey. Its beyond time to evolve our policies.\nJoining Dorsey were Uber Technologies Inc CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Box Inc CEO Aaron Levie, who respectively sent tweets on Tuesday saying #EndGunViolence and\n#NeverAgain, two Twitter hashtags commonly used by proponents of gun control.\nOn behalf of the team at zUber, sending support to everyone zYouTube and zGoogle, and gratitude to the heroic first responders, Khosrowshahi tweeted. Another tragedy that should push us again to #EndGunViolence\nEmergency calls reporting gunfire in San Bruno, California, at the headquarters of Alphabet Incs YouTube began to pour in early Tuesday afternoon, according to the city of San Bruno. Authorities have not released the identities of the suspected shooter or the victims.\nThe tweets on Thursday could be an indication that Silicon Valley may soon weigh in on the epidemic of mass killings by firearms in the United States.\nIncredibly sad to see the YouTube shooting today, Levie tweeted. Our thoughts are with our Google friends and their families. #NeverAgain\nSundar Pichai and Susan Wojcicki, the CEOs of Google and YouTube respectively, also issued statements on Tuesday while avoiding the topic of gun control.\n\"There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter zYouTube today,\" Wojcicki said. \"Our deepest gratitude to law enforcement & first responders for their rapid response. Our hearts go out to all those injured & impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family.\"\nOther tech leaders expressed sympathy for the employees of YouTube on social media on Tuesday without referencing gun control. Those included Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos, Salesforce.com Inc CEO Marc Benioff and Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg.\nFrom everyone at Apple, we send our sympathy and support to the team at YouTube and Google, especially the victims and their families, Cook said in a tweet.\n(Reporting by Salvador Rodriguez, editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T05:18:04.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
