REUTERS/Saiyna Bashir Yousafzai and her family were taken to Islamabad airport in a security convoy and they boarded a London-bound flight, said aviation official Akmal Kayani.\nYousafzai, known by her first name, Malala, has been in Pakistan since Thursday, on her first trip home since Pakistani Taliban militants shot her in the head on her way home from school for advocating for greater education for girls.\nAfter the attack, Yousafzai was airlifted abroad and underwent surgery.\nMalala on Saturday visited her old home in the Swat valley, a mountain region northwest of Islamabad, which was under the control of the militants for about two years until the army launched an offensive to clear them out.\n“I miss everything about Pakistan ... from the rivers, the mountains, to even the dirty streets and the garbage around our house,” Malala, 20, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.\nA family friend said earlier Malala planned to return home after completing her education at Oxford University, where she is reading for a degree in politics, philosophy and economics.\nMalala wrote an anonymous blog for the BBC Urdu service as a schoolgirl during the Taliban rule and later became outspoken in advocating more educational opportunities for girls.\nIn 2014, Malala became the youngest Nobel laureate, honoured for her work with the Malala Foundation, a charity she set up to support education advocacy groups with a focus on Pakistan, Nigeria, Jordan, Syria and Kenya.\nNobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai (R-front) sits with her family and Pakistan Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb (L-back) while visiting her hometown Mingora in Swat Valley, Pakistan March 31, 2018.
