Prosecutors say he is the lone survivor of a suicide squad. \nNeither he nor Ayari, who is in custody in Belgium, was present for the judgment. \nDespite the absence of both accused, security was tight around the Brussels court, with heavily armed police on guard. \nBy the time of the shootout in the Brussels district of Forest on March 15, 2016, Abdeslam had been in hiding for four months after fleeing Paris the night his elder brother blew himself up at a cafe. \nProsecutors who accuse Abdeslam of helping organize the attacks and ferry former fighters from Syria around Europe say he, too, would have died if his suicide vest had not failed to detonate. His lawyers do not dispute Abdeslam was in Paris during the attacks. \n\nFILE PHOTO - Handout file picture shows Belgian-born Salah Abdeslam on a call for witnesses notice released by the French Police Nationale information services on their twitter account November 15, 2015. Police Nationale/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo They finally stumbled across him when, with French officers, they went to inspect a suspect apartment in Forest and then came under a hail of gunfire which wounded four of them. \nAfter a three-hour siege ended with marksmen killing a 35-year-old Algerian called Mohamed Belkaid, police found an arms cache. \nAbdeslam’s DNA found at the scene linked him to the shootout and that led to his arrest three days later in a different apartment in Brussels. \nFour days after his arrest, suicide bombers attacked Brussels Airport and the city’s metro, killing 32 people. Officials believe Abdeslam had links with the bombers and that they brought forward their attack because they feared Abdeslam might reveal their plans under interrogation. \nAbdeslam was present on the opening day of the trial, but refused to answer the judge’s questions. \n\nSlideshow (3 Images) His lawyer Sven Mary told reporters on Monday that he discuss the case with his client before determining whether to appeal. \nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Richard Balmforth\n  0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
