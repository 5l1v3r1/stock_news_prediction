REUTERS/David Mdzinarishvili/File Photo Its stock rose as much as 2.6 percent on Monday morning.\nThe RevPAR forecast was stronger than expected, said Morgan Stanley analyst Thomas Allen, adding it was likely supported by continued strength in foreign markets, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.\nHilton recorded the strongest growth in its international business from Asia Pacific in the fourth quarter, led by rising demand in China as travel picks up pace in the world’s second largest economy.\nThe company said on Monday underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 9.4 million shares of its common stock from HNA.\nHilton has agreed to buy back from HNA 10 million shares of its common stock at a price equal to the one at which the underwriters will purchase shares from HNA, less 1 percent of the public offering price.\nHilton will have the option to repurchase from HNA up to an additional 6.5 million shares of its common stock at the same price.\nThe company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering, Hilton said.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Patrick Graham and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:04:18.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
