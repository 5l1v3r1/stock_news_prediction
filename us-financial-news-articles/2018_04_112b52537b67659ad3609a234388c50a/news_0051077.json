His responsibility for energy private equity investments had moved earlier this year to David Rockecharlie, the firm’s head of energy real assets, another of the sources added.\nA spokeswoman for KKR, whose assets under management totaled $168 billion at the end of 2017, declined to comment.\nOther private equity firms are beginning to launch similar offerings focused on investors’ social responsibility agenda. TPG Capital’s $2 billion Rise Fund, for example, invests in five areas including agriculture and education, and counts musician and activist Bono as a founding stakeholder.\nKKR has made investments in the past that fit into the profile of companies its new fund would target, such as China Modern Dairy Holdings, which sells higher-end dairy to the country’s growing middle class when milk standards have been questioned.\nReporting by David French and Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T00:12:10.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
