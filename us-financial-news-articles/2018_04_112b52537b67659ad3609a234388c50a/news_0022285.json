Anders Besseberg is the IBU President. It is not known what the investigation focused on.\n“The Austrian Federal Criminal Police executed a property search under warrant, at the International Biathlon Union Headquarters, on Tuesday, the 10th of April, 2018,” the IBU said.\n“The search is linked to the investigation focusing on IBU President Anders Besseberg and IBU Secretary General Nicole Resch.\n“The IBU is fully cooperating with the investigation and the office remains operational during normal business hours with Executive Director Martin Kuchenmeister serving as acting Secretary General.\n“The IBU Executive Board is taking the matter extremely seriously and continues to be committed to operating under the highest standards of good governance and transparency,” it said.\nThe IBU was recently in the spotlight after it went ahead with the season-ending World Cup in Russia in March despite the country’s doping scandal and several nations, including the United States and Canada, refusing to send athletes.
