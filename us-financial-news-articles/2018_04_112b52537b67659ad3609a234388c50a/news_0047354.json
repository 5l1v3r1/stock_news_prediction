It's kind of symbolic of working in the cloud,\" Riley said of the space, which houses dedicated IT and engineering hubs.\nIn recent years, Ansarada — an acronym of its four founding members' names — has also incorporated artificial intelligence features into its platform to help make the often-stressful deal making process more enjoyable for clients.\nIt also created the world's first M&A video game, and that \"fun\" aspect is something it has tried to nurture in the workplace.\nAnsarada Ansarada's headquarters overlooks the Sydney Harbour Bridge Swings, a mini cricket green and regular workout classes are some of the perks on offer to help staff in Sydney let loose during the working day. Don't worry, though, there are showers and laundry facilities for when things get intense.\nMeanwhile, for those who prefer to chill out on their break, there's a comfy reading corner which also plays host to the company's book club. Each quarter, staff get together to read and discuss an inspirational business book, such as Jim Collins' \"Good to Great\" and \"Blue Ocean Strategy\" by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne.\nHuddle spaces run throughout the streamlined, exposed brick workplace and allow staff to host daily leadership meetings and discuss their \"wins\" on Fridays, Riley told CNBC.\nAnsarada Ansarada's 8,460 square feet office is situated in The Rocks, Sydney, Australia But the piece de resistance comes in the architecturally award-winning building's \"Bridge\" meeting room, which boasts prime views of the city's iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House.\nAccording to Riley, it's enough to entice staff in on the weekends and even public holidays.\n\"A lot of our team and their family and friends will come up here on New Year's Eve to get an epic view and it's a really fun time,\" Riley said.\n\"Everyone can enjoy the office — not just during the workdays, it's open on the weekend and you can chill out.\"\n— CNBC's Uptin Saiidi contributed to this report\nLike this story?
