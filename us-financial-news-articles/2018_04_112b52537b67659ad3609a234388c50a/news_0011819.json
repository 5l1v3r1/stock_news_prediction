JPMorgan shares closed at $110.99 on Wednesday.\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. speaks during the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 1, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo To show that government regulation needs to be “smart,” Dimon included a reprint of a 1992 newspaper essay by the late liberal U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential candidate George McGovern, who recounted how he had learned late in life that regulations could crush businesses.\nDimon, 62, has said in the past that he was a Democrat, but in recent years he has avoided siding with a political party. He said in the letter that partisanship causes bad public policy.\nHe called for “improved merit-based immigration,” particularly for those who get an advanced degree in the United States. “We need skilled individuals in America,” he wrote.\nHe also said the U.S. should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Trump has rejected.\nInterviewed later on Thursday morning on Yahoo Finance, Dimon said he and other CEOs had talked to Trump about trade policy a month ago.\n“Obviously, we weren’t very effective,” Dimon said. “”We told him what we thought and it wasn’t what he thought at the time.”\nAsked how Trump was doing as president, Dimon said he chose to address specific policy actions: “I am not going to assess a president after a year.”\nReporting by David Henry in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T13:52:44.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
