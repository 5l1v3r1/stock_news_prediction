REUTERS/David W Cerny/File photo \nForman passed away on Friday in the United States, where he lived, after a short illness, his wife, Martina, told Czech news agency CTK on Saturday. \n“His departure was calm and he was surrounded the whole time by his family and his closest friends,” she said. \nForman was born in the Czech town of Caslav on Feb. 18, 1932. He moved to the United States after the Communist crackdown on the “Prague Spring” uprising in 1968 and became a U.S. citizen in the 1970s. \n“One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” in which a psychiatric institution becomes a microcosm of the contemporary world, and “Amadeus,” the life of 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival Antonio Salieri, earned 13 Oscars between them, including those for best director to Forman.

The film Taking Off - a look at youth protest movements - found critical acclaim but little financial success \nHe remained connected to his birth country, filming Amadeus there. \nMarried three times, Forman met his third wife Martina - a writer three decades his junior - in Prague in the 1990s. He was father to two sets of twin boys, with his second and third wives. \nJan Hrebejk, a leading Czech film director and a friend and former classmate of Forman’s wife Martina, told Reuters the director was a gifted storyteller and a great person. \n“In his films you can see the author,” he said. “When you watch them it’s as if that person is speaking to you, as the maker; not many people can do that.” Reporting by Jason Hovet and Robert Muller; editing by Angus MacSwan and Richard Pullin", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:37:39.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
