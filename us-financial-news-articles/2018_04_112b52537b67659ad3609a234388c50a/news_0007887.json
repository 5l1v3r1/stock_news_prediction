OPCW inspectors are also looking into the toxin used in the attack.\nThe Russian Defence Ministry’s official newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star), on Friday published a graphic showing events over the past week which included a mention of a visit to Russia by an “inspection group of the Technical Secretariat of the OPCW.”\nIt provided no further details.\nBritain has said that the Russian state was “highly likely” to blame for the poisoning of Skripal and his daughter. British officials say they were poisoned using the “Novichok” nerve agent which, they say, was developed in the Soviet Union.\nMoscow denies any involvement in the attack and says it has no stocks of “Novichok” or any other chemical weapon. A diplomatic row has flared up over the case, with scores of diplomats expelled in multiple countries.\nWriting by Christian Lowe; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T11:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T12:18:38.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
