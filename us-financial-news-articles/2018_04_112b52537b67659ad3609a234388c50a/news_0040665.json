(OTCQB:MZEI) or Medizone, manufacturer of the AsepticSure 速 system, today announced that certain creditors of the Company have commenced an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code against the Company. The creditors include Mr. Edwin G. Marshall, the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and Dr. Jill C. Marshall, the former Director of Operations of the Company. The Company is evaluating its options in light of the involuntary bankruptcy proceeding.\nAbout Medizone International, Inc.\nMedizone International, Inc. is focused on commercializing the AsepticSure 速 System, a superior disinfectant technology compared to conventional systems or practices. The company developed the AsepticSure 速 System to combine oxidative compounds (O 3 and H 2 O 2 ) to produce a unique mixture of free radicals (H 2 O 3 known as trioxidane) with much higher oxidative potential than ozone or hydrogen peroxide alone. After securing broad IP protection for the use of trioxidane for both healthcare and non-healthcare facility disinfecting systems and bioterrorism applications, Medizone released its AsepticSure 速 System for use in Canada, and several other global markets.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
