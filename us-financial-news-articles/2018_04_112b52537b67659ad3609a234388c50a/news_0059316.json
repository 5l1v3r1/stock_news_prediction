Concerns about rising inflation and government debt had pushed the 10-year yield to 3.035 percent on Wednesday, which was last seen in January 2014 before retreating to 2.961 percent late on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 462,133 contracts on April 24, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 371,489 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. Moreover, speculative net short positions in five-year Treasury futures increased by 18,350 contracts to 591,849 on Tuesday. On Wednesday, five-year Treasury yield reached 2.854 percent, the highest since August 2009, Reuters data showed. Meanwhile, speculators dialed back their net shorts in Eurodollar futures to 3.88 million contracts from a record high amount of 4.05 million the prior week. On the other hand, they increased their net longs in federal funds futures to 216,156 contracts on Tuesday, which was the highest level since August 2008, the latest Commitment of Traders data showed. The Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting next week, where policy-makers are expected to leave the federal funds rate unchanged.
