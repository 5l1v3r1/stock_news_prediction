This, the report said, made betting on matches more attractive to players, many of whom admitted knowledge of match-fixing.\nA survey of 3,200 players found that 16 percent indicated they had first-hand knowledge of players betting on matches, 11 percent knew of inside information being provided and 14.5 percent of match-fixing. Of these, 35 percent said they had knowledge of more than one instance.\nTennis’ governing bodies have committed to implementing the report’s final findings after a period of consultation.\nThe panel, which was chaired by Adam Lewis QC, took statements from 200 key stakeholders, conducted more than 100 interviews and collected more than 3,200 survey responses.
