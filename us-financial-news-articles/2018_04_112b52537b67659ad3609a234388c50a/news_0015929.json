It had 2.7 million active users in the last year and aims to reach 10 million by 2020.\nThe deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, follows months of restructuring by Lebara, which has faced competition from free messaging services such as Facebook’s WhatsApp.\nIt was acquired last September by Swiss family office Palmarium, a private equity and real estate investment firm.\n“We can bring something to WorldRemit and WorldRemit can bring something to us,” Graeme Oxby, who joined Lebara as its CEO following the Palmarium acquisition, told Reuters in a telephone interview.\nOxby is a telecoms veteran who served as managing director of both Virgin Mobile and Three in Britain before becoming head of Liberty Global’s European operations.\nLebara has been the subject of recent media reports that questioned the departures of former executives and its progress in disposing of non-core businesses.\nIn its 2017 results last week, Lebara updated previously announced plans to exit its non-mobile businesses and to build up repeat customers rather than one-off pay-as-you SIM card buyers. Oxby said the partnership, under with most of Lebara’s existing remittance customers will be transferred to WorldRemit, demonstrates the progress Lebara is making.\n“We see the WorldRemit services really being the dominant portion of our money-related activities,” Oxby said.\nWorldRemit is paying Lebara an upfront fee to complete the partnership, a spokesman said. The deal involves paying Lebara for referring customers its way and an incentive scheme for Lebara shop owners to sell the co-branded remittance services.\nWorldRemit has raised $220 million since its founding in 2010 from investors including Accel Partners, LeapFrog Investments and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV). William Blair acted as a financial adviser to WorldRemit.\nReporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T21:07:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
