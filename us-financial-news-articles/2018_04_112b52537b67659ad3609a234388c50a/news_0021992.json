Elections for the state parliament will be held late next year. \nThough he said the talks with the AfD would not lead to a coalition, his remarks highlight how Germany’s splintering political landscape is increasingly forcing leaders of the once dominant CDU and left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) to contemplate awkward alliances. \nBoth parties suffered grievous vote share losses in September’s national election, triggering an unprecedented six months of talks as different combinations of parties struggled to furnish Europe’s largest economy with a government. \nThe AfD’s joint leader Alexander Gauland was sceptical about Senftleben’s statement, telling reporters he doubted the CDU’s regional membership would stand for a coalition with the Left party. \n“It’s a tactical pronouncement,” he said. “Whether there’s anything behind it? I’m pretty sceptical.” \nNationwide, the conservatives are sticking to their policy of rejecting talks with either party, with one senior lawmaker accusing the Left party, more market-critical and often pro-Russian, of “wanting to lead our country out of the western community of values”. \nBut electoral arithmetic means such a tie-up may have to happen sooner or later. \nAfter providing Brandenburg with all three state premiers since 1990, the SPD’s vote share is collapsing there, leaving it barely larger than the AfD and Left parties, and giving the CDU a chance of becoming the largest party for the first time. \n“There’s a big difference between the Left in the regional and federal parliaments,” Senftleben said. “In Brandenburg nobody would listen to us if we behaved as if we had all the good ideas and the others only bad ones.” Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:58:51.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
