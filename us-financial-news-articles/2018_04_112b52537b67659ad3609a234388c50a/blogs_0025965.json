This has caused a capitulation in investor sentiment; in other words, investors have more or less waved a white flag as bitcoin has declined so sharply from its December highs. Now, I see $10,000 in the cards.\nCan the bounce continue? I am looking to positive developments from various cryptocurrency exchanges in the coming months, which should be supportive to the market. Bitcoin has been bottoming out over the last week, $500 higher than its lows in February of $6,000.\nThat level, specifically, goes back to align with the cryptocurrency's breakout in November. Now, there is now tremendous support here.\nMeanwhile, ethereum has found support of its own around the $375 mark, building somewhat of a base.\nI believe the cryptocurrency space is most bullish when these two are working together; these factors together pave the way for bitcoin to make a run back to $10,000, at a minimum, in the coming weeks.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
