It is the case that he fired me,” Mr. Williamson said. He called the phrase “a detestable euphemism” that “illuminates the character of the entire sorry affair.”\nMr. Williamson is the latest commentator to be ousted from a mainstream publication after information about their history surfaced.\nIn February , the New York Times said it had hired tech writer Quinn Norton as an opinion writer. A social-media firestorm erupted over her friendship with a neo-Nazi hacker and over her past tweets and retweets containing racist and antigay slurs. By the end of the day, Ms. Norton said she would no longer be joining the publication.\nThe announcement of Mr. Williamson’s hire at the Atlantic late last month drew scrutiny from the liberal watchdog group Media Matters .\nThe organization pointed to a 2014 tweet by Mr. Williamson in which he said abortion should be “treated like any other premeditated homicide,” adding that he viewed hanging as a potential punishment.\nMr. Goldberg initially defended Mr. Williamson’s hire. In a memo to staff last month, Mr. Goldberg wrote that Mr. Williamson’s “trollish” tweets shouldn’t be considered in isolation and touted Mr. Williamson’s reporting skills.\nIn the memo, Mr. Goldberg said the Atlantic “should be a big tent for ideas and argument” and singled out ideological diversity as an area of particular focus.\nOn Wednesday, Media Matters highlighted a podcast interview released in September 2014 with Mr. Williamson that suggested his tweet wasn’t an isolated comment.\nIn the interview he said, regarding abortion, “I would totally go with treating it like any other crime, up to and including hanging.”\nThat interview caused the Atlantic to re-evaluate its relationship with Mr. Williamson, Mr. Goldberg wrote.\n“The language he used in this podcast—and in my conversations with him in recent days—made it clear that the original tweet did, in fact, represent his carefully considered views,” he wrote.\nBen Shapiro, a conservative commentator and editor in chief of the Daily Wire, criticized Mr. Williamson’s firing on Twitter, writing that it represented an attempt by “the left” to narrow “the spectrum of acceptable discourse.” In a follow-up article for the Daily Wire , Mr. Shapiro wrote that marginalizing writers like Mr. Williamson “will result in the utter polarization of politics in the worst possible ways.”\nWrite to Benjamin Mullin at Benjamin.Mullin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:03:22.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
