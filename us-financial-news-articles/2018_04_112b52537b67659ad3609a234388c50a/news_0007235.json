The first route using Chinese-made vehicles already connects Paris and Amiens in France.\nEngert said the company, whose founders still hold a 25 percent stake, currently has no plans for an IPO.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T16:31:57.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
