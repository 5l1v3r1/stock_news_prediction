Together they seek to raise roughly 7.2 billion reais.\nDass intends to use about 350 million reais to fund technology investments, acquisition of new brands and debt payments. Dass has the rights to produce and sell shoes with the brand Fila in Latin America, as well as Umbro in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.\nIn 2017, Dass posted net revenue of 1.700 billion reais and a net income of 237 million reais.\nDass would join four other shoemakers already listed in Sao Paulo: Grendene SA, Alpargatas SA, Arezzo Industria e Comercio SA and Vulcabras Azaleia SA .\n($1 = 3.40 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl; Editing by Brad Haynes and Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T08:25:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
