Under Thailand’s strict lese majeste law, those found guilty of insulting the monarchy face up to 15 years in prison.\nAdditional reporting by Panu Wongcha-um; Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Matthew Tostevin and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T09:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T10:37:32.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
