With this acquisition—completed on April 2, 2018, at a price of approximately $120 million—Ryder is now the second largest last mile delivery provider of big and bulky goods.\nRyder has acquired 109 MXD e-commerce fulfillment facilities across the U.S. and Canada, including 21 MXD-operated cross dock hubs, 16 dedicated operations, and a network of 72 third-party agent facilities. The acquisition also includes proprietary order management and visibility technology, which features real-time tracking and a customer service portal for rapid response and resolution. This significantly expands Ryder’s omni-channel fulfillment capabilities in two key areas:\nRyder e-Commerce Fulfillment – With the additional 109 facilities, Ryder’s network now includes 121 e-commerce hubs covering more than 95% of the U.S. and Canada within a two-day delivery timeframe.
