European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters building is seen in Frankfurt, Germany, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo \nIl Sole 24 Ore newspaper cited a letter the ECB sent to banks under its supervision and the main auditing firms spelling out its concerns connected to the coming into force of the IFRS9 accounting rule. \nThe new rule, in place from the start of 2018, forces lenders to book expected, and no longer just incurred, losses. Under a temporary regime, banks can spread over five years the impact of rule’s initial application. Also, the impact is only on banks’ capital and not their earnings. \nThe ECB said banks may have postponed booking loan losses to the start of this year in order to benefit from the ‘first time adoption’ regime, Il Sole reported. \nThe ECB has also asked auditors to pay special attention to this issue when reviewing banks’ 2017 financial statements, the paper added. \nThe ECB declined to comment. \nIl Sole said that Italy’s larger lenders ruled out having to revise their 2017 accounts because they believed they had applied the new rule correctly. \nIn publishing last year’s accounts, all main Italian banks have said they would book significant writedowns at the start of 2018 in connection with the coming into force of the IFRS9 rule.
