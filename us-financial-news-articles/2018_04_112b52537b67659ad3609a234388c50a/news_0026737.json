But that's what will probably happen.\"\nThe new EU legislation, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), comes into force on May 25 and aims to give consumers control of their personal data.\nTech companies must explicitly ask consumers for consent on sharing their data. Companies will not be able to use vague or confusing statements to get consumers to agree to data sharing, and firms won't be able to bundle consent for different things together either and consent must also be easy to withdraw. For children under 16, a person holding \"parental responsibility\" must opt-in to data collection on their behalf. Consumers will be able to access the personal data being stored by companies and find out where and for what purpose it is being used.\nAn organization in breach of the GDPR law will be fined up to 4 percent of annual global turnover or 20 million euros ($24.6 million), whichever is higher.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg: GDPR will generally be a positive step for the internet 2:26 PM ET Wed, 11 April 2018 | 03:57 Facebook Product Management Director David Baser said in a blog post Monday that the company collects and receives information about people even if they're logged out or don't have a an account. \"This is because other apps and sites don't know who is using Facebook,\" he wrote.\nBaser said Facebook collects information including your computer's IP address, the type of browser you're using to access the internet, the software your computer runs (Android, macOS, Windows, iOS, etc.), and other material.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T15:57:54.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
