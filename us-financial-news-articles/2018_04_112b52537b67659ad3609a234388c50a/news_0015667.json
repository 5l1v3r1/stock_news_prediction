Both President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis have canceled travel plans for this weekend, an indication of planning under way for a possible military strike . \nIn statement issued at its headquarters in The Hague, the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said that it had asked the Syrian government to make the arrangements for the fact-finding visit.\nThe organization, known as the OPCW, is responsible for monitoring violations of the international accord banning chemical weapons. The group oversaw efforts to remove Mr. Assad’s chemical arsenal under a 2013 agreement.\nThe watchdog agency’s statement followed a Syrian and Russian proposal that the OPCW investigate the alleged chemical weapons attack at Douma. Syria and Russia said they would provide safe passage for the inspectors.\nThe White Helmets, a Syrian paramedic group that tallied the casualties, said that a Syrian government helicopter dropped a barrel bomb containing the poisonous gas on the rebel-held city of Douma on Saturday.\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the work of OPCW’s fact-finding mission was critical to establish if chemical weapons were used, but that the Security Council needed to unite behind an accountability process.\n“We have half a tool. We have a tool through OPCW that helps us establish facts, but the other part is accountability,” he said. “The missing piece here is the accountability.”\nThis image made from video released by the Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other Associated Press reporting, shows a medical worker giving toddlers oxygen through respirators following an alleged poison gas attack in the opposition-held town of Douma, in eastern Ghouta, near Damascus. Photo: Syrian Civil Defense White Helmets/Associated Press Some U.S. officials, however, have been skeptical of the Syrian and Russian offer, saying that those countries initially blocked access to the site of the alleged attack and that some of the evidence might have been destroyed.\n“We don’t have much credibility in the offers the regime put forward,” a U.S. official said shortly before the OPCW announcement. “We don’t know if the evidence has been tampered with.”\nEven if the inspection is carried out, an OPCW’s field mission to Douma might have little bearing on a U.S. decision to carry out a punitive strike against Mr. Assad.\nThe organization is authorized to determine if chemical weapons have been used but not who might have carried out a chemical attack. An investigation could also take time as sample and reports are brought out of Syria to labs for testing.\nThe U.S., in contrast, is pushing for the Security Council to establish a new U.N. independent inquiry into the continued chemical weapons attacks in Syria with a mandate to assign blame. The Security Council is scheduled to vote on the U.S. resolution on Tuesday afternoon but Russia is expected to veto it.\nRussia is offering a counterproposal proposal for a U.N. investigative team, but Western diplomats said the Russian resolution is written in such a way that makes it would make it difficult for the U.N. to hold Syria’s regime accountable. Russia’s counterproposal is separate from its request for an OPCW probe.\nIf both resolutions are vetoed, it would sharply limit the ability of international officials to find perpetrators of chemical attacks and hold them accountable.\nConsultations among the U.S. and its key allies continued amid speculation of preparations for a military attack. Mr. Trump spoke on Tuesday with British Prime Minister Theresa May, who spoke earlier in the day with French President Emmanuel Macron about the suspected chemical attack in Syria.\nWhen asked whether the U.K. would join the U.S. if it took further military action in Syria, Mrs. May didn’t answer the question directly. “We believe that those responsible should be held to account,” she said.\nThe Pentagon said little about the movement of its military assets. The U.S.S. Porter, has left a port call in France and may be headed to the eastern Mediterranean. It was one of two ships that in April 2017 launched cruise missiles from the eastern Mediterranean at an airfield in Syria after Mr. Trump ordered a strike in response to a Syrian chemical weapons attack.\nAnother U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the vicinity of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and the USS Truman aircraft carrier and its strike group left the U.S. on Monday for a previously planned tour in the Middle East.\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Trump had been planning to attend a summit of Western Hemisphere leaders at the Summit of the Americas, beginning later this week in Peru, but decided to cancel the trip, the White House said on Monday.\nMr. Mattis canceled a speech at Stanford University on Monday. He was scheduled to travel to Nevada Friday to visit several Defense Department sites, and then travel to San Francisco to meet with a group of former top federal officials, including one-time cabinet secretaries, a U.S. official said. \nThe defense chief hasn’t canceled plans to travel to New York on Thursday to speak at the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation dinner, returning to Washington Friday, the official said.\n—Jenny Gross in London and Nancy Youssef in Washington contributed to this article.\nWrite to Michael R.
