Ferrao decided not to renew his contract with the company and will be leaving to “pursue other interests,” the company said.\nFerrao led the company through a $213 million initial public offering last August, Tanzania’s largest ever, which attracted more than 40,000 local investors, most of whom were first-time participants in the country’s stock market.\nForeigners, initially banned from participating, bought 40 per cent of the shares.\nThe move was part of a government directive for mobile companies to list a minimum 25 percent stake at the local Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.\nVodacom is the only telecom company so far in Tanzania to list at the DSE, where it closed on Monday at 850 shillings ($0.3759).\nVodacom controls 32 percent market share of the country’s 40 million mobile subscribers. Other major players include Tigo Tanzania, a subsidiary of Sweden’s Millicom ( MICsdb.ST ) and a local unit of India’s Bharti Airtel ( BRTI.NS ).\nReporting by Omar Mohammed; editing by Elias Biryabarema and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T01:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T21:32:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
