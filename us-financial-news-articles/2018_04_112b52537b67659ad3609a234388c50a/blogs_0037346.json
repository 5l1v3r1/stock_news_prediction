He also thanked Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft \"for not taking part in political censorship\".\nDurov, a pioneer of social media in Russia, left the country in 2014 and has become a vocal critic of the Kremlin's policies on internet freedom.\nTelegram is widely used in countries across the former Soviet Union and Middle East. Durov said on Tuesday that Russians account for about 7 percent of its users.\nAs well as being popular with journalists and members of Russia's political opposition, Telegram has also been used by the Kremlin to communicate with reporters and arrange regular conference calls with President Vladimir Putin's spokesman.\nOn Monday the spokesman's office asked journalists who were previously subscribed to a chat in Telegram to switch to a chat that had been set up in a different messaging service, ICQ, which is part of the Russian Mail.ru technology group.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:14:28.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
