A little short you’re in the water. A little long you’ve got a difficult up-and-down. So for me it all depends on the drive.”\nDEVILISH PITCH A second shot offers high reward, but also high risk. Judge and execute a shot well, usually from a downhill lie, and a player can find the putting surface and have a chance for a two-putt birdie or, occasionally, an eagle.\nBut land short of the green and a tightly-mown bank will repel the ball back down into a watery grave.\nFiring a second shot over the green is no guarantee of success either, with an ever-present danger that the ball will take a hard bounce off a downslope and bound all the way into the pond on the adjacent 16th hole.\nAnd even if water is avoided, a devilish pitch awaits, with par suddenly becoming a good score.\nScott estimates he has gone for the green with his second shot more than half the time over the years.\nHe has played the hole well, never making worse than double-bogey in 60 attempts, for a stroke average of 4.65.\nThe hole has not been kind to Marc Leishman, however. He has a career average there of 5.36, including a triple-bogey last year, when he twice found the pond in front of the green.\n“I know I haven’t played it very well,” he said, describing it nonetheless as a “really good” hole.\nCameron Smith adopts a conservative philosophy and says there are very few scenarios in which he would not lay-up.\nThe wedge strategy was famously employed by Zach Johnson on all four days en route to victory in 2007.\nThe modern power player, however, is more likely to attack the hole, consequences be damned, which is why it could be the scene of high drama again this year, one way or the other.\nReporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T20:23:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
