The IAB, an online advertising trade body, hosts the NewFronts.\nDigital video publishers are aiming to pry loose more dollars from advertisers who have been slow to shift their budgets from TV to new video formats. This year, upfront digital ad spending is estimated to grow 25% to $3.64 billion, according to eMarketer. Upfront TV ad spending, meanwhile, is expected to increase 3% to $20.3 billion.\nWhile spending on digital video has increased in recent years, video creators haven’t shared equally in the riches. Bigger players like Google’s YouTube and traditional TV networks, which have increasingly embraced streaming their shows online, continue to dominate advertisers’ digital video outlays.\nDespite that, there’s a sizable audience for original digital video. The audience among U.S. adults has expanded from 45 million in 2013 to 72 million in 2018, an increase of 60%, according to the IAB.\nThe report defines original digital video as ad-supported, professionally produced and distributed digitally, encompassing longer original series as well as short clips and extras. The report distinguishes this content from other forms of video, such as analog TV shows that are streamed online or commercial-free series streamed by Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nAccording to the IAB, more than a third of viewers of such original digital video content are cord-cutters or cord-nevers, meaning that advertisers can’t reach them through traditional pay-TV because they have ditched their subscriptions or never signed up in the first place.\nThey also skew younger and more diverse, according to the report. About 60% of the audience is 34 years old or younger, giving marketers access to a significant swath of millennial and Gen Z viewers. About 43% of the viewership of original digital video is nonwhite compared with 36% of the total U.S. population, according to the report.\n“Younger groups are very open to digital video, and they are open to information on it, especially from brands,” said Anna Bager, executive vice president of industry initiatives at the IAB.\nThe report also describes original digital video consumers as on par with their streaming TV counterparts when it comes to viewing frequency. About 86% of original digital video consumers watch ad-supported original video content weekly, while about 89% of viewers who watch TV shows online do so at least once a week.\nThey also consume video in their own “personal prime times” throughout the morning and afternoon, departing from the traditional evening prime-time viewership on TV, the report concluded. The IAB’s study was based on more than 2,000 online interviews conducted in the U.S. in March.\nDespite the appeal, some ad buyers aren’t convinced that they need to buy digital video in an upfront manner since in most cases there is a near-unlimited supply of inventory. By contrast, the TV upfront has continued to remain relevant, despite rating declines, because there is a much more limited supply of commercial inventory on TV.\nThe IAB is touting the benefits of online video heading into a critical time period. Some ad buyers have long been somewhat skeptical about the quality of online video and have pushed aggressively for publishers and platforms to invest in higher-quality content. Compounding that hesitation, the sector is facing headwinds after advertisers’ messages have repeatedly shown up alongside YouTube content deemed unsafe for brands , which has caused brands to re-examine their ad placements.", "external_links": ["https://www.iab.com/insights/digital-video-viewers-brand-connection/?mod=article_inline", "https://www.iab.com/events/digital-content-newfronts-2018/?mod=article_inline"], "published": "2018-04-26T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T03:29:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
