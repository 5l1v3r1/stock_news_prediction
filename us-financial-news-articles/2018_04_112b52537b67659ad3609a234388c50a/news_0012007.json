Mainland China markets were closed for a holiday. \nThe top gainers among H-shares were Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd up 4.96 percent, followed by Air China agining 3.53 percent and China Vanke Co Ltd rising 3.32 percent. \nThe three biggest percentage decliners in H-shares were Sinopharm Group Co Ltd which was down 2.36 percent, Hengan International Group Co Ltd, which fell 0.71 percent, and PICC Property and Casualty which was down 0.59 percent.
