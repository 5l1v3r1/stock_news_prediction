REUTERS/Kacper Pempel “This is a real chance to seek a compromise solution, which would be in the interest of Poland and the EU,” Poland’s Deputy Foreign Minister Konrad Szymanski said after the ministerial talks where he presented Warsaw’s latest thinking.\nPRIMEVAL FOREST Bialowieza has played into the wider concerns over the rule of law in Poland as Warsaw for months ignored environmentalists’ protests and an ECJ order last July to stop logging immediately.\nECJ judge Marek Safjan said on Tuesday that the logging in the World Heritage site, which is also home to the rare European bison, had endangered many birds and insects.\nWarsaw stopped the logging earlier this year as part of the broader campaign to improve ties with the EU.\nEnvironment minister Jan Szyszko, who was responsible for the increased logging, has now been dismissed, and the ministry said on Tuesday it would respect the ruling.\n“Poland will observe the ruling,” the current Environment Minister Henryk Kowalczyk said in a statement, adding Warsaw would be sending proposals to Brussels on a possible new protection plan for the forest.\nIn 2016, Poland had tripled logging quotas and said spruce and pine trees that were more than 100 years old had to be felled because of a beetle infestation. The ECJ said on Tuesday that was not justified.\nFILE PHOTO: Logged stubs and trees are seen at one of the last primeval forests in Europe, Bialowieza forest, near Bialowieza village, Poland February 15, 2018. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Green groups say irreversible damage has been done to the delicate habitat.\n“The Polish government should consider enlarging the national park,” said James Thornton, head of the environmental campaign group ClientEarth. “This is the only way to guarantee that devastation of the forest will not happen again.”\nAdditional reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko in Warsaw and Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T11:52:21.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
