VDUs take residual crude oil from CDUs and refine it at vacuum pressure.\nAlkylation units convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.\nHydrotreaters extract hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. Sulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Dan Grebler and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:47:59.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
