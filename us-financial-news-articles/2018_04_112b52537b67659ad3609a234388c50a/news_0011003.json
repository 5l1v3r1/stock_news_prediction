For the past 23 years, we have backed the visionaries who push the boundaries of possibility and explore the frontier of the unknown,\" the website says. \"We focus on disruptive technology such as commercial space exploration, deep learning, quantum computing, robotics, AI, blockchain, and sustainable transportation, synthetic biology and clean meat.\"\nThe website refers to the firm's \"founders\" as a plural, implying that other investors may be joining Jurvetson at the outpost. The firm has yet to file any paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nA Jurvetson spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Thursday. The website is registered in the name of Jurvetson's former executive assistant and was updated in late March.\nJurvetson's apparent reemergence onto the venture capital scene is not surprising — he is responsible for two of DFJ's massive successes, SpaceX and Tesla — and that means he is likely to find a friendly base of investors, perhaps among several prior DFJ limited partners. His departure came amid internal tension at DFJ after the firm caught him lying about what it considered serious allegations, a source familiar with the situation said at the time.\n\"I am excited to move on and get back to my professional passion, helping great entrepreneurs forge the future,\" Jurvetson said in a Facebook post in November shortly after leaving DFJ.\nBut it is still a quick rebound. Mike Cagney, the former CEO of SoFi, is also back with a new startup , as Recode first reported, after his company battled allegations of sexual harassment. Travis Kalanick, too, has restarted his life after being forced to leave his job.\nJurvetson, for his part, was accused by women of having several extra-marital affairs that, in the eyes of some, crossed into the professional world . No one has publicly emerged to allege him of sexual harassment. He has denied any misconduct.\nSince his departure in November, Jurvetson has kept a low profile, though he has been making several speaking appearances on familiar topics, according to his social media pages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:15:28.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
