Here are Morganlander's reasons for his bullish view.\n• The group has fallen nearly 12 percent this year, far underperforming the broader market, and the group's valuation makes sense at this juncture.\n• Single stocks like Hormel , Pepsi , McCormick and Walmart will likely thrive, particularly Walmart, with a further push into e-commerce. The market under-appreciates the profitability, growth and balance sheets among these names.\n• Church & Dwight , the staples giant, is one particularly strong play in the space.\nBottom line: Consumer staples can weather the storm of rising interest rates, according to one portfolio manager.\nDisclaimer Disclosure: Morganlander's firm owns Hormel, Pepsi, McCormick and Walmart in its portfolio. Morganlander personally owns Church & Dwight.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
