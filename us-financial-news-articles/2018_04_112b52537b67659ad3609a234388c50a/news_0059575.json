But his lawyer later scaled back the relief being sought, saying he only wanted to prevent future charges from being filed against Manafort.\nNext week in a federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, Manafort will ask another judge to consider dismissing charges against him from the second indictment.\nReporting by Sarah N.
