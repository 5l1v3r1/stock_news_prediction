The country’s new Vice Premier Liu He, known for his tough stance on credit-driven stimulus, has made a crackdown on risk in the country’s financial sector a top priority.\nXiang Junbo, former chairman of the insurance watchdog, last April became the highest-ranking finance industry official to be investigated for corruption.\nThe high-flying former chairman of China’s Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd last month went on trial in Shanghai over alleged economic crimes, including fraud and embezzlement involving more than $10 billion.\nThe CCDI gave no further details. Huarong Asset Management was not immediately available for comment. Reuters could not immediately reach Lai for comment.\nHuarong is among China’s top state-owned bad debt managers, created in 1999 to take over distressed assets from the country’s’ “Big Four” state-owned lenders.\nThe firm posted 2017 net profit of 22 billion yuan ($3.50 billion) last month, up from 19.6 billion yuan a year earlier.\n$1 = 6.2848 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Lee Chyen Yee in SINGAPORE and Adam Jourdan in SHANGHAI; Additional reporting by Meg Shen in HONG KONG and Zhang Shu in BEIJING; Editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:14:33.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
