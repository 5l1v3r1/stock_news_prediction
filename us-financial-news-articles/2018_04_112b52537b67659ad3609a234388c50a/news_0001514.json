Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplementary information about the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and integration related expenses, foreign-exchange impacts on inter-company loans reorganizational and impairment charges. Over the past four years, we have completed seven acquisitions, two of which were transformative for the Company, and sold two of our businesses. The costs we incurred in completing such acquisitions, including the amortization of intangibles and deferred financing costs, and these divestitures have been excluded from these measures because their size and inconsistent frequency are unrelated to our commercial performance during the period, and which we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs. We exclude the impact of currency translation from these measures because foreign exchange rates are not under management's control and are subject to volatility. Other non-operating charges such as, the write-off of our interest rate swap, are excluded as the charges on not indicative of our ongoing operating cost. We believe the presentation of adjusted income from operations and adjusted operating margin provide useful information in assessing our underlying business trends and facilitates comparison of our long-term performance over given periods.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to actual income growth derived from income amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n(a) Non-GAAP Adjusted income from operations, represents GAAP income from operations, adjusted to exclude the effects of restructuring and integration expense, non-operational charges related to acquisition, divestiture and restructuring and integration costs, intangible amortization costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions, and when applicable, our share of income from joint venture operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income from operations, is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income from operations.\n(b) Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from continuing operations , represents GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude the tax-affected effects of restructuring and integration charges (related to plant closures and other charges incurred to implement our strategic goals, that do not necessarily represent a major strategic shift in operations), charges related to acquisition, and transition costs, amortization of intangibles costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions and amortization of deferred financing costs, and foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income(loss) from segment operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations.\n(c) This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the table above. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. NN, Inc. estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying NN, Inc's. overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nn-inc-files-annual-report-on-form-10-k-for-2017-300622915.html\nSOURCE NN, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.nninc.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nn-inc-files-annual-report-on-form-10-k-for-2017-300622915.html"], "published": "2018-04-03T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T03:04:08.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
