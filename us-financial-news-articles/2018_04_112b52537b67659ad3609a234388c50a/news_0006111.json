Already used and loved by hundreds of design-forward companies like Airbnb, Capital One, Evernote, Eventbrite, Facebook, Hulu, Spotify and Stripe, a version of Wake will now be offered for free for the first time ever.\nIn recent years, nearly every company has started to prioritize design and to put more resources towards creating digital experiences that resonate with their customers. Even companies that are not traditionally seen as design oriented have been forced to make significant investments in their team, process and technology in order to compete with startups entering their market and to catch up to changing consumer behavior.\nWake solves an important pain point for any organization that is trying to improve their customer experience through better web and mobile app design. By creating visibility around design projects that are in progress, Wake helps companies have critical conversations around their customer experience, better predict business outcomes and ultimately, create better digital products.\nWake also helps design teams address one of the biggest challenges that comes with scale -- staying connected and aligned. By driving visibility early in the design process, Wake improves feedback, drives faster stakeholder alignment, and gives visibility into best practices. Perhaps most importantly, it facilitates the evolution of conversations around design from the product team to the executive team, enabling companies to connect user experience and business strategy.\n“We’ve found Wake to be an essential part of our toolkit. Not only does it help the whole team see and absorb each other’s work, it enables us to ship products faster by getting the right people involved early in the process,” said Eventbrite Director of Product Design Tom Censani. “I’m excited to see how the product evolves as part of the InVision platform.”\nWake team members will be joining InVision to support the product, which will continue to operate as a separate brand. They will be closely partnering with the broader InVision product team to further develop capabilities for design visibility. The first of those enhancements is the upcoming free plan, which will bring design visibility to more product teams than ever before.\n“Design is evolving from a job done by designers into the core organizational discipline driving the success of many of the companies we love the most. A well-designed customer experience is the competitive moat of our time,” said InVision CEO and Co-Founder Clark Valberg. “By driving visibility around early design work, Wake enables stakeholders from around the organization to engage in the design process early and often, aligning business strategy, customer insight and product design. This kind of early visibility and engagement is incredibly powerful and is essential for any company that wants to succeed in today’s business landscape.”\nThis acquisition marks the ninth for InVision and is part of the company’s commitment to fostering growth and innovation in the digital product design community. In addition to partnerships, integrations and acquisitions, InVision also recently announced the Studio Platform and the Design Forward Fund by InVision , two initiatives meant to support and encourage the development of the digital product design ecosystem.\nFor more information or to sign up for Wake, please visit http://www.invisionapp.com/blog/Wake-joins-InVision .\nAbout InVision\nInVision is the digital product design platform used to make the world’s best customer experiences.
