Starting wages will be raised to at least $10 per hour for associates in the Cincinnati/Dayton area. After one year of service, associate wages will rise to $11 an hour.\nKroger has been trying to transform its company as the industry undergoes massive changes, pressured by Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and changing consumer preferences. Several grocers, including Walmart , have realigned its workforce and resources to readjust to the need to focus more digital efforts, including delivery options.\nOne Kroger effort is the roll out of \"Scan, Bag and Go,\" a platform that allows shoppers to bypass a traditional cashier in paying for items, to 400 locations by the end of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T17:10:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
