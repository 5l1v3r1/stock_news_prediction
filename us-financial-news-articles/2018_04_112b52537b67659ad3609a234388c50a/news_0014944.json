He walked one and struck out one.\nHamels also gave way to the bullpen to start the sixth inning, having allowed four hits and three walks in his five innings. He threw 94 pitches.\nRangers left-hander Alex Claudio pitched the sixth and seventh innings, allowing two hits, and righty Chris Martin worked a one-hit eighth, turning the ball over to closer Keone Kela with a three-run lead.\nKela worked around a leadoff single by Jonathan Lucroy in the ninth to record his first save.\nMazara, Chirinos and Odor had two hits apiece for the Rangers, who out-hit the A’s 10-8.\nPinder, Matt Olson and Matt Chapman collected two hits apiece for the A’s, who lost for the fourth time in five games since an Opening Day win.\nRelievers Liam Hendriks, Daniel Coulombe and Emilio Pagan threw four shutout innings, allowing one hit, to keep the A’s in the game after Graveman departed.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:18:55.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
