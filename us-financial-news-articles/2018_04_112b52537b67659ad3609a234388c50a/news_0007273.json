The game-time temperature of 40 was the second lowest in 10 home openers at the new Yankee Stadium.\nGregorius lined a three-run homer into the lower rows of the first level beyond the right field seats off Chris Archer in the third inning. With one out in the seventh, he sent a first-pitch fastball from Austin Pruitt (1-1) into the second deck in right field.\nGregorius drove in his final two runs with a two-run single in the eighth off Sergio Romo.\nIt was the most RBIs by a Yankee since Alex Rodriguez drove in 10 on April 26, 2005, when he hit three home runs against Bartolo Colon in a game against the Los Angeles Angels at the old Yankee Stadium. It also was the most RBIs by a Yankees shortstop in team history.\nGregorius’ big effort occurred on a day when Giancarlo Stanton heard boos for striking out five times for the first time in his career.\nGregorius’ second homer came after Tyler Austin snapped a 4-4 tie by scoring on a throwing error by Rays third baseman Matt Duffy on Brett Gardner’s sacrifice attempt.\nNew York’s four-run seventh also occurred after New York’s Tyler Wade was robbed of a home run by Carlos Gomez, who leapt over the right field wall to make the catch.\nAustin scored the tiebreaking run after the Tampa Bay overcame a 4-1 deficit in the sixth on Adeiny Hechavarria’s bloop single off Jonathan Holder and pinch hitter Denard Span’s two-run double off Tommy Kahnle.\nKahnle (1-0) struck out the side in the seventh.\nGregorius also scored on Wade’s base hit in the second. Before Gregorius’ final hit, Aaron Judge drew a bases-loaded walk in the eighth.\nTampa Bay scored its other run when Jesus Sucre scored on a throwing error by third baseman Brandon Drury in the third on a grounder by Duffy.\nNew York starting pitcher Jordan Montgomery allowed one run and two hits in five innings.\nArcher allowed four runs and six hits in five innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:40:18.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
