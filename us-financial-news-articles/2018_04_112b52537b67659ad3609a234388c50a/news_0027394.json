He’s also going to connect it to the visual in order to represent it,” he said. \nWhile the analytics will be ready almost instantly, video could take up to two minutes to package and deliver. \n“Fans are watching less and less the full matches, this is a fact,” HEED chief executive Danna Rabin told Reuters. \n“Being able to draw them in, in a unique way, you have a higher likelihood to connect them back to broadcasting in many ways and to different sport categories.” \nRoser Queralto, the Euroleague’s chief business officer, said player comfort had been a concern around using wearable technology, and another was ensuring the aims were clearly understood. \n“It was not only ‘Here, you put this shirt on, the Euroleague said it’,” she explained. \n“We wanted the players to understand that the days in which they were only playing, those are over. They need to be active and they need to embrace the new technology.” \n“It’s a new project. We want to give our fans new options to see and enjoy the game and we said ‘let’s go for it’.” \nCSKA Moscow, Khimki Moscow Region, Panathinaikos, Real Madrid, Olympiakos Piraeus, Zalgiris Kaunas, Fenerbahce and Baskonia Vitoria-Gasteiz are the eight playoff teams.
