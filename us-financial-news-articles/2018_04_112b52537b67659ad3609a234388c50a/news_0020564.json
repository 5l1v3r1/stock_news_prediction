By contrast, from late 2012 to late 2016, availability fell much more steeply, dropping more than two-tenths of a percentage point on average every quarter.\nCBRE said warehouse developers have been putting up buildings at a faster pace, and are coming closer to meeting overall demand. In the first quarter of 2018, CBRE reported net demand of 41 million square feet, which was 6 million square feet beyond the 35 million square feet of new completions.\nAlso in Logistics\nXPO Logistics Joins Push to Digital Freight Booking April 11, 2018 Boeing, Airbus Boost Jet Backlogs April 10, 2018 Trucking Hiring, Logistics Payrolls Surged Last Month April 6, 2018 Hurricane-Damaged Cars Moving Again as U.S. Exports April 5, 2018 “In some ways, the market is closer in equilibrium,” said Tim Savage, senior managing economist for CBRE. “We’re not seeing demand outpacing supply, because supply has basically caught up.”\nAs consumers’ preferences for shopping online has exploded in recent years, in tandem with the economy’s bounce back from recession, retailers have scrambled to find warehouse space for order-fulfillment operations. Industrial markets around the country have seen vacancies decline and rents soar as developers rushed to break ground on new facilities.\nLast year, developers completed more than 216 million square feet of new warehouse space in the U.S. markets, according to CBRE, an increase of 12% over 2016’s completions. While net demand outstripped supply in 2017 by nearly 20 million square feet, that was smaller than the gap of nearly 130 million square feet between new supply and demand in 2016.\n“The market in general remains tight,” Mr. Savage said, adding that strong consumer activity, together with a fiscal stimulus from the new tax law should keep availability low and rent levels high well into next year.\n“Given those macroeconomic fundamentals, we think the industrial space has a considerable way to go in the current cycle,” he said.\nWrite to Erica E.
