REUTERS/Damir Sagolj \nIn the torrential night-time rain, the sheets that covered them clung to the bodies. \n“You couldn’t see how many were under the sheets, but what I could see was that most were children,” Sagolj said. \nThe photo he captured was one of a series awarded the Pulitzer Prize for feature photography on Monday, described by the judging committee as “shocking photographs that exposed the world to the violence Rohingya refugees faced in fleeing Myanmar.” \nThe latest crackdown by authorities and Buddhist civilians against the Rohingya population in Myanmar’s Rakhine state created a mass exodus of over 600,000 Rohingya children, women and men who fled their homes at the end of 2017. The remains of a burned Rohingya village is seen in this aerial photograph near Maungdaw, north of Rakhine State, Myanmar September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun \nThe refugees have reported killings, rape and arson on a large scale, and senior United Nations officials have described the violence against the Muslim Rohingya population as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” \nMyanmar has denied ethnic cleansing or systematic human rights abuses, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The army has said its crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August. \nReuters has covered the plight of the Rohingya since 2012, but in 2017 it became clear that the scale of this exodus was far larger than previous migrations.

The photographers experienced almost no resistance from refugees as they photographed the refugees and asked about their experiences. \n“I had the impression that these people want everybody to know what happens to them,” Sagolj said. “They all really wanted their story to be told.” Reporting by Andrea Januta, Editing by Leela de Kretser and William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T22:52:10.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
