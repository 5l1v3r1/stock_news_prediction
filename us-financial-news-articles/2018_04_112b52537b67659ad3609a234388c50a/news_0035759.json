World Abu Dhabi in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Christopher Pike \nOil-rich Abu Dhabi is investing billions of dollars in tourism, industry and infrastructure to diversify its economy away from oil. \nIt is already home to the Louvre Abu Dhabi, Formula 1 Etihad Airways Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Ferrari World and the Yas Water Park. Two more museums – the Guggenheim and the Zayed National Museum - are being built as well as a SeaWorld theme park. \nThe Warner Bros park will be an added attraction, but with neighboring Dubai already a leading tourist destination and given the huge investment in the theme park, returns may not be immediate.
