He said it was not yet clear who had carried out the attack.\nAzari-Jahromi said the attack mainly affected Europe, India and the United States, state television reported.\n“Some 55,000 devices were affected in the United States and 14,000 in China, and Iran’s share of affected devices was 2 percent,” Azari-Jahromi was Quote: d as saying.\nIn a tweet, Azari-Jahromi said the state computer emergency response body MAHER had shown “weaknesses in providing information to (affected) companies” after the attack which was detected late on Friday in Iran.\nHadi Sajadi, deputy head of the state-run Information Technology Organisation of Iran, said the attack was neutralised within hours and no data was lost.\nReporting by Dubai newsroom Additional reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington.
