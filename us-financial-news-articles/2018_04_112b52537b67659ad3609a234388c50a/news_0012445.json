She most recently served as chief marketing officer for IMAX Corporation, where she led the company’s marketing interactions with leading Hollywood studios. During her tenure, IMAX’s revenue grew significantly faster than overall cinema industry growth. Prior to IMAX, Campbell served as Global CEO of Millward Brown. In addition to leading Womintuition, an umbrella for her consulting and other business interests, she is also a member of the board of advisors for Reimagine Holdings Group. She holds a bachelor’s of science, cum laude, in economics and business administration from Heidelberg University.\nDenise Warren is an expert in media, digital media, marketing and digital and transformational change. She’s currently CEO and founder of Netlyst LLC, a consulting and advisory practice. Previously, she served as President of Digital and CEO of East Coast Publishing for Tribune Publishing (now tronc) and spent 26 years in numerous executive positions at The New York Times Company, where she led the execution of its successful paid digital subscription model. Warren currently serves on the board of directors for Electronic Arts. She holds bachelor and management degrees from Tulane University, and an MBA in communications and media management from Fordham University.\n“We’re thrilled to welcome Eileen and Denise to the Monotype board, as they both bring extensive experience that aligns with our goal of serving the design and marketing needs of the world’s largest brands,” said Scott Landers, president and CEO of Monotype. “We’re confident that their collective experience will lead us to consider new ways of looking at our business from the customers’ perspective.”\nPamela Lenehan Named New Chair\nPamela Lenehan will be appointed Monotype’s Chair of the Board, effective immediately following the Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In addition to Monotype, Pamela is a director of two other publicly-traded companies. She has served as a Class III independent director at Monotype since 2006, as chair of the management development and compensation committee, as well as a member of the audit committee. Lenehan holds an Executive Masters Professional Director Certification, Silver Level, from the American College of Corporate Directors, a bachelor of arts in mathematical economics from Brown University and a master of arts in economics from Brown University.\n“As we continue our focus on growth and margin expansion, Pam was the obvious choice to lead the board of directors. Her deep understanding of financial systems and markets, combined with her extensive board experience, make her the ideal chair for Monotype,” said Landers.\n“Bob has been a member of our board for 10 years and has served as chairman since 2014. Doug, one of the company’s co-founders, has served on the board since 2004. Both have had a significant impact on Monotype,” continued Landers. “On behalf of the board of directors and management team, I want to thank both Bob and Doug for their leadership, guidance and counsel over the past several years.”\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements including those related to the expected contributions of Ms. Warren and Ms. Campbell to Monotype’s board of directors and the reelection of Ms. Lenehan to Monotype’s board of directors that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially.
