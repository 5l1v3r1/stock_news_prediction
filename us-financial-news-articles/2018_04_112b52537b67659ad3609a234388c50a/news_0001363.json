Still, the mood across global financial markets was cautious as concerns over a United States-China trade war lingered. The peso firmed 1.2 percent to 2,773 to the dollar, leading gains among Latin American currencies and recovering from a 0.6 percent drop the day before. The rebound was largely underpinned by an upswing in oil prices, which had posted their biggest one-day fall in almost a year the day before. China announced last week it would slap extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world's two biggest economies and triggering a sellof in risky assets. Currencies were mostly stronger, while stock markets throughout the region traded higher. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index was up 0.6 percent, as shares of Vale SA extended their recent rally in the wake of a new dividend policy. State-controlled oil company Petr√≥leo Brasileiro SA also rose, supported by the advance in crude futures.
