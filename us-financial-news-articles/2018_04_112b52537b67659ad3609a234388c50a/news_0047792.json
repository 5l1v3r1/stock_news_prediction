Talks about trade war ... they create uncertainty and make customers consider purchases a little longer.”\nFirst-quarter earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) rose 9 percent to 98 million euros ($120 million), but fell short of the 118 million euros expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.\nShares in the company were down 4.3 percent at 0936 GMT.\n“Wartsila’s profitability was a disappointment ... we had also anticipated an improvement in their (marine) outlook,” said Inderes analyst Erkki Vesola, who has a “reduce” rating on the stock.\nEskola, however, said Wartsila was well-positioned for future growth and would look for further deals after announcing last month a plan to acquire navigation company Transas for 210 million euros.\nAsked about Rolls Royce’s loss-making marine business, he said: “We will investigate all possible acquisition cases if they would support our strategy. Rolls-Royce Marine is of course very close to our strategy.”\nRolls-Royce Marine last year had sales of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion). Wartsila generated revenue of 1.3 billion euros at its Marine Solutions unit, but made roughly the same amount of service sales from ship customers.\n($1 = 0.7172 pounds)\n($1 = 0.8196 euros)\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Louise Heavens and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:24:09.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
