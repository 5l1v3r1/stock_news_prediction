At this time there is no evidence that the shooter knew the victims of this shooting or that individuals were specifically targeted,\" police said in a statement.\nAghdam's online profile shows she was a vegan activist who ran a website called NasimeSabz.com , meaning \"Green Breeze\" in Persian, where she posted about Persian culture and veganism, as well as long passages critical of YouTube.\nA screenshot of a video posted on Aghnam's YouTube channel before it was taken down on Tuesday, showed her complaining that \"YouTube filtered my channels to keep them from getting views!\"\nYouTube spokeswoman Jessica Mason could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThere are hundreds of mass shootings every year in the United States. A national debate around tighter curbs on gun ownership has intensified since the massacre of 17 people at a Florida high school in February shocked the public.
