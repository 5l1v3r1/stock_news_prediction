Trump wrote in a post in Twitter that oil prices are \"artificially very high\" and \"will not be accepted,\" triggering a selloff in oil markets. Currencies from oil-exporting economies followed along, with the Mexican and Colombian pesos both down over 1 percent. The United States cannot legally influence oil prices other than through releasing oil from its strategic reserves which it has done occasionally, most recently last year in the wake of Tropical Storm Harvey. The slump in oil prices, coupled with higher U.S. Treasury yields, also damped demand for risky emerging market assets, driving currencies throughout Latin America lower. \"The dollar is trading higher worldwide and we are tracking that movement,\" Rio Gestão analyst Bernard Gonin said. Risk-aversion helped to pull down most of the region's stock markets, though losses were limited by local issues. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index declined 0.8 percent, but shares of Embraer SA rose as much as 7 percent after a local media report said tie-up talks between the Brazilian planemaker and Boeing Co were at an advanced stage. Shares of Hypera SA dropped the most in the index after police searched the houses of several high-ranking executives.
