Equities investors shrugged off fears of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China and looked forward to the quarterly earnings season. [.N] U.S. officials said the countries could negotiate.\n“Oil prices are profiting from the general brightening of sentiment on the markets as signs emerge that the trade dispute is easing between the U.S. and China,” analysts at Commerzbank said in a note.\nSaudi Arabia announced that it would increase its official selling prices of May crude, and the move supported prices, said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.\n“It’s kind of bullish that they feel like they can justify those higher prices and not lose market share,” he said.\nThe strength of the U.S. dollar limited oil’s gains, analysts said.
