That makes it less economical to send barrels on Colonial to the East Coast or other areas in the United States.\nColonial declined to comment on why the line has been unallocated.\nGulf Coast middle distillate exports are at over 1.2 million barrels per day so far in April, a five-month high, said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. A majority of exports are heading to Central and South America, he said.\nEast Coast supply could remain tight for as long as Line 2 stays unallocated. Inventories of distillates hit their lowest levels since 2014 in the most recent week, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.\nEast Coast distillate prices have been strong due in part to both high export demand and less supply from the Gulf Coast.\nGulf Coast distillate fuel oil inventories have fallen for four consecutive weeks, according to EIA data. Gulf diesel ULSD-DIFF-USG hit its strongest levels in seven months in early April and has since weakened slightly to 4 cents per gallon below the futures benchmark on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nGulf Coast heating oil HO-DIFF-USG traded on Wednesday at 17 cents per gallon below the futures contract, near levels not seen since January, a signal of strong demand.\nA Colonial “cycle” is a five-day period when a sequence of all in-season products is pumped. The company pumps the same sequence of products every five days.\nIn 2017, Line 2 was not allocated between cycle 38 and cycle 58, a Colonial spokesman said, the equivalent of about three months.
