Many had little political import. Previously the company had only taken down fake accounts and accounts spreading fake news.\nThe new policy will include otherwise legitimate content spread by those same actors, Zuckerberg said.\n“It is clear from the evidence that we’ve collected that those organizations are controlled and operated by” the Internet Research Agency, he added.\nIn February, the agency along with two other firms and 13 Russians, was indicted by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on charges it oversaw a criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper in the presidential campaign to support then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and disparage Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
