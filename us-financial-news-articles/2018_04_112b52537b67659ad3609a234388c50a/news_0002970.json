These include advanced information technology, robotics, and pharmaceuticals, among other strategic industries. \nThe China-specific tariffs are a response to what the Trump administration calls intellectual property theft, via technology transfer policies that require companies to share technology with Chinese firms in order to do business in China. The Trump administration claims these rules are unfair and have allowed the Chinese government to misappropriate American technology. \nBut announcing new technology tariffs could in turn push China to tax American firms such as Apple that rely on Chinese manufacturing to keep their costs low. \nTrump is not the only American politician pursuing tariffs on Chinese goods. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, not usually known to agree with the president, said in Beijing over the weekend that she was not afraid of tariffs, and that U.S. policy towards China had been “ misdirected ” for decades. \nThere might be some light at the end of the tunnel: Chinese officials have urged trade talks in recent weeks in order to avoid an all-out trade war. But with no response from the U.S. government, the window to avoid a damaging conflict might be closing.
