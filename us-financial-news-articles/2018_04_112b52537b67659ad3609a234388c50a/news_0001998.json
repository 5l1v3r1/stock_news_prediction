In the meantime, it is speaking to fishing industry and Department of Defense representatives about suitable locations for the wind farm.\nThe wind power will help balance out the large amounts of solar energy consumed in RCEA's territory, Biondini said.\nCurrently RCEA sources solar from Southern California and wind energy from Oregon and Washington.\nHumboldt County has the best wind resources off the coast of California, the group said in a statement, but the deep water along its coast has prevented development of standard, fixed offshore wind turbines.\nFloating wind turbines are costly and have not been deployed widely. A small, 30 megawatt floating wind farm began operating off the coast of Scotland last year.\nThe Humboldt County project is expected to be between 100 and 150 MW, the group said.\nParticipants in the project include floating wind turbine maker Principle Power Inc, Aker Solutions, ecological consultants H.T. Harvey & Associates and environmental consulting firm Herrera Environmental Consultants Inc.
