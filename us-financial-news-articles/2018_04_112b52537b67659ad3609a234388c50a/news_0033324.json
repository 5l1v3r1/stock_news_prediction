Hopefully we can have the same game as at the beginning of this year when we beat United in a very positive way,” Vertonghen said, referring to the 2-0 Premier League win in January.

When I won my first trophy (at Ajax), the next couple followed at a very quick tempo. You just need that belief you can do it and then they will come. We’re full of confidence we can do it,” he said. \nUnited bounced back from Sunday’s shock 1-0 home Premier League defeat by bottom club West Bromwich Albion with a convincing 2-0 win at Bournemouth on Wednesday to consolidate second place in the table.”The players we good,” United manager Jose Mourinho said. “It was a good professional performance with good effort and responsibility. There was desire to score and a desire to cope with the defensive responsibilities against a fast team.” \nThe other semi-final on Sunday pits Antonio Conte’s Chelsea against relegation-threatened Southampton. \nChelsea, fifth in the league, also have strong motivation to win the trophy given their title defence ended with them facing the possibility of missing out on Champions League football next season. \nMark Hughes’s Saints will take a welcome break from their dogfight against the drop as they seek their first appearance in the FA Cup final since their 2003 defeat by Arsenal.
