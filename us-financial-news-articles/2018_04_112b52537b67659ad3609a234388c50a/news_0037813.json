(NYSE AMERICAN:ATNM) (\"Actinium\" or \"the Company\"), announced today that it has expanded its clinical development team with hiring of Vijay Reddy, M.D., Ph.D. as Vice President, Clinical Development, who will focus on Actinium’s clinical programs centered on targeted myeloablation. Actinium is differentiating itself by developing the only multi-disease, multi-target pipeline of drug candidates focused on improving bone marrow transplant access and outcomes through improved myeloablation which includes the Company’s lead program, Iomab-B, that is being studied in the Pivotal Phase 3 SIERRA study and its planned Phase 2 Actimab-MDS trial.\nDr. Mark Berger, Actinium’s Chief Medical Officer said, “I am incredibly excited to welcome Dr. Reddy, Dr. Safavi and Ms. McNamara to Actinium’s clinical development team. Vijay brings extensive clinical experience in the field of bone marrow transplant along with hematology focused drug development experience. His deep domain expertise and knowledge will allow us to capitalize on the many opportunities in myeloablation, for which our drug candidates and Actinium Warhead Enabling technology are ideally suited. Farnoush has a strong background in clinical trial execution and a proven ability to drive clinical trial enrollment, which will be of great benefit as we work to complete the SIERRA trial and launch new trials such as Actimab-MDS. Kathleen possesses a strong clinical nursing background, drug development experience and significant experience in the administration of complex therapies that will be well received by the SIERRA sites she supports. I am confident that collectively and individually, Dr. Reddy, Dr. Safavi and Ms. McNamara will make invaluable contributions that will allow us to continue to build on Actinium’s leadership position in myeloablation.”\nDr. Reddy said, “As a transplant physician I am keenly aware of Iomab-B and its value proposition for patients, so it is incredibly exciting to have the opportunity to help bring this important targeted therapy against acute myeloid leukemia to patients with a clear need that can benefit from a BM. Actinium has done a fantastic job in the execution of the SIERRA trial thus far, as evidenced by participation of many of the leading BMT centers. In addition, expansion of the myeloablation programs with the planned Actimab-MDS trial represents a compelling opportunity. I am incredibly excited by the opportunities that lie ahead for Actinium and look forward to working with Dr. Berger and my new colleagues to build the leading myeloablation company.”\nSandesh Seth, Actinium’s Chairman and CEO said, “Actinium is committed to being the leading company focused on myeloablation that improves access to and outcomes from potentially lifesaving bone marrow transplants. What started as a single asset in Iomab-B has evolved into a myeloablation franchise with the only multi-disease multitarget pipeline in myeloablation. The addition of Dr. Reddy, Dr. Safavi and Ms. McNamara will allow us to execute on the critical milestones for our pivotal Phase 3 trial for Iomab-B, efficiently launch our planned Phase 2 Actimab-MDS trial and capitalize on other opportunities in the field. We are incredibly excited for the talent we have assembled within Actinium and are motivated to make great advances with our drug candidates and technologies to better outcomes for patients.”\nDr. Reddy has specialized in hematologic oncology with a Ph.D. in cancer immunology who focused his clinical practice in the area of bone marrow transplantation.

Our targeted therapies have demonstrated the potential to result in significantly improved access to bone marrow transplant with better outcomes, namely increased marrow engraftment and survival. Our targeted therapies are ARC’s or Antibody Radio-Conjugates that combine the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies with the cell killing ability of radioisotopes. We have four clinical trials based on our AWE or Actinium Warhead Enabling Technology Platform that utilizes the isotope Actinium-225 (Ac 225 ) which emits alpha particles. In addition, our most advanced product candidate, Iomab-B, an ARC developed by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is comprised of an anti-CD45 monoclonal antibody labeled with iodine-131. We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 trial of Iomab-B for myeloablation and conditioning of the bone marrow prior to a bone marrow transplant for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) age 55 and older. A bone marrow transplant is a potentially curative treatment for patients with AML and other blood cancers including leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma as well as certain blood disorders. Iomab-B has been tested in several of these other cancers with over five hundred patients treated in several Phase 1 and 2 trials with promising results. Upon successful completion of our Phase 3 clinical trial for Iomab-B we intend to submit this candidate for marketing approval in the U.S. and European Union where it has been designated as an Orphan Drug. We are also developing a potentially best in class CD33 program using an ARC comprised of the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody lintuzumab labeled with the alpha-particle emitter actinium-225. Our most advanced CD33 program candidate, Actimab-A, is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for patients advanced over the age of 60 who are newly diagnosed with AML and ineligible for standard induction chemotherapy. Actimab-A also has Orphan Drug designation in the US and EU. Actimab-M, our second CD33 program ARC, is being studied in a Phase 1 trial for patients with refractory multiple myeloma. Actinium is also planning a Phase 2 trial for Actimab-MDS, our third CD33 program candidate, as a conditioning regimen prior to a bone marrow transplant for patients with MDS that have a p53 genetic mutation. Our Phase 1 trial studying Actimab-A with CLAG-M is our fourth CD33 program clinical trial for patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Our AWE or Actinium Warhead Enabling Technology Platform, originally developed in conjunction with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, is focused on leveraging Actinium’s know how and intellectual property to create additional ARC drug candidates by labeling Ac 225 to targeting moieties that we will either progress in clinical trials ourselves or out-license.\nMore information is available at www.actiniumpharma.com and our Twitter feed @ActiniumPharma, www.twitter.com/actiniumpharma .\nForward-Looking Statements for Actinium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nThis press release may contain projections or other “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe-harbor” provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 regarding future events or the future financial performance of the Company which the Company undertakes no obligation to update.
