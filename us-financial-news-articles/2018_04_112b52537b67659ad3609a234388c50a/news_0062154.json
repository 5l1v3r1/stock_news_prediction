Reuters could not independently verify that.\nMyanmar’s military and civilian government officials did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.\nAbout 2,000 people have been trapped in a remote forest near the village of Aung Lawt without access to aid for more than two weeks, aid workers say, adding that many are elderly, women and children.\n“The villagers trapped amid the conflict must be allowed safe passage to places of refugee and must be provided with timely humanitarian aid as soon as possible,” activists who organized Monday’s protests wrote in a statement.\nThe U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said some civilians were unable to leave conflict-affected areas and were taking shelter in churches or with host families where they received initial aid from the government and aid groups.\nFighting between government forces and ethnic minority Kachin and other insurgents has been eclipsed in media coverage by the plight of nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last August.
