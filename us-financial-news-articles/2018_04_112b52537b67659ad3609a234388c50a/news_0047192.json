He gets into action on Wednesday against the winner of Andreas Haider-Maurer against Roberto Carballes Baena. \nFresh from winning at Monte Carlo, Nadal is looking to take the Barcelona Open title for the third year running. \n“It’s a very difficult field and my draw is not going to be easy,” the 31-year-old told a news conference on Monday. “I will have some tough opponents. I will need to play very well.” \nNadal will face late entry Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals should both players reach that stage.
