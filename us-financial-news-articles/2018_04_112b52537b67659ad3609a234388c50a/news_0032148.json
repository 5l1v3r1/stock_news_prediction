Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact.\nReporting By Donny Kwok; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T04:39:36.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
