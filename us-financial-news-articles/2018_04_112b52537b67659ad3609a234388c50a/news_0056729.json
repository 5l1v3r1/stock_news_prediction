I’m simply not going to let that happen.”\nSome lawmakers scolded Pruitt, calling the alleged missteps troubling and impossible to ignore.\nDemocratic Representative Paul Tonko of New York ripped Pruitt for his “seemingly endless misconduct” and “what appears to be a propensity for grift.” Tonko criticized what he called “wasteful spending on luxury travel, personal security and, yes, office upgrades, to say nothing of his well-documented sweetheart rental from a lobbyist with business before EPA.”\nTonko also cited reports of Pruitt’s retaliation against EPA employees who have questioned his abuses and expenditures. “At the heart of all these issues is an apparent pattern of an administrator refusing accountability and putting personal and special interests ahead of the American people,” Tonko said. ‘INNUENDO AND MCCARTHYISM’\nRepresentative David McKinley of West Virginia was among some Republican lawmakers expressing support for Pruitt, saying the hearing was a “classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism,” a reference to a 1950s-era campaign to root out communists.

REUTERS/Brian Snyder\nRepublican Joe Barton of Texas also offered Pruitt some support, saying, “You are not the first person to be the victim of ... for lack of a better term ... Washington politics.”\nPruitt is due to testify before a Senate panel later in the day.\nThe EPA has defended Pruitt’s spending on travel and security, saying it has been crucial to protecting him from public threats and ensuring he can conduct confidential work, and have also pointed out that Pruitt’s lease for the room in Washington was around market rate.\nThe tumult in the administration was underscored earlier on Thursday when Trump’s physician Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration to head the Department of Veterans Affairs after allegations about misconduct mounted.\nPruitt has drawn praise from conservatives during his EPA tenure for rolling back Democratic former President Barack Obama’s policy to curb greenhouse gas emissions from power plants and other environmental regulations opposed by industry, as well as his role in Trump’s decision to abandon the 2015 Paris global climate change agreement.\nAlthough Trump has expressed support for Pruitt for his work on scaling back environmental regulations, White House sources have told Reuters officials are worried about the flow of charges against him.\nThere are nearly a dozen pending investigations into Pruitt with the EPA inspector general, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the White House Office of Management and Budget, as well as the U.S. House of Representatives oversight committee.\nRecent findings by the GAO, which said the EPA violated the law by installing a $43,000 secure soundproof booth in Pruitt’s office without notifying lawmakers first, are of particular concern, the White House sources said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Wednesday that the White House was evaluating the allegations against Pruitt. “We expect the EPA administrator to answer for them,” she said.

In recent days, five Republican Congress members have joined their ranks in calling for his ouster.
