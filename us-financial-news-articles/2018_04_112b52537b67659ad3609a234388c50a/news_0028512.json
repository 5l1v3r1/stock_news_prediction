Another said there had been no new Zodiac delays.\nAll of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because of commercial sensitivities.\n“It is well known across the industry that Zodiac is currently experiencing some production delays,” Rob Dewar, vice president of Bombardier’s CSeries program, told Reuters in a statement.\n“We are collaborating closely with their team, and we are making great progress, as reflected in our production rate of four aircraft last month,” he added.\nZodiac, recently acquired by France’s Safran, the world’s third-largest aerospace supplier, is emerging from a three-year manufacturing crisis that drew criticism from planemakers Airbus and Boeing.\n“We are very happy with the CSeries that are already flying with Swiss,” Carsten Spohr, chief executive of Germany’s Lufthansa Group, the parent company of CSeries launch customer Swiss International Air Lines.\n“What we are not so happy about are the continuing delays to deliveries. The reason is not the engines but other difficulties at Bombardier,” Spohr told Reuters.\nHe declined to specify the reasons.
