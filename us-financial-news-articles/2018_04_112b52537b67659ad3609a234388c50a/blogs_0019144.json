No. Do I want to be involved in this? No,\" Cohen said. \nFederal prosecutors in New York obtained a search warrant to carry out the raid. It followed a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election. \nCohen's description of the search clashes with what Trump said on Monday. The president said agents \"broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys.\" \nThe lawyer told CNN he would reconsider the payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels, which came on the eve of the 2016 election, because of the fallout has affected his family.
