Facebook will ask users to say whether they agree to it using data from outside sources to target them with ads, and it will check whether it’s okay for Facebook to make use of people’s political, religious, and relationship information. \nThe company will also ask users whether they’re fine with having their faces analyzed with Facebook’s facial recognition tech. Currently, it only uses this technology outside the EU and Canada—Facebook did use facial recognition on people in the EU before 2012, but in that year privacy regulators cracked down on the practice due to a lack of real consent on the part of users. \n“While the substance of our data policy is the same globally, people in the EU will see specific details relevant only to people who live there, like how to contact our Data Protection Officer under GDPR. We want to be clear that there is nothing different about the controls and protections we offer around the world,” Facebook’s chief privacy officer and deputy general counsel, Erin Egan and Ashlie Beringer, wrote in a blog post . \nSo will these changes make Facebook compliant? That remains to be seen—the EU’s privacy regulators no doubt will be studying them closely—but it certainly seems like Facebook is trying to steer people towards giving it as many permissions as possible. Facebook's facial recognition privacy settings. Facebook \nWhen presented with options, users will see a bright blue box reading “accept and continue,” and a less conspicuous box above it that reads “manage data settings.” \nAs TechCrunch’s Josh Constine, a journalist given a preview of the settings at Facebook HQ, wrote : “Facebook’s consent flow starts well enough with the screen above offering a solid overview of why it’s making changes for GDPR and what you’ll be reviewing. But with just an ‘X’ up top to back out, it’s already training users to speed through by hitting that big blue button at the bottom.” \nWhen asked to accept or decline Facebook’s new terms of service, which have been redesigned in line with the GDPR, users will see a big blue button marked “I accept,” while the option to decline the terms is almost invisible, and marked “See your options.” This is unlikely to please the EU regulators. \nAnd if those regulators end up deciding that Facebook still hasn’t fallen in line, the company could face fines as high as 4% of its global annual revenues. Based on last year’s revenues, that would be a whopping $1.6 billion.
