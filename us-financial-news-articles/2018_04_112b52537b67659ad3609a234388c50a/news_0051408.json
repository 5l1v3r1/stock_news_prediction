(NASDAQ: MORN), a leading provider of independent investment research, today announced its first-quarter 2018 financial results. Reported results reflect continued revenue growth, which contributed to strong operating income gains in the quarter.\nFirst-Quarter Financial Highlights\nRevenue increased 16.2% to $243.5 million; organic revenue increased 13.7%, which now includes PitchBook's first full quarter of contribution. Operating income increased 67.2% to $47.5 million. Free cash flow was $42.3 million, reflecting cash provided by operating activities of $59.9 million and capital expenditures of $17.6 million, or 31.4% higher than the first quarter of 2017. Diluted net income per share increased 133.3% to $0.98 compared to $0.42 2017. Net income 2018 includes an after-tax gain of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, from the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line during the quarter. Diluted net income per share also includes a net benefit of $0.08 per diluted share related to a lower effective tax rate, primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\n\"2018 is off to a great start,\" said Kunal Kapoor, Morningstar's chief executive officer. \"Broad-based growth across our products and geographic regions, led by our key investment areas, contributed to strong results in the quarter. Our core strengths in data, research, technology, and design are resonating with investors, who are turning to us to help them navigate an ever-increasing number of choices. Morningstar is well-positioned to succeed in a world where transparency, innovation, and investor outcomes take center stage. Investors know that Morningstar will act in their best interests.\"\nOverview of First-Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter was $243.5 million, an increase of 16.2% compared with the first quarter of 2017, or 13.7% higher on an organic basis. License-based revenue grew 14.0% year over year, with solid contributions from PitchBook, Morningstar Data, and Morningstar Direct. Morningstar Investment Management and Workplace Solutions grew asset-based revenue 20.7% year over year due to positive net flows and market appreciation. Growth in new issue ratings in Morningstar Credit Ratings and higher ad sales on Morningstar.com increased transaction-based revenue by 31.6%, compared to an aggregate decline 2017.\nOperating expense grew 8.2% 2018, driven by an increase in salary and compensation expenses and higher production-related costs for product development and data purchases. These expenses were partially offset by certain factors, including a shift in the timing and mix of advertising and marketing spend related to greater use of digital channels in the quarter versus direct mail campaigns, and an increase in capitalized software expenses in support of development work. The company did not begin capitalizing software development expenses related to PitchBook until the second quarter of 2017.\nFirst-quarter operating income was $47.5 million, an increase of 67.2% compared with the first quarter of 2017. First-quarter operating margin was 19.5%, compared with 13.6% in the prior year period. As noted above, operating income benefited partially from the favorable timing of certain expenses, and some of these comparisons will have an impact on future periods, including in compensation and bonus expense, advertising and marketing, and capitalized software.\nNet income in the first quarter was $41.9 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, compared with $18.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share 2017. Net income includes an after-tax gain of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, in connection with the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 24.2%, versus 31.6% in 2017, which is primarily due to the lower U.S. federal statutory tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The lower effective tax rate led to a benefit of $0.08 per diluted share in the quarter.\nUpdate on Key Investment Areas\nAs part of its long-term strategy, Morningstar's major investment areas include— Morningstar ® Data, Morningstar Direct SM , PitchBook, Workplace Solutions, Morningstar ® Managed Portfolios SM , and Morningstar Credit Ratings. As a group, these areas had organic revenue growth of 20.2% 2018. The highlights below summarize key operating metrics in these areas as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with the same date in 2017.\nRevenue for Morningstar Data was up 14.7% to $45.1 million. Morningstar Direct revenue increased 16.7% to $33.9 million and licenses for Direct increased 9.2% to 14,111 as of March 31, 2018. PitchBook revenue increased 59.2% to $20.9 million and licenses for the PitchBook Platform increased 51.4% to 15,488 as of March 31, 2018. Total assets under management and advisement for Workplace Solutions rose 17.2% to $130.8 billion as of March 31, 2018. Assets under management and advisement in Morningstar Managed Portfolios increased 33.9% to $43.8 billion as of March 31, 2018. Almost 19,000 advisors globally now use Morningstar Managed Portfolios. Morningstar Credit Ratings completed 24 new-issue ratings versus 7 2017, representing a 98.3% increase in asset value to $11.7 billion as of March 31, 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Allocation\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $355.4 million and $150.0 million of long-term debt, compared with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $353.3 million and $180.0 million of long-term debt as of December 31, 2017. The company repaid $30.0 million of the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility during the quarter.\nCash provided by operating activities was $59.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $46.5 million in the prior year. Free cash flow was $42.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $32.2 million in the prior year.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company repurchased about 92,500 shares of common stock for $8.9 million and paid $10.6 million in dividends.\nComparability of Year-Over-Year Results\nCertain items affected the comparability of first-quarter 2018 results versus the same period in 2017.\nOrganic revenue growth of 13.7% 2018 includes the full contribution of PitchBook; whereas 2017, PitchBook represented acquired revenue growth. It also excludes the impact of divestitures, primarily HelloWallet. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09 (\"ASC Topic 606\") using the modified retrospective method. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC Topic 606, whereas previously reported periods have not been adjusted. The impact to revenue from the adoption of ASC Topic 606 relates to a change in the presentation of revenue and costs associated of third-party content and data. Such revenue and costs were presented on a net basis prior to the adoption of ASC Topic 606 and are now presented on a gross basis. In the quarter ended March 31, 2018, this change resulted in an increase to revenue of $1.7 million, and a corresponding increase in cost of revenue, with no impact on operating income. We excluded the revenue amount from our presentation of organic revenue growth for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. As a result of ASC Topic 606, we also changed our accounting for expenses related to our sales commission plans this quarter. Due to our method of adoption, we recorded a contract asset, and related deferred tax liability, as of January 1, 2018, for sales commissions that were expensed in prior periods. This change resulted in an opening net adjustment to retained earnings of $17.0 million. Under ASC Topic 606, we will capitalize certain sales commissions on a go-forward basis. We expect to amortize these contract assets over a period not to exceed 36 months. The resulting net impact of this change on operating income 2018 was not material. Foreign currency translation increased operating income by $0.4 million during the first quarter, increasing revenue by $5.6 million and reducing operating expense by $5.2 million. First-quarter net income includes an after-tax gain of $7.8 million, or $0.18 per share, in connection with the sale of our 15(c) board consulting services product line in the quarter. Our effective tax rate of 24.2% in the quarter benefited from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which lowered the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The Act was not in effect 2017, when our effective tax rate was 31.6%.\nInitiation of Trading Plan for Joe Mansueto\nOn March 20, 2018, Joe Mansueto, Morningstar founder and executive chairman, established a pre-arranged stock trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to sell a portion of his Morningstar shares on a regular basis. As of March 31, 2018, Mansueto owned 24.2 million shares, or approximately 57.0% of shares outstanding. Under this current plan, Mansueto may sell up to 1.6 million shares, or 6.6% of his total shares, during a 12-month period that will begin in May 2018.\n\"It's been more than a year since I stepped down as CEO. The transition to Kunal has gone very smoothly, Morningstar is growing nicely, and I'm confident that our company is poised for future success,\" said Mansueto. \"I haven't sold any of my Morningstar shares since August 2010, so the time has come for me to diversify my assets, consistent with the advice we often give investors. I envision this plan as a multi-year program that allows me to retain a significant interest in the company while adding some incremental liquidity to Morningstar's shares. I remain very optimistic about Morningstar and its potential under Kunal's leadership.\"\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the company to comparable GAAP measures and an explanation of why the company uses them.\nAnnual Meeting\nInvestors are invited to attend Morningstar's Annual Meeting at 8 a.m. Central Time on Friday, May 18, 2018, at its corporate headquarters at 22 W.

These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nMorningstar presents consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations (organic revenue) because the company believes this non-GAAP measure helps investors better compare period-over-period results. We exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period.\nIn addition, Morningstar presents free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after making capital expenditures. Morningstar's management team uses free cash flow to evaluate its business. Free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to any measure required to be reported under GAAP (such as cash provided by (used for) operating, investing, and financing activities).\nThree months ended March 31\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nchange\nReconciliation from consolidated revenue to revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations (organic revenue):\nConsolidated revenue\n$ 243.5\n$ 209.5\n16.2%\nLess: divestitures\n-\n(1.8)\nNMF\nLess: acquisitions\n-\n-\nNMF\nLess: adoption of accounting changes\n(1.7)\n-\nNMF\nFavorable effect of foreign currency translations\n(5.6)\n-\nNMF\nRevenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of accounting changes, and the effect of foreign currency translations\n$ 236.2\n$ 207.7\n13.7%\nReconciliation from cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nCash provided by operating activities\n$ 59.9\n$ 46.5\n28.8%\nCapital expenditures\n(17.6)\n(14.3)\n23.1%\nFree cash flow\n$ 42.3\n$ 32.2\n31.4%\nMedia Contact:\nSasha Bigda, +1 312 244-7493 or Sasha.Bigda@morningstar.com\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nBarbara Noverini, CFA, +1 312 696-6164 or Barbara.Noverini@morningstar.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/morningstar-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300636683.html\nSOURCE Morningstar, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/morningstar-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300636683.html", "https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2018-morningstar-annual-shareholder-meeting-tickets-44814927655"], "published": "2018-04-26T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T01:26:22.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
