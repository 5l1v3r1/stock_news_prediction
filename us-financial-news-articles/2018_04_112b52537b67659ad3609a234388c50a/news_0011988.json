And that just maybe gave us a little bit of over-confidence that we didn’t practice in Australia,” he said.\nThe Ferrari-powered team, who made their debut in 2016, have stunned rivals with their speed this season.\nMagnussen and Grosjean started the Melbourne race fifth and sixth, the team’s best-ever starting positions.\nTheir surprising turn of speed has drawn scrutiny from rivals who have remarked on the resemblance of the team’s 2018 car to last year’s Ferrari.\nSome rivals have questioned, in talking to the media, the team’s relationship with Ferrari and the rules that allow them to share some parts.\nSteiner said none of those rivals had brought their issues to him, however.\n“They spoke about us, but not to me so I’m not worried about that,” he said.\nEditing by Alan Baldwin and Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T19:54:50.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
