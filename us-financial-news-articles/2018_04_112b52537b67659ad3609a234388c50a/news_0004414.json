Drug giants GlaxoSmithKline and Reckitt Benckiser Group as well as J ohnson & Johnson have already looked at the business. \nP&G remains the one potential bidder, though the two sides are far apart on price, with P&G looking to pay $15 billion, while Pfizer was seeking $20 billion or more, the sources said. \nPfizer is considering other options, including a joint venture with other drug makers. The pharmaceutical giant hopes to reach a decision by the end of the month. It announced a review of the business last year.
