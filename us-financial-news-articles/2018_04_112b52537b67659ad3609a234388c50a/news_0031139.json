Telegram, which was founded by Russian tech luminary Pavel Durov but operates from outside the country, refused to do so.\nAs with other modern encryption apps such as WhatsApp, the keys to Telegram users’ private conversations are held on their own devices, so the company running the service does not hold anything it can turn over.\nThe matter came to a head on Friday morning when, according to Russian news agency TASS, Telegram asked Moscow’s Tagansky court to delay hearings . Durov reportedly told his lawyers not to show up, so as “not to legitimize an outspoken farce by their presence.”\nThe court turned down the request, and swiftly ordered Telegram’s blocking. “The court ruled to satisfy the demand of Rosomnadzor,” judge Yulia Smolina said .\nAccording to Vedomosti , Telegram now has a month to appeal the block. Telegram’s lawyer told the newspaper that the messaging service plans to do so.\nFortune has asked Telegram for comment, but had received none at the time of writing.\nThe case has echoes of WhatsApp’s repeated blockage in Brazil , where prosecutors were frustrated by their inability to access the private messages of a suspect in a major drug case.\nTelegram has also frequently hit the headlines over its use by terrorists , although that is more to do with its unencrypted “channels” feature, through which people can broadcast their opinions to followers.", "external_links": ["http://tass.com/economy/999517", "https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/online/2018/04/13/766616-vopros-blokirovke-telegram-onlain-translyatsiya", "http://tass.com/world/999527"], "published": "2018-04-13T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T12:46:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
