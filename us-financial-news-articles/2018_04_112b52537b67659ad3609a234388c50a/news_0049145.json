REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo Niccol said “Mission One” is to make the brand more visible with messages that remind diners what makes the chain different.\nHe brought in a Taco Bell alum to replace long-time Chipotle marketing chief Mark Crumpacker. And the chain has also already made some “simple pivots” on messaging - releasing punchy and light-hearted ads focusing on Chipotle’s “real” ingredients such as grilled adobo chicken, freshly made chips and hand-mashed guacamole.\nOn the operational side, Chipotle set new goals for cutting food and packaging waste and linked executive compensation to sales and margin growth at restaurants.\nOther opportunities include adding new meal occasions - more likely late-night than breakfast in the near term - tweaking menus to broaden appeal, and increasing access through delivery, catering and mobile ordering, Niccol said.\nSelling the chain’s 2,441 restaurants, something some investors advocate, is not on the table.\n“We see no need to go down that path right now,” Niccol said.\nChipotle shares are up about 35 percent since Feb. 13, when the company announced Niccol’s hire. They are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 54, more than double that of McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ) and Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ), according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe 10.5 percent jump in Chipotle shares in extended trading on Wednesday brought them to $373.50. Still, they remain far below their all-time high of more than $742 in the summer of 2015, just months before news of the food poisoning outbreaks that sickened hundreds of U.S. customers and unmasked operational weaknesses at the former high-flying chain.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T23:23:17.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
