The previous worst was 11, by three players - Jumbo Ozaki in 1987, Ben Crenshaw in 1998 and Ignacio Garrido in 1999.\nGarcia also matched Tom Weiskopf and Tommy Nakajima for the worst score at a single hole in the Masters.\nWeiskopf’s 13 occurred at the par-three 12th in 1980 while Nakajima’s 13 was at the par-five 13th in 1978.\nIn the 1996 movie Tin Cup, the main character was in contention playing the final hole at a U.S. Open, only to run up a 12 after repeatedly finding the water with his approach shot.\nReporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ken Ferris and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T00:34:09.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
