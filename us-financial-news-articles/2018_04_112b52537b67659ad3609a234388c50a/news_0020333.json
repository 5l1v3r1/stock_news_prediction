Then, after a pause, she adds with a smile: “I won’t be here though”. \nAttenborough chuckles but does not dwell on the remark, instead commenting on a nearby sundial positioned in the shade of a tree, rendering it useless. \n“Isn’t it good, yes,” the queen says, before flashing a wide grin at a person standing off camera. “Had we thought of that, that it was planted in the shade?” she asks with a chuckle, adding: “It wasn’t in the shade originally, I’m sure.” \nThe queen then suggests the sundial could be moved, to which Attenborough responds that it depends whether she wishes to know the time or not. \nThe documentary, “The Queen’s Green Planet”, is scheduled for broadcast on ITV on Monday. It also features other members of the royal family as well as the actress and campaigner Angelina Jolie, who has taken part in the environmental project and is shown describing the queen as “a lovely lady”. “SOUNDS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP” \nIn a separate excerpt from the queen’s walk with Attenborough, released by ITV ahead of broadcast, the quiet of the palace garden is broken by the noise of a helicopter hovering overhead. \n“Why do they always go round and round when you want to talk?” the queen asks, adding: “Sounds like President Trump, or President Obama”, apparently referring to the aircraft used by the U.S. presidents during visits to her. \nDuring another light-hearted moment, the monarch spots a sapling bent over at an alarming angle, remarking: “Somebody sat on it I think, at the garden party”. \nThe queen and Attenborough have known each other for many years as the broadcaster, who has been making nature programmes since the 1950s and continues to draw millions of viewers with every new one, has received a series of royal honours over the years. \nThe two nonagenarians appear relaxed together, with little of the formality and rigid deference often seen in people addressing the monarch. \nThe pair look at trees planted in the palace garden to mark the birth of the queen’s children, and Attenborough is seen squatting down to read the plaques as they try and work out which tree corresponds to which prince or princess. \nThe queen, who routinely receives gifts from visitors from every corner of the planet, comments that the garden has benefitted from many gifts of roses and other plants. \n“You know, I’ve been quite difficult to give presents to, so,” she says, drawing laughter from Attenborough. “Of course they’ve said ‘Oh well, let’s give her a plant ... or a tree or something.’ Which is very nice to have.” FILE PHOTO: Britain's Queen Elizabeth walks with broadcaster David Attenborough during her visit to the \"Wild London\" exhibition in Richmond, west London May 15, 2012.
