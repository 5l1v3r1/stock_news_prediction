That followed last month’s $16 billion syndicated loan refinancing, which expanded the original facility by $6 billion.\nFahad al-Saif, speaking by telephone late on Wednesday, noted that together, the two exercises raised a net $17 billion — in the range of the $16 billion-$18 billion that Riyadh initially planned to borrow internationally this year.\nAs a result, Riyadh will focus on raising money domestically for the rest of this year, Saif said. It has said it wants about 65 percent of its debt to be domestic and 35 percent foreign, plus or minus 10 percent.\n“We still have the local portion to finance. As you’re aware we are obliged to find the best place to fund our issuances, and I think the focus from now going forward is the local market development.”\nSaudi Arabia has borrowed 18 billion riyals ($4.8 billion)domestically so far this year with monthly issues of riyal-denominated Islamic bonds, and plans to raise about 60 to 70 billion riyals in total in 2018, subject to market conditions, Saif said.\nThis month the Saudi stock exchange began listing domestic government bonds in a move that is expected to facilitate riyal issuance by encouraging secondary market trade.\nBut Saif said Riyadh would not neglect the international market because it was keen to ensure a stable yield curve. “We are very committed on being a regular issuer, a responsible borrower in this market.”\nHe added, “We are focused on liquidity, and when I say liquidity I very much mean balancing between supply and demand, and obtaining further investor diversity.\n“We are very much focused on secondary market behavior, on how exactly each point of the curve behaves, and we want our curve to become stable, reliable, and to become a benchmark for the region.”\nWhile the kingdom has no immediate plan to make an international issue of Islamic bonds, it might do so in the second half of 2018 to maintain its presence in the sukuk area and provide supply to sharia-compliant investors.\nThe potential sukuk issue would be smaller than Saudi Arabia’s previous international sukuk transaction, which was $9 billion, Saif said.\nRiyadh issued its latest international bond a few days before a planned global issue by Qatar, which would be Doha’s first foreign bond sale since Saudi Arabia and allies cut diplomatic and transport links with Qatar last June, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies.\nSome bankers and fund managers told Reuters that by absorbing some demand in the market, the Saudi issue might complicate Qatar’s funding plan, potentially forcing Doha to offer higher yields.\nAsked if Qatar was a consideration in the timing of the Saudi deal, Saif said it was determined by market conditions.\n“We are a sophisticated debt management office. We looked into market volatility, supply, reverse inquiries, and we looked into all of these circumstances.”\nSaif said the decision to issue maturities of seven, 12 and 31 years – while the common standards for large transactions are five, 10 and 30 years – was due to discussions with investors.\n“We had empty buckets into these points and actually we wanted to add more points to continue building our yield curve where investors and other issuers can use the Saudi curve as a benchmark.”\nEditing by Andrew Torchia and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:43:39.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
