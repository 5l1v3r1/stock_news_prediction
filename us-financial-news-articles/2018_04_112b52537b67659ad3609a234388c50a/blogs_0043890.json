He left eight Astros stranded on base and limited them to 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position. \nAltavilla got into trouble immediately after entering in the sixth. He walked Evan Gattis on four pitches, then threw a wild pitch that allowed the runner to advance to second. \nMcCann then launched a 2-1 pitch into the right field bleachers to give the Astros their first lead. It was McCann’s first home run of the season. \nThe Astros added their final run in the eighth as Gattis singled off Chasen Bradford and was replaced by pinch runner Derek Fisher. Left-hander Wade LeBlanc then hit McCann with a pitch, and a wild pitch moved Fisher to third. Fisher scored on George Springer’s sacrifice fly. \nIt didn’t take long for Houston to tie the score after Cano’s home run. \nYuli Gurriel led off the second with a double and moved to third on third baseman Kyle Seager’s throwing error on Alex Bregman’s infield single. \nGurriel scored on a groundout by Josh Reddick. The Astros loaded the bases with one out, but Miranda caught Jake Marisnick looking at a called third strike and then struck out Springer to get out of the inning. \n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T01:17:38.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
