Bad weather in February and March also dented sales.\nShares in Travis Perkins, down 21 percent year-on-year, were down 1.2 percent at 0751 GMT.\nLast month Kingfisher, Europe’s second largest home improvement retailer, warned the outlook for the UK market was “more uncertain” after a dip in trading.\nOn Thursday Homebase/Bunnings, the No. 2 player in Britain, reported a 15.4 percent slump in quarterly sales. Owner Australia’s Wesfarmers is reviewing the future of the business.\nTravis Perkins’ overall like-for-like sales rose 3.0 percent in the first quarter, benefiting from a strong performance in the restructured plumbing & heating business where underlying sales rose 19.7 percent.\nThe group, which trades from over 20 businesses, noted that recent market lead indicators such as mortgage approvals, housing transactions, house prices and consumer confidence have been mixed.\n“Assuming no further deterioration in market conditions, at this early stage of the year the group is on track to meet its expectations for 2018,” it said.\nSeparately on Friday a long-running survey by market research company GfK found British consumer sentiment fell back this month as households grew more worried about their finances and remained gloomy about the outlook for the economy.\nAnother survey from mortgage lender Nationwide said house prices in Britain rose a bit more quickly this month after touching a seven-month low in March.\nIn February Travis Perkins forecast a flat performance in 2018 and said it would slow investment in non-priority areas. It made core earnings of 380 million pounds in 2017.
