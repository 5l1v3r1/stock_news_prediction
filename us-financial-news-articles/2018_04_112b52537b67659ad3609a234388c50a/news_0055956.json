Nevertheless, the currency losses were partially offset by an uptick in advertising sales and reduced costs.\nLike broadcasters in other markets, Televisa has been forced to reinvent itself amid increasing competition from internet-based streaming services.\nAfter longtime Chief Executive Emilio Azcarraga said he would step down last year, Televisa executives Bernardo Gómez and Alfonso de Angoitia took over as co-chief executives in January. Azcarraga remains chairman of the board.\nThe company said in February it was considering whether to keep the company intact or spin off some divisions amid the upheaval in the media business.\n($1= 18.303 pesos)\nReporting by Julia Love; Additional reporting by Sheky Espejo and Noe Torres; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T02:50:22.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
