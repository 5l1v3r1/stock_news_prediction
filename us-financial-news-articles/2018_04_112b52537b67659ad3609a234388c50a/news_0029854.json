Rusal holds a 20 percent stake in Rio's Queensland Alumina refinery in Australia, as concerns over supply shortages focus not only on aluminium but also the substance used to make the metal. \"China and Russia's aluminium industry are now both affected by the sanctions,\" consultancy AZ China said in a note over the weekend, referring to a 10 percent import tariff imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. \"Trump's policies are bound to have an impact on the global aluminium landscape,\" it added. China, the world's largest aluminium producer, \"may be able to step in and supply metal to Rusal customers, possibly even for political reasons\", but this would be \"only a temporary alleviation on the impact\", said AZ China.
