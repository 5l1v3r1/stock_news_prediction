Amazon beat out Google and Apple , which earned the top spot from 15% and 11% of respondents, respectively. Other companies citied in the poll include Facebook, Microsoft , Tesla, and Uber.\nAccording to Recode, which published the findings on Sunday, nearly 2,800 American adults responded to the survey. It was conducted between April 8 and April 9.\nOf course, the poll is based on subjective opinions and only looks at tech companies, so it’s important to note that Amazon, Google, and Apple might either stand far above—or far behind—other companies in other industries. It does, however, shed light on public opinion about some of the tech world’s most popular companies. And it suggests that Amazon has found a way to position itself as having a positive impact on the world.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nBut there are aspects of the poll results might surprise you. Facebook , the world’s largest social network and a company that has come under fire of late for allowing user data to slip into the hands of third-parties , was cited by 10% of respondents as having the most positive impact, making it the fourth most popular choice. What’s more, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who was grilled recently by lawmakers over his company’s privacy efforts, was cited by 17% of respondents as having the biggest positive impact on the average person’s life. He trailed Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Google CEO Sundar Pichai at 22% and 18%, respectively.\nStill, asking which company had the “most positive impact” doesn’t necessarily shed light on which companies are having the polar opposite effect. Recode cited a separate survey from pollster Tavis McGinn that found that 32% of people believe Facebook actually negatively impacts society.\n", "external_links": ["https://www.recode.net/2018/4/12/17215142/facebook-negative-impact-society-mark-zuckerberg-poll", "https://www.recode.net/2018/4/22/17261132/amazon-positive-impact-society-tech-company-survey"], "published": "2018-04-23T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T23:39:53.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
