Khawaja Asif speaks during an interview with Reuters at his office in Islamabad, Pakistan July 18, 2013. REUTERS/Mian Khursheed/Files\nThe Islamabad High Court verdict against Asif is one of several judicial setbacks for the PML-N since the Supreme Court removed party founder Nawaz Sharif as prime minister in July.\nAsif told Geo TV he would challenge the decision in the Supreme Court. It was not clear if he would have to relinquish control of the foreign ministry, since he could remain in charge as an adviser to the prime minister.\nAsif, a close ally of Sharif, is one of the most high-profile PML-N figures in government and was among names tipped to replace Sharif when the three-time prime minister was disqualified by the Supreme Court over some undeclared income.\nSharif and other top PML-N officials have complained that the judiciary is targeting the party ahead of the general election, which is expected in July.\nUsman Dar, a rival politician from Asif’s constituency in the town of Sialkot, near the Indian border, filed a petition against Asif to have him disqualified over the possession of an “iqama”, a work permit for the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nThe court ruled Asif did not fully disclose his status as an employee of a UAE company and therefore was “not qualified” to be in parliament.\nThe court removed him using Article 62 of the constitution, which stipulates parliamentarians must be “honest and righteous” and which was also used to oust Sharif.\n“We have handed down this judgment with a heavy heart,” the Islamabad High Court said in its verdict.\n“Not only because a seasoned and accomplished political figure stands disqualified but more so because the dreams and aspirations of 342,125 registered voters have suffered a setback,” the court added, referring to Sialkot voters.\nSharif, speaking shortly after the verdict against Asif was announced, urged party workers to mobilise ahead of the elections no matter what happens in the courts.\nSharif and some family members are facing a Supreme Court-ordered trial in an anti-corruption court, which is expected to make a ruling as early as next month. Sharif could face prison if convicted.\nSharif denies wrongdoing.\n“Even if I go to jail, no one should lose heart,” he said.
