REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nIcahn and Deason, who own a combined 15 percent of Xerox, have repeatedly urged fellow shareholders to oppose the $6.1 billion Fuji-Xerox deal. \nThe shareholder duo has said the merger dramatically undervalues Xerox and criticized the deal structure, which calls for the U.S. firm to be combined into the Fuji Xerox joint venture, as being convoluted. \n“We believe our plan could create total value of $54 to $64 per share compared to (the approximate) $28 per share in the (Fujifilm deal),” Icahn and Deason said. \nXerox, in a statement, said on Tuesday its board of directors had followed a “comprehensive process” in reaching the decision to approve the Fujifilm deal, including a proper review of all strategic alternatives.
