Die. Let the atomic bomb drop on the Carp”. \nHiroshima was devastated by an atomic bomb in 1945. \nA Dragons official said they regret the chant and are struggling to identify the fans in the video. \n“We will continue to make efforts to create an environment in which spectators can watch games with a sense of security and joy,” the Dragons official said on Thursday. \nThe Dragons made an announcement before Wednesday’s game against the Yomiuri Giants urging supporters not to make similar chants. \nThe Carp won all three games in the series and lead Nippon Professional Baseball’s Central League.
