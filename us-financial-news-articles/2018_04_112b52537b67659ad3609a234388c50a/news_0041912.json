It does not mention Algeria in its annual report.\nUltra, which last month abandoned a bid for U.S. company Sparton Corp due to anti-trust concerns, is currently without a chief executive.\nDouglas Caster assumed the role of executive chairman last year after the previous CEO quit. New CEO Simon Pryce is due to join in June.\nThe SFO has been criticised by lawmakers in the past over its efforts to bring companies and senior individuals to book. More recently it has secured deferred prosecution agreements with Rolls-Royce and Tesco and filed unprecedented criminal charges against Barclays and former senior executives.\nReporting by Sarah Young; editing by James Davey and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:32:50.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
