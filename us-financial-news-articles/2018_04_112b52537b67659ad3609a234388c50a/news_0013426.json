The report found that 69 percent of digitally active consumers in China use fintech services, compared to 33 percent in the U.S. \nBut a large portion of the current growth is driven by payments, David Ye, co-founder and chairman of Rong360, told CNBC's Akiko Fujita at the Boao Forum in Hainan, China. \n\"China has been leading in some fintech space such as payments.

Multiple fintech firms, including Rong360's subsidiary Jianpu Technology , launched initial public offerings in the U.S. over the past year. \n\"We see more consumers and SMEs need access to credit, they want to buy insurance, they want to better manage their wealth, they want to get their first cars — that's the biggest driver,\" Ye added.", "external_links": ["https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/whats-next-for-chinas-booming-fintech-sector", "http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017/$FILE/ey-fintech-adoption-index-2017.pdf"], "published": "2018-04-09T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T06:57:10.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
