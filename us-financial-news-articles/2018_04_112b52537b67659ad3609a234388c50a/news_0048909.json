The new offer is marginally higher than the £47 it proposed Friday. Both companies said a revised proposal was on the table Tuesday, but didn’t disclose its financial value until Wednesday.\nTakeda initially had until Wednesday to formalize an offer, withdraw it or walk away but Shire’s board agreed to extend the deadline to May 8 so both parties could conclude ongoing discussions.\nShire’s shares closed 5.9% higher on Tuesday’s news of the fifth offer; its stock has risen more than 30% since Takeda’s interest first surfaced in late March. Shire shares fell 0.8% Wednesday.\nMore News\nCalifornia Water Takes SJW Offer Public April 26, 2018 Hershey’s Brand Investments Boost Sales April 26, 2018 American Lowers Outlook Amid Rising Fuel Costs April 26, 2018 Takeda’s shares fell more than 6.5% on Wednesday morning and have dropped 18% since its first expression of interest because of concerns Japan’s largest drugmaker would pile on too much debt to fund the deal.\nAt about $50 billion, Shire’s market value exceeds Takeda’s by more than $10 billion.\nNevertheless, the combined entity would be the world’s eighth-largest drugmaker, with sales of about $30 billion a year, and bolsters Chief Executive Christophe Weber’s mission to expand Takeda’s global reach.\nLike its Western counterparts, 237-year-old Takeda is faced with a shrinking pool of patent-protected products. Actos, Takeda’s blockbuster diabetes drug, lost patent protection in 2012. Acid reflux medication Dexilant is expected to lose protection in 2020.\nThe Shire acquisition would add drugs like Cinryze, which treats hereditary angioedema; and Elaprase, a Hunter syndrome treatment, to Takeda’s portfolio, and helps it tap into the lucrative market for orphan drugs, which treat rare diseases.\nThe proposed deal would be the largest Japanese takeover of a Western firm, topping SoftBank Group Corp.’s acquisition of U.K.-based chip designer ARM Holdings PLC in 2016, worth $32 billion at the time.\nWrite to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T08:06:41.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
