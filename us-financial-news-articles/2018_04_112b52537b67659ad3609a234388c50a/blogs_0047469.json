The deals builds on Humana's focus on using healthcare providers in members' homes to improve patient care and save costs.\nSoaring healthcare costs have been a national issue, and the federal government has been restricting spending for healthcare, putting pressure on insurers.\nLast year, Aetna announced a $69 billion deal to be bought by CVS Health , fueling interest in how smaller rival Humana will compete.\nHumana will get a 40 percent interest in Curo and the deal is anticipated to close in summer.\nEvercore is the exclusive financial adviser to Humana. Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips are legal advisers to Humana.\nDebevoise & Plimpton and Mintz Levin are legal advisers to TPG and WCAS. Ropes & Gray is also acting as legal adviser to WCAS.\nJefferies is the exclusive financial adviser and Kirkland & Ellis legal adviser to Curo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T17:29:43.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
