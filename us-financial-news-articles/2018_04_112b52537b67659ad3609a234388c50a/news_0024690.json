The yen often draws demand in times of uncertainty.\nThe risk overhang has also pressured carry trades, in which investors buy low-yielding currencies - the yen has appreciated more than 5 percent so far this year - to invest in relatively higher-yielding ones.\nBilal Hafeez, an FX strategist at Nomura said the broad economic and risk backdrop has become unstable after 2017 saw booming stock markets, synchronised global growth and benign inflation.\n“This year is seeing all these reverse,” he said.\nThe euro held steady at $1.2362, stabilising after gains in recent sessions. The euro has gained 0.7 percent so far this week, as comments from European Central Bank officials reinforced views that the bank is on track to normalise monetary policy.\nMinutes from the ECB’s March meeting are due at 1130 GMT.
