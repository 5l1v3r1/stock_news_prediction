The Knicks turned to the rookie guard early when Michael Beasley exited the game in the first minute with a knee contusion.\nNew York later lost Tim Hardaway Jr., who injured his left ankle late in the game, and Emmanuel Mudiay (headache).\nLuke Kornet added 17 points off the bench for the Knicks, who shot 50.6 percent from the field and 48.6 percent from 3-point range. Kyle O’Quinn had 14 points and 14 rebounds and Courtney Lee added 10 points off the bench for New York, whose reserves outscored the Heat bench, 68-46.\nJames Johnson had 12 points for Miami, which shot 39.8 percent from the field and 25.9 percent from deep. Kelly Olynyk had 11 points and Wayne Ellington added 10 off the bench for the Heat.\nThe win was not without its costs for the Knicks, and not only in terms of injury. New York’s win dropped it a half-game behind Chicago, which lost on Friday to the Boston Celtics, for eighth place in the lottery race.\nThe Knicks stay at home for a quick turnaround on Saturday, when they host the Bucks.\nMiami (43-37) hosts the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:02:16.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
