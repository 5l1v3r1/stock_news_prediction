Total cash cost for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was US$1.90 per pound of copper sold, net of precious metals credits.\nHighlights (100% Basis)\nCopper, gold and silver production for the first quarter of 2018 at Copper Mountain Mine was 23.2 million pounds of copper equivalent which includes 19.9 million pounds of copper, 6,070 ounces of gold and 77,900 ounces of silver. Revenue for the period was $78.0 million, from the sale of 21.7 million pounds of copper, 6,500 ounces of gold and 80,600 ounces of silver, net of pricing adjustments.Gross profit for the quarter was $6.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $28.6 million for the quarter, compared to $16 million in the same quarter for 2017. Adjusted earnings were $10.6 million or $0.08 per share, compared to $0.3 million and nil per share for the same quarter of 2017. Site cash costs for the 2018 first quarter were US$1.46 per pound of copper produced net of precious metal credits. Total cash costs for the period were US$1.90 per pound of copper sold net of precious metal credits and after all off-site charges. At the end of the quarter the Company had $42.5 million in cash, and received an additional $22 million on April 4, 2018 relating to an end of March shipment of copper concentrate. Realized prices on metal sales were US$3.17 per pound of copper, US$1,326 per ounce of gold and US$16.60 per ounce of silver.\nJim O'Rourke, President and CEO of Copper Mountain, remarked \"During the first quarter of 2018, the mill throughput averaged 38,800 tpd. Abnormally high snowfall during the quarter created operating challenges in the pit and resulted in some power supply disruptions. We remain bullish on the outlook for the copper market and with our production on target we are well positioned to benefit from a strong copper price environment. We continue to focus on cost control and operational improvements to further strengthen the Company's balance sheet.\"\nSummary Financial Results\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(In thousands of CDN$, other than per share and per pound amounts)\n2018\n$\n2017\n$\nRevenues\n77,946\n74,096\nCash flow from operations\n18,083\n20,843\nGross profit\n6,312\n11,211\nOperating income (loss)\n3,332\n7,971\nEBITDA 1\n11,485\n22,819\nAdjusted EBITDA\n28,553\n16,030\nAdjusted earnings 2\n10,602\n328\nAdjusted earnings (loss) per share 3\n0.08\n0.00\nCash and cash equivalents\n42,568\n30,126\nAccounts receivable\n36,194\n26,044\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable\n78,762\n56,170\nEquity\n259,427\n230,460\nTotal pounds of copper sold (000's lbs)\n21,700\n19,000\nTotal ounces of gold sold (oz)\n6,500\n6,000\nTotal ounces of silver sold (oz)\n80,600\n64,000\nSite cash costs per pound of copper produced (net of precious metal credits) (US$)\n1.46\n1.36\nTotal cash costs per pound of copper sold (net of precious metal credits) (US$)\n1.90\n1.86\nRealized Copper Price (US$)\n3.17\n2.65\n1\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

With the acquisition the Company holds minerals tenures over approximately 4,000km 2 along the Rose Bee fault complex spanning 250 km that is a dominate land position in the Eastern Mt. Isa Inlier area. The Company is planning to follow up on some of the successful drilling from Altona's 2017 drilling program on the Companion, Veiled and Quamby prospects. These prospects add to an emerging cluster of copper-gold discoveries south of the proposed Eva Copper Project.\nListed below is a summarized balance sheet and income statement as well as details for our conference call schedule:\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nDecember 31,\n2017\n$\nDecember 31,\n2016\n$\nAssets\nCash\n42,568\n45,133\nAccounts Receivable and prepaids\n36,194\n29,314\nInventory\n65,404\n68,135\nProperty, plant and equipment\n400,989\n414,041\nOther Assets\n122,873\n111,326\n668,028\n667,949\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\n88,056\n92,056\nAmounts payable to related parties\n59,349\n43,633\nProvisions\n6,493\n6,521\nInterest rate swap liability\n1,623\n2,081\nLong-term debt\n253,080\n258,373\n408,601\n402,664\nEquity\nShare capital\n195,758\n195,670\nContributed surplus\n16,244\n15,724\nDeficit\n(30,944)\n(25,693)\nNon-controlling interest\n78,369\n79,584\nTotal equity\n259,427\n265,285\n668,028\n667,949\nSummarized Income Statement\n(In thousands of Canadian dollars, other than per share and per pound amounts)\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n$\n2017\n$\nRevenues\n77,946\n74,096\nCost of sales 6\n(71,634)\n(62,885)\nGross profit\n6,312\n11,211\nOther income and expenses\nGeneral and administration\n(2,474)\n(2,682)\nExploration and evaluation\n-\n(35)\nShare based compensation\n(506)\n(523)\nOperating income\n3,332\n7,971\nPricing adjustments on concentrate and metal sales\n9,765\n(3,976)\nFinance income\n136\n145\nFinance expense\n(3,514)\n(3,437)\nCurrent resource tax expense\n(345)\n(375)\nDeferred income and resource tax expense\n1,228\n-\nAdjusted earnings 7\n10,602\n328\nPricing adjustments on concentrate and metal sales\n(9,765)\n3,976\nUnrealized loss on interest rate swap\n773\n(358)\nUnrealized gain on foreign exchange\n(8,076)\n3,171\nNet income and comprehensive income for the period\n(6,466)\n7,117\nNet income and comprehensive income attributable to:\nShareholders of the company\n(5,251)\n4,723\nNon-controlling interest\n(1,215)\n2,394\n(6,466)\n7,117\nEarnings per share\n($0.04)\n$0.04\nAdjusted earnings per share\n$0.08\n$0.00\n6\nCost of sales consists of direct mining and milling costs (which include mine site employee compensation and benefits, mine site general and administrative costs, non-capitalized stripping costs, maintenance and repair costs, operating supplies and external services), depreciation and offsite transportation costs.\n7\nAdjusted earnings (loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure which excludes unrealized gains/losses on derivative instruments, changes in fair value of financial instruments, foreign currency gains/losses, pricing adjustments related to metal sales and non-recurring transactions.\nThe full set of financial statements and accompanying MD&A are posted on Sedar.com .\nAbout Copper Mountain Mining Corporation :\nCopper Mountain's flagship asset is the Copper Mountain mine located in southern British Columbia near the town of Princeton. The Company has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation who owns 25% of the mine. The Copper Mountain mine has a large resource of copper that remains open laterally and at depth. This large exploration potential is being explored over the next few years in order to fully appreciate the property's full development potential. Recently, Copper Mountain's acquisition of Altona Mining Limited has been completed which brings with it approximately A$30M cash, the Cloncurry project with development-ready Eva Copper Project and an extensive exploration potential in the acquired ~ 4,000 square km (379,000 hectare) mineralized land package within the highly prospective Mt. Isa inlier area in Queensland, Australia.\nAdditional information is available on the Company's web page at www.CuMtn.com .\nA conference call and audio webcast will be held on Friday April 27, 2018 at 7:30 am (Pacific Daylight Time) for management to discuss the first quarter 2018 results.
