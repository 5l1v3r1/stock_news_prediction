Markets in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan were closed for the Tomb Sweeping Day holiday on Thursday.\nMany suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China.\nThat is considered one of the most powerful weapons in Beijing’s trade arsenal given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Donald Trump in the presidential election.\nU.S. soybeans and corn regained ground on Thursday, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day.\nNOT SO RISKY? Some observers argue that the global economy is currently running so well that it could cope with the impact of the proposed tariffs, which cover a fraction of world trade.\n“We’ve had a few months now where markets have really been going sideways and progressively lower, but at the same time has data really rolled over? The answer is no,” Geoffrey Yu, head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management, said.\n“The underlying economy is actually chugging along which will increase the scope for upside surprises on the corporate front, on the economic front and at some point markets will have to catch up to that.”\nU.S. data on Wednesday underscored the prevailing bullish view on the economy. Private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, boding well for Friday’s jobs data.\nA correction since January has driven share price valuations down from record levels, attracting bargain hunters.\nMSCI ACWI traded at 14.77 times its forward earnings, the lowest in more than two years.\nOil prices bounced back in tandem with global share prices, and on a surprise draw in U.S. crude stockpiles. U.S. crude futures traded at $63.38 per barrel, flat in percentage terms.\nBond markets were hit by the recovery in equities as demand for safe-haven assets ebbed. The yield on the German 10-year touched a one-week high of 0.538 percent, while U.S. treasury yields were at 2.827 percent.\nReporting by Kit Rees, Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; editing by John Stonestreet\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
