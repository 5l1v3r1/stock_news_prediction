Photo courtesy of Goldman Environmental Prize But she has no intention of giving up the work that this week earned her a prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, known as the “Green Nobel”, which honors grassroots activism.\n“Land is life, it’s culture, it’s what we are as human beings,” the 36-year-old Afro-Colombian from the country’s southwestern Cauca province told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“Without land for us as Afro-descendent people, we are nobody.”\nMarquez says illegal mining is a scourge for Afro-Colombian communities whose ancestral lands are rich in gold reserves as it pollutes rivers with toxic mercury and cuts down forests.\nThe government shuts down hundreds of unlicensed mines run by organized crime networks every year and according to Bogota-based Externado University, 60 percent of all mining in Colombia is illegal.\nMarquez’s activism has focused on La Toma, a mountainous region where Afro-Colombians - a population originally brought as slaves from Africa - have lived for centuries.\nThe law student and single mother’s biggest battle came in 2014, when illegal gold miners cleared forests and diverted the natural flow of a river that the local community depended on for fish and fresh water.\nIn response, Marquez led 80 women on a 10-day, 350-mile (560-km) march to the capital Bogota that led to the government sending in troops to remove illegal miners and their equipment.\n“As we brought attention to the problem, we also began to receive death threats from armed actors, paramilitary groups, who declared us a military target because according to them we opposed development,” Marquez said.\nIn 2014 she received a death threat that forced her to leave home with her two children.\nThe threats continue, by phone or text message, and even with two government body guards Marquez said it was not safe for her to go home.\nFor Marquez, like many other activists in Latin America, danger is part of life as they battle often big international companies to preserve their ancestral lands from mining, dams, logging, and other mega-developments.\nWhen Marquez received the prize earlier this week in the United States, she paid homage to Berta Caceres, a Honduran indigenous environmental activist and previous Goldman winner who was gunned down less than a year after receiving the award.\nGrowing numbers of activists worldwide face threats, according to Global Witness, a UK-based rights group.\nIt says four land and environmental activists were murdered each week in 2016, with nearly 60 percent of all killings occurring in Latin America. Brazil fared worse with 49 deaths followed by Colombia with 37 activists killed.\n“The situation is very difficult but we’ll continue resisting and defending our lands,” Marquez said.\nFive of the six Goldman winners this year were women.\nThe others were Philippine anti-lead campaigner Manny Calonzo, the United States’ LeeAnne Walters, founder of a citizens’ movement that helped expose the Flint water crisis, South African anti-nuclear campaigners Makoma Lekalakala and Liz McDaid, French ocean and marine-life advocate Claire Nouvian, and Vietnamese renewable-energy activist, Khanh Nguy Thi.\nReporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Claire Cozens Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
