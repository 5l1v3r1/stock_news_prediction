It said on Tuesday it still wanted to share the data at some point.\n\"As we have said in the past, we want to work closer with other Facebook companies in the future and we will keep you updated as we develop our plans,\" it said.\nOther changes announced by WhatsApp on Tuesday include allowing users to download a report detailing the data it holds on them, such as the make and model of the device they used, their contacts and groups and any blocked numbers.\n\"This feature will be rolling out to all users around the world on the newest version of the app,\" it said.\nThe blog post also points to safety tips on the service, such as the ability to block unwanted users, and delete and report spam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T10:52:45.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
