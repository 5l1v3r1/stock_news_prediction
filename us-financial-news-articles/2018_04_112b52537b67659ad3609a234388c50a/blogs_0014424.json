Keytruda is already approved to treat several forms of cancer, including advanced melanoma. The drug racked up $3.81 billion in revenue in 2017. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and is expected to kill over 154,000 people in the U.S. this year, the American Cancer Society says. Published 8 Hours Ago Reuters Source: Merck \nMerck's blockbuster drug Keytruda helped previously untreated lung cancer patients live longer in a late-stage trial, potentially cementing its position as the dominant player in the lucrative lung cancer market. \nShares of the drugmaker were up 3 percent on Monday. \nMerck is already considered the frontrunner in the space and Keytruda is expected to earn peak sales of over $10 billion in 2023, according to Credit Suisse. \nKeytruda is already approved in the U.S. to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not received prior therapies and whose tumors show PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater. \nIf the company can show that the new data benefits patients whose PD-L1 expression is between 1 and 49 percent, it would expand Keytruda's market and raise the competitive benchmark for rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca , BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said. \nAn independent data monitoring committee determined the trial, which tested Keytruda as a monotherapy to treat NSCLC, extended the lives of patients significantly compared to chemotherapy. \nAdditional data from Merck, as well as results from trials of competitors, could eventually determine which companies will snatch the largest slice of the pie for the lung cancer market. \n\"I think the market still believes that there could be other players in the lung cancer market, which would combat overall sales of Keytruda in this setting,\" Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters. \n\"Because we don't know the full data set we don't know the survival benefit here.\" \nBased on a recommendation from the committee, the trial will continue to evaluate a secondary goal on whether the treatment can delay the disease from progressing. \n\"While it is still unclear whether Keytruda and (Bristol-Myers') Opdivo are truly different in some way, it is crystal clear that Merck has done a much better job designing trials and developing their drug. This will solidify their lead,\" said Brad Loncar, chief executive officer of Loncar Investments, which runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. \nKeytruda, which is approved to treat several other forms of cancer including skin and blood cancer, racked up $3.81 billion in revenue in 2017. \nLung cancer is the second most common cancer and is expected to kill over 154,000 people this year, the American Cancer Society says. NSCLC accounts for about 85 percent of all lung cancer cases, Merck said. \nShares of Bristol-Myers fell 2 percent.
