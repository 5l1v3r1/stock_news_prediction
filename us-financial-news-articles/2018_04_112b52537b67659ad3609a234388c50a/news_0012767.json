It was a fantastic job today. I hope that this will only be the start.” \nThe result equalled Toro Rosso’s second best to date. \nIt also gave new power unit partners Honda a boost after a bruising three-years with McLaren marked by unreliability and a lack of performance blamed chiefly on their engines. \nThey split with the former champions, who now use Renault power, at the end of last season and have enjoyed a far more promising start to their partnership with the Red Bull sister team. \nThe combination looked quick and reliable in pre-season testing with none of the frustration many had predicted. \nGasly felt Sunday’s result, at a power sensitive track, was validation of the progress Honda had made even if he was helped by a double retirement for Red Bull and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen also failing to finish. \n“They (Honda) had a tough couple of years and it’s a great way to motivate them and show them we need to keep pushing,” he said. \n“To finish fourth in Formula One you need to have a good engine. So, the engine is good.” (Editing by Alan Baldwin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T04:29:01.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
