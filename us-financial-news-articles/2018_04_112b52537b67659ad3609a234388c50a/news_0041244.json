Limited (\"China Finance Online\", or the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\" or \"our\") (NASDAQ GS: JRJC), a leading web-based financial services company that provides Chinese retail investors with online access to securities trading services, wealth management products, securities investment advisory services, as well as financial database and analytics services to institutional customers, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nThe Company achieved a positive net cash-flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 Net revenues were $13.6 million, up from $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2017 Equity brokerage business grew 100.5% year-over-year and 24.0% quarter-over-quarter Gross margin was 49.7%, up from 44.9% in the third quarter of 2017 Net loss attributable to China Finance Online was $8.4 million, compared with a net loss of $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments were $41.3 million as of December 31, 2017, up from $36.1 million as of September 30, 2017\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues were $42.6 million, down 48.7% year-over-year Equity brokerage business grew 182.3% year-over-year Commodities brokerage business declined by 95.7% year-over-year after the suspension of new commodities trading by the precious metal exchange in China Lingxi Robo-Advisor outperformed most of its peer products in the Chinese market with an average return of 10.59% and average drawdown rate of 1.84% in 2017. From January 1, 2017 to April 12, 2018, the aggressive portfolio of Lingxi beat 95% of equity funds and hybrid funds in terms of return.\nMr. Zhiwei Zhao, Chairman and CEO of China Finance Online, commented, \"We turned a positive net cash-flow in the fourth quarter, as we are making inroad in optimizing our business units and improving our top line from the third quarter. As we are transitioning away from the commodity brokerage business, our equity brokerage related business maintains a strong growth momentum and our intelligent-finance driven fintech business has drawn interest from leading brokerage firms in China, with whom we have entered into strategic cooperation agreements.\"\n\"Our operation has also been making solid progress. Our website \" JRJ.com .cn\" remains a popular destination for news and analysis on economy and capital markets, with growing brand perception. And its unique visitors all year in 2017 was 236 million, an increase of 40% from 169 million in 2016. The fast-growing traffic was attributable to the improvement of our fact-based journalism, breaking news coverage and proprietary deep dive content.\"\n\"In 2017, we concentrated on building out our fintech capabilities. With a team of senior software engineers and capital market professionals, we carried out integration of financial engineering, artificial intelligence and big data, and developed intelligent finance products for individual investors and institutions. Our robo-advisory product Lingxi provides retail investors with investment products for global asset allocation, which outperformed most of its peer products in the market with its better return and lower drawdown. We also introduced Genius Zhisheng, a cloud-based one-stop investment research platform for institutional investors. For retail investors, we also introduced technical trading research tools based on Zhisheng algorithm. Based upon our track records in financial media, financial data service and securities advisory services, along with our robust fintech capabilities, we are committed to developing more cloud-based products to drive user engagement,\" Mr. Zhao concluded.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues were $13.6 million, compared with $19.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.7 million during the third quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues from financial services, the financial information and advisory business, and advertising services contributed 66%, 21% and 12% of the net revenues, respectively, compared with 83%, 12% and 4%, respectively, for the corresponding period in 2016.\nRevenues from financial services were $8.9 million, compared with $16.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and $7.5 million during the third quarter of 2017. Revenues from financial services mainly represent equity brokerage services. The equity brokerage business grew 100.5% year-over-year and 24.0% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year decrease of revenues from financial services was mainly due to a decline in revenues from the Company's commodities brokerage services after the suspension of new commodities trading by the precious metal exchange in China. Revenue from commodities brokerage was $11.4 million or 59% of total revenue in fourth quarter of 2016. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly driven by the robust growth in equity brokerage business.\nRevenues from the financial information and advisory business were $2.9 million, an increase of 23.0% from $2.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 and 12.9% from $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. Revenues from the financial information and advisory business were comprised of subscription services from individual and institutional customers. During the fourth quarter, subscription revenue from individual investors grew by 315.2% year-over-year, mainly due to the increased adoption of the Company's cloud-based analytical tools among retail investors.\nRevenues from advertising were $1.6 million, compared with $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2017. The increased traffic to our site also helped elevate our advertising revenues.\nGross profit was $6.8 million, compared with $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 49.7%, compared with 62.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 44.9% in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was mainly due to revenue mix changes associated with the Company's transition to increased services for the equity capital market, which has a lower gross margin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $4.1 million, a decrease of 10% from $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an increase of 25.9% from $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to more stringent expense control measures.\nSales and marketing expenses were $6.8 million, a decrease of 52.5% from $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a decrease of 1.5% from $6.9 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to the reductions in headcounts and sales commissions in the commodity brokerage operation during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $3.8 million, a decrease of 23.7% from $5.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and with no significant difference from the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to the improved efficiency after the consolidation of R&D team throughout different business units. The Company continues to maintain a team of senior software engineers, data scientists and capital market professionals to support further development in fintech capabilities.\nTotal operating expenses were $14.7 million, a decrease of 38.5% from $23.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an increase of 5.2% from $14.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to improved efficiency and effective cost controls.\nLoss from operations was $8.0 million, compared with a loss from operations of $11.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a loss from operations of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet loss attributable to China Finance Online was $8.4 million, compared with a net loss of $12.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a net loss of $8.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nFully diluted loss per American Depository Shares (\"ADS\") attributable to China Finance Online was $0.37 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with fully diluted loss per ADS of $0.57 for the fourth quarter of 2016 and fully diluted loss per ADS of $0.37 for the third quarter of 2017. Basic and diluted weighted average numbers of ADSs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 22.7 million, compared with basic and diluted weighted average number of ADSs of 22.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Each ADS represents five ordinary shares of the Company.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues for full year 2017 were $42.6 million, a decrease of 48.7% compared with $83.1 million for 2016.\nRevenues from financial services for the full year 2017 were $28.2 million, a decrease of 59.1% compared with $69.0 million for 2016.\nRevenues from the financial information and advisory business for the full year 2017 were $10.3 million, a decrease of 3.9% compared with $10.7 million for 2016.\nRevenues from advertising for the full year 2017 were $3.6 million, an increase of 24.0% compared with $2.9 million for 2016.\nGross profit for the full year 2017 was $20.7 million, a decrease of 67.0% compared with $62.7 million in the full year 2016.
