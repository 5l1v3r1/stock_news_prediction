REUTERS/Ben Nelms The results come as unionized workers at CP, Canada’s second largest railroad, prepared to strike as early as Saturday after a stalemate in talks with the company over certain demands.\nIn a call with analysts, CP Chief Executive Keith Creel said he was in “very close contact” with the labor unions.\n“We cannot make and will not make a bad short-term deal that jeopardizes our ability to protect the long-term interest and strength of this company, the benefit our customers, employees and the Canadian economy,” Creel added.\nCP said that while revenue from grain — among the biggest contributors to overall results — slipped 9 percent, potash revenue and revenue from energy, chemicals and plastics both increased over 10 percent.\nCP’s operating ratio — operating costs as a percentage of revenue — rose to 67.5 percent from 62.4 percent a year earlier. A lower ratio indicates higher efficiency.\nNet income fell to C$348 million ($275.8 million) from C$431 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, CP earned C$2.70 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate by 2 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe Calgary-based company’s total revenue rose nearly 4 percent to C$1.66 billion.\n($1 = 1.2620 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru and Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T00:59:56.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
