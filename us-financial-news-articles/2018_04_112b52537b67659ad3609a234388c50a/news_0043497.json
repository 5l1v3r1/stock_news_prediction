They range from connected toothbrushes that can tell you how well you are cleaning your teeth via an app, to smart inhalers that monitor a patient's inhaler use.\nVan Houten was speaking as Philips released its earnings for the first quarter of 2018. Sales hit 3.9 billion euros ($4.77 billion), with comparable sales growth of 5 percent, while the company's comparable order intake grew 10 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:37:29.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
