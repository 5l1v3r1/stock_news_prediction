REUTERS/Romeo Ranoco Government data that showed a rebound in U.S. store sales in March failed to lift the dollar which has been pressured by concerns over a trade war between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies.\n“The action may be more limited than previously thought and that’s helped market sentiment,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in Stamford, Connecticut, said of a missile strike against Syria.\nThe U.S., Britain and France said their bombing was aimed at three chemical weapons facilities in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma by the Assad regime.\nFor now, the three Western nations signaled there will be no more strikes.\n“The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from last week of a weaker dollar and favorable conditions for risk taking,” said Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri in London.\nThe MSCI world equity index .MIWD PUS, which tracks shares in 45 nations, rose 0.18 percent, to 511.45.\nAn index that tracks the dollar against a basket of six currencies .DXY fell 0.42 percent, to 89.426.
