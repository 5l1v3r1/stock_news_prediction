REUTERS/Francois Lenoir \nChancellor Angela Merkel, who hosts President Emmanuel Macron for the working meeting, is under pressure from her conservative bloc in parliament not to agree to any reforms that result in German taxpayers funding profligate euro zone peers. \nAt a meeting with conservative lawmakers on Tuesday, she trod a careful line between Macron’s drive for bold reform and their push to retain scrutiny over any European Monetary Fund developed out of the existing euro zone bailout fund. \nOfficials in Berlin and Paris both express confidence that they will find a common stance before a European Union summit on June 28-29. \n“I hear here and there talk of difficulties between the German and French governments on transforming the euro zone,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told lawmakers in the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. \n“Let me reassure you that the silent, secret, demanding work under way will allow us to reach a true Franco-German roadmap by the time of the next European summit in June,” he said, adding he expected a “sensible and ambitious compromise”. \nIn Berlin, a government spokeswoman said Germany and France “have the firm desire to find a joint way forward”, echoing Merkel’s own cooperative tone at a news conference on Tuesday. \nFrance and Germany, which account for around 50 percent of euro zone output, are essential to the reform drive. But while they often put on a strong show of political unity and shared intent, the devil is frequently in the detail. \nOn Tuesday, Merkel said creating a euro zone banking union was a priority for her, but she also broadened out the reform question to include a European asylum system, as well as foreign, defence and research policy. \nFraming reform as such a broad issue risks diluting Macron’s drive to beef up the euro zone with extra funding firepower. \nMerkel also wants to make economic competitiveness a priority for the euro zone, rather than simply amassing funds for countries in trouble, and has suggested a “Jumbo Council” of European finance and economy ministers, government sources say. \nBut in an indication of the divisions within her government on euro zone reform, the Handelsblatt business daily reported that Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), reject the idea. \nThe SPD sympathises with Macron on the euro zone and wants him to be rewarded for his efforts to reform the French economy, well aware that a big chunk of French voters remains susceptible to far-right and far-left populists sceptical about the EU.
