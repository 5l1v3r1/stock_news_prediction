Following a successful pilot, GlobalFit and WalkMyMind have partnered to bring this new technology to employers.\nWalkMyMind is a mobile application that delivers a holistic approach to wellness by connecting the physical, mental, and emotional health of its users. The platform fosters walking, learning, listening, and community through \"walkcasts,\" audio podcasts that the user hears while in motion. WalkMyMind combines the physical health benefits of walking or running with the mental stimulation of audio podcasts curated from great thinkers, inspiring educators, and best-selling authors. Walkcast topics appeal to a range of interests, covering themes such as self-motivation, arts and culture, finance and daily news briefs. In addition to audio walkcasts, the app implements fitness features such as step counting, distance tracking, and wearable device integration to log and analyze the user's progress.\n\"In addition to recognizing the benefits of increased physical activity on their employees' overall health, our GlobalFit clients are noticing a distinct parallel between mindfulness and job performance,\" said GlobalFit President and CEO, Tony Frick. \"It is a natural progression for GlobalFit to expand into the mindfulness space, and we have found the ideal partner in WalkMyMind. Diana is revolutionizing the wellbeing of the corporate world, and employers are adopting her solution because they are seeing tangible results with WalkMyMind.\"\nThrough the WalkMyMind platform, employers can deliver company messaging and trainings to their employee base through a customizable \"brand box\" that is unique to their organization. WalkMyMind is a multi-tasking solution that broadens an employer's ability to engage employees at work while driving happiness, health, and engagement to ultimately generate higher levels of workplace productivity.\n\"Both GlobalFit and WalkMyMind recognize how overall wellness can positively impact the workforce, but approach the matter with different, yet compatible solutions.
