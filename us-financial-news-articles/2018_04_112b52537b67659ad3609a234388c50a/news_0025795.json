Lacey personally faces 79 criminal counts.\nProsecutors have accused the website of generating $500 million in prostitution-related revenue since launching in 2004, in addition to money-laundering by routing funds through seemingly unrelated entities, using foreign accounts and converting it into and out of cryptocurrencies.\nBackpage.com was used primarily to sell sex and was the second-largest classified ad service in the United States after Craigslist. The online resource and its affiliated websites were seized last week by U.S. federal law enforcement authorities and taken off the internet.\nLacey’s release came a day after the website’s chief executive, Carl Ferrer, 57, entered guilty pleas to conspiracy and money-laundering charges in both Sacramento County Superior Court and U.S. District Court in Arizona under agreements with state and federal prosecutors that call for him to serve five years in prison.\nAs part of his agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice and with prosecutors from California and Texas, Ferrer agreed to cooperate in the criminal case against Backpage.com co-founders Lacey and James Larkin, who also pleaded not guilty and has a detention hearing scheduled on Monday.\nAlso charged in the indictment were Backpage.com Executive Vice President Scott Spear, Chief Financial Officer John “Jed” Brunst, Sales and Marketing Director Dan Hyer, Operations Manager Andrew Padilla and Assistant Operations Manager Joye Vaught.\nWriting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T22:10:59.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
