No spin-offs or capital measures are currently planned, she said. \nAsked about whether the group would consider strategic options for its StreetScooter electric minivan business, Kreis only said it was natural to assess how peers and rivals were being valued and what the potential for the business was. \nEarlier this week, Deutsche Post said it was is moving its StreetScooter project into a new unit, seeking opportunities to further commercialise the family of electric delivery vans.
