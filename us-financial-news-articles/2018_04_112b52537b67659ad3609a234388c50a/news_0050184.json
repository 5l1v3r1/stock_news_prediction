But headwinds from the continental U.S. are starting to reach America’s 50th state.\nStore closings from Sports Authority Inc. and Sears Holdings Corp.’s Kmart chain have pushed vacancy rates higher, prompting some Hawaii landlords to become more aggressive in cutting rents and offering other concessions to attract tenants, according to brokers and market analysts.\nVacancy rates rose to 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the highest rate since the third quarter of 2014, before falling slightly to 5.7% in the first quarter of this year, according to property consultancy CBRE, which tracks 22.9 million square feet of retail space in Hawaii.\nOther brokerages are showing a similar trend. Vacancy rates tracked by CoStar rose to 3.5% in the first quarter from 3.1% in the fourth quarter and up from 2.8% a year earlier. Quote: d rents reached $33.83 per square foot per year in the first quarter, up from $33.08 in the previous quarter, but down 3.8% from $35.16 in the first quarter of 2017, according to CoStar.\n“Hawaii is still a retail paradise; it’s just been raining a lot recently,” said Roger Lyons, CBRE senior vice president of Retail Advisory and Transaction Services in Hawaii. “It’s still 72 degrees.”\nSome of the space previously occupied by Sports Authority, which had eight stores in Hawaii, remains vacant, while others are now leased to Ross Stores Inc., T.J. Maxx, which is owned by TJX Co. , and Petco Holdings Inc. In the coming weeks, Toys “R” Us Inc. is closing its three stores, as well as a Babies “R” Us store.\n“There might be another year or two of vacancy issues, but it still feels healthy,” said Wendell F. Brooks III, senior vice president of JLL Retail Brokerage overseeing the Hawaii market. Mr. Brooks added that tourism numbers are strong, and even in centers that serve domestic consumers, pharmacy chain CVS Health Corp. , which operates Longs Drugs in Hawaii, is adding stores regularly.\nThere are no dead malls in Hawaii, largely because it isn’t as overbuilt as the mainland U.S. On average, there is 24 square feet of retail space per capita in the U.S., compared with 16 square feet in Canada and 11 square feet in Australia. In Hawaii, it is about 16 square feet.\nKa Makana Ali‘i, a 750,000 square-foot open-air mall in West Oahu that opened in late 2016, is the only new mall built on the island in the past 30 years. The mall, which includes tenants such as Macy’s Inc., 24 Hour Fitness and restaurants such as California Pizza Kitchen and Cheesecake Factory Inc., is currently 87% occupied.\n“A lot of the major mall companies are retrofitting their centers with grocery stores and restaurants. We’re way ahead of the curve,” said Ed Kobel, president and chief operating officer at Tampa, Fla.-based DeBartolo Development, the mall’s owner.\nWhile the mall had some challenges in the women’s ready-to-wear category, sales receipts from the gym and from California Pizza are the top tier in their respective chains, said Mr. Kobel.\nAt a time when other retail real-estate investment trusts are looking to shrink their asset base, Hawaii-based REIT Alexander & Baldwin Inc. is looking to expand its portfolio of grocery-anchored centers as approvals for new retail development remain scarce.\n“The zoning and entitlement process is so difficult,” said Chris Benjamin, Alexander & Baldwin’s chief executive.\nThe REIT, which has around 17% of the strip retail market share in Hawaii as well as some industrial property, last month broke ground on a 94,000-square-foot center in Maui.\nThe Ho’okele Shopping Center would be anchored by a Safeway Inc. store. Alexander & Baldwin also recently purchased three grocery-anchored shopping centers for $254 million.\nApart from controls on development, landlords in Hawaii do get a little respite from online competition.\nOnline retailers usually pass on the higher costs of delivery to consumers in Hawaii, which is located about 2,400 miles west of California in the Pacific Ocean. For instance, Amazon Prime members there don’t get free two-day shipping, though standard shipping is free.\n“Shipping to Hawaii is exorbitant in some cases. Even if it’s slightly cheaper online, it might end up costing so much more to deliver,” said Kristi Dagdagan, a resident in Honolulu. The mother of three, who is an Amazon Prime member and a member at Sam’s Club, added that groceries like milk and eggs are generally more expensive in Hawaii, so wholesale retailers like Costco are often crowded.\n“I’m a fan of the ‘scan and go’ app,” said Ms. Dagdagan.\nWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T04:55:46.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
