Julia Vivi Wang, (R) who is accused of having paid a bribe for diplomatic positions, exits the Manhattan U.S. District Courthouse in New York March 18, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nJulia Vivi Wang admitted to bribery and conspiracy charges, both in violation of the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and to submitting fraudulent income tax returns. \nWang, 57, also entered a plea agreement under which she is expected to cooperate with prosecutors. \nThe defendant entered her plea before U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan federal court. She faces up to five years in prison on each FCPA count. A sentencing date has not been set. Her lawyer declined to comment. \nWang, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is among several people charged by U.S. prosecutors since 2015 over alleged influence-peddling linked to the U.N. \nOne defendant, billionaire Macau developer Ng Lap Seng, was found guilty last July by a Manhattan jury on bribery charges. \nWang admitted to having in April 2013 wired $500,000 to win favors for her late husband and another man. \nProsecutors have said the bribe was solicited by John Ashe, a former U.N. ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda who was also General Assembly president. \nWang was vice president of South-South News, a U.N.-focused media group, and an organization whose stated mission was to promote U.N. development goals and sustainable development. \nBoth were led by Francis Lorenzo, a former deputy U.N. ambassador from the Dominican Republic. Prosecutors have said Ng founded South-South News and used it as a bribery conduit. \nIn March 2016, prosecutors filed a complaint accusing Wang and her husband of having told Lorenzo they wanted to buy diplomatic posts, such as consol or envoy, with Antigua’s government because they viewed it as a “business opportunity.” \nThe complaint said Lorenzo understood from speaking with Ashe that some of the “hundreds of thousands of dollars” that Wang paid was meant for Antiguan officials, including the prime minister at the time, who was not identified. \nAshe died in an accident at his home in June 2016. Lorenzo pleaded guilty to bribery and money laundering charges. Prosecutors last week asked a judge to sentence Ng to more than six years in prison.
