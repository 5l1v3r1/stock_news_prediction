French officials insist the new initiative will not cannibalise PESCO. \nFrench Defence Minister Florence Parly will discuss the project with her German counterpart Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday in Paris. \n“It’s creating a smaller group of countries that have common analysis and procedures,” said a second French defence source. “It would plug in the different military planning and operations centres,” said one source. \nThe source said its aim was to try to anticipate future crises, be it military conflicts or humanitarian such as the recent storms that hit the Caribbean, and avoid situations whereby one country would be forced to intervene alone, as France did in Central African Republic and Mali. \nThe project is not on a list of 17 joint projects initiatives, including a European armoured infantry vehicle, agreed by the founding PESCO members. \nPESCO members have yet to decide on whether to let non-member states join the projects, prolonging uncertainty over any future role for Britain after it leaves the EU next year. \nAs Europe’s biggest military power along with France, Britain is central to European security efforts but has long blocked defence integration. \nHowever, Britain is seeking a security treaty with the EU by 2019, worried out missing out on key weapons projects. \nThe eventual aim of PESCO is to develop and deploy forces together, backed by a multi-billion-euro fund for defence research and development that is now under negotiation. \n“The EU’s second-biggest army is leaving the union so this multilateral project makes sense when everything is being broken up,” said a French military source. \n(This version of the story corrects day in first paragraph to Wednesday, not Thursday) Reporting by John Irish", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T21:24:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
