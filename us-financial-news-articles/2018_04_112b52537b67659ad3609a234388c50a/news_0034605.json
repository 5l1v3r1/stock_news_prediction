REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez \nCalifornia National Guard troops will not enforce immigration laws or participate in the construction of any new border barrier, the governor’s office said in a statement. \nThe deal comes after a U.S. Defence Department official last week said the Democratic-run state had declined a request to commit troops to Republican President Donald Trump’s effort to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to help the Department of Homeland Security secure the border with Mexico in four southwestern U.S. states. \nCalifornia Governor Jerry Brown has been a staunch opponent of Trump’s efforts to tighten immigration law enforcement and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Brown last year signed a sanctuary law ordering state and local officials not to cooperate with federal immigration agents in certain situations. \nCalifornia reached Wednesday’s agreement after securing the federal government’s commitment this week to fund the mission, Brown’s office said. \nCurrently, 900 National Guard troops have been deployed in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, officials said Monday. \nNational Guard troops are not taking part in direct border security and are not performing law enforcement work.
