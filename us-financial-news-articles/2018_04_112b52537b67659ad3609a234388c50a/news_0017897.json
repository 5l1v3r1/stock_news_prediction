Jose Pirela doubled home Eric Hosmer with the Padres’ final run in the fifth.\nThe Rockies narrowed the gap on Chris Iannetta’s three-run homer off Richard in the fourth and Carlos Gonzalez’s disputed two-run homer off Padres reliever Jordan Lyles in the sixth.\nLeft fielder Cory Spangenberg apparently had Gonzalez’s drive in his glove when a fan reached out and hit the glove. The ball remained in the glove afterward but fell into the stands when the glove hit the fence. An appeal of the home run call by the Padres was denied.\nRichard (1-1) got credit for the win despite allowing four runs on five hits, including Iannetta’s homer, with three walks and three strikeouts in five innings.\nStammen entered the game with runners on first and second with no one out in the seventh and prevented the tying run from scoring. He retired all six hitters he faced. Hand struck out the side in the ninth to record his third save.\nPirela and catcher Austin Hedges had three hits and one RBI apiece for the Padres.\nRockies right-handed starter Jon Gray (1-2), who shut out the Padres on four hits over seven innings at Petco Park last Wednesday, surrendered seven runs on 10 hits and a walk and struck out six in five innings Monday night to suffer the loss.\nSix of the Padres’ seven runs scored came with two outs and four came on the homers by Richard and Asuaje.\nWith no one on and two out in the fourth, Freddy Galvis tripled for the Padres and scored on a Hedges double.\nAfter Manuel Margot was walked intentionally, Richard drove a Gray fastball 418 feet into the second deck in right. It was the third homer of the pitcher’s career.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:27:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
