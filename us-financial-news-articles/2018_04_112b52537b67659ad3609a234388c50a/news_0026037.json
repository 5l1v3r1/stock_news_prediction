Hermes will remain headquartered in London as a subsidiary of Federated, with no layoffs planned among its current staff of around 400 people, Federated Chief Executive Christopher Donahue said in a telephone interview. \nFederated managed $397.6 billion in assets at year-end, concentrated in money market funds. Hermes manages about 33 billion pounds across equity, credit and private strategies and is known for taking stands on a range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. \nIt also advises institutional investors on how to vote at corporate annual meetings. \nDonahue said Hermes’ capabilities and client relationships in Europe and Asia will broaden Federated’s distribution capabilities. Meanwhile his firm plans to introduce new products for U.S. investors once the deal closes that would be based around Hermes’ expertise. \nFederated might also offer Hermes advisory services to big U.S. clients that hold assets in index strategies. “If you can’t sell the stock, why not work with management to build sustainability or manage returns?,” he said. \nESG investing lately has proven a bright spot for active managers and spurred a number of deals, including Eaton Vance’s ( EV.N ) purchase of ESG manager Calvert Investment Management. \nFederated was advised by Citigroup and Barclays while BTPS was represented by PwC and Allen and Overy. Hermes was advised by Fenchurch Advisory.
