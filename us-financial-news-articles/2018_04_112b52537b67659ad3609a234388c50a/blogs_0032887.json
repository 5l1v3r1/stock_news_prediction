Simply, if you found the URL, you could download all their customers scanned details,” Merrigan wrote in his blog. \nTrue said the leak was fixed on April 12. \nSeubsakol Sakolsatayadorn, Ascend Commerce’s managing director, said the data was private and that customers’ information was hacked by Merrigan. \n“In this case the expert did not have the right to access this and he used special tools,” Seubsakol told reporters at a news conference. \nAccording to Pakpong Pattanamas, a deputy director for True’s mobile business, True has “a good security system”. \nMerrigan told Reuters he had notified True “in good faith” to get the security issue fixed so the data would not fall into the wrong hands. “I just wanted to get this information secured to ensure a safer internet for everyone.” \n“The overall goal is when you see an issue like this, you try to get it fixed,” he told Reuters by e-mail. \nTrue Corp shares closed down about 2 percent, against the broader market’s 0.66 percent drop.. \nTrue is working to prevent “this sort of incident” from happening again, said Pakpong. \n“TrueMove H will send out an SMS to the 11,400 affected customers and inform them about the security measures that we have taken so far,” Pakpong said. \nThe National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) said it would ask Thailand’s five main mobile operators to clearly outline their data protection measures. \nThe NBTC is looking to build its own data center to store customers’ information, Takorn Tantasith, secretary-general of the country’s telecoms regulator, told reporters. \n“The NBTC thinks that data storage should be done by a government agency,” he said. \n“If a state agency is responsible then the public will have more confidence. This is part of our long-term plan,” he added. \nThailand has been working on a draft personal data protection bill. The government has said the bill is expected to go to parliament within May or June.
