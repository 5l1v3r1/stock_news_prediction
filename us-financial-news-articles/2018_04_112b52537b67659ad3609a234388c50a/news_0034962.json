The amendment weakens the law’s provisions by allowing private land ownership and opening the door to foreign investment, activists said.\nIn March, Browne’s government announced its intention to repeal the law entirely.\nPARADISE FOUND Among prominent development projects on Barbuda is Paradise Found, a beachfront property in which Hollywood actor Robert De Niro has a financial stake.\nA memorandum signed by Browne’s government and Paradise Found, which mentions De Niro as a stakeholder, and has been seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has stirred controversy because the venture’s 198-year lease would convert to private land ownership if freehold tenure is established on Barbuda.\nBarbuda’s lone parliamentarian, Trevor Walker, believes there is precedent for the Barbudans to keep their land.\n“I’ve looked at aboriginals in Australia, maroons in Jamaica, Caribs in Dominica - they have ancestral rights to land within an independent country,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via telephone from Barbuda, where power and water have yet to be fully restored.\n“You cannot disregard the rights of indigenous people just for development - it’s a human rights violation.”\nBrowne’s office and the Antigua and Barbuda High Commission in London did not respond to requests for comments.\nBrowne told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview last year his plan would assist Barbuda’s recovery by facilitating mortgages to finance reconstruction and developing the island’s economy.\nIn Britain, human rights barrister Leslie Thomas told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the legislation had been rushed through like a “thief in the night” without adequate consultation from the Barbudan public or diaspora.\n“The Barbudans maintain a completely unique way of life, they see themselves as the stewards and protectors of their pristine island, nowhere else in the Caribbean do you have this situation,” he said.\nFor Thomas, the case is a test for Britain and the Commonwealth - an organization encompassing a third of the world’s population - to prove its relevance and legitimacy.\n“All families have weaker and vulnerable members ... that doesn’t mean you’re less important. Barbuda is part of the family, what is the Commonwealth doing when it stands by and sees the Barbudan people having their rights taken away from them?,” said Thomas.\nHenry and others in the Barbudan community hope to meet Browne in London this week and plan to rally British Barbudans in front of the Commonwealth headquarters on Thursday, she said.\n“We will fight to the end on this.”\nReporting by Adela Suliman and Gregory Scruggs; Editing by Astrid Zweynert.
