Dasht-i Archi has been largely under the control of Taliban fighters and many details about the strike were unclear. \nA statement from the Taliban said the strike killed 150 religious scholars and civilians and denied that any of its forces were present. \nArmy Colonel Lisa Garcia, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesperson, said U.S. forces had not carried out any attacks in the area. \n“U.S. Forces-Afghanistan did not conduct air strikes in Kunduz province today. Any claims to the contrary are baseless,” she said in an emailed statement.
