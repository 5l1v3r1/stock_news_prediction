The focus now shifts to the possible U.S. response,” economists at Nomura said. \n“But of course actions speak louder than words. We will keep an eye on the progress of those opening-up measures.” \nThe speech at the Boao Forum for Asia in the southern province of Hainan had been widely anticipated as one of Xi’s first major addresses in a year in which the ruling Communist Party marks the 40th anniversary of its landmark economic reforms and opening up under former leader Deng Xiaoping. \nXi said China would raise the foreign ownership limit in the automobile, shipbuilding and aircraft sectors “as soon as possible” and push previously announced measures to open the financial sector. Related Coverage Analyst View - China's Xi promises to open economy, lower tariffs \n“This year, we will considerably reduce auto import tariffs, and at the same time reduce import tariffs on some other products,” Xi said. \nHe said “Cold War mentality” and arrogance had become obsolete and would be repudiated. His speech did not specifically mention the United States or its trade policies, which have been assailed by Chinese state media in recent days. \nVice Premier Liu He had already vowed at the World Economic Forum in January that China would roll out fresh market opening moves this year, and that it would lower auto import tariffs in an “orderly way”. \nChinese officials have promised since at least 2013 to ease restrictions on foreign joint ventures in the auto industry, which would allow foreign firms to take a majority stake. They currently are limited to a 50 percent stake in joint ventures and cannot establish their own wholly owned factories. \nTesla’s Chief Executive Elon Musk has railed against an unequal playing field in China and wants to retain full ownership over a manufacturing facility the company is in talks to build there. \n“This is a very important action by China. Avoiding a trade war will benefit all countries,” Musk tweeted after Xi’s speech. \nForeign business groups welcomed Xi’s commitment to reforms, including promises to strengthen legal deterrence on intellectual property violators, but said the speech fell short on specifics. \n“Ultimately U.S. industry will be looking for implementation of long-stalled economic reforms, but actions to date have greatly undermined the optimism of the U.S. business community,” said Jacob Parker, vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council.

None of the announced duties have been implemented yet, offering room for negotiation. \nBeijing charges that Washington is the aggressor and spurring global protectionism, although China’s trading partners have complained for years that it abuses World Trade Organization rules and practices unfair industrial policies that lock foreign companies out of crucial sectors with the intent of creating domestic champions. \nWhile U.S. officials, including Trump, have recently expressed optimism that the two sides would hammer out a trade deal, Chinese officials in recent days have said negotiations would be impossible under “current circumstances”.
