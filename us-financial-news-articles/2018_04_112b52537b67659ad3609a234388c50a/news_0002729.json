Reuters reported last month that the bank was considering spinning off Quorum. \nIn her role at JPMorgan, Baldet led product development for Quorum and was tasked with helping set the corporate and investment bank’s blockchain strategy. \nMoy had been leading blockchain product development for the bank’s investor services and capital markets business.
