REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta/Files\nThe Indian unit of Japanese car maker Suzuki Motor Corp said on Friday profit for the January-March quarter rose to 18.82 billion rupees ($281.74 million) from 17.11 billion rupees a year earlier.\nThat compared with the 21.10 billion rupees average estimate of 22 analysts, Thomson Reuters data showed.\nAn increase in effective tax rate impacted the net profit for the country’s most valuable automaker. Tax expenses jumped about 31 percent to 7.52 billion rupees in the quarter.\nMaruti’s operations are key for Suzuki as it provides the bulk of the Japanese automaker’s revenues, and has a market value of over $40 billion, more than one-and-a-half times that of its parent.
