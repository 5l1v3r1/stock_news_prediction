The United States and the United Nations have described the situation as ethnic cleansing. \nMyanmar has denied nearly all allegations, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The army has said its crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August. \nIn a filing made public on Monday, Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda asked the court to rule whether it has jurisdiction over the alleged deportations. \nAn affirmative verdict could pave the way for her to investigate the alleged deportations as a possible crime against humanity. The main reason for doubt over jurisdiction is that, while Bangladesh is a member of the court, Myanmar is not. \n“The Government of Myanmar expresses serious concern on the news regarding the application by the International Criminal Court (ICC) Prosecutor to claim jurisdiction over the alleged deportation of the Muslims from Rakhine to Bangladesh,” the administration said in a statement. \nIn her application, Bensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favor of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established legal principles. \n“Nowhere in the ICC charter does it say the court has jurisdiction over states which have not accepted that jurisdiction. Furthermore, the 1969 U.N. Vienna Convention on International Treaties states that no treaty can be imposed on a country that has not ratified it,” the Myanmar government statement said. \nBensouda was trying “to override the principle of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other states, in contrary to the principle enshrined in the U.N. charter and recalled in the ICC charter’s preamble,” it said. \nThe ICC prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request on Friday seeking comment on the Myanmar government’s statement. \nThe government also said it was working on repatriation of the Rohingya with Bangladesh and its minister had just visited refugee camps in Bangladesh. \nBensouda’s request is the first of its kind filed at the court. She asked the ICC to call a hearing to hear her arguments, as well as those of other interested parties. \nThe magistrate assigned to consider the request, Congolese judge Antoine Kesia-Mbe Mindua, will determine how to proceed.
