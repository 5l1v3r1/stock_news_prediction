I expect next week we will reach something very close to normality,” Guardiola told analysts during a conference call.\nThe outage followed a planned migration of TSB’s computer systems, as it shifted from the platform of its former owner Lloyds Banking Group to a new system called Proteo developed by Sabadell.\nGuardiolsa said the bank had also been updating regulators and stakeholders regarding their latest developments in restoring TSB’s online and banking app services.\n“We will make sure that no customer is left out of pocket and we are asking customers to file complaints that will be processed,” he said.\nTSB has called in International Business Machines Corp to help resolve an IT crisis that has left dozens of customers without access to digital services for almost a week, its CEO said on Thursday.\nSabadell booked non-recurring expenses of 77 million euros in the first quarter mainly due to the IT deal.
