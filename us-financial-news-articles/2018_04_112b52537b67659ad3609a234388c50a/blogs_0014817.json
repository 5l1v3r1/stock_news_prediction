The Trump administration filed a brief with the Supreme Court in March that argued retailers should have to collect sales taxes even in states where they aren't physically present. The top court will hear arguments on the issue later this month.\nA spokeswoman for the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nThe WSJ report follows the president's recent social media rampage against Amazon , claiming that the online retail giant pays \"little or no taxes to state & local governments.\"\nTrump tweet I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!\nTrump has frequently targeted the company of CEO Jeff Bezos , who also owns The Washington Post, which Trump has falsely claimed to be a \"lobbyist\" for Amazon.\nTrump's most recent salvo alleged that Amazon's use of the United States Postal Service cost the government agency billions of dollars. Trump also claimed that the \"Fake Washington Post\" is used as the company's lobbyist \"and should so REGISTER.\"\nTrump tweet While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that \"the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned,\" and that...\nTrump tweet ...does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a \"lobbyist\" and should so REGISTER. If the P.O. \"increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.\" This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!\nA White House spokeswoman said Trump has been referring to taxes collected by third-party sellers on Amazon.com. The company collects taxes on sales of its own inventory in 45 states and the District of Columbia.\nRead the full report from the Wall Street Journal\nWATCH: Trump to study how to level playing field for Amazon show chapters Trump says he's 'going to study' how to level playing field for Amazon 6:38 PM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 02:14", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T00:06:38.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
