Hooley, State Street’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"First-quarter 2018 results reflect strong growth in both fee revenue and net interest income. Servicing fees increased 10% from 1Q17, reflecting strength in equity markets and continued strong business momentum.\"\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005150/en/\nHooley added, \"We continue to execute on State Street Beacon, enhancing the client experience by providing new solutions and insights, while driving efficiencies across the organization. As a result of our multi-year investment in technology, we have been able to win new mandates and expand existing relationships as demonstrated by the record level of new servicing commitments of $1.3 trillion in 1Q18.\"\nHooley concluded, \"We are well positioned to achieve the financial objectives for 2018 we announced in January, while remaining focused on servicing our clients and investing in new products and offerings.\"\n1Q18 Highlights\nAUCA/AUM\nBroad-based business momentum: Asset servicing AUCA at 1Q18 quarter-end, increased 12% from 1Q17 due to strength in equity markets, new business and client activity. Asset management AUM at 1Q18, increased 7% compared to 1Q17, primarily driven by strength in equity markets and ETF net inflows, partially offset by thinner-yielding institutional outflows. New business: Asset servicing mandates newly announced in 1Q18 totaled approximately $1.3 trillion. (1) Servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods totaled approximately $1.6 trillion. In our asset management business, we experienced net outflows of $27 billion during 1Q18 given the difficult market conditions for our institutional offerings.\nRevenue\nFee revenue (2) : Broad-based strength in fee revenue, up 8% in 1Q18 compared to 1Q17, driven by higher servicing fees, management fees, trading services, securities finance, and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by lower processing fees and other revenue. Servicing and management fees: Servicing fees increased 10% relative to 1Q17, benefiting from higher global equity markets, new business, client activity, and the favorable impact of currency translation. Management fees increased 24% relative to 1Q17, primarily driven by higher global equity markets and the impact of the new revenue recognition standard. (2) Processing fees and other revenue: Decreased from 1Q17, largely reflecting the absence of a $30 million one-time gain in 1Q17 from the sale of a business and the episodic impact of $22 million in higher FX swap costs not included in the net interest income deposit hedging program. Net interest income: Increased 29% in 1Q18 from 1Q17, driven by higher market interest rates in the U.S., disciplined liability pricing, and higher client balances.\nExpenses (2)\nExpenses: 1Q18 expenses increased 8% compared to 1Q17 due to investments to support new business, compensation costs, transaction processing costs, the expense impact of the new Revenue Recognition Standard, (2) and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by the absence of restructuring charges and Beacon savings. Operating leverage: Compared to 1Q17, the growth rate of total revenue exceeded the growth rate of total expenses, resulting in positive operating leverage of approximately 5.0% points. Fee operating leverage: Compared to 1Q17, fee operating leverage was (0.6)% points. The episodic increase in FX swap costs contributed approximately -1% point to this result. Pre-tax margin: Compared to 1Q17, pre-tax margin increased 3.4% points.\n(1) We expect that for the remainder of the year newly announced asset servicing mandates will return to levels more commonly reflected historically. See “Additional Information” below in this news release for a description of our calculation methodology for newly announced asset servicing mandates.\n(2) Effects of the new Revenue Recognition Standard (ASU 2014-09): The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 1Q18 total fee revenue and total expenses by approximately $65 million each. Relative to 1Q17, the new revenue recognition standard contributed 3% to both fee revenue growth and expense growth. The revenue impact was approximately $45 million in management fees, $15 million in trading services, and $5 million across other revenue line items. The expense impact was approximately $15 million in transaction processing, $45 million in other expenses, and $5 million across other expense line items.\nCapital\nKey metrics: Relative to 1Q17, the estimated Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio for 1Q18 decreased 70 basis points to 10.8%. The estimated 1Q18 leverage ratio was 6.9%, reflecting an increase of 10 basis points from 1Q17. Capital Return: Purchased $350 million of our common stock and declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.42 per share in 1Q18.\nFinancial Results\n(Table presents summary results,\ndollars in millions, except per share amounts,\nor where otherwise noted)\n1Q18 4Q17 Increase\n(Decrease)\n1Q17 Increase\n(Decrease)\nTotal fee revenue (1) $ 2,363 $ 2,230 6.0 % $ 2,198 7.5 % Net interest income 658 616 6.8 510 29.0 Total revenue 3,019 2,846 6.1 2,668 13.2 Provision for loan losses — (2 ) nm (2 ) nm Total expenses (1) 2,256 2,131 5.9 2,086 8.1 Net income available to common shareholders 605 334 81.1 446 35.7 Earnings per common share: Diluted earnings per share 1.62 0.89 82.0 1.15 40.9 Financial ratios : Quarterly average total assets 226,870 216,348 4.9 219,209 3.5 Fee operating leverage (2) 9 bps (64 ) bps Operating leverage (2) 21 501 Return on average common equity 12.8 % 6.9 % 590 9.9 % 290 Return on tangible common equity (3) 20.1 16.7 340 16.0 410 Pre-tax margin (GAAP-basis) 25.3 25.2 10 21.9 340 Pre-tax margin (historical Operating-basis) 27.4 33.1 (570 ) 26.1 130 Effective tax rate (4) 13.5 48.4 (3,490 ) 14.0 (50 ) (1) Effects of the new Revenue Recognition Standard (ASU 2014-09): The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 1Q18 total fee revenue and total expenses by approximately $65 million each. Relative to 1Q17, the new revenue recognition standard contributed 3% to both fee revenue growth and expense growth. The revenue impact was approximately $45 million in management fees, $15 million in trading services, and $5 million across other revenue line items. The expense impact was approximately $15 million in transaction processing, $45 million in other expenses, and $5 million across other expense line items.\n(2) The financial ratio represents the rate of growth of total revenue (or fee revenue) less the rate of growth of expenses relative to the preceding or prior year period, as applicable.\n(3) Return on tangible common equity is calculated by dividing year-to-date annualized net income available to common shareholders (GAAP-basis) by tangible common equity. For additional information on the Reconciliation of Tangible Common Equity Ratio refer to the addendum included with this News Release.\n(4) As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the fourth-quarter of 2017 included a one-time estimated net cost of $250 million. The impact of this item on the GAAP-basis effective tax rate for the fourth-quarter of 2017 was 13.2%.\nnm Not meaningful\nSummary of Notable Items\nPre-tax impact\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 Revenue: Gains on sales of businesses $ — $ — $ 30 Investment portfolio repositioning — — (40 ) Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) impact (1) (20 ) — Expense: Acquisition & restructuring costs — (133\n)\n29 Tax: Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) impact (1) — (250\n)\n— Total EPS Impact $ — $ (0.94 ) $ (0.06 ) (1) The effects of the TCJA described in this presentation are estimates.

The revenue impact was approximately $45 million in management fees, $15 million in trading services, and $5 million across other revenue line items.\nnm Not meaningful\nServicing fees increased from 1Q17, primarily due to higher global equity markets, new business, client activity, and the favorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by modest hedge fund outflows. Compared to 4Q17, servicing fees increased, primarily due to new business, increased client activity, and stronger global equity markets.\nManagement fees increased from 1Q17, primarily due to higher global equity markets, the favorable impact of currency translation, and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. Compared to 4Q17, management fees increased, primary due to higher global equity markets and the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.\nTrading Services revenue increased from 1Q17, primarily due to stronger client FX volumes and higher electronic trading activity. Compared to 4Q17, trading services revenue increased due primarily to higher FX volatility, client volumes, and higher electronic trading activity.\nSecurities finance revenue increased from 1Q17, reflecting higher lending activity from the agency business. Compared to 4Q17, securities finance revenue decreased due to modestly lower revenue related to enhanced custody on lower balances.\nProcessing fees and other revenue decreased from 1Q17, largely reflecting the absence of a $30 million one-time gain in 1Q17 from the sale of a business and the episodic impact of $22 million in higher FX swap costs not included in the net interest income deposit hedging program. Compared to 4Q17, processing fees and other revenue decreased, reflecting seasonally lower software fees.\nNet interest income increased from 1Q17, primarily due to higher U.S. market interest rates, disciplined liability pricing, higher client balances, and a continued shift away from wholesale CDs. Net interest margin increased 26 basis points compared to 1Q17, driven by higher U.S. market interest rates, disciplined liability pricing, higher client balances, and a continued shift away from wholesale CDs. Compared to 4Q17, NII increased primarily due to higher U.S. market interest rates, partially offset by lower day count. Compared to 4Q17, net interest margin increased 5 basis points, reflecting higher U.S. market interest rates, partially offset by a lower tax equivalent adjustment on municipal bonds and a larger balance sheet.\nExpenses\n(Dollars in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 Increase\n(Decrease)\n1Q17 Increase\n(Decrease)\nCompensation and employee benefits $ 1,249 $ 1,067 17.1 % $ 1,166 7.1 % Information systems and communications 315 301 4.7 287 9.8 Transaction processing services 242 219 10.5 197 22.8 Occupancy 120 117 2.6 110 9.1 Acquisition and restructuring costs (1) — 133 (100.0 ) 29 (100.0 ) Other 330 294 12.2 297 11.1 Total Expenses (2) $ 2,256 $ 2,131 5.9 $ 2,086 8.1 (1) In 4Q17 and 1Q17, the restructuring costs associated with Beacon were $133 million and $16 million, respectively.\n(2) Effects of the new Revenue Recognition Standard (ASU 2014-09): The newly effective revenue recognition standard increased 1Q18 total expenses by approximately $65 million. Relative to 1Q17, the new revenue recognition standard contributed 3% to expense growth. The expense impact was approximately $15 million in transaction processing, $45 million in other expenses, and $5 million across other expense line items.\nCompensation and employee benefits expenses increased from 1Q17, primarily due to increased costs to support new business, annual merit and performance-based incentives, and the unfavorable impact of currency translation, partially offset by Beacon savings. Compared to 4Q17, compensation and employee benefits expenses increased primarily due to higher expenses associated with the seasonal deferred incentive compensation for retirement-eligible employees, as well as seasonal payroll taxes, and increased costs to support new business.\nInformation systems and communications expenses increased from both 1Q17 and 4Q17. The increase from both periods is due to higher technology costs.\nTransaction processing services expenses increased from both 1Q17 and 4Q17. The increase from both periods reflects higher client volumes and higher market levels.\nOccupancy expenses increased from 1Q17, primarily reflecting Beacon-related global footprint investments.\nAcquisition and restructuring expenses decreased from 1Q17, primarily related to lower acquisition costs and Beacon restructuring charges. Compared to 4Q17, acquisition and restructuring expenses decreased due to lower Beacon-related restructuring charges.\nOther expenses increased from 1Q17 and 4Q17. The increase from both periods primarily reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.\nThe 1Q18 GAAP-basis effective tax rate was 13.5% compared to 14.0% in 1Q17 and 48.4% in 4Q17. The 4Q17 tax rate included a one-time estimated net tax cost of $250 million as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The decrease in 1Q18 tax rate compared to 1Q17 reflects the impact of the lower U.S. tax rate under the TCJA partially offset by a reduction in tax advantaged investments and fewer discrete items.\nThe following table presents regulatory capital ratios as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed in those statements, and those statements should not be relied upon as representing our expectations or beliefs as of any date subsequent to April 20, 2018.\nImportant factors that may affect future results and outcomes include, but are not limited to:\nthe financial strength of the counterparties with which we or our clients do business and to which we have investment, credit or financial exposures as a result of our acting as agent for our clients, including as asset manager; increases in the volatility of, or declines in the level of, our NII, changes in the composition or valuation of the assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition (and our ability to measure the fair value of investment securities) and changes in the manner in which we fund those assets; the liquidity of the U.S. and international securities markets, particularly the markets for fixed-income securities and inter-bank credits; the liquidity of the assets on our balance sheet and changes or volatility in the sources of such funding, particularly the deposits of our clients; and demands upon our liquidity, including the liquidity demands and requirements of our clients; the level and volatility of interest rates, the valuation of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we record revenue or accrue expenses and the performance and volatility of securities, credit, currency and other markets in the U.S. and internationally; and the impact of monetary and fiscal policy in the U.S. and internationally on prevailing rates of interest and currency exchange rates in the markets in which we provide services to our clients; the credit quality, credit-agency ratings and fair values of the securities in our investment securities portfolio, a deterioration or downgrade of which could lead to other-than-temporary impairment of such securities and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of income; our ability to attract deposits and other low-cost, short-term funding; our ability to manage the level and pricing of such deposits and the relative portion of our deposits that are determined to be operational under regulatory guidelines; and our ability to deploy deposits in a profitable manner consistent with our liquidity needs, regulatory requirements and risk profile; the manner and timing with which the Federal Reserve and other U.S. and foreign regulators implement or reevaluate the regulatory framework applicable to our operations (as well as changes to that framework), including implementation or modification of the Dodd-Frank Act and related stress testing and resolution planning requirements, implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee and European legislation (such as the AIFMD, UCITS, the Money Market Funds Regulation and MiFID II / MiFIR); among other consequences, these regulatory changes impact the levels of regulatory capital and liquidity we must maintain, acceptable levels of credit exposure to third parties, margin requirements applicable to derivatives, restrictions on banking and financial activities and the manner in which we structure and implement our global operations and servicing relationships. In addition, our regulatory posture and related expenses have been and will continue to be affected by changes in regulatory expectations for global systemically important financial institutions applicable to, among other things, risk management, liquidity and capital planning, resolution planning, compliance programs, and changes in governmental enforcement approaches to perceived failures to comply with regulatory or legal obligations; adverse changes in the regulatory ratios that we are, or will be, required to meet, whether arising under the Dodd-Frank Act or implementation of international standards applicable to financial institutions, such as those proposed by the Basel Committee, or due to changes in regulatory positions, practices or regulations in jurisdictions in which we engage in banking activities, including changes in internal or external data, formulae, models, assumptions or other advanced systems used in the calculation of our capital or liquidity ratios that cause changes in those ratios as they are measured from period to period; requirements to obtain the prior approval or non-objection of the Federal Reserve or other U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the use, allocation or distribution of our capital or other specific capital actions or corporate activities, including, without limitation, acquisitions, investments in subsidiaries, dividends and stock purchases, without which our growth plans, distributions to shareholders, share repurchase programs or other capital or corporate initiatives may be restricted; changes in law or regulation, or the enforcement of law or regulation, that may adversely affect our business activities or those of our clients or our counterparties, and the products or services that we sell, including additional or increased taxes or assessments thereon, capital adequacy requirements, margin requirements and changes that expose us to risks related to the adequacy of our controls or compliance programs; economic or financial market disruptions in the U.S. or internationally, including those which may result from recessions or political instability; for example, the U.K.'s decision to exit from the European Union may continue to disrupt financial markets or economic growth in Europe or potential changes in trade policy and bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements proposed by the U.S.; our ability to create cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and to further digitize our processes and interfaces with our clients, any failure of which, in whole or in part, may among other things, reduce our competitive position, diminish the cost-effectiveness of our systems and processes or provide an insufficient return on our associated investment; our ability to promote a strong culture of risk management, operating controls, compliance oversight, ethical behavior and governance that meets our expectations and those of our clients and our regulators, and the financial, regulatory, reputation and other consequences of our failure to meet such expectations; the impact on our compliance and controls enhancement programs associated with the appointment of a monitor under the deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ and compliance consultant appointed under a settlement with the SEC, including the potential for such monitor and compliance consultant to require changes to our programs or to identify other issues that require substantial expenditures, changes in our operations, or payments to clients or reporting to U.S. authorities; the results of our review of our billing practices, including additional findings or amounts we may be required to reimburse clients, as well as potential consequences of such review, including damage to our client relationships or our reputation and adverse actions by governmental authorities; the results of, and costs associated with, governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, litigation and similar claims, disputes, or civil or criminal proceedings; changes or potential changes in the amount of compensation we receive from clients for our services, and the mix of services provided by us that clients choose; the large institutional clients on which we focus are often able to exert considerable market influence and have diverse investment activities, and this, combined with strong competitive market forces, subjects us to significant pressure to reduce the fees we charge, to potentially significant changes in our AUCA or our AUM in the event of the acquisition or loss of a client, in whole or in part, and to potentially significant changes in our fee revenue in the event a client re-balances or changes its investment approach or otherwise re-directs assets to lower- or higher-fee asset classes; the potential for losses arising from our investments in sponsored investment funds; the possibility that our clients will incur substantial losses in investment pools for which we act as agent, the possibility of significant reductions in the liquidity or valuation of assets underlying those pools and the potential that clients will seek to hold us liable for such losses; our ability to anticipate and manage the level and timing of redemptions and withdrawals from our collateral pools and other collective investment products; the credit agency ratings of our debt and depositary obligations and investor and client perceptions of our financial strength; adverse publicity, whether specific to State Street or regarding other industry participants or industry-wide factors, or other reputational harm; our ability to control operational risks, data security breach risks and outsourcing risks, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights, the possibility of errors in the quantitative models we use to manage our business, and the possibility that our controls will prove insufficient, fail or be circumvented; our ability to expand our use of technology to enhance the efficiency, accuracy and reliability of our operations and our dependencies on information technology and our ability to control related risks, including cyber-crime and other threats to our information technology infrastructure and systems (including those of our third-party service providers) and their effective operation both independently and with external systems, and complexities and costs of protecting the security of such systems and data; changes or potential changes to the competitive environment, including changes due to regulatory and technological changes, the effects of industry consolidation and perceptions of State Street as a suitable service provider or counterparty; our ability to complete acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures, including the ability to obtain regulatory approvals, the ability to arrange financing as required and the ability to satisfy closing conditions; the risks that our acquired businesses and joint ventures will not achieve their anticipated financial, operational and product innovation benefits or will not be integrated successfully, or that the integration will take longer than anticipated; that expected synergies will not be achieved or unexpected negative synergies or liabilities will be experienced; that client and deposit retention goals will not be met; that other regulatory or operational challenges will be experienced; and that disruptions from the transaction will harm our relationships with our clients, our employees or regulators; our ability to recognize evolving needs of our clients and to develop products that are responsive to such trends and profitable to us; the performance of and demand for the products and services we offer; and the potential for new products and services to impose additional costs on us and expose us to increased operational risk; our ability to grow revenue, manage expenses, attract and retain highly skilled people and raise the capital necessary to achieve our business goals and comply with regulatory requirements and expectations; changes in accounting standards and practices; and the impact of the U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and changes in tax legislation and in the interpretation of existing tax laws by U.S. and non-U.S. tax authorities that affect the amount of taxes due.\nOther important factors that could cause actual results to differ indicated by any forward-looking statements are set forth in our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent SEC filings. We encourage investors to read these filings, particularly the sections on risk factors, for additional information with respect to any forward-looking statements and prior to making any investment decision.
