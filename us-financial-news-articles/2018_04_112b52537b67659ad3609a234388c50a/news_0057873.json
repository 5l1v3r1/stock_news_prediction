They reiterated their “market perform” rating on the stock.\nActive managers such as Brewin Dolphin are facing competition and fee pressure from index-tracking passive funds, leading to a round of consolidation in the sector.\nBrewin Dolphin reported a 15 percent rise in full-year first-quarter profit to 57.6 million pounds ($80.20 million) in November.\nIts assets under management rose 3.5 percent in the quarter to end-December, to 41.5 billion pounds, it said in January.
