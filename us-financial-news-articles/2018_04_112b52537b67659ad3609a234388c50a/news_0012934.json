Security forces foiled the terrorist plots after the operation,” Arabiya added.\nThe town, in an oil-producing province and home to a large Shi’ite population, is a flashpoint between the Sunni Muslim government and Shi’ites complaining of discrimination.\nSince 2011 the region has been shaken by frequent, though mostly peaceful, protests by the Shi’ite minority.\nShi’ite militants, angry over what they say is repression of their community, have sometimes repeatedly launched deadly attacks on Saudi security forces.\nSaudi authorities said a Shi’ite judge was abducted and killed by wanted militants in December, and a militant suspect was shot and killed in January in a shootout.\nReporting By Noah Browning; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T11:00:54.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
