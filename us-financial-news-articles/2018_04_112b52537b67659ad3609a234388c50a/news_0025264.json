Consensus forecast was for a reading of 100.5.\n\"Although it fell in April, the University of Michigan consumer confidence index remains at a high level by past standards and suggests that the slowdown in spending growth at the start of this year will prove to be a blip,\" Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.\nThe dollar was on pace for a weekly gain of 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen and 0.3 percent against the Swiss franc.\nThe Swiss and Japanese currencies are often sought in times of global tension partly because the countries have big current account surpluses.\nThe weakening of the safe-haven currencies suggested investors were less worried after a week dominated by U.S.-China trade tensions and the possibility of a U.S.-led missile strike on Syria.\nSterling rose to a 10-week high against the dollar and pulled itself out of a six-month trading range against the euro, prompting investors to unwind long euro positions.\n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by David Gregorio and Susan Thomas)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T15:16:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
