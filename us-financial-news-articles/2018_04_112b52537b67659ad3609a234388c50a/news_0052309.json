Picture taken May 29, 2017. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo Net profit for the year totaled 714.3 billion roubles ($11.41 billion), the company said, down from 951.6 billion roubles a year earlier.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters had expected the company to post a net profit of 684 billion roubles.\nNet debt increased 24 percent year-on-year to 2.4 trillion roubles, Gazprom said, due to currency exchange rates.\nThe company also booked reserves of more than 198.8 billion roubles, mainly due a legal dispute with Ukrainian state-owned energy firm Naftogaz.\nGazprom has to pay Ukraine $2.56 billion after a Stockholm court found in Naftogazâ€™s favor in the final stage of a long-running legal battle in February.\nThis sum is net of mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit. Naftogaz was awarded damages of $4.63 billion, but since the court previously ordered Naftogaz to pay Gazprom for gas supply arrears, the net payment Gazprom will have to make to Ukraine is $2.56 billion.\nRevenue totaled 6.5 trillion roubles in 2017, Gazprom said, while earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 1.47 trillion roubles.\n($1 = 62.5978 roubles)\nReporting by Oksana Kobzeva and Vladimir Soldatkin; Writing by Jack Stubbs; Editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:14:22.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
