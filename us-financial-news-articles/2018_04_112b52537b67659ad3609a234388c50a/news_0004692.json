Still, the mood across global financial markets was cautious as concerns over a United States-China trade war lingered. The peso firmed 1.2 percent to 2,773 to the dollar, leading gains among Latin American currencies and recovering from a 0.6 percent drop the day before. The rebound was largely underpinned by an upswing in oil prices, which had posted their biggest one-day fall in almost a year the day before.
