The increase has been primarily driven by purchases of Chinese treasury bonds. \nOverseas investors’ holdings of Chinese treasury bonds rose by 21.2 billion yuan in March, or 3.1 percent, to 712.1 billion yuan. That represents 5.85 percent of outstanding government bonds, also the highest proportion to date. \nIn March, Bloomberg announced that the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index will begin to include Chinese yuan-denominated government and policy bank securities in April next year. The inclusion will be phased in over a 20-month period. $1 = 6.2970 Chinese yuan Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T10:51:37.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
