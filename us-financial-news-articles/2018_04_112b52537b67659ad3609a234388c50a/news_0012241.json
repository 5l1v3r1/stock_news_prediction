Authorities have launched an investigation into the matter.\n“We have suspended direct trading with Samsung Securities on concerns over decreasing stability in trading after a financial accident occurred,” an official with the National Pension Service said.\nThe official declined to disclose the volume of the fund’s stock trading done through Samsung. It had 136 trillion won ($127 billion) of its assets invested in the local stock market as of January.\nSamsung Securities, one of South Korea’s biggest brokerages, issued the shares in error when it was supposed to pay dividends worth 2.8 billion won to employees under a stock ownership plan.\nIts stock extended losses on Tuesday and has fallen 10 percent since Thursday’s close, wiping about $330 million from its market value.
