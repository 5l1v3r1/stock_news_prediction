Correlated growth around the world is continuing at a reasonable pace. And so there is a good amount of activity that's been building,\" he said. \"Looking at the indicators that we can see, I'd expect to see a relatively robust deal-making environment continue throughout the year.\"\nAndrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty Images David Solomon, Goldman Sachs & Co.
