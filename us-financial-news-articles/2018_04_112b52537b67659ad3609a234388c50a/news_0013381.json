However, the puck then squirted loose in the crease, and Johansen tapped it into the net.\nCraig Smith led Nashville with two goals. Johansen finished with one goal and one assist, as did teammate Roman Josi.\nRyan Ellis and Kyle Turris both had two assists for Nashville in the victory.\nWashington already has clinched the Metropolitan Division title, which it locked up earlier this week with a victory over Pittsburgh.\nEvgeny Kuznetsov led the Capitals with two goals and one assist.\nThe first three goals of this game all came on the power play. Smith gave the Predators a 1-0 lead by scoring on a rebound from right in front 4:17 into the game.\nWashington tied the game at 4:29 of the second period when Alex Ovechkin scored an extra-man goal on a bullet from the left side. The Capitals then took a 2-1 lead when Kuznetsov scored at 6:47 of the period.\nKuznetsov was trying to make a pass across the crease but the puck hit a Nashville player and then slid into the net.\nSmith then tied the game with 5:57 left in the period, scoring on a rebound from in front after a shot bounced off goalie Grubauer’s chest.\nKuznetsov’s second goal gave Washington a 3-2 lead 1:07 into the third period. He came in along the right wing and put a backhand shot past goalie Juuse Saros on the short side.\nNashville tied it 8:19 into the third period on a Josi power-play goal.\nThe Capitals held a pre-game ceremony honoring Ovechkin for being the first Capital in franchise history to play in 1,000 games.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T15:59:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
