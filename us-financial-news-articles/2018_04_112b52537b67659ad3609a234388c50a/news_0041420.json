As of 10:46 a.m. EDT (1446 GMT), the benchmark was up $1.65, or 2.5 percent, at $68.17 a barrel.\nBrent futures gained $1.53, or 2.1 percent, to $73.11 a barrel, after hitting $73.30, highest since November 2014.\nRefining runs fell, as some plants powered down for seasonal maintenance, but the drop in gasoline points to reasonably solid demand, with overall motor gasoline demand up 0.7 percent in the last four weeks compared with the same period a year ago.\nDistillate product demand was down 2 percent from the same time period a year ago, but jet fuel demand rose 5.3 percent.\nRefinery crude runs fell by 70,000 barrels per day as utilization rates fell by 1.1 percentage points to 92.4 percent of total capacity, the EIA data showed.\nCrude stocks were also reduced as a result of net crude import declines, which fell by 1.3 million bpd last week.\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI fell by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said.
