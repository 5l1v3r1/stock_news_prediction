It’s not a crime to be born Russian. It’s not a crime to be rich,” he told reporters.\n“We have significantly increased amount of work ongoing, some of which is against people who are Russian nationals, but there is a wide spread of activity if you look at the nationality of those involved.”\nToon said their work was painstaking and it took time to build watertight cases. The NCA’s International Corruption Unit, which had been operating for about three years, had submitted some cases to prosecutors to consider and he expected they would authorise charges to be made within the next three months.\n“None of this stuff gets to court very quickly,” he said adding a couple of the charges would be “on quite significant, largescale cases”.\nAsked if those might have a Russian connection, he said: “There is something in there you might find interesting if you were thinking about Russians.”\nHe said the corrupt elites were those who had abused political office or senior position in private or nationalised industries to amass tens of millions of pounds.\n“Some of them you are talking about ridiculous amounts of money,” he said. “It’s the kind of lifestyles of the rich and famous but generally without the ‘and famous’ bit at the end.”\n($1 = 0.7057 pounds)\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T21:18:18.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
