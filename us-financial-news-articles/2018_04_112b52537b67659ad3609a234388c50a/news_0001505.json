Prior to Intralinks, Ken led IBM's worldwide Customer Analytics business, including the Tealeaf Technologies and Coremetrics acquisitions. He was also vice president of IBM's enterprise content management business including IBM's FileNet acquisition where he built the industry's largest ECM business and served on the board of directors for AIIM.

He served as general counsel and senior vice president of corporate development at Sophos Group plc; vice president and general counsel at Rocket Software; and senior vice president of legal and regulatory services at Phase Forward. In his new role, Buchler will work closely with the executive team and the board of directors to ensure Intralinks delivers high-quality services within a global compliance framework.\n\"As we head into a year of growth and development, I knew it was important to also build a strong, engaged, and talented leadership team,\" said Leif O'Leary, CEO at Intralinks. \"We feel fortunate to have these three exceptional professionals joining our team and know the expertise they each bring will help propel Intralinks forward over the next year.\"\nWith the leadership team solidified, Intralinks will continue to pursue strategic growth strategies such as the previously announced Toppan Vintage strategic alliance.
