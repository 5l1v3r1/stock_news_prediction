The offer was rejected by LaSalle’s board. \nIn a letter to LaSalle’s management, founder of the hedge fund, Parag Vora, said Pebblebrook’s initial offer was “inadequate”, but presents a “compelling” opportunity for a more efficient cost of capital and stronger cash flows. \nVora urged LaSalle, owner of Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue, to form an independent strategic committee to negotiate with Pebblebrook and gauge interest from other potential buyers. \n\"We believe a sale of the entire Company would maximize value for shareholders,\" Vora said, after his hedge fund became the third biggest shareholder in LaSalle.
