[nL5N1GE7TK]\n“The release of political prisoners comes to strengthen the spirit of reconciliation, national harmony and peace created by the national dialogue” and as part of “steps to prepare a permanent constitution for the country,” SUNA said.\nSince 2015 Bashir has held ongoing meetings with opposition and rebel groups under the banner of a national dialogue, in part to end longstanding conflicts in warring regions such as Darfur.\nMany groups have boycotted the initiative however, demanding that Bashir first repeal what they describe as repressive security and press laws and free political detainees.\nSUNA did not specify how many political prisoners the decision would affect or the names of any of those set to be released.\nLast month Bashir ordered about 80 political detainees released, weeks after they were arrested amid countrywide protests over soaring food prices and ongoing austerity measures.\nOpposition groups have said about 50 political detainees remain in prison, including prominent politician Mohamed Mokhtar al-Khatib, the leader of Sudan’s communist party.\n(Corrects vice president to prime minister in paragraph 3)\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz in Khartoum, Additional reporting by Omar Fahmy in Cairo; Writing by Eric Knecht; Editing by Dominic Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:52:09.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
