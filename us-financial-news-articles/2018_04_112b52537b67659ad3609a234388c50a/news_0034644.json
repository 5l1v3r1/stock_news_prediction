Michel Hazanavicius (“The Artist”) sets out to do that in “Godard Mon Amour,” and to capture the bolt’s zigzags in a fiction film. His subject is Jean-Luc Godard, the most provocative, perplexing, political and poetic of the New Wave directors who reinvented the movie medium in France during the late 1950s and 1960s. That Mr. Hazanavicius makes the attempt is impressive; Godard has never been readily accessible, to say the least. That he frames his film as a love story seems implausible, but bears more fruit—however prickly or acidic—than you might expect. The result is an entertainment of surprising liveliness. It’s also mindbait for Godard fans in which admiration for what the venerable filmmaker has achieved--he’s still turning out films at 87--is mixed with faintly elegiac regret for the stern, remote figure he’s become. (This film’s title is a wordplay on “Hiroshima Mon Amour, the 1959 classic by Alain Resnais. )\nMore Film Reviews\n‘I Feel Pretty’ The year is 1967, one year before student and worker protests brought the French economy to a halt. The place is Paris, and the lovers are Godard (a skillful performance by Louis Garrel ) and his wife-to- be, the actress Anne Wiazemsky (a lovely performance by Stacy Martin ). He, a 37-year-old revolutionary who already considers himself an old man, is completing “La Chinoise,” the phenomenal political comedy that Pauline Kael likened, ardently, to “a speed-freak’s anticipatory vision of the political horrors to come.” She, a rising star at 17 and granddaughter of the conservative literary lion François Mauriac, is a radiant embodiment of the lyricism with which Godard infuses his cool Brechtian mashups. (Mr. Hazanavicius based his screenplay on Wiazemsky’s 2015 book, “Un An Après.”)\nWe don’t see Godard on set directing his film, apart from a fleeting glance in a visually witty preface. (Nonetheless, Mr. Hazanavicius’s cinematographer, Guillaume Schiffman, and production designer, Christian Marti, fill “Godard Mon Amour” with Godardian tropes: words on posters or walls used both for their meaning and their graphic design; quick-twitch montages of conflicting elements; puckish camera moves meant to provoke eye and brain.) The story that plays out, more sensual than intellectual, concerns the love that erupts between two people mismatched philosophically as well as chronologically, and that cools as Godard distances himself from—indeed renounces—the playfulness and ill-concealed passion that have made his pre-1968 films so appealing. (For those who don’t know his formidable body of work, significant titles include “Breathless,” “A Woman Is a Woman,” “Contempt,” “Band of Outsiders,” “Alphaville,” “Pierrot le Fou,” “Masculin Féminin,” “Two or Three Things I Know About Her” and the chaotic, prophetic “Weekend.”)\nLouis Garrel Photo: Cohen Media Group When “La Chinoise” debuts at the Avignon Film Festival, it’s met with so little enthusiasm that Godard, in despair, declares the cinema dead and denies that he is, in fact, Godard. “I’m an actor pretending to be Godard,” says the actor pretending to be Godard to the actress pretending to be Anne. (That’s only a hint of the film’s complexities.) She wants him to go back in his work to being light and charming, while people in the street ask when he’s going to make funny films again; his 1960 debut feature, “Breathless,” was radical in style but a crowd-pleaser in its effect. Yet the tumultuous events of 1968, far from tickling his funny bone, radicalize him further, to the point where he joins forces with the very young and very ideological Jean-Pierre Gorin ( Félix Kysyl ) to create a new cinema that has no place for fun, or for moviegoers seeking enjoyment.\nI think this new movie is such a special taste that it will alienate many of today’s moviegoers seeking enjoyment. I say “I think” because I’m too close to the subject to judge it objectively, having been educated and enchanted by so many of Godard’s pre-Gorin films, and having lived in France around the time “Breathless” was made. Mr. Hazanavicius’s film is far from a fairy-tale romance. The man it portrays can be unfeeling toward the woman who loves him, icy in his increasing alienation, cruel in his contempt for gifted colleagues, and on one occasion flagrantly anti-Semitic.\nStacy Martin Photo: Cohen Media Group All the same, “Godard Mon Amour” sets a turning point in French cinema in the context of a crucial moment in modern history, and does so with underlying seriousness, even though much of the film is very funny. (I particularly liked a long argument about the nature of film in a crowded car, and Jean-Luc and Anne having a theoretical discussion of nudity in film while both are naked in their apartment.) What’s more, there’s a special poignancy to hearing Godard talk of the need to kill conventional cinema. We, too, live in revolutionary times,when cinema as we’ve known it may be mortally ill, and there’s no Godard in sight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:37:08.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
