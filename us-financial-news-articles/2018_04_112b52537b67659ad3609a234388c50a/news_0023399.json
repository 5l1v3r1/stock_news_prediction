XPO -0.56% is the latest transportation company to offer customers an online freight marketplace, bringing big investment and the company’s own ready-made list of shippers and carriers to fire back at the upstarts.\nXPO launched its service, called XPO Connect, earlier this year as a pilot with about 50 shippers and is now opening it up more widely, the company said Wednesday. Shippers will be able to book and track shipments online as well as monitor changes in carrier capacity, spot rates and shifts in load availability by geography.\n“We’re starting off today with our brokerage network, then moving next to XPO Intermodal,” the division that manages transportation over long distances by train and truck, said Mario Harik, XPO’s chief information officer.\nMost retailers and manufacturers book some cargo shipments directly with carriers, and the rest through intermediaries like brokers and freight forwarders. Many of those are small companies that rely on phone calls or even fax machines to set up and track loads.\nAlso in Logistics\nXPO Logistics Joins Push to Digital Freight Booking April 11, 2018 Boeing, Airbus Boost Jet Backlogs April 10, 2018 Trucking Hiring, Logistics Payrolls Surged Last Month April 6, 2018 Hurricane-Damaged Cars Moving Again as U.S. Exports April 5, 2018 Startups such as Uber Freight, Transfix and Convoy are challenging that model with online platforms , apps or cloud-based software to connect shippers with transportation providers. The new crop of cargo-matching firms say they can slash shipping costs while handling goods more efficiently and offering greater transparency on pricing.\nDespite interest from investors, they haven’t done away with freight middlemen quite yet, however.\nBig companies like C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., the largest freight brokerage firm in the U.S., XPO and global logistics firm DB Schenker are putting millions into technology . Some are investing in or outright acquiring online freight platforms\nLast year, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc., one of the largest U.S. trucking companies, launched its own digital freight marketplace. This year, it expects to book about $500 million in freight, or some 240,000 loads, up from 30,000 the previous year, through the service, which also allows shippers to track loads and provides visibility on pricing and other data.\nJ.B. Hunt had $1.02 billion in gross revenue from brokerage last year, Bart De Muynck, a transportation analyst with Gartner Inc., noted, while Uber, Transfix and Convoy “make maybe 3% of that combined.”\nStill, Mr. De Muynck said, the digital challengers eventually will push brokers to adopt more technology and reduce their commissions. Business at bigger companies will become more automated, he said, as rows of brokers working phones to book freight give way to transactions where shippers and carriers enter their own information into digital marketplaces.\nAt XPO, transactions booked through the new platform will rely on a mix of brokers and automation. “Over time, a higher number would be no-touch shipments,” Mr. Harik said.\nThe marketplace will be limited to existing customers, Mr. Harik said, adding, “It’s not something where someone can get a spot Quote: and move one shipment.”\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T23:53:32.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
