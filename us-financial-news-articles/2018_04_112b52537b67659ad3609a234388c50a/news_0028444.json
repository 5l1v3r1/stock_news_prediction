Marte had reached based with a one-out bunt earlier in the inning.\nGeorge Kontos (1-1) earned the victory as four Pittsburgh pitchers held Miami to six hits. Felipe Vazquez retired all three batters in the ninth to record his fifth save in five attempts.\nFrancisco Cervelli had a pair of hits for the Pirates.\nThe second game of the series was a pitchers’ duel from the start between a pair of right-handers — Pittsburgh’s Jameson Taillon and Miami’s Trevor Richards.\nTaillon hurled six scoreless innings, giving up four hits in his third quality start of the season. He fired a one-hit shutout in a 5-0 win over the Cincinnati Reds last Sunday, earning him National League Player of the Week honors. The shutout was the first of his career.\nStarlin Castro and Brian Anderson each had two hits for Miami, and Ziegler (0-3) took the loss.\nRichards kept the Pirates off the board over seven innings in his best outing in the big leagues. He allowed just two hits, struck out two and walked one.\nRichards was making his third start for the Marlins, and he stated his case to remain in the rotation. Miami is without injured starters Dan Straily and Wei-Yin Chen, and the Marlins used career reliever Jarlin Garcia as a starter in loss to the New York Mets on Wednesday.\nIn his previous two starts against the Boston Red Sox and the Philadelphia Phillies, Richards failed to make it through five innings, allowing a total of eight runs.\nThe only batter Richards had a problem with Saturday was Cervelli, who reached base all three times. The catcher had a ground-rule double and a single and was also hit by a pitch in the first seven innings. The only other Pirate to reach base against Richards was Jordy Mercer, who drew an intentional walk after Cervelli’s double.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:06:20.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
