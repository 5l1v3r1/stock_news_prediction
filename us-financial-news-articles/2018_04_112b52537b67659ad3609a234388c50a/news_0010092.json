The ECB is responsible for overseeing Latvian banks including ABLV Bank, which shut in February after the U.S. Treasury accused it of money laundering. ABLV has said it wasn’t guilty of money laundering and had invested heavily in compliance systems.\nThe ECB said it had asked the court to rule on whether Latvia’s restrictions on Mr. Rimsevics violate EU law, according to a statement published on Friday. Mr. Rimsevics has been unable to attend ECB policy meetings since he was detained by anti-corruption investigators in mid-February. He has been represented in Frankfurt by his deputy, Zoja Razmusa, who can’t vote on any decisions.\nThe ECB’s move will help clarify the conditions under which ECB governors can be suspended or ousted. The bank hopes that this will help to safeguard the independence of its top officials, at least three of whom have recently become entwined in domestic investigations. They include Greek central-bank head Yannis Stournaras, who faces a parliamentary investigation into whether he took bribes to fix drug prices, and Bostjan Jazbec, governor of Slovenia’s central bank, who is embroiled in a long-running investigation into a 2013 overhaul of the country’s banks. Both officials deny any wrongdoing.\nMr. Jazbec will step down as ECB governor later this month, more than a year before his term ends, to take up a job with the EU’s bank-resolution authority in Brussels.\nUnder EU law, an ECB governor can only be removed from office “if he no longer fulfils the conditions required for the performance of his duties or if he has been guilty of serious misconduct.”\nThat wording leaves considerable room for interpretation by national authorities, who could put pressure on central-bank governors with whom they have policy disagreements by launching politically motivated investigations.\nRelated\nLatvia Detains Top ECB Official in Anticorruption Probe ECB Freezes All Payments by Latvia’s ABLV Bank Amid Treasury Department Probe Greek Investigates Politicians in Novartis Bribery Probe The ECB was careful to stress that its move was “not meant to interfere with the criminal investigation” in Latvia. ECB president Mario Draghi has not sought to defend Mr. Rimsevics. By contrast, Mr. Draghi has spoken out repeatedly in support of Mr. Stournaras, who he describes as a “respected” member of the ECB’s rate-setting committee.\nLatvian banks have repeatedly faced allegations of money laundering . Local regulators and prosecutors have been reluctant to prosecute laundering cases or impose fines on banks, according to reports by the European Commission and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Mr. Rimsevics doesn’t directly oversee banking regulators or public prosecutors, but U.S. Treasury officials have repeatedly pressed Mr. Rimsevics to use his influence to make money-laundering cases a bigger priority in Latvia.\nTwo Latvian banks accuse Mr. Rimsevics of seeking $100,000 bribes in return for favorable treatment by the central bank he has overseen for 17 years. Mr. Rimsevics says those accusations are not only false but pushed by Russian oligarchs, whom he hasn’t named, but who he says want to undermine his authority over Latvia’s banking system.\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com and Drew Hinshaw at drew.hinshaw@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:32:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
