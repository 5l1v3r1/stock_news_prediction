Rob is and always will be one of the greatest. We wish him the very best recovery possible.” \nFormer England centre Brad Barritt was “shocked” by the news. \n“A terrific player and bloke,” the Saracens back tweeted. \n“Wishing you all the best with your recovery and for your next step in life. Congratulations on a fantastic career.” Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T05:27:50.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
