Passengers aboard Southwest Flight 1380 had rushed to pull the victim back into the plane after she was partially sucked out of a window, witnesses said.\nIt was the first fatality on a U.S. airline since the 2009 Colgan Air crash near Buffalo, New York.\nshow chapters Safety in the skies in focus after Southwest engine failure 9 Hours Ago | 03:30 The CFM56-7B, the engine involved in Tuesday's incident, is one of the most common in the world. It powers some 6,700 aircraft around the world, according to its manufacturer CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran Aircraft Engines.\nSouthwest said it was its first on-board fatality related to an incident or accident in its history.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration sought more rigorous testing of the engine last August, when it proposed a rule that would subject the engines to ultrasonic tests of their fan blades.\nOn Aug. 27, 2016, a Southwest flight made an emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the disc, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Debris punched a 16-inch by 5-inch hole in the left fuselage, above the wing, the NTSB had said.\nIn both incidents what occurred is known as uncontained engine failure. Engines are designed with special casings that are intended to keep blades and other metal from flying out and potentially striking the fuselage of the plane. Engine manufacturers put them through rigorous testing to make sure blades and other metal can be contained.\nSouthwest late Tuesday said that it would accelerate testing of CFM56 engines \"out of an abundance of caution\" and that the ultrasonic checks of the engines' fan blades would likely be completed within 30 days. Several other airlines using this engine made similar announcements.\nGE and Safran are deploying technicians to support Southwest's inspection program. In a statement, GE said it also is supporting the effort of the NTSB and Southwest as they investigate the cause of the accident.\n\"By law, CFM cannot provide information about the accident or details related to it. You may contact the NTSB for updates,\" GE said in a statement. \"The members of the CFM Team worldwide wish to express their deepest condolences to family of the victim of this incident.\nshow chapters NTSB: Southwest engine showed signs of metal fatigue 9 Hours Ago | 02:04", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:19:07.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
