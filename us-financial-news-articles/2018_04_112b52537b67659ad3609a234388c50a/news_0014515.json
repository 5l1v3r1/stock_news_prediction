The third baseman went 3-for-4 and also contributed a game-tying, two-run single in the sixth inning.\nJoey Votto, Tucker Barnhart and Jose Peraza had two hits apiece for the Reds, who finished with 11. Cincinnati recovered from a 4-0 deficit to improve to 2-5.\nLeft-hander Wandy Peralta (1-0) struck out three in two perfect innings of relief and right-hander Raisel Iglesias picked up his second save.\nJordy Mercer had two of the Pirates’ eight hits. Pittsburgh drops to 6-2.\nPirates right-hander Chad Kuhl allowed two runs, five hits and three walks and struck out seven over five innings.\nReds right-hander Sal Romano gave up four runs and seven hits in five innings, and struck out one and walked one.\nPittsburgh right fielder Gregory Polanco sat out with a sore right foot after fouling a ball of it on Friday. Polanco entered Saturday with a major league-leading 11 RBIs.\nCincinnati pitchers retired 16 consecutive batters until Colin Moran singled off Iglesias to open the ninth. But Moran was caught stealing and Iglesias struck out Mercer and retired Sean Rodriguez on a grounder to end it.\nPittsburgh jumped ahead in the first as Starling Marte and Josh Bell hit two-out singles to center and both scored on Corey Dickerson’s double to right.\nJosh Harrison’s sacrifice fly in the second made it 3-0, and Adam Frazier recorded a run-scoring single to center later in the inning to make it a four-run margin.\nThe Reds got on the board in the third on Votto’s sacrifice fly to right.\nCincinnati tallied in the fifth on a RBI single by Jesse Winker and later had the bases loaded with one out. But Kuhl struck out Scooter Gennett and Adam Duvall to escape further damage to keep the Pirates leading 4-2.\nThe Reds again loaded the bases with two outs in the sixth before Suarez stroked the tying two-run off right-hander Dovydas Neverauskas.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T11:48:47.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
