REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo After PNC reported first-quarter profit broadly in line with analysts’ estimates, the guidance by Chief Financial Officer Robert Rilley pushed shares to a more than three-month low.\nThe broader market and the S&P 500 financial sector index .SPSY were both lower, weighed down by quarterly results from JPMorgan Chase Co ( JPM.N ), Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) and Citigroup Inc ( C.N ).\nChief Executive Bill Demchak said on a post-earnings call he expects real estate markets to tighten, leading to slower loan growth in the business.\n“The combination of rising business optimism and lower corporate tax rates has raised the bar in terms of loan growth expectations,” Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sander said.\nPNC Financial forecast second-quarter provision for loan losses to be between $100 million and $150 million. This follows a 4.5 percent rise in loan loss provision to $92 million in the first quarter.\nThe higher provision and a 5 percent jump in expenses offset gains from higher interest income and pushed PNC Financial to report an in-line profit for the three months ended March 31.\nThe Pittsburgh-based bank, among the United States’ largest local lenders by assets, had beaten analysts’ profit estimates for the past seven quarters.\nThe company reported earnings per share of $2.43, in line with analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPNC Financial, which owns a minority stake in BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), said its loan portfolio grew 4 percent in the first quarter, with commercial lending expanding 6 percent.\nNet interest income rose 9 percent to $2.37 billion.\nReporting by Parikshit Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
