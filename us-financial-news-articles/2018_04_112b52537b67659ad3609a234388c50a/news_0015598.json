Its yield had previously been steady at around 6 percent, but on Tuesday it spiked to 28.5 percent, a record high. \nMeanwhile, Rusal board member Ivan Glasenberg, who is chief executive of Swiss-based trader Glencore, resigned on Tuesday, Glencore said. \nDeripaska’s companies have seen other resignations by non-Russian board members since the sanctions, with his newly-created holding company En+ Group saying board directors Dominique Fraisse and Zhao Guangming had quit on April 6 and 9 respectively. \nAs a major Rusal shareholder, Glencore added it was carefully considering how to protect its business and said it was pulling back from earlier plans to swap its 8.75 percent of Rusal for Global Depository Receipts in En+. \n“Glencore is committed to complying with all applicable sanctions in its business and is taking all necessary measures in order to mitigate any risks to Glencore’s business as a result of the designation of Rusal and EN+ as SDNs (specially designated nationals), including in respect of secondary sanctions,” Glencore said in a statement. \n“Glencore will not proceed with the Transaction at this time in light of the designation of Rusal and EN+ as SDNs,” it said.
