REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File Photo \nSupport for the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has fallen after contested financial rewards for ministers, protests against a further tightening of the abortion law and a diplomatic spat with Israel and the United States. \nThe party, which won in late 2015 on promises of vast social spending and restoring conservative values in the overwhelmingly Catholic Poland, had enjoyed popularity of above 40 percent, but a latest poll showed that support for the united liberal opposition overtook PiS for the first time.

It will also spend 5 billion zlotys on local roads. \n“We threw down the gauntlet to all the neoliberals who said that economic policy can only be based on their notes from the 1990s,” Morawiecki said, in a veiled criticism of the Civic Platform party which governed Poland for eight years before PiS came to power. \nJaroslaw Kaczynski, the party chairman and effectively Poland’s paramount leader said party members must be “unblemished”. \n“You don’t go into politics for the money,” he told the party. \nLocal elections will be held in autumn. Parliamentary elections are due in 2019 and the presidential vote in 2020.
