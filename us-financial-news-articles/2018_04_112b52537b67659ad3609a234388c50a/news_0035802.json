She said she has taken part in at least 10 rescue operations.\nMembers of four RBLAs are now spread across the state to spot forced labor, especially in brick kilns and rice mills, which are busiest in April and May before the monsoon rains hit, said RBLA members.\nThe first RBLA was formed in 2014, and three across Tamil Nadu that have joined since then.\nThe past year has seen a spike in membership - evidence that the movement to end debt bondage is getting stronger, said Gopal.\nBanned in 1976, bonded labor remains widespread, prompting the government to boost its efforts to clamp down, with plans to rescue more than 18 million people by 2030.\n“There are gaps and challenges in the implementation of the law,” said Kuralamuthan Thandavarayan of the IJM, which supports the RBLAs.\n“But officials can’t ignore the voice of the survivors who have suffered for years,” he added. “The formation of these associations has given them a platform to fight back.”\nAnother RBLA member, Arul Egambavan, said he was taken from his grandparents home at age 8 to work in a stone quarry. He labored to pay off his father’s debt of 10,000 rupees ($152) until being rescued 10 years later.\n“When I was freed, I didn’t know anything about the outside world,” Egambavan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“I had to turn to people who had been rescued earlier for help on everything - from how to apply for government grants to where to find work,” he said. “I want to return the favor.”\nReporting by Anuradha Nagaraj, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking and climate change.
