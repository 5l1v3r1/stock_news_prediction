But plans to develop it were put off several times over the past decade. \nDiscovered at the end of the century, it lies between two rapidly expanding gas hubs in Egypt and Israel, both of which have attracted huge investments in recent years. \nAttempts to develop the field were put on hold repeatedly after Hamas, which Western countries and Israel have designated as a terrorist group, took control over the Gaza Strip in 2007. \nIsrael then put an economic blockade on Gaza, raising questions about the financing of the project and the sharing of future profits among the Palestinians. \nIsrael has, however, said in the past it supports the field’s development.
