Operating profit in its core domestic segment plummeted 20 percent, and was down 6 percent overall.\nShares were flat in pre-market trade.\nThe company spent $1.5 billion in the quarter on network improvements like new technology and automating its parcel sorting hubs, and maintained its 2018 spending plan of between $6.5 billion to $7 billion.\nAtlanta-based UPS and rival FedEx have spent billions of dollars upgrading networks to handle surging e-commerce package volumes, weighing on margins and leaving investors frustrated over the expense.\nThe rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of making more, smaller deliveries to households, compared to businesses that receive more parcels at once.\nThe investments show UPS is betting that if it can handle more volume it can increase the number of packages it delivers to households, and eventually improve profitability, versus pushing for higher prices and less volume, analysts say.\nRevenue per parcel delivered rose just 2.6 percent, as higher prices and fuel surcharges offset the higher costs associated with delivering packages bought online, the company said.\nUPS posted first-quarter net income of $1.35 billion or $1.55 per share, up from $1.17 billion or $1.33 per share a year earlier, a 17 percent rise on a per share basis.\nAnalysts expected earnings per share of $1.54.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:06:12.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
