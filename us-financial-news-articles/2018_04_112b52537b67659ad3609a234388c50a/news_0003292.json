REUTERS/Claro Cortes IV/File Photo Another issue that will have to be resolved is self-ruled Taiwan, which maintains formal diplomatic ties with the Vatican. China, however, considers Taiwan a wayward province with no right to state-to-state relations.\nChen, who lost his position during a reshuffle of government departments China announced last month, added that channels of communication with the Vatican were unimpeded and Beijing hoped the Roman Catholic Church could meet it halfway.\nHowever, religion in China must be independent of outside influence and organized within the country, he said.\nAsked if denying the pope total authority to appoint bishops infringed upon the religious freedom of Chinese Catholics, Chen said, “I don’t accept that idea, and in the religious lives and practices of numerous Catholics, this does not exist.”\nXiao Hong, a former spokeswoman of the agency, said China was actively pursuing talks with the Vatican.\nFILE PHOTO: A Chinese Catholic confesses to a priest during a pilgrimage for the Virgin Mary on the outskirts of Taiyuan, capital of China's Shanxi province April 7, 2006. REUTERS/Reinhard Krause/File photo News of the impending deal has split Catholic communities across China and some faith leaders and believers both in and outside China have been critical of the accord.\nCardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, said the Vatican would be “selling out” to China’s ruling Communist Party.\nReporting by Christian Shepherd\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T05:58:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
