Since then, it has added infrastructure, mining, petroleum and power assets to its staple food and beverage businesses.\nThe National Economic and Development Authority’s board approved San Miguel’s 735.6 billion pesos ($14 billion) “unsolicited proposal”, subject to a final review, to build an airport in Bulacan province, near the capital Manila, Finance Secretary Carlos Domiguez said in a mobile phone message to reporters.\nThe airport is aimed at easing congestion at the country’s main gateway in Manila.\nSan Miguel’s proposal will be subject to a Swiss Challenge under government rules, meaning other groups will be invited to make competing offers, with the original bidder given the right to match any better proposal.\nIn November, San Miguel said the airport project would be constructed without any government subsidy and could be completed in five years upon the issuance of relevant government approvals.\nThe company had planned to invite other Filipino investors to participate in the project and said it would operate the airport under a build-operate-transfer scheme and a 50-year concession with the government.\nAmong other “Build, Build, Build” projects approved so far are the 12.6 billion pesos expansion of Clark International Airport, a 39.2 billion pesos flood-control project in the southern Mindanao region, and a 27.4 billion pesos bridge project in Manila.
