The project is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035.\nThe ITER project is a cooperation between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea with an estimated cost of about 20 billion euros ($25 billion).\nMember countries contribute the lion’s share of the ITER budget my manufacturing components in their own factories and then shipping them to France where they are assembled.\nSome of the 250 ultra-heavy components, which travel by sea, canal and road, are so large that France had to spend 110 million euros adapting roads to accommodate them.\nThe biggest components, some of which weigh nearly 600 tonnes, will be shipped to ITER in 2019-20.
