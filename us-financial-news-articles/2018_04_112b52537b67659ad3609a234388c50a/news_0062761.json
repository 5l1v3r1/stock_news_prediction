The changes at the management and board levels have better positioned the Company to execute on the Mara Rosa project development. 2018 will see an update to the Mara Rosa Pre-Feasibility Study to incorporate the findings from a Whittle Consulting Optimization Study, and a 10K meter exploration drilling program to expand the Mara Rosa Ore Reserve prior to launching a Feasibility Study in early 2019. This year will also see expanded exploration activities at the prospective Campos Verde and Amaralina properties near Mara Rosa, and at the Matilde, Butia, Caneleira and Zeca Souza exploration properties at the Lavras do Sul Project. With the completion of our recent financing, we are well positioned to execute on all of these activities. I would like to thank our shareholders, dedicated employees and local communities and government in Brazil for their continuing support, as we look forward to a very exciting year for the Company.”\n2017 HIGHLIGHTS AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nCompleted a corporate management reorganization Completed an Updated Pre-Feasibility Study at Mara Rosa, Brazil ¹\n• Post-tax net present value using 5% discount rate of US$178M @ $1,200 per ounce gold\n• Post-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 35.2%\n• Post-tax project payback of 2.2 years;\n• Average Life of Mine production 112,000 ounces per year over 8 years.\n¹ NI 43-101 report entitled “2017 Updated Pre-Feasibility Study Posse Mine Project – Mara Rosa GO” prepared by SRK Consulting dated April 2017. The qualified persons of the report are Gregory Keith Whitehouse and Rubens Jose de Mendonca. Both individuals are independent of the Company. Engaged Whittle Consulting for an Optimization Study on the Mara Rosa Gold Project. Extended the maturity date of its gold-linked credit facility from July 31, 2019 to June 30, 2022. Closed a private placement for $5.2M. Initiated a drilling program for Mara Rosa with the intent to extend the mine life to over 10 years.\nThe Company underwent board and management changes during the year and subsequent to the year end. The Board was enhanced through the addition of Rowland Uloth as the Executive Chairman, and Stephen Stow and Colin Sutherland as Independent Directors. Mike Mutchler joined the Company in January 2018 as President & CEO and Hemdat Sawh joined as CFO in November 2017. This team has the necessary background and experience to execute the development of the Mara Rosa Project and realize the potential of Lavras do Sul with increased exploration in 2018 and beyond.\nIn January 2018 the Company initiated a Whittle Consulting Optimization Study. We expect to incorporate the study findings into a Pre-Feasibility Study update early in Q3 2018.\nOn April 12, 2018 the Company closed a non-brokered private placement (the “Private Placement”) through the issuance of 18,427,780 units (“Units”) at a subscription price of $0.28 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $5,159,778. Each Unit is comprised of one common share (each, a “Common Share”) and one-half of one Common Share purchase warrant (each, a “Warrant”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one additional Common Share at an exercise price of $0.38 for a period of 24 months following the date of issue, subject to customary adjustment provisions. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement for advancing the Company’s mineral exploration and development projects, and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Company plans additional exploration drilling at Mara Rosa starting in May 2018 followed by an updated mineral resource which will be produced prior to launching a Feasibility Study (“FS”) in early 2019. Following the FS and Basic Engineering (“BE”) in early 2019, Amarillo will make an application for the Installation Permit – (LI or Licença de Instalação) and expects to begin construction of the Mara Rosa Gold Mine in 2020.\nAt Lavras do Sul, additional exploration work consisting of soil sampling, trench sampling and airborne magnetic surveying will be conducted on properties adjacent to the Butia project in an effort to explore for an extension of the Butia deposit.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nOperating Expenses – Three and Twelve Months 2017 and 2016 Three Months ended December 31 Year ended\nDecember 31 2017 2016 2017 2016 Consulting fees 440,733 459,269 893,376 645,419 General and administrative 75,429 57,030 334,796 237,667 Stock-based compensation 239,510 - 990,573 641,241 Professional fees 77,033 30,091 267,560 170,105 Other expenses 64,558 163,262 216,390 303,338 Subtotal before other items 897,263 709,652 2,702,695 1,998,490 Accretion on gold loans 325,987 375,945 1,288,023 1,119,546 Subtotal of expenses before Fx and FV changes 1,223,250 1,085,597 3,990,718 3,118,036 Foreign exchange loss/(gain) (844,878 ) (164,626 ) (811,538 ) (131,374 ) Loss/(gain) on FV of derivatives 107,431 (1,276,657 ) 1,110,085 557,586 Loss/(income) before taxes 485,803 (355,686 ) 4,289,265 3,544,248 Deferred tax 486,165 233,330 486,165 233,330 Net loss/(income) 971,968 (122,356 ) 4,775,430 3,777,578 Loss per share (0.01 ) 0.00 (0.06 ) (0.05 ) Total assets 34,186,492 34,246,927 34,186,492 34,246,927 Total non-current liabilities 11,050,397 8,798,174 11,050,397 8,798,174 The Company’s loss is mostly attributable to the items related to the gold-linked loan consisting of accretion, mark to market adjustments for gold price increase and foreign exchange gains due to strengthening of the Canadian dollar to the US dollar from the previous reporting periods.

An Updated Pre-Feasibility Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for the Mara Rosa Project was filed on SEDAR on May 4, 2017. In addition, Amarillo has an advanced exploration project with excellent grades at Lavras do Sul, also in Brazil. A Mineral Resource Estimate Study (NI 43-101 technical report) for Lavras do Sul was filed on SEDAR on October 4, 2010. Both projects have excellent nearby infrastructure. The Mara Rosa Project was awarded the main permit (LP) that gives social and environment permission to mine. This has allowed Amarillo to move forward and work on the installation permit (LI) for the Mara Rosa Project.\nFor further information, please contact: Mike Mutchler or Karen Mate President & CEO External Communications 416-294-0736 416-230-6454 mike.mutchler@amarillogold.com karen.mate@amarillogold.com 32 Richmond St. East Suite 201 Toronto, ON Canada, M5C 1P1 Website: www.amarillogold.com Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS:\nThis news release contains Forward Looking Statements regarding the Company’s current expectations regarding future events, including with respect to the Company’s business, operations and condition, management’s objectives, strategies, beliefs and intentions.
