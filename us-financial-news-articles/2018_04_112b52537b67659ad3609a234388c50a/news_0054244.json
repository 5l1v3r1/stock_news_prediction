Croatia’s moves are contrary to the spirit of neighborly cooperation and respect for basic European values that includes freedom of movement,” it said in a statement.\nOn Sunday, Croatia accused Vulin of undermining its sovereignty with a statement in which he said Zagreb had no authority to decide on whether he could visit Croatia or not.\nAfter Croatia’s move, Vulin said Zagreb’s barring of his visit to the memorial service in the village of Mlaka, near the site of the Jasenovac camp, was an attempt by Croatia, an EU member, to silence those speaking about the crimes committed there by the Nazi-backed Independent State of Croatia.\nReporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T17:13:22.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
