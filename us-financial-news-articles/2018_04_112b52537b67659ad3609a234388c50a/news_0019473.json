Both were trading at lows not seen since January 2017.\nInvestors are concerned about pressure from President Tayyip Erdogan to reduce borrowing costs when inflation remains high, while political tensions in Russia and Syria are also taking a toll, driving the lira to repeated record lows.\nThe closely-watched current account deficit came in at $4.152 billion in February, below a forecast of $4.2 billion in a Reuters poll, but sharply wider than the $2.566 billion in February last year.
