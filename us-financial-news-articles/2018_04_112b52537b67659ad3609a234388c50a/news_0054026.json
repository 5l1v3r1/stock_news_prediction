REUTERS/David Lawder The pause underlined how much work remains to be done to update the North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada, the United States and Mexico, especially relating to automotive content and production rules.\nUnder pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to nail down a deal, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland have been holding intense talks in Washington with Lighthizer since Tuesday.\nThe Trump administration has threatened to impose sanctions on Canadian and Mexican steel and aluminum on May 1 if it deems not enough progress has been made in the talks. It was not immediately clear if that deadline has also been postponed.\n“We ministers will be meeting again on Monday the 7th,” Guajardo told reporters after a fourth straight day of top-level talks.\nThe question of how much content in a vehicle should be sourced from within the NAFTA region to qualify it for duty-free status is proving to be one of the hardest issues to resolve.\nU.S. negotiators initially demanded that North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value, up from 62.5 percent now.\nIndustry officials say that has been cut to 75 percent, with production of certain components specified in areas that pay higher wages - a demand aimed at preserving manufacturing in the United States and Canada and putting upward pressure on low Mexican auto wages.\nThe break will allow the Mexican team to return home for consultations after shifts in the U.S. proposals, a person who was present in the meetings said.\nOther sources briefed on the talks said Mexico had asked for the timeout to bounce the latest U.S. position off its auto industry executives.\nThe break will also allow Lighthizer to visit China with other senior Trump administration officials next week as planned. Freeland is scheduled to be in Bangladesh on May 3.\nFreeland said the ministers would reconvene in Washington “in a week or so” after the political consultations at home.\n“We have made a lot of progress here in Washington this week,” she said. Freeland did not answer directly when asked whether the United States would impose the tariffs on May 1.\nAdditional reporting by Jason Lange and Ana Isabel Martinez in Mexico City; Writing by David Ljunggren; Editing by Paul Simao and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:44:17.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
