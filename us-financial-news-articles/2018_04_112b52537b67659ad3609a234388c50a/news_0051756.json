As for the Japanese market, sales decreased 15.3% year-on-year to ¥383.4 billion largely due to the impact of transferring 16 long-listed products in April 2017, and the introduction of generics for Micardis ® for the treatment of hypertension in June 2017. In EMEA, sales decreased due to the continued impact of transferring the dermatology business in April 2016, yet sales increased when excluding this item.\nFY2018 Guidance\nThe forecasts for fiscal year 2018 ending March 31, 2019 (“FY2018”) (core basis) are as shown in the following table. The sales forecast is ¥1,278.0 billion (- 1.7% year-on-year). Core operating profit is forecasted at ¥262.0 billion (-2.5% year-on-year). In FY2018, we expect negative impact on sales and profit due to a decreased amount of recognized deferred income following the transfer of the global dermatology business and the transfer of long-listed products in Japan, foreign exchange, and other factors. Despite the negative impact of the NHI drug price revision in Japan and other factors, we are forecasting sales and core operating profit, excluding the factors associated with previously discussed business transfers and the impact of foreign exchange, to remain largely unchanged year-on-year.\nConsolidated Full-year Business Forecasts (core basis)\n(Millions of yen)\nFY2017 Results\nFY2018 Forecasts\nChange\n(%) Sales 1,300,316 1,278,000 -22,316\n(-1.7%)\nCore Operating profit 268,698 262,000 -6,698\n(-2.5%)\nCore Profit for the year 204,326 210,000 +5,674\n(+2.8%)\nNOTE: For further information on the results including on a full basis, please refer to the reference documents: Financial Results, Supplementary Documents, Overview of R&D Pipeline and Presentation Material for the Financial Information Meeting available on the Astellas website at https://www.astellas.com/en/investors/ir-library .\nStrategic Highlights in FY2017\nAstellas continues to create sustainable growth over the mid-to-long term through the pursuit of three main strategies: “Maximizing the Product Value,” ”Creating Innovation” and “Pursuing Operational Excellence.” The company achieved many accomplishments against these strategies as outlined below:\nMaximizing the Product Value\nContinued to maximize the growth of the Oncology franchise centered on XTANDI ® and the Urology OAB franchise including Vesicare ® and Betanis ® / Myrbetriq ® / BETMIGA ® with new launches across various countries and a growth in franchise sales globally.
