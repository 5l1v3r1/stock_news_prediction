It is not about the UK versus continental Europe, it is about the UK against the U.S. and the big financial centres.” (Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by Sinead Cruise)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T15:30:12.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
