But at least then, Patricof said, people were engaging in the outside world.\n\"Walmart was more a physical presence. It was not online,\" he said. \"Now, I mean, we're talking about an online presence where people press buttons and don't go places.\"\nPatricof's portfolio at Greylock includes several e-commerce start-ups that could be considered competitors with parts of Amazon's business. Though he told CNBC his criticism comes from a place of \"social concern.\" \nAmazon and its dominance in e-commerce have come under heightened scrutiny in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump continues to take on the tech company and its billionaire CEO and Washington Post-owner Jeff Bezos. \n\"I'd hate to agree with our president. I haven't been exactly supportive of him, but I think that he's not wrong in saying ... we should be looking at it and seeing what the implication it's having for the country overall,\" Patricof said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:43:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
