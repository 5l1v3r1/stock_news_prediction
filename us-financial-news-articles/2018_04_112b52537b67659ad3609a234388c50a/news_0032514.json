If we can get a little break on Sunday against Burnley, we’re certainly in with a fight.” Slideshow (8 Images) CONFIDENT MOOD \nAfter West Ham’s crucial home win over Southampton and a well-earned point at Chelsea, David Moyes’ side were in confident mood and could have broken the deadlock after 55 minutes when former Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic directed a powerful header past Butland but was given offside. \nThe Hammers were denied a goal once again after 67 minutes when Edimilson Fernandes struck a powerful shot that flew past Butland but his effort was also ruled out, with Arnautovic standing right in front of the unsighted Stoke keeper. \nStoke opened the scoring after a moment to forget for World Cup hopeful Hart in front of watching England manager Gareth Southgate as he failed to hold a shot from Xherdan Shaqiri and Crouch was in the right place to convert from close-range. \nBut West Ham refused to lie down and Carroll, missing for the last 13 games through injury, showed his quality when Cresswell delivered a perfect ball into his path and the former Liverpool forward fired an unstoppable volley past Butland. \nWest Ham were again denied by the linesman’s flag moments later when Javier Hernandez struck the ball past Butland, but Carroll was adjudged to have handled inside the area. \n“I tried to bring the ball down and it hits my hand a little bit,” said Carroll. “If it’s a shove in the back, it’s a penalty, but we played on and he (referee Michael Oliver) didn’t give it and, in the end, it’s a point, so we’ll take it.” Reporting by Marc Isaacs; editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T02:29:28.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
