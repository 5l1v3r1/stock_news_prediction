Most exchanges do not send users a 1099 tax form and tax filing websites like TurboTax and H&R Block don’t ask if you sold cryptocurrency in the previous year. It is up to individuals to stay proactive and inform themselves of new tax laws.\nIf the IRS catches you not paying taxes, common fees include a “substantial understatement” penalty and “negligence or disregard of the rules” penalty, which are an additional 20 percent of the net understatement of tax. And if the IRS thinks you knowingly and intentionally did not pay your tax, it will charge you an additional 75 percent for committing fraud.\nIn previous years, fewer than 900 people reported capital gains on Bitcoin to the IRS from 2013 to 2015. It is likely that many believed they could avoid paying taxes because of the perception that their trades would not be traceable. For example, AlphaBay, the successor to the illicit online market “Silk Road,” was still recommending using Bitcoin as a privacy coin in 2016.\nBut the assumption that Bitcoin is anonymous or untraceable is unfounded. The FBI was able to trace $13.4 million in Bitcoin from the Silk Road to its apparently anonymous founder, Ross Ulbricht, by tracing public transactions on the blockchain – and that was back in 2014. The next year, the IRS partnered with Chainanalysis , a company that makes blockchain-focused compliance and investigation software, to identify suspicious activity among owners of digital wallets.\nNow that you’ve decided to file your cryptocurrency taxes , how do you do it?\nIn the US, cryptocurrencies are treated by the IRS as property , similar to stocks. This means that you must pay capital gains on your investments that you have sold and basic income tax if mining or earning cryptocurrency for work.\nGetCryptoTax.com\nOur recommendation is to use GetCryptoTax.com because it is cheap, user-friendly, and safe.\nFounded in 2018, GetCryptoTax aims to be the market leader in crypto tax preparation software by focusing on customer value and quality of user experience. The company was formed by crypto trading expert Ian Hafkenschiel when he realized that the rising prominence of cryptocurrency creates the need for tools to help traders stay compliant.\nThe website provides illustrated, click-by-click tutorials to help you to easily extract your trade data from exchanges.

With the tax deadline upon us, head over to GetCryptoTax.com before it is too late.\nDisclaimer: This is not intended to be tax or legal advice.
