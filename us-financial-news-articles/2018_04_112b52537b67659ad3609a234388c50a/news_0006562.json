Initiating safeguards will work against any redirection that could create injury in the EU.” \nOn March 26, the EU launched a study of whether tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump would lead to Asian producers flooding Europe with steel. \nBrussels-based European Aluminium, which represents more than 80 members including producers and manufacturers of aluminium products, declined to comment on the impact of U.S. sanctions announced on Friday on Rusal ( 0486.HK ), one of the world’s biggest aluminium producers. \n“We cannot comment on the impacts of the sanctions on Russia,” it said. “We will continue to monitor markets in the meantime.” Reporting by Eric Onstad; editing by Andrew Roche", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T19:53:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
