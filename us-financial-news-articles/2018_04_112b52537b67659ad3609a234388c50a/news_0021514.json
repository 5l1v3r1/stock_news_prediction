A dissolution of the board would likely shake up management and remove current Chairman Abilio Diniz, a retail magnate who took the reins five years ago and owns nearly 4 percent of the company. \nDiniz was behind the proposal of the alternative list, according to a person familiar of the matter. \nRepresentatives for Diniz did not immediately comment on his relationship with the alternative board line-up. \nThe company is the subject of a probe into whether its executives bribed inspectors to evade food safety checks. \nThe investigation, which led to a ban of BRF chicken exports to the European Union, forced the company to place thousands of workers on paid leave as it trimmed output. \nBRF shares, which are down almost 39 percent this year, rose 5 percent on Wednesday, the most in a month. $1 = 3.38 reais Reporting by Ana Mano; editing by Leslie Adler, Amrutha Gayathri and Steve Orlofsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T05:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T05:30:35.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
