I get to go out for one of my only stress-free rounds that I’ve ever played at Augusta National,” said the 2015 champion, who also finished second in 2014 and 2016. \nBut with 22 of the past 27 winners coming from the final Sunday pairing, the odds are that either American Reed or second-placed Briton Rory McIlroy, three off the lead, will slip on the Green Jacket in Butler Cabin. \nSpieth seemed to acknowledge as much. \n“Patrick, I think he’s come in here with the mentality that he’s fully capable of winning here, and he’s proving what he is capable of doing here,” the American added. “It’s going to be a pretty cool showdown with Rory tomorrow.” (Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T04:37:32.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
