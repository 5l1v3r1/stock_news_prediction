It also included a personal tour of a major museum by Xi.\nChinese state media has praised the tone of the trip.\nThe overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a front page commentary on Saturday \"two great countries ought to have great cooperation,\" and showed a large picture of the two leaders shaking hands.\n\"There is reason to believe that this Wuhan meeting will increase mutual trust, manage and control disputes, deepen cooperation and lead to a new phase in China-India relations,\" it said.\n\"It is quite clear that strategic agreement between the two countries far exceeds the specific differences, and the need for cooperation far exceeds local friction,\" it said.\nThe official China Daily said in an editorial there was no denying mutual suspicion was keeping the two countries from working together.\n\"Yet neither Beijing nor New Delhi calls the other an enemy, which means both expect bilateral ties to improve. Indeed, China and India are natural partners,\" it said.\nDespite the upbeat statements, which on Friday included Modi inviting Xi to India for a similar informal summit next year, the nations' differences are significant.\nAs well as disputes over stretches of a 3,500 km (2,200 miles) border, they are bumping up against each other in the Indian Ocean and squabbling over Xi's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nIndia signaled as recently as Tuesday its opposition to the grand trade and transport plan because one of its branches runs through Pakistani-administered Kashmir, which India claims.\nIndia has long been suspicious of China's traditionally close ties with Pakistan.\nFor its part, China has been concerned about U.S. efforts to draw India into a maritime \"quad\" of democracies, including Japan and Australia.\nChina is also suspicious of India's hosting of the Dalai Lama and other exiled Tibetans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T11:46:01.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
