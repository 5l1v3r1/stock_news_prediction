Malcolm Subban had 21 saves to improve to 12-3-2 this season.\nPatrick Berglund, Brayden Schenn and Chris Thorburn scored for St. Louis (43-28-6, 92) which had a season-long six-game win streak snapped. Allen finished with 22 saves for the Blues who fell into a tie with Colorado for the second wild-card spot in the Western Conference, though they have a game at hand.\nBerglund, off a nice feed from Steen, gave St. Louis a 1-0 lead just 2:54 into the game when he fired a shot from the slot past Subban’s glove side for his 13th goal of the season and fifth in the last nine games.\nVegas rebounded to take a 2-1 lead later in the period when Karlsson scored his 41st of the season on a short-handed breakaway after a long outlet pass from Cody Eakin. Marchessault gave the Golden Knights the lead seven minutes later when, parked at the right side of the net, he slapped in a wide shot by Alex Tuch past Allen’s blocker, extending his point streak to seven games, tying his career-high.\nSchenn tied it when he took a pass from Jaden Schwartz at the dot in the right circle and beat Subban with a wrist shot that went under his glove for his 26th goal of the season.\nNeal scored his first goal since Feb. 8, his 25th, when he roofed a crossing pass from Erik Haula from the right side of the net to give Vegas a 3-2 lead after two periods.\nThorburn then took advantage of a defensive breakdown by the Golden Knights to tie it at the 6:14 mark of the third period, cutting to the net all alone, taking a pass from Scottie Upshall from behind the net and firing a shot through Subban’s pads for his first goal since Dec. 11, 2016 against Edmonton.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:30:10.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
