Hot dogs and beer are off-limits under the especially strict Passover regulations .\nBallpark matzos “We had just one matzo to share among the seven of us,” said Julian Horowitz, the musical director of the Maccabeats, the a cappella group from Yeshiva University that came to Marlins Park here to perform this week. The young men spent hours at the ballpark for the game and show but had forgotten to pack kosher for Passover food.\nPassover commemorates the exodus of Hebrews from Egypt and forbids observant Jews from eating leavened bread—and other items with yeast such as beer. Many American Jews this week are also celebrating Passover’s twin holiday: the start of baseball season, another harbinger of renewal and hope for a more secular but no less fervent kind of believer.\nNearly half of Major League stadiums have special concession stands that serve kosher offerings for most of the season, but the items don’t pass muster during Passover. Ballparks are lenient about allowing in outside food—meaning the observant can pack matzo sandwiches or Seder dinner leftovers—but alcohol is strictly limited to what vendors are selling.\nSome of the kosher for Passover food at the Marlins’ Passover at the Park event this week.

Rubin/The Wall Street Journal Before a Mets game that Rabbi Eliezer Zalmanov of Munster, Ind., attended with relatives in 2016, he poured kosher for Passover wine into seltzer bottles, wrapped them in towels and stashed them at the bottom of a backpack. The ploy got the goods past security guards, allowing the Zalmanovs to toast a Mets win over the Cincinnati Reds with religiously certified libations.\n“We were just there to enjoy stress-free baseball,” he said. “And some contraband kosher wine.”\nZachary Silver, who lives just a few blocks from Wrigley Field in Chicago’s Lakeview neighborhood, said during Passover he likes to bring Seder leftovers of brisket, horseradish and charoset—an apple and nut chutney that symbolizes the mortar used by Hebrew slaves in Ancient Egyptian construction projects.\nHe said he gets fewer glances from fans than during regular-season games, when he brings his own freshly grilled kosher hot dogs from home, skipping the concession stands. He said he likes his own better. They are the “ ‘Where did you get that?’ kind of looks,” said Mr. Silver, a teacher and administrator at a Jewish high school.\nConcession stands that serve kosher food during the regular season become unkosher this week, when utensils or other items that have ever come in contact with leavened products aren’t allowed. Kosher ballpark vendors usually opt to close during the eight-day holiday rather than undertake the amount of work necessary to make stands kosher for Passover.\nThe Maccabeats a cappella group from Yeshiva University sang the National Anthem at Marlins Park on Tuesday.

This year, opening day fell the night before Passover began, leaving the popular kosher stand at Camden Yards in Baltimore to operate for just one game before shutting down for the week, according to stadium general manager Michael Geczi. Passover ends this year on Saturday night.\nEven during the regular season, keeping concessions kosher is a challenge. During a game last year, the rabbi overseeing the Baltimore operation thought he saw something nonkosher unintentionally touch the grill. He closed the stand and spent the next hour “kashering” the grill on maximum heat to burn off any contagion.\n“It was during the game, and the entire stand looked like it was going up in flames,” Mr. Geczi said. “Other than that it was business as usual.”\nMarlins Park in Miami is an exception to the Passover famine. Since 2015, the Marlins have teamed up with Miami Chabad, an Orthodox group, to host “Passover at the Park,” a pregame festival that this year featured the Yeshiva University singing group. It had a catered spread that included bunless hot dogs, turkey legs and chicken wings.\n“It’s the only place you can see the Maccabeats and the Marlins,” said David Dalva, who came to the Tuesday game with his wife, his mother and his two children after seeing a flier at his synagogue in Boca Raton.\nThe Dalva family at the Passover at the Park event.

Rubin/The Wall Street Journal Aaron Wallenstein, a visitor from New York, enjoyed the event, but had a bone to pick. “The food is pretty good, but it’s pricey,” he grumbled—although the Passover hot dog and a dog from the regular concession stand were both $6.\n“It’s better than cream cheese on matzo,” Liz Wallenstein, Aaron’s sister, replied. His sister-in-law Lauren Wallenstein, attending the game along with several family members, said they wouldn’t even be here if not for the food.\nManischewitz, the kosher food and beverage conglomerate, started sponsoring the Miami event this year, which attracted 3,000 people out of the total game attendance of 15,000.\nTake a Look at Other Recent A-Heds\nWhat’s a Tough Call in Bird Watching? Identifying a Gull Will Office Affairs Ever Be the Same? Not in Romance Novels Sloths Hot, Armadillos Not: Zoos Seek Affection for Overlooked Species In an interview after he threw out the first pitch, Manischewitz Chief Executive David Sugarman said he was eager to expand Passover offerings at various ballparks, using creative promotions. “We should be giving out gefilte fish to the first 10,000 fans,” he said.\nOf all American sports, baseball is by far the most intertwined with American Jewish identity. There have been dozens of Jewish Major Leaguers, including Hall of Famers Sandy Koufax and Hank Greenberg. In cities that settled large populations of Jewish immigrants during the first half of the 20th century, the local baseball team was a fruitful avenue for Jews to express their love of American culture.\n“I totally associate the Brooklyn Dodgers with the Jewish community of Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s,” said Jon Daniels, the general manager of the Texas Rangers. He and his brother Ryan, a rabbi, co-wrote the foreword to “The Baseball Haggadah,” a themed version of the book used by Jews during the Seder to tell the Exodus story.\nThere’s even a picture book, “Matzah Ball,” that walks kosher children through the experience of bringing Passover food to the ballpark while friends get peanuts and Cracker Jack. Turns out non-Jews like matzo and macaroons too, according to the author, and the Prophet Elijah might even help the pious catch a home run hit by Orioles legend Cal Ripken Jr.\nNearly a century ago, teams were already using food as a way to attract their growing Jewish fan base. New York Giants manager John McGraw signed Jewish second baseman Andy Cohen in 1926, and vendors at the Giants’ Polo Grounds stadium sold “Ice Cream Cohens” to entice Jewish fans to come to games.\nMost observant Jews readily admit they would love to ditch their matzo for a hot dog bun as soon as they can.\n“You don’t want to be the one guy in a section of thousands of people eating a piece of cardboard,” said Cubs fan Adam David Miller.\nWrite to Gabriel T.
