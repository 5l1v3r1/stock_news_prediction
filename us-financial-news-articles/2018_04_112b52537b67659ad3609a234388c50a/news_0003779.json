So were at least three of their six adopted children, police said. \nThe bodies of three of the children were not recovered as of early Monday, but officials said they believed all the children were in the vehicle, along with their parents. \nOfficials searched the family’s Woodland, Wa., home, but found no suicide note, media reported. \nThe Washington State Department of Social and Health Services said it was investigating the family for potential child neglect or abuse. \nA spokeswoman said the department attempted to make contact with the family on March 23, but their was noone at their home in Woodland, Washington, about 27 miles (43 kms) north of Portland. Child welfare authorities failed to contact the family on two subsequent visits in March. \n“We had no prior history with the family,” said spokeswoman Norah West.
