But even a larger conglomerate might be jealous of the company’s track record: Every minute, Longchamp sells 11 of its foldable nylon Le Pliage totes, according to reported analyst estimates. Over 30 million have been sold to date. Beyoncé, Karlie Kloss and even German Chancellor Angela Merkel are fans, while creatives from artist Tracey Emin to designer Jeremy Scott have left their mark on the classic piece via capsule collections and collaborations.\n“I call it the T-shirt of bags,” says Cassegrain, 53, of the expandable creation, which comes in 12 colors and typically runs from $125 for a small rendition to $640 for a large leather version. The bag was invented by Cassegrain’s father, Philippe, who was inspired by the origami he encountered during his travels in Japan, and it has helped catapult the brand to a reported $1.5 billion valuation. The house, which Cassegrain says offers “everyday luxury,” reportedly generated $642.5 million in sales in 2016 alone. Recent spokesmodels have included Kate Moss and Alexa Chung , while Freja Beha Erichsen is the brand’s current face.\nAs Longchamp celebrates its 70th anniversary this spring, it also inaugurates a new Manhattan flagship, opening at 645 Fifth Avenue in May. The 4,000-square-foot space will be the company’s largest U.S. store, featuring a shimmering facade of shifting metallic panels created by French lighting firm Exception. A store opening in Beverly Hills, California, this fall will mark another move on Longchamp’s global chessboard—there are currently over 300 Longchamp stores worldwide, including recently debuted flagships in Moscow, Tokyo and Shanghai. \nIt all began in 1948, when Cassegrain’s grandfather, also named Jean, transformed what was a small tobacco shop into an accessories company, selling leather-encased pipes to fans like Elvis. Now, along with Le Pliage, the brand offers a wide array of products, ranging from wallets to this spring’s suede safari jackets. The women’s ready-to-wear line, introduced in 2006, is designed by Cassegrain’s sister, Sophie Delafontaine, 50, who is Longchamp’s artistic director. \n“There aren’t many brands like us,” adds Cassegrain. “It’s my father, my brother, my sister, myself—all of us working together.” His brother, Olivier Cassegrain, 48, is vice president/managing director of retail in the U.S., and Philippe, 81, is now chairman of the company. (Cassegrain’s mother, Michèle, was in charge of the European stores until her death in 2016.) \n“Maybe we were a little bit shy, and now we feel more confident,” says Delafontaine of the New York store, which will include a station where Le Pliage fans can customize their choices. “For a French house to be present on Fifth Avenue, it’s a great symbol, so we are very proud.” longchamp.com .\nMore from WSJ.
