The rest would be held on behalf of management and staff. \nThe fourth step of the company’s break-up plan will take place six months later and see Old Mutual Limited separate out its stake in South African lender Nedbank, by distributing 32 percent of Nedbank’s stock to Old Mutual Limited shareholders. \nAfter that, Old Mutual Limited will retain a minority stake of 19.9 percent in Nedbank, it said. \nOld Mutual is aiming for “material completion” of the break-up by the end of 2018. Hemphill stands to receive a bonus of up to 1,000 percent if it completes on schedule. \nThe Old Mutual break-up comes as other insurers and asset managers such as Prudential and Standard Life Aberdeen are also changing their structures to become more competitive. \nThe plan also follows an agreement by Old Mutual to sell part of its asset management arm, Old Mutual Global Investors, to private equity firm TA Associates and management for 600 million pounds. \nBernstein analysts valued Old Mutual Wealth at 2.8 billion pounds excluding Old Mutual Global Investors.
