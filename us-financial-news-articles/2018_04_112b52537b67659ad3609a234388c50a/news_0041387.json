Given the positive momentum across our businesses and an improved outlook, we are raising our 2018 guidance,” concluded Mr. Jellison.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company now expects full year Adjusted DEPS of $11.08 - $11.32, compared to previous guidance of $10.88 - $11.20.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects Adjusted DEPS of $2.65 - $2.71.\nThe Company’s guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures.\nConference Call to be Held at 8:30 AM (ET) Today\nA conference call to discuss these results has been scheduled for 8:30 AM ET on Friday, April 20, 2018.
