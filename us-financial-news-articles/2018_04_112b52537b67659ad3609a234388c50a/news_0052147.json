If the sale stalls, it could weaken his image and hurt his chances of getting re-elected. Critics already accuse Mr. Modi of promising too much last election and underdelivering.\nRepresentatives from the civil aviation and finance ministries didn’t respond to requests for comments.\nPrevious governments have attempted to sell Air India, but strong resistance from workers’ unions and political parties blocked those attempts.\nThe global Star Alliance member’s operating fleet of 115 aircraft, 2,500 international and 3,700 domestic slots, aircraft repair workshops and real estate in cities from Mumbai to New York and London make it attractive for those wanting to expand their global presence.\nBut analysts and industry officials say the restrictions on any buyer are daunting. The current government plan requires the new owner to assume about 60% of Air India’s roughly $8.2 billion of debt and face restrictions such as not fire staff for a year. The company has nearly 27,000 permanent and contractual employees.\nThe investor won’t be able to sell the stake for at least three years, and it can’t merge Air India’s operations with any existing business as long as the government holds the remaining 24% stake.\nBesides the 76% stake in Air India, the deal also would include selling all of the company’s low-cost arm Air India Express and its 50% stake in the baggage-handling and airport-services joint venture with Singapore’s SATS Ltd. The offer requires the investor to bid for the combined stakes in the three companies and not separately.\nThe government is hoping the tight conditions will attract genuine buyers who have the capability to turnaround Air India, helping shield against any potential criticism that it allowed the national brand to fade away. A turnaround for Air India would also allow the government to sell the remaining 24% stake at higher valuations later and heal its weak fiscal health.\nMr. Martin said a deal this size would require the buyer to invest an estimated $7 billion initially to buy the airline and then another $10 billion over the next several years to turn it around, something he said very few companies would be able to manage.\nAlthough foreign airlines could still bid, they are allowed to do so only in partnership with a domestic entity and hold no more than 49% in the airline, leaving them without management control.\nAnalysts believe the government may have to reduce the debt burden on potential buyers if it wants the deal to go through. Buyers also would want the freedom to restructure the company, analysts say.\nSaj Ahmad, a London-based analyst at StrategicAero Research, said the decision to sell such a large stake so quickly is causing suspicion over the deal and scaring away investors.\n“The way the government is handling the selloff, it is making them wary,” he said.\nAir India may have to be sold off in smaller pieces to reduce the risk for buyers taking on huge debt and the legacy troubles of a large unionized workforce and bureaucratic culture, according to analysts.\nAir India has a nearly 26% share of the international market when considering only Indian carriers. It also has a 12% share of the Indian market where traffic is surging as rising incomes allow more Indians to fly and the government’s efforts to improve connectivity to smaller towns make travel more affordable.\nHowever, increased competition and rising oil prices have pushed most Indian airlines into losses. Air India has been in the red for several years and has been surviving on a government bailout package announced in 2012. The government has injected about $4 billion in the airline since then.\nGrowing political opposition, including from within Mr. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, and protests from the airline’s strong trade unions could also deter investors.\n“We will do whatever it takes to make sure the privatization doesn’t happen,” said J.B. Kadian, a union leader.\nWrite to Anant Vijay Kala at anant.kala@wsj.com and Rajesh Roy at rajesh.roy@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:37:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
