REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo The downward revision shows the difficult task the European Central Bank (ECB) faces in bringing inflation to its target of close to but below 2.0 percent.\nPrices rose by 1.3 percent in March, compared to the same period last year, down from Eurostatâ€™s previous estimate of 1.4 percent. Compared to the previous month, prices were up 1.0 percent.\nUnprocessed food prices, previously seen expanding by 0.9 percent, rose by 0.8 percent in March. Services and energy prices contributed most to the annual rise, but energy prices fell in March compared to February.\nWithout energy and unprocessed food prices, the two most volatile components, prices rose 1.3 percent on the month and year-on-year, a slight increase from the previous annual rates.\nThe ECB defines this as its core inflation metric.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Alastair Macdonald\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T22:00:51.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
