REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian \nBernardo Grobocopatel, who is known as the “Soy Bean King” in Carlos Casares, a small city 186 miles west (300 km) of the capital Buenos Aires, made his fortune in agriculture but that wasn’t enough for the ambitious football fanatic. \n“We were doing well economically but I felt there was something missing in my life and that was doing what I felt passionate about,” Grobocopatel told Reuters, explaining why he started Club Agropecuario Argentino. \n“We started from zero, literally from nothing. No players, no pitch, no buildings at all,” he said of the $20 million investment that included a brand new stadium for 20,000 people, half the population of the surrounding city.
