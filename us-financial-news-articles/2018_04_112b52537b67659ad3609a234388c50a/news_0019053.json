(the “Company”) (NYSE American:LODE), a Nevada-based, land-based, gold and silver mining company, announced today the election of Walter A. “Del” Marting, 71, to its Board of Directors and the retirement of Daniel W. Kappes, after 6 years of service, from its Board of Directors. Mr. Kappes will remain involved with the Company as a member of its recently established Mining Advisory Committee, to assist in all aspects of technical mining and mine development, along with Mr. Leo Drozdoff and Mr. Robert Reseigh.\nCorrado De Gasperis, Executive Chairman of the Board said, “Dan’s leadership, fortitude and guidance steered us through some of our most difficult developments as a producer and as a company. His technical and strategic expertise is second to none, but for me, his mentorship, passion and focus on the strategy and success of the Comstock, its importance and its legacy, was most valuable to our Company and me as a professional. I am honored to have such a sincere and intellectually honest mentor, willing to give the straight, hard advice, and we are blessed to retain his continued experience, along with Bob and Leo’s on our advisory committee.”\nThe Company welcomes Mr. Marting to the Board, with an extensive resume in, among other areas, mining, mine development, strategic and operational finance. Mr. Marting started his mining career with Amax Inc., a worldwide producer of molybdenum that eventually became part of Freeport-McMoRan, the largest molybdenum producer in the world, with increasing responsibilities including supervising production from Amax’s largest underground and open pit molybdenum mines, worldwide strategic planning for all of Amax’s new molybdenum properties, including exploration, and ultimately Vice President of Administration for Amax Europe, where he centralized all of Amax’s finance and treasury for Europe and consolidated and managed all of their metal trading for molybdenum, tungsten, copper, coal and iron ore into one European center. He was also the Chairman and CEO of Lucky Chance Mining Co., a Nevada-based miner that successfully reopened and restarted production at the famed 16-1 Mine in Allegheny, CA, that he took public. Mr. Marting has held financial and investment banking roles serving a variety of industries and is most recently the Founder and Managing Partner of CereCare, LLC and CoreSource Recovery Services, LLC, providing breakthrough rehabilitation treatment for patients suffering from brain and related substance abuse disorders—most commonly alcoholism and opioid addictions. Mr. Marting graduated from Yale University in 1969, with a BA in English and holds an MBA from Harvard Business School. Mr. Marting is also a Navy veteran, including service as a member of the US Navy SEAL Team Two.\nMr. De Gasperis added, “We are honored to welcome Del Marting to the Comstock as we expand and accelerate our strategic initiatives. His intimate knowledge of northern Nevada industries, and his strategic planning, finance, capital markets, and corporate governance expertise are especially valuable as we embark on developing and commercializing new technologies and businesses.”\nAbout Comstock Mining Inc.\nComstock Mining Inc. is a Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company with extensive, contiguous property in the Comstock District and is an emerging leader in sustainable, responsible mining.
