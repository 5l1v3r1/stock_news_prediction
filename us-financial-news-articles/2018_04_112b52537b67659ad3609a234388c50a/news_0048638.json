Uber is the ride-hailing leader in Mexico, where it has seven million users in more than three dozen cities.\nReuters was first to report Didi's plan in Toluca, the capital city of the state of Mexico, earlier this month.\nDidi, which has an operations hub in the Juarez neighborhood in Mexico City, said it hopes to bring its ride-hailing service to other major Mexican cities later this year.\nDidi said teams in Mexico, Beijing and California studied the Mexican market to adapt Didi's algorithms and other ride-service technologies for the local market, addressing issues such as crime.\nDidi is bringing to Mexico a number of new safety features, including an emergency alert system that will connect drivers and passengers with police and other emergency contacts if they find themselves in danger, a safety monitoring system and a way for passengers to share their ride itinerary.\nThe company started recruiting drivers in early April, promising not to take any piece of their fares until June 17. After mid-June, Didi plans will take a 20 percent cut, below the 25 percent commission by Uber, Reuters previously reported.\n(Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco.
