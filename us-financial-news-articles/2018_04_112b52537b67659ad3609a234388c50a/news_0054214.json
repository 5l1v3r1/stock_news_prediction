The Orioles (6-18) have lost four straight and 10 of 11.\nThe Orioles carried a 3-1 lead into the fifth, but Alex Cobb, making his third start for Baltimore after seven seasons with Tampa Bay, allowed six of the eight batters he faced to reach base. Adeiny Hechavarria and Denard Span opened the inning with singles before racing home on C.J. Cron’s game-tying double.\nCron advanced to third on Carlos Gomez’s flyout and trotted home on Miller’s fly ball to center. Daniel Robertson then doubled and scored on Joey Wendle’s single before Wilson Ramos coaxed a walk to end Cobb’s night.\nChance Sisco homered in the bottom of the inning to pull the Orioles within a run, but the Rays put the game away via Hechavarria’s homer in the sixth and RBI hits by Wendle (single) and Ramos (double) in the seventh.\nMiller also had a run-scoring groundout in the first for the Rays. Wendle finished with three hits while Span, Robertson and Hechavarria had two hits apiece.\nAndrew Kittredge (1-2) earned his first big league win by recording the final two outs of the fifth inning. Rays starter Jake Faria allowed four runs on four hits and three walks while striking out five over 4 1/3 innings.\nTampa Bay reliever Jonny Venters, making his first major league appearance since Oct. 3, 2012, retired the only batter he faced in the sixth inning. Venters underwent three Tommy John surgeries in between big league pitches.\nBaltimore’s Adam Jones laced an RBI double in the first inning, and newly acquired Jace Peterson delivered a two-run double in the second.\nCobb (0-3) gave up five runs on 10 hits and one walk while striking out none over 4 2/3 innings. He has a 13.11 ERA for the Orioles and has allowed 33 baserunners in just 11 2/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:08:08.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
