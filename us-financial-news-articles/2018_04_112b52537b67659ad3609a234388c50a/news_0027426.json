His modus operandi seems to do anything that seems to be good for his re-election. If protectionism doesn’t work, he may switch to international trade,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holdings.\n“Markets are still not yet convinced yet if the U.S. is really re-joining the TPP. But if it does, it’s very positive for the global economy and stock markets will like it,” he added.\nThe improved sentiment drove up U.S. bond yields. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to 2.843 percent, its highest level since March 27.\nIn the currency market, the dollar rose to 107.27 yen , edging near a five-week high of 107.49 touched on Apr. 5.\nThe yen has become litmus test for risk sentiment, sought when investors turn risk averse because Japan’s hefty current surplus gives protection to any capital outflows deficit-running countries are vulnerable to.\nThe euro eased to $1.2327, though on the week it has kept gains of 0.4 percent.\nThe Hong Kong dollar stood at 7.8498 to the dollar, near the lower end of its 7.75-7.85 trading band, a day after Hong Kong’s de facto central bank intervened to support the currency for the first time since 2015.\nThe Singapore dollar gained slightly after Singapore’s central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years as expected.\nOil prices remained close to highs last reached in late 2014 on tensions in the oil-rich Middle East and shrinking global oil inventories.\nBrent crude futures traded at $71.90 a barrel, a tad below Thursday close but not far from Wednesday’s high of $73.09. U.S. WTI crude futures stood at $66.87.\nElsewhere, bitcoin fetched $7,968.5 after 14.2 percent gains on Thursday, its biggest gain in four months.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T10:44:13.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
