They noted U.S.-Europe 10-yr yield spread was now the widest since fall of Berlin Wall in 1989.\nBreaking down the weekly flow numbers which run from Wednesday to Wednesday showed the dive for safety.\nInvestment Grade bond fund inflows were the best in 11 weeks at $4.4 billion, more risky high yield bonds in contrast saw $2.4 billion of outflows and emerging market debt saw $700 million go out, which was the largest in 10 weeks.\nEM stocks did though see their 10th straight week of inflows at $1.7 billion while Europe saw a seventh week of outflows and Japan equity funds extended what were record outflows the previous week.
