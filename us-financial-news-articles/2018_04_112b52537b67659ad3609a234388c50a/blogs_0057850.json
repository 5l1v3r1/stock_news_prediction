From there, they narrowed it down to the Sacramento-area grandfather using DNA obtained from material he'd discarded, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert said.\nAuthorities declined to name the online site. However, two of the largest, Ancestry.com and 23andMe, said Thursday that they weren't involved in the case.\nDNA potentially may have played an earlier role in the case. It was just coming into use as a criminal investigative tool in 1986 when the predator variously known as the East Area Rapist and the Golden State Killer apparently ended his decade-long wave of attacks.\nDeAngelo, a former police officer, probably would have known about the new method, experts said.\n\"He knew police techniques,\" said John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Louis Schlesinger. \"He was smart.\"\nNo one who knew DeAngelo over the decades connected him with the string of at least a dozen murders, 50 rapes and dozens of burglaries from 1976 to 1986 throughout the state.\nAfter he was identified as the suspect, however, prosecutors rushed to charge him with eight killings.\nIn addition, police in the central California farming town of Visalia said Thursday that DeAngelo is a suspect in a 13th killing and about 100 burglaries in the area.\nIn 1975, of community college teacher Claude Snelling was shot while trying to stop a masked intruder from kidnapping his 16-year-old daughter from his home.\nInvestigators lacked DNA evidence so Snelling's death and the burglaries weren't included in the tally of Golden State Killer crimes but fingerprints and shoe tracks will be reviewed for matches to DeAngelo, Visalia Police Chief Jason Salazar said.\nInvestigators searched DeAngelo's home on Thursday, looking for class rings, earrings, dishes and other items that were taken from crime scenes as well as weapons.\nMeanwhile, DeAngelo's neighbors, relatives and former acquaintances all say they had no inkling that he could be a serial killer. He worked nearly three decades in a Sacramento-area supermarket warehouse as a truck mechanic, retiring last year. As a neighbor, he was known for taking meticulous care of his lawn in suburban Citrus Heights.\nDeAngelo worked as a police officer in the farming town of Exeter, not far from Visalia, from 1973 to 1976.\nDeAngelo was a \"black sheep\" who didn't joke around with other officers, said Farrel Ward, 75, who served on the force with DeAngelo.\nWard said it's possible that DeAngelo helped with the search for Snelling's killer and the elusive burglar but he doesn't recall DeAngelo directly investigating the killing.\n\"I've been thinking, but there's no indication whatsoever that anything was wrong,\" Ward said. \"How could you just go out and kill somebody and go back and go to work? I don't understand that.\"\nLater, DeAngelo joined the Auburn Police Department outside of Sacramento but was fired in 1979 after he was caught shoplifting a hammer and dog repellant.\nInvestigators say they have linked DeAngelo to 11 killings that occurred after he was fired.\nJames Huddle said he always hoped police would catch the killer whose attacks prompted him to buy a pistol.\nBut he was stunned to find out the man arrested was DeAngelo, his former brother-in-law.\nHuddle said it was \"still just going crazy in my mind.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:58:23.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
