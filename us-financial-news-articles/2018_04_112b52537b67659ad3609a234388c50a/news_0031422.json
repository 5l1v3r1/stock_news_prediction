Analysts on average had expected an 1.5 percent rise, according to research firm FactSet. \nIn comparison with the big gain in Europe overall, organic revenue rose just 3.1 percent in the United Kingdom and fell 0.1 percent in North America. \nOmnicom, said total revenue rose 1.2 percent to $3.63 billion in the first quarter. \nThe company, whose clients include Apple ( AAPL.O ), McDonald’s Corp ( MCD.N ) and Adidas ( ADSGn.DE ), said net income attributable to the company rose to $264.1 million, or $1.14 per share, from $241.8 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. \nAnalysts’ on average estimated a profit of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
