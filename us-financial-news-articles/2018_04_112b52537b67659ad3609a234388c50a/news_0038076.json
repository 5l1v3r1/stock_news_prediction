Fico remains leader of the ruling Smer, giving him a behind-the-scenes position of informal power similar to that Law and Justice Party chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski holds in Poland. \nThis has led some protesters to fear that the government reshuffle was not a sufficient change and demanded the departure of Gaspar as well, saying the police were ineffective in prosecuting corruption. \nSome of Kuciak’s reporting dealt with deals between the government and Slovakia’s biggest privately-owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar. The police chief has denied any wrongdoing. \nGaspar’s earlier reluctance to quit on his own forced Interior Minister Tomas Drucker to announce his resignation on Monday, after three weeks into the job. Drucker said he did not have grounds to fire Gaspar and could not square that with the public pressure.
