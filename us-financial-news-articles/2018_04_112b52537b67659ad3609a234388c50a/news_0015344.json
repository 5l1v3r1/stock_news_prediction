These longer-tailed trends carry negative margin mix and potential distribution losses for Hershey.\" \nStrycula lowered his price target to $90 from $106 for Hershey, representing 9 percent downside to Monday's close. \nThe company's shares are down 3.5 percent Tuesday after the report. Its stock declined 12.5 percent so far this year through Monday versus the S&P 500's 2 percent drop. \nUBS' survey of consumers points to \"flat to negative\" chocolate sales growth for 2018 and 2019, according to the analyst. Strycula said U.S. chocolate sales constitute 74 percent of the company's revenue. He noted that cocoa and cocoa butter prices are up 30 percent year-to-date and represent 15 percent to 20 percent of Hershey's costs. \n\"Our data analysis highlights increased US promotional activity in chocolate as vendors compete for distribution in a decelerating consumption category,\" he wrote. \nHershey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:05:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
