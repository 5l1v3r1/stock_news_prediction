Snap’s 2016 launch of its first hardware product, Spectacles, was accompanied with a gutsy marketing bet: consumers could get their hands on smart glasses only via snazzy vending machines. But Snap misjudged demand and had to take a charge of the thousands of Spectacles gathering dust in warehouses. On Thursday, Snap announced an updated version of Spectacles , which are designed to be easier to use. Crucially, as The Wall Street Journal reports, a “more measured” marketing plan is in place this time around. Gone are the vending machines and Spectacles promotions will focus more on what the glasses can do rather than their fashion appeal. Another Evan Spiegel Vogue shoot isn’t looking likely any time soon, then…\n‘Cuz You’re Amazon Just the Way You Are Some analysts had expected Amazon to record a modest profit in its first quarter, following a blowout holiday period. Quite the opposite: Amazon topped $1 billion in profit for the second straight quarter and posted its best revenue growth in more than six years. Amazon attributed some of that profit performance to its thriving advertising business. The company’s “other revenue,” where advertising sits, grew a whopping 139% to $2.03 billion. On the call, Amazon’s chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky described its high-margin advertising unit as a “multi-billion dollar program” and said the main goal of Amazon’s advertising products is to help its customers discover new brands and products. Not a lot of news in that, although Mr. Olsavsky hinted, “there may be opportunities over time to have more advertising in our video, but we choose not to do that right now.”\n—Football’s Coming Home—\nTime out, time out: Also on Thursday, the NFL and Amazon announced they have renewed their “Thursday Night Football” streaming deal for the 2018-19 season. As you’ll remember, last year’s telecasts also included TV-like ads that were packaged with other inventory across Amazon’s platform. The Wall Street Journal’s Joe Flint writes this deal has a 30% premium on the last one, according to a source . This time around, the games will be offered on its Prime streaming service,and be available for free for Twitch users, which presumably will increase the size of the audience. On the call, Amazon’s director of investor relations, Dave Fildes, said the company is “still learning” when it comes to the live format.\nThe Pepsi Generation We heard earlier this week that Coca-Cola’s decision to relaunch Diet Coke in the U.S., complete with a major marketing push, returned the brand to its first quarter of volume growth since 2010. Rival PepsiCo likes the sound of that. The snacks and beverage giant said Thursday it’s planning an advertising blitz for its cola brands in the U.S. to turnaround sluggish sales. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said Pepsi’s recent “Pepsi Generations” campaign, a nod at the brand’s history, increased recall and connectivity to the brand, but converting that to sales will take time. PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi noted it has a competitor “who is on air all the time,” so as well as stepping up media spend, the company is “maniacally focused on the quality of the message.” At first, Pepsi will see whether the ads resonate with its traditional baby-boomer audience and then it’ll look to recruit younger drinkers. This summer, she said, expect to see more ads for Pepsi Zero Sugar and Diet Pepsi.\nHis Parliament’s On Fire and His Hands Are Up If you thought Mark Zuckerberg’s testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this month was theater, Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer’s grilling in front of British lawmakers in parliament on Thursday was blockbuster viewing. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee pulled no punches in their well-researched questioning of Facebook’s tech chief over the company’s handling of user data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica controversy. MPs referred to Facebook as a “morality-free zone, a “vampire squid” and told it “your company is the problem.” Oof. What did we learn? I’m breaking out the bullet points again:\nFacebook did not read all of the terms and conditions of the app, created by Cambridge University research Aleksandr Kogan, that improperly shared user data with Cambridge Analytica. Mr. Schroepfer also said it was “a mistake not to inform people at the time” it discovered that data was improperly shared. In written evidence to the committee, Facebook said it had discovered some “ billing and administration connections ” between Cambridge Analytica and Canadian data company Aggregate IQ. Both firms deny a link between each other. Facebook said Aggregate IQ spent $2 million on ads associated with the U.K.’s 2016 referendum. Mr. Schroepfer pushed back at the suggestion that shortcomings in its approach to political ads were driven by its revenue ambitions: “Political advertising is a very small, low single-digit percentage of our overall advertising .” The committee still isn’t satisfied. In a statement after the hearing, committee chair, Damian Collins, said Mr. Schroepfer failed to answer “on nearly 40 separate points” and the committee is requesting again for Mr. Zuckerberg to make the trip to Westminster to give evidence.\nPay the Man WPP published its annual report Friday morning . As expected, former Chief Executive Martin Sorrell’s pay package took a sharp haircut. He received a total of £13.9 million ($19.1 million) in 2017, down from the £48.1 million he received a year earlier. As we’ve previously reported , this year’s pay packet was the first time Mr. Sorrell was compensated under a five-year long-term incentive program that began in 2013 when WPP’s board put a cap on his pay in response to investor anger over executive salaries. As for life at WPP after Mr. Sorrell, WPP Chairman Roberto Quarta writes in the letter to shareholders that the company is considering both internal and external candidates for the chief executive role, but warns “there is no set timeframe” for an appointment. Mark Read and Andrew Scott, recently appointed as joint chief operating officers after Mr. Sorrell’s departure, “have been given a mandate to move forward decisively, to accelerate the strategy, and to apply their own views, abilities and expertise in doing so,” Mr. Quarta writes.\nBest of the rest A look at why Netflix and Amazon are experimenting with short-form programming.
