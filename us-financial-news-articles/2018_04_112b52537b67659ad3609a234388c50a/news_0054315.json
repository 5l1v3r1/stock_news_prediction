The statement did not say how much IDBI recovered from the borrowers.\nIn 2014, according to the CBI, IDBI is accused of giving a loan of $83 million to the company based in the British Virgin Islands, Axcel Sunshine Ltd, which was used to pay off loans of associate companies from the same group, violating Indian regulatory guidelines.\nThe CBI also says IDBI gave the unnamed Finnish company a loan equivalent to 52 million euros ($63 million) in 2010. The firm was showing stress, and in 2013 it was granted voluntary bankruptcy by a Finnish court.\nIDBI said in the statement late on Thursday it had given a loan to Axcel Sunshine Ltd in February 2014, which became a non-performing asset in December 2015.\n“The loan has been fully provided for,” IDBI said. “The bank has initiated recovery actions to recover dues from the borrower in August 2016.”\nReuters was unable to contact Axcel Sunshine as no website could be found for the company.\nIndia’s Finance Ministry asked all banks to step up vigilance following a $2 billion fraud in February at Punjab National Bank ( PNBK.NS ), the country’s second-biggest state-run lender.
