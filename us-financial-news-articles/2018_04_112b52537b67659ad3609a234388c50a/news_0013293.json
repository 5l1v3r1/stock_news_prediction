(OTCQB: GOPH) (\"Gopher\"), a technology company which specializes in the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled mobile technologies, effective April 2, 2018 acquired certain assets from Electronic Check Services Inc. (“ECS”) and from Central State Legal Inc. (“CSL”).\nThe acquisition centers around a proprietary software that:\nValidates written check authenticity in real-time; Scores risk associated with the acceptance of a check; and Generates automated response and follow up when a check is returned unpaid.\nBy using this system, less than 2% of 50,000+/- checks processed monthly have been returned unpaid. Utilizing the automated follow up, 70% of that 2% fraction of checks were collected within the first 90 days.\nCSL was developed to work with merchants and ECS to recover funds from returned checks. CSL also acts as a second layer in the “bad check” recovery process. ECS attempts recovery during the first 90 days following the return. After 90 days, CSL takes over the recovery process. CSL has been able to recover funds on approximately 55% of all returned checks within 90 days of taking over the delinquent account.\nThese assets acquisition is a complementary assets acquired from ECS Prepaid LLC - https://backend.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/sec-filings/12638360/content/html The core asset of ECS is its processing software program, which Gopher intends to combine into the prior acquisition of the UGO HUB and the UGO brand of products.\nECS PrePaid’s core operating system currently operates over 9,000 terminals in retail locations throughout the United States. These terminals process over 14,000 transactions a day and have capacity to manage at least three times its current volume, without further software expense. This platform generated approximately $32 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 (unaudited), approximately $4.2 million for the month of January 2018 (unaudited) and approximately $4.3 for the month of February 2018 (unaudited).\n“We believe these acquisitions will uniquely position Gopher to establish our mesh network and connect with consumers. This integration of technologies, may establish a platform that can provide solutions that aren’t currently available from a single provider. I still need some additional tools under my belt to present a comprehensive proprietary product, but we continue to strive toward this goal” stated Gopher CEO Greg Bauer.\nAbout ECS Prepaid LLC.\nFormed in 2008, ECS Prepaid LLC. ( www.ecsprepaid.com ) was started and fueled by the desire to create a Prepaid Wireless distribution model built to cater to Independent Sales Organizations servicing the gas station, convenience store market.
