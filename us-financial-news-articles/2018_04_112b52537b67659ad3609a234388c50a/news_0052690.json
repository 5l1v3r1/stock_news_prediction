Almost three-quarters of 80,000 foundations that gave their age were started in the last 25 years, the report said.\n“We indeed live in a ‘global age of philanthropy’,” it said.\n“If this trajectory continues, philanthropy will be poised to have an increasingly significant social and economic impact.”\nMany wealthy people were driven by a sense of moral obligation, as well as a fear that “when inequality becomes too acute it may threaten peace, stability, and the free enterprise system that created such wealth”, it said.\nEducation was the main funding focus globally, followed by social welfare, health, arts and culture and reducing poverty.\n“Education is seen as both a way to provide for individual opportunity - to bring individuals out of poverty - and at the same time as an engine for national growth,” Johnson said.\nResearchers were unable to get data from a large number of countries. About 95 percent of foundations surveyed were in Europe and the United States, where governments use tax incentives to encourage philanthropy.\nReporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.
