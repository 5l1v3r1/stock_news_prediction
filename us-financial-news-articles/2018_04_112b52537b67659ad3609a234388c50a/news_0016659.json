Farmers were getting lower returns from winter-sown crops due to lower-than normal monsoon rains, Nambiath said. \nLocal gold prices jumped to their highest in 16-months in March following the gains in the overseas market and as the rupee weakened. \nIndia imported 103.7 tonnes of gold in March 2017. Gold imports in the January to March quarter fell 32 percent from a year ago to 163.1 tonnes, data compiled by GFMS showed. \nImports would improve in April as inventories with jewellers have been depleted due to lower imports in three straight months, said a Mumbai-based head of the gold trading desk with a private bullion importing bank. \n“Due to the wedding season and Akshay Trititya demand would be higher in April,” the dealer said. \nThis month Indians will celebrate the annual festival of Akshaya Tritiya, when buying gold is considered auspicious. \nGold is an essential part of a bride’s dowry in India and also a popular gift from family and guests at weddings. \n“Demand will improve if prices remain stable at the current level. Many price sensitive consumers have postponed purchases,” said a Mumbai-based gold dealer.
