If not, then I guess there’s probably other options,” he added.\n“Obviously the win helps but if we were finishing sixth every race this year, then that’s not the most attractive option to me.”\nUntil Sunday, Ricciardo had endured a difficult start to the season.\nFourth in his home Australian Grand Prix after a grid penalty, he retired in Bahrain on the second lap with an electrical problem.\nIn China, he qualified only sixth after a pre-qualifying engine switch.\nWhile Mercedes have yet to win this season, they are still top of the constructors’ standings and have won both championships for the last four years.\nThe symbolism of Sunday’s podium was not lost on spectators, with Ricciardo standing next to the men whose seats he could take — second placed Mercedes driver Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen.\nPressed on Tuesday on where he wanted to be, Ricciardo jokingly swerved: “I just want to go to the moon.\n“I’ve been asked so many contract questions so I’m trying to find other ways to answer them.”\nRed Bull team boss Christian Horner on Sunday questioned why Ricciardo would want to be anywhere else if the team could give him a winning car.\nFerrari’s Sebastian Vettel, the four times champion team mate Ricciardo beat at Red Bull in 2014, won the first two races and has started the last two on pole.\nAsked whether, on Sunday’s evidence, Red Bull had a car that could challenge for the championship, Ricciardo reserved judgment.\n“I think it’s still too early to say yes,” he said. “We won at the weekend but we need to win regularly to kind of show that.\n“If we come out and win again in two weeks in Baku then I’ll probably say yes.”\nAzerbaijan, a race Ricciardo won last year after chaotic scenes, is next up on April 29.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T19:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T20:32:45.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
