General Motors and Switch became the first participants in a new company program to help large businesses use more renewable energy sources. Both companies are now matching 100 percent of their electric use at key locations in Michigan with wind power from Consumers Energy. Consumers Energy filed its five-year electric distribution plan with the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). Consumers Energy submitted its proposal to the MPSC to pass savings from federal tax reform by reducing energy bills to customers, which is expected to lower bills by up to 4 percent.\nLooking forward, the company is developing its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) for submission to the MPSC in June. The IRP includes input from several stakeholders and will reflect our long-range plan to ensure Michigan continues to be powered by safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy. Our commitment to our communities and to the people who work for us will guide us as we continue on our IRP and Clean Energy Goal journeys.\nCMS Energy (NYSE: CMS) is a Michigan-based company that has an electric and natural gas utility, Consumers Energy, as its primary business. It also owns and operates independent power generation businesses.\nCMS Energy will hold a webcast to discuss its 2018 first quarter results and provide a business and financial outlook on April 26 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT). To participate in the webcast, go to CMS Energy's homepage ( cmsenergy.com ) and select \"Investor Meeting.\"\nImportant information for investors about non-GAAP measures and other disclosures.\n*This news release contains non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures, such as adjusted earnings. Adjustments could include items such as discontinued operations, asset sales, impairments, restructuring costs, regulatory items from prior years, or other items detailed in the attached summary financial statements. Management views adjusted earnings as a key measure of the company's present operating financial performance and uses adjusted earnings for external communications with analysts and investors. Internally, the company uses adjusted earnings to measure and assess performance. Because the company is not able to estimate the impact of specific line items, which have the potential to significantly impact, favorably or unfavorably, the company's reported earnings in future periods, the company is not providing reported earnings guidance nor is it providing a reconciliation for the comparable future period earnings. The adjusted earnings should be considered supplemental information to assist in understanding our business results, rather than as a substitute for the reported earnings. All references to earnings per share are on a diluted basis.\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements.\" The forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's results to differ materially. All forward-looking statements should be considered in the context of the risk and other factors detailed from time to time in CMS Energy's and Consumers Energy's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nInvestors and others should note that CMS Energy routinely posts important information on its website and considers the Investor Relations section, www.cmsenergy.com/investor-relations , a channel of distribution.\nFor more information on CMS Energy, please visit our website at cmsenergy.com .
