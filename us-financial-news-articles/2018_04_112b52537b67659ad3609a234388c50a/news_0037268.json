SURPRISED AND DISAPPOINTED \nThe existing contract to make British passports is worth 400 million pounds and the new contract starts in October 2019, after Britain leaves the EU in March that year. \nDe La Rue’s Chief Executive Martin Sutherland told BBC radio that he remained “surprised and disappointed”, but he had taken a pragmatic business decision not to appeal. \nUnderlying operating profit for the year to end-March would be in the low to mid 60s million pound range, the company said. \nAnalysts at Investec, who were predicting 71 million pounds, said it was a “disappointing outcome”. \nRevenue for the year had increased by about 6 percent, with growth across all product lines, De La Rue said, although it added it was “cautious” about its current financial year. \nIt said it would assist with the transition to the new supplier, and was expecting no impact on its performance in the next 18 months. \nTrade union Unite said news that De La Rue was abandoning its appeal would come as a bitter blow to workers in Gateshead, north east England, who now faced an uncertain future. \n“Workers will feel let down that the company is not prepared to fight the government’s decision to ship the production of the new blue passport overseas,” Unite national officer Louisa Bull said. $1 = 0.7037 pounds Additional reporting by Alistair Smout, Editing by Guy Faulconbridge, Alexander Smith and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T10:11:04.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
