Everyone bought in. It’s a group of guys who wants to win.”\nWashington advances to play the Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round. The Capitals have lost nine of the 10 times they have taken on the Penguins in the playoffs, including the last seven.\nOvechkin’s milestone goal was a tiebreaker, giving the Caps the lead for good at 2-1 with 7:10 left in the second period. He scored on a backhander, putting away the rebound of a shot from Brooks Orpik (two assists).\nOvechkin stretched it to 3-1 on a power-play goal with 1:37 remaining in the middle period on a one-timer off a John Carlson pass.\nOvechkin finished the series with five goals, and Carlson ended up with eight assists. Jay Beagle added two assists Monday.\nWashington goalie Braden Holtby started for the fourth straight game after Philipp Grubauer got the nod in the first two. Holtby has been strong since then, and he made 35 saves in the clincher.\nBlue Jackets coach John Tortorella said of the Capitals, “They were pretty stingy. I give Washington credit for, through the series, how well they defended. We thought we might be able to get something going against them. They defended hard.”\nThe Capitals scored first for the fifth time in the series thanks to a bullet from Dmitry Orlov. He took a pass from Matt Niskanen, skated between the circles and fired a high shot past goalie Sergei Bobrovsky with 7:48 left in the first period.\nColumbus killed off overlapping penalties in the second period and tied the game shortly thereafter when Nick Foligno fired a shot from the right side past Holtby at 8:40.\nOvechkin then put the Caps in front with his two second-period goals.\nPierre-Luc Dubois cut the lead to one for Columbus early in the third period before Smith-Pelly and Chandler Stephenson (one goal, one assist) scored 94 seconds apart for a 5-2 Washington lead with 14:30 left in the game.\nFoligno added a second goal later in the period before Lars Eller gave the Caps an empty-netter in the final minute as Washington notched three in the third.\n“It stings. I’m not really sure what to say right now,” Foligno said. “I’m still dissecting everything. It was a good series. I think we learned a lot about ourselves. This is a team we have in here that’s a hell of a team. We had a real good opportunity being up 2-0 and didn’t make the most of it.”\nCapitals coach Barry Trotz said, “The Columbus Blue Jackets ... (it’s) a real resilient, good young team that they have. The future is bright here. They have some great pieces, so it was a war out there. It was a really strong series by them. They forced us to the limit for sure.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:18:18.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
