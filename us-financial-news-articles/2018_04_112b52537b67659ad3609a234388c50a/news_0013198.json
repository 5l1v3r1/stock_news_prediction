REUTERS/Paul Childs \nIn front of festive crowd at Carrara Stadium, the 28-year-old qualified fastest with a time of 10.06 seconds to raise his hopes of a maiden gold medal at the quadrennial Games in Monday’s final. \nBlake hopes to claim the title as a stepping stone to restoring Jamaica’s primacy in the event following last year’s retirement of Usain Bolt. He said the sprint great, his former training partner, had texted him best wishes in the morning. \n“This morning he messaged me and said ‘I believe in you,’” the 28-year-old told reporters at the twilight meeting. \n“Yeah, just keep it basic, don’t think too much into it, just look all ahead and get the job done.

I feel good, 10.06, I am feeling comfortable, anything is possible.” \nKemar Hyman of the Cayman Islands also showed himself in decent shape, qualifying second fastest for Monday’s final with a time of 10.11 seconds ahead of England’s Adam Gemili, a world championships relay gold medalist last year. \nTrinidad and Tobago’s Michelle-Lee Ahye, favorite to win the women’s 100, qualified third fastest (11.25) for the final behind England’s Asha Philip (11.21) and Jamaican Christania Williams (11.22). \nRising Ugandan talent Joshua Cheptegei, the world silver medalist in the 10,000 meters last year, grabbed the 5,000 gold in a time of 13:50.83, burning away from Canada’s silver-medal-winner Mohammed Ahmed in the final lap. \nKenya’s Edward Zakayo took the bronze but Toka Badboy, the 19-year-old runner from Lesotho, was disqualified. \nGlasgow silver medalist Nick Miller smashed the Games record and England’s national mark with a throw of 80.26 meters to capture gold in the hammer ahead of Australian Matty Denny and Scot Mark Dry, who won bronze.
