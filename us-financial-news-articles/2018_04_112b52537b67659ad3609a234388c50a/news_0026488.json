( bit.ly/2HyYbp9 ) \nAnalysts had estimated earnings of $2.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. \nIncome tax expense was down 8.6 percent at $2.56 billion as the U.S. corporate tax rate fell. \nNet interest income rose 9 percent to $13.5 billion, driven by higher interest rates and increased lending. \n“2018 is off to a good start with our businesses performing well across the board, driving strong top-line growth and building on the momentum from last year,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon   \nNet revenue rose 10.3 percent to $28.52 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $27.68 billion. \nMany of JPMorgan’s business lines have delivered higher profits in the past year as the economy grows, capital markets flourish and higher interest rates lift lending revenue more than the bank’s cost of money. \nReturn on tangible common equity, a performance measure, was 19 percent, compared with 13 percent a year earlier. JPMorgan in February raised its return target for three years out to 17 percent, largely because of lower tax rates.
