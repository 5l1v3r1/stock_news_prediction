It warned that people caught trading at other rates would face arrest.\nAnalysts say the new policy means the central bank may have to spend huge sums from its foreign reserves to satisfy demand for dollars at an artificially strong rial rate, or alternatively, starve the country of hard currency.\nIn his remarks on Monday, Seif did not say how the central bank would satisfy hard currency demand or manage the rial in the event of sharp fluctuations in the global value of the dollar.\nAs part of the government’s new policy, it clamped a 10,000-euro ($12,300) ceiling on the amount of foreign currency that citizens can hold outside banks.\nMost private money changers in Tehran have not bought or sold dollars or other foreign currencies for days as they wait to see how the government will manage the rial and how authorities will regulate the money changing industry, witnesses told Reuters.
