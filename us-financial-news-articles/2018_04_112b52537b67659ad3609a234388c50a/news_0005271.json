The slowdown was due in large part to weaker consumer demand caused by higher inflation after June 2016’s Brexit vote.\nA PMI published earlier on Tuesday showed growth in euro zone manufacturers slid to an eight-month low in March, although they continued to outpace their British peers.\n“The latest PMI survey provided further evidence that UK manufacturing has entered a softer growth phase so far this year,” said Rob Dobson, director at data company IHS Markit.\n“Although the pace of output expansion ticked higher in March, which is especially encouraging given the heavy snowfall during the month, this was offset by slower increases in new orders and employment.”\nThe PMI’s new business index hit a nine-month low in March, marked by a tailing off in growth in export orders — possibly reflecting sterling’s recent rally.\nThe pound has gained more than 4 percent against the U.S. dollar since the end of 2017.\nA Confederation of British Industry survey last month also suggested growth in manufacturing moderated recently.\nTuesday’s PMI showed growth in cost pressures for factories and their selling prices cooled in March, something that may reassure Bank of England officials who are keeping an eye on inflation pressures.\nMost economists polled by Reuters think the central bank is likely to raise interest rates to a new post-financial crisis high of 0.75 percent in May.\n“With cost inflationary pressures also moderating to provide some respite for margins, the sector looks set to make further slow and steady progress as we head through the spring,” Dobson said.\nPMIs covering the construction and services sectors are due on Wednesday and Thursday.\n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from IHS Markit and customers need to apply for a licence.\nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: here\nFor further information, please phone IHS Markit on +800 6275 4800 or email economics@ihsmarkit.com (Reporting by Andy Bruce, editing by Catherine Evans)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.ihsmarkit.com/about/contact-us.html", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:41:18.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
