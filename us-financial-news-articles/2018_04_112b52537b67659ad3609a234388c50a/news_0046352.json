North Korea also has its own system of speakers along the border between the two countries, which tends to play reports critical of its neighbor and their allies. It is not yet known whether Pyongyang will also silence its loudspeakers.\n'Maybe things will work out, maybe they won't' Meanwhile, North and South Korea are ironing out the final details for a summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-In on Friday.\nAhead of the scheduled inter-Korean meeting, Pyongyang said it would halt all nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site. The announcement marked a remarkable turnaround in tensions after geopolitical uncertainty had been ratcheted up to unprecedented levels when the North carried out its largest-ever nuclear test last year.\nThe North's move to stop missile and nuclear tests was initially welcomed by President Donald Trump , before the U.S. premier then adopted a more guarded stance Sunday.\n\"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won't â€” only time will tell,\" he said via Twitter.\nTweet 1\nA successful summit between the Koreas could then help pave the way for a meeting between Kim and Trump. They are poised to hold talks in late May or June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:00:30.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
