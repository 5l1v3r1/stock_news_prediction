But he added that he feared an unintended impact would be to make the financial system \"less resilient\" and crises \"likelier and more severe.\"\nLobbyists and other regulatory sources say efforts to ease such rules, in particular the so-called Volcker Rule banning banks from taking risky bets with their own money, have been slowed by the long time it has taken to install new leadership at the FDIC.\nMcWilliams was approved as the next FDIC chair by the Senate Banking Committee in February, replacing Martin Gruenberg, and is still awaiting approval by the full Senate.\n(Reporting by Katanga Johnson; Editing by Michelle Price and Rosalba O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T21:35:32.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
