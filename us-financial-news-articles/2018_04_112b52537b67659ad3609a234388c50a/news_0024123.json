Rights activists say thousands of rapes go unreported because of the stigma.\nAdityanath on Thursday asked the CBI, the equivalent to the FBI in the United States, to take over the Unnao case, police said.\n“We have collected crucial evidence and handed over all the details to the CBI to further investigate the case,” said O.P. Singh, the most senior police officer in Uttar Pradesh.\nThe rape victim told reporters at her residence that Sengar should be arrested to prevent him from influencing the investigation.\nUp until now, police had refused to investigate the victim’s accusations, she said. In a bizarre sequence of events, the victim’s father died in police custody this week, fanning suspicion that Sengar was somehow involved.\nThe victim’s father had been beaten before being taken into custody following a complaint by his assailants. Police officer Singh said they have launched an investigation into accusations that Sengar played a role in the assault.\nPolice have suspended several officers in Unnao during the past few days pending investigations into their conduct, another senior police official said.\nReporting by Rupam Jain and Simon Cameron-Moore; Writing by Simon Cameron-Moore; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:56:06.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
