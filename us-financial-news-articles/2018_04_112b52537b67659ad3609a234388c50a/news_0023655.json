REUTERS/Alvin Baez The funding for the U.S. territory was the largest grant in the history of the HUD, said HUD undersecretary Pamela Patenaude.\nBut the award was significantly less than the $46 billion requested by Governor Ricardo Rossello in November.\nHUD is awarding a total of roughly $28 billion to nine states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico that have been recently affected by major disasters, including Hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria, as well as the recent California wildfires.\nThe funds are part of a $90 billion disaster aid package signed by Trump in February. The Virgin Islands is set to receive $1.6 billion in HUD disaster recovery funds, a department media advisory said on Tuesday.\nResidents stand near a house with a plastic sheet replacing the roof hit by Hurricane Maria in September, in a neighbourhood in Canovanas, Puerto Rico April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez Rossello said at a news conference that he expected to adjust Puerto Rico’s fiscal turnaround plan to reflect the full grant. The most recent version of the plan pegged at $13 billion the amount of funds from HUD that the commonwealth expected to receive.\nPuerto Rico is navigating the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history, and the plan is meant to establish economic projections that will serve as a basis for forthcoming restructuring talks with creditors owed $120 billion in bond and pension debt.\nRossello and Patenaude made the announcement in Villa Hugo, a shantytown in Canovanas, which sustained severe damage when Maria hit the island on Sept. 20.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Villa Hugo’s 6,000 residents are squatters on government land. Most built their homes informally, and do not own title to their properties.\n“Informal” construction - which can also refer to property owners who illegally subdivide their land - is thought to comprise between one-fourth and one-half of Puerto Rico’s 1.2 million homes.\nThe prevalence of informal housing, which often does not comply with building codes, was thought to compound damage to Puerto Rico’s housing stock when the storm hit.\nThe HUD funds can be used for housing, economic development and infrastructure, and could be used to help repair the island’s crippled power grid. While local authorities determine where funds will be used, HUD provides technical assistance and guidelines, Patenaude said.\nMaria was a vicious blow to an already struggling island that has been in recession for more than a decade, with a poverty rate near 50 percent.\nPuerto Rico now projects to receive roughly $50 billion during the next six years in federal disaster relief assistance, mostly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to the government’s latest fiscal turnaround plan.\nAdditional reporting by Nick Brown in New York; Editing by Daniel Bases and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T01:51:22.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
