Origin completed its sale of Lattice Energy gas assets to Beach Energy in January, a move that helped cut its debt.\nProduction for the quarter rose 10 percent to 62.7 petajoules equivalent (PJe), from a year earlier.\nAPLNG is a joint venture between Origin, ConocoPhillips and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (Sinopec).\nEarlier this year, the company said its half-year underlying profit more than tripled on the back of soaring energy prices, leading it to upgrade its earnings forecast for energy markets.\n$1 = 1.3203 Australian dollars Reporting by Chris Thomas in Bengaluru; Editing by Richard Pullin and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:21:22.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
