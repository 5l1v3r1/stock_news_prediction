Gertler has denied all allegations of impropriety and has said his investments in Congo have created thousands of jobs.\nGertler’s Ventora Development Sasu is seeking $695 million in unpaid and future royalties from Glencore’s subsidiary Mutanda Mining and $2.28 billion from Glencore subsidiary Kamoto Copper Co (KCC).\nGlencore said the orders would allow local authorities to freeze certain bank accounts, mining titles and assets.\n“Glencore denies that Mutanda and KCC are in breach of any of their obligations ... and also entirely rejects Ventora’s calculation of the value of the future royalties allegedly owed to Ventora,” the statement said.\nA spokesman for Gertler’s Fleurette Group, previously Glencore’s partner in the mines, declined to comment.\nA source familiar with the situation said Glencore is looking to file an appeal early next week.\nGlencore also disputes the choice of jurisdiction for the orders and said that the agreement between its subsidiaries and Ventora are subject to English law.\nA freezing order could affect mining operations, Glencore said.\nThe legal action is the latest headache for Glencore’s Congo operations. Its partner on the Kamoto project, Congo state miner Gecamines, said this week that it was starting legal proceedings to dissolve Kamoto because of persistent high debts.\nReporting by Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala in London and Aaron Ross in Dakar Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:51:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
