He estimates self-driving vehicles can produce 40 terabytes of data in an hour for example. Today's self-driving vehicles transmit about 500 times the amount of data as a typical smartphone contract.\n\"How will Tesla manage such a large quantity of data?\" Jonas said. \"In our opinion, leveraging the broadband network provided by its very own sister company seems like a plausible answer.\"\nTesla declined to comment on the note.\nIn turn, Tesla could be the a \"captive customer\" for SpaceX, which is already developing a broadband network using satellites.\nWhether or not Tesla will be able to achieve full-self driving technology is still an open question. However, it is already equipping every car it makes with hardware CEO Elon Musk says is sufficient for full autonomy, and Musk has said cars will eventually be capable of fully self-driving through software upgrades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T21:14:20.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
