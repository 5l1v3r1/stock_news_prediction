Police say he was responsible for at least 12 homicides and 45 rapes across the state between 1976 and 1986.\nInvestigators used DNA from one of those crime scenes and compared it with genetic profiles on online genealogy sites, according to the Sacramento County district attorney’s office. In these searches, investigators found a relative of the suspect, according to a spokesman for the office. They then looked at online family trees to narrow down the suspect, he said.\nThe Sacramento Bee first reported the account.\nA spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office confirmed the account, but declined to elaborate.\nIn recent days, as the investigation pointed toward Mr. DeAngelo, officers conducted surveillance of Mr. DeAngelo and collected “discarded DNA” that matched the killer’s, Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said Wednesday. Sheriff Jones declined to elaborate on the nature of the discarded DNA but said it confirmed investigators’ suspicions about Mr. DeAngelo.\nPolice regularly use DNA to help solve crimes, often comparing samples from crime scenes with law-enforcement databases. But using genealogy websites, which allow customers to submit DNA samples and find relatives, has been more rare.\nIt is unclear exactly how investigators used the online genealogy sites. A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office declined to say whether it used publicly available data or used a search warrant to gain access.\nThe most popular of these sites, 23andMe Inc. and Ancestry , said they weren’t involved in the investigation.\n“23andMe was not involved in this case,” a spokesman for the company said. “Broadly speaking, it’s our policy to resist law-enforcement inquiries to protect customer privacy. 23andMe has never given customer information to law-enforcement officials.”\n23andMe is only available to customers and “does not support the comparison of genetic data processed by any third party to genetic profiles within our database,” the spokesman said.\nAn Ancestry spokeswoman said the company has “not been in contact with law enforcement regarding the Joseph James DeAngelo case,” adding that the company “will not share any information with law enforcement unless compelled to by valid legal process.”\nMr. DeAngelo is in custody and it is unclear whether he has an attorney. A spokesman for the Sacramento County public defender’s office said it hadn’t been assigned to the case as of Thursday afternoon.\nWrite to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:15:33.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
