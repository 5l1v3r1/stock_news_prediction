They traded last at A$0.455 a share, valuing the company at about A$229 million.\nThe transaction is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of the year.\nThe new company, which will be listed on the Australian and Singapore exchanges, is set to become Australia’s first new lithium exporter since 2016, when it ships out its first lithium concentrate later this month, Tawana said in a statement.\nThe new entity has offtake agreements in place with Burwill Commodity Ltd, a joint venture partner of China’s Jiangte Special Electric Motor Co\nIt has also reached an offtake agreement for its tantalum with Germany’s HC Starck Group.\nAlliance shares closed at S$0.34 on Wednesday.
