We are now testing it in more than 15 solid cancers,” de Winkel said, adding that this could open up new markets worth several billion dollars. \nAn important trigger this year will be the outcome of a study where Darzalex is being tested as first-line treatment in combination with Celgene Corp’s Revlimid. \n“That is going to cause turbo acceleration of the income, because that is 56 percent of the market in the biggest territory and that will have a massive impact on sales from 2019,” de Winkel said, adding that a U.S. approval could come early next year. \nGenmab expects sales of Darzalex in the range of $2-2.3 billion in 2018.
