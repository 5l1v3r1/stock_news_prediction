(Nasdaq:ARGS), an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies based on the Arcelis® precision immunotherapy technology platform, today reported interim results from its randomized, active controlled, open-label, multi-center Phase 3 ADAPT trial of Rocapuldencel-T in combination with sunitinib/standard-of-care for the treatment of newly diagnosed metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Based on these results, the Company has decided to discontinue the trial.\nAs previously reported, a total of 462 patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma were enrolled in the ADAPT trial and randomized 2:1 between combination treatment with Rocapuldencel-T and sunitinib (combination arm) vs. sunitinib monotherapy (control arm) after undergoing cytoreductive nephrectomy. The Company recently submitted a protocol amendment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration providing for four co-primary endpoints focused on various measures of survival. Based upon review of the interim data, the Company does not believe that it would achieve these endpoints if the trial were to be continued. After consulting with the principal investigators of the trial, the Company has therefore decided to discontinue the trial and has informed the FDA of its decision.\nThe most recent interim analysis was conducted after 51 new events (deaths) had occurred since the time of the February 2017 interim analysis. Median overall survival for the intent-to-treat patient population, one of the four co-primary endpoints, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The estimated median overall survival for the combination arm was 28.2 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 23.4, 35.2) compared to 31.2 months (95% CI: 23.0, 44.5) for the control arm. The hazard ratio was 1.10 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.42). The two other co-primary endpoints that were evaluated at this time, including overall survival for the patients who remained alive at the time of the February 2017 interim analysis and overall survival for all patients for whom at least 12 months of follow-up was available, also did not demonstrate a favorable result. A fourth endpoint, five-year survival, was not evaluated because there was insufficient data at this time to perform this analysis.\nBased on a review of the status of its internal programs, resources and capabilities, Argos plans to explore a wide range of strategic alternatives that may include a potential merger or sale of the Company, among other potential alternatives that could maximize both near and long-term value for our shareholders. The Company has retained Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated to serve as its financial advisor in the process.\nArgos does not have a defined timeline for the exploration of strategic alternatives and is not confirming that the process will result in any strategic alternative being announced or consummated. Argos does not intend to discuss or disclose further developments during this process unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific action or otherwise determined that further disclosure is appropriate.\nArgos also today reported that it does not expect to regain compliance with The Nasdaq Capital Market continued listing requirements by the April 24, 2018 deadline. As a result, Argos expects that its common stock will be delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and that trading in the Company’s common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market will be suspended effective at the open of business on April 23, 2018. The Company has filed an application to transfer trading and quotation of its common stock to the OTCQB® Venture Market, operated by OTC Markets Group Inc., under its current trading symbol “ARGS,” effective as of April 23, 2018. Quotation and trading information for the common stock will be available on www.otcmarkets.com .\nAbout Argos Therapeutics\nArgos Therapeutics is an immuno-oncology company focused on the development and commercialization of individualized immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases using its Arcelis® technology platform.
