Galston’s “ The National Debt Is Worse Than You Think ” (Politics & Ideas, April 18): Our economy will benefit by expanding the legal immigration of skilled trade workers and technology workers to alleviate labor shortages in construction and innovative technologies that provide steady growth. Our low population-growth rate, similar to other advanced economies, won’t be adequate to fill the gap in demand. Demand for skilled workers among all advanced economies is bound to increase to meet economic growth rates that support public services.\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images Both parties must recognize their primary responsibility to maintain economic growth that promotes genuine fiscal improvement. Distracting voters with divisive social issues isn’t going to solve economic problems.\nRohit Desai\nPrinceton Junction, N.J.\nMr. Galston states: “Absent big changes in the labor force, advocates of 3% growth are left hoping for a productivity miracle.” My comment is: A miracle isn’t necessary. All that is needed is a change in the Congressional Budget Office’s assumption about the makeup of the U.S. labor force. For example, today’s U.S. labor force has to be more knowledge and technology based then previously. This means that the U.S. workforce can remain on the job doing useful work well past the current typical retirement-benefit age of 65. That fact, enhanced as necessary with tech-savvy immigrants, can dramatically change the CBO’s estimate about the growth of our labor force.\nAccordingly, its estimate of economic growth could easily be much higher. It would be interesting to see a parametric CBO estimate depicting the effect of average retirement age being, let’s say, 67, 70, etc., and the corresponding number of younger tech-savvy immigrants needed for U.S. economic growth to reach the administration’s target of 3% a year. The CBO might have performed such analyses to estimate what is needed to reach the administration’s goal.\nEllery Block\nWesterville, Ohio", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T09:27:44.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
