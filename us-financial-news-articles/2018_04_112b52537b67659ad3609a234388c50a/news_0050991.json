Wembley itself is also familiar to Florida-based businessman Khan — who is currently valued at over $7.2 billion dollars — as his Jacksonville Jaguars team have played regular season games at the venue on five occasions.\nThe 90,000 capacity stadium was reopened back in 2007, after the old structure was completely demolished, and is one of the most expensive ever built, reportedly costing £798 million.\nKhan's motivation for the bid appears to be an attempt to cement London as a base for his Jacksonville NFL side, as ties with the capital continue to grow throughout the organization. \"If my ownership interests were to include Wembley Stadium, it would protect the Jaguars' position in London at a time when other NFL teams are understandably becoming more interested in this great city,\" he said.\nThis soccer season has seen Tottenham Hotspur playing its games at Wembley, while construction is completed on its own stadium in northeast London. Tottenham's new White Hart Lane ground will provide further evidence of London's importance to the NFL, as it is also set to include a retractable American football pitch, ahead of the start of a 10-year deal to host at least two NFL games a season.\nReportedly, Khan intends to pay more than £500 million Wembley Stadium itself, and a further £300 million to allow the FA to keep the Club Wembley debenture and hospitality business.\nEarlier this year, the English Football Association revealed that it would officially finish repaying the sizeable loan needed to build Wembley by 2024. Since its reopening, the FA has supplemented the cost by hosting other sporting events and music concerts, before Khan's offer came in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T17:51:43.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
