The temperature was 32 degrees at first pitch, the coldest start time at home in franchise history. It was 34 degrees at game time Saturday.\nCleveland (4-5) broke a 23-inning scoreless streak by tying the game at 1 without a hit in the eighth inning. Bradley Zimmer drew a walk off reliever Tim Hill to open the inning. Zimmer stole second and was sacrificed to third before Jason Kipnis reached on a throwing error by pitcher Justin Grimm to put runners on first and third.\nJose Ramirez hit a check-swing grounder to Grimm enabling Zimmer score. Cleveland had only four hits and has the worst batting average in the majors, .159.\nCody Allen (1-0) pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for the victory.\nKansas City took a 1-0 lead when Alex Gordon singled with one out in the fifth inning and was forced at second by Cam Gallagher before Jon Jay tripled to deep center for a 1-0 lead.\nRight fielder Jorge Soler had three hits for the Royals, breaking an 0-for-34 streak dating to July 2, 2017.\nJay walked twice and Mike Moustakas had two of the Royals’ nine hits.\nKansas City right-hander Jason Hammel pitched six scoreless innings, giving up three hits and walking two. He struck out five ix and left after throwing 88 pitches.\nCleveland right-hander Mike Clevinger gave up nine hits and one run in 7 1/3 innings, striking out four and walking two. Clevinger, who is 3-0 in six career appearances against the Royals, has given up one run in his first 12 1/3 innings this season.\nCleveland recalled outfielder Tyler Naquin after placing outfielder Lonnie Chisenhall on the disabled list Sunday because of a strained right calf suffered when he made a catch in Saturday’s game. Chisenhall missed almost two months with the same injury in 2017.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:18:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
