Yields fall when bond prices rise.\nTreasury yields, which had fallen toward the end of the March quarter, swung as U.S. stocks began the first day of the second quarter on a downbeat note. Sliding technology shares and rising global trade tensions put pressure on major indexes.\n“Adverse news on the tech sector has promoted bonds ,” said Thomas di Galoma, a managing director and head of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings. “That’s what’s driving the firmness in the Treasury market.”\nInvestor demand for the relative safety of government debt came despite continuing signs that the economy is in solid shape.
