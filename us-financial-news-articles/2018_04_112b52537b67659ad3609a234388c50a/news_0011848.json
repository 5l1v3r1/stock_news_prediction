The group reported a pretax profit of 3.25 billion naira for 2017, but this was down 61 percent.\n“We would use 2018 to refinance a short-term facility. We intend to have this business restructured,” Bello, who took over as chief executive this year, said. “We see long-term growth supported by a huge housing deficit.”\nNigeria, home to more than 180 million people, suffers from long-term a housing shortage. Few banks offer long-term mortgages as high interest rates make them unattractive for buyers while lenders worry about the default risk.\nOfficials have said Nigeria needs to build around 17 million houses annually to catch up with a fast-growing population which is set to more than double to 400 million in 2050, according to U.N. estimates. Nigeria will be then the third most populous nation after China and India.\nUPDC cut its debt to 19.3 billion naira in 2017, down 15 percent from the previous year.\nShares in UAC, which has interests in foods, logistics and livestock feeds, rose 0.58 percent on Thursday to 17.30 naira while UPDC traded flat at 3 naira.
