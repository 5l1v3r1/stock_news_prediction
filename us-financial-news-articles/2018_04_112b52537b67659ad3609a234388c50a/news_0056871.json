SVU 4.54% has reached a deal to sell eight distribution centers and is exploring a sale of supermarket chain Shop ‘n Save as it seeks to boost results amid investor pressure.\nThe Minnesota-based company, one of the nation’s largest grocery companies, said Tuesday it had had reached agreements to sell the eight centers for roughly $445 million after taxes and lease them back for an initial term of 20 years with five, five-year renewal options.\nThe company said it would sell the sites to a single buyer but didn’t name the buyer.\n“Already in the first two months of fiscal 2019, we’ve capitalized on our business momentum by taking several decisive, strategic actions that further our transformation,” Chief Executive Mark Gross said in a statement. “These include exiting our Farm Fresh banner, the announcement that we’re pursuing the sale of our Shop ‘n Save and Shop ‘n Save East retail operations, and the monetization of approximately $483 million in owned real estate.”\nMore in Logistics\nBoeing Nears Deal to Buy Aerospace-Parts Specialist KLX April 27, 2018 Maersk CEO Calls For End to Shipping Subsidies April 26, 2018 Freight Costs Weighing on Earnings at Consumer-Goods Makers April 24, 2018 XPO Logistics Names Former Amazon Executive as COO April 23, 2018 The company reported a 42% increase in net sales in its fiscal quarter ending Feb. 24, 2018, mostly from the acquisitions of wholesale suppliers Unified Grocers and AG Florida. Retail sales at stores open at least a year increased 0.1%.\nThe distribution-center deal comes as Supervalu faces a proxy fight with an activist investor seeking to overhaul the company’s board of directors. Blackwells Capital LLC has nominated candidates for six seats on Supervalu’s nine-person board.\nThe activist investment firm, which was already pushing for change at Supervalu, said it chose the nominees based on their independence and expertise. The slate includes former executives with XPO Logistics Inc., Sysco Corp. and Starbucks Corp.\nBlackwells declined to comment on Supervalu’s sale of the distribution centers and intent to shed additional supermarkets. The investment fund has pushed for the company to spin off real estate and poor-performing grocery stores as part of its campaign.\nInvestors responded positively to the announcements, with Supervalu’s stock rising 11% Wednesday.\nBoard members are expected to be elected at the company’s shareholder meeting later this year.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T22:06:00.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
