REUTERS/Yuya Shino/File Photo Uchida has been among the central bank’s most influential bureaucrats on monetary policy, involved in the drafting of the BOJ’s key policies such as the adoption of negative interest rates and yield curve control in 2016.\nAfter heading the BOJ’s division on monetary policy affairs, he became manager of the bank’s Nagoya central Japan branch.\nUchida’s predecessor, Eiji Maeda, will become executive director overseeing monetary policy - a key post held previously by new deputy governor Masayoshi Amamiya, the BOJ said.\nTwo BOJ deputy governors - career central banker Amamiya and former academic Masazumi Wakatabe - assumed their posts last month. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will begin his second five-year term on April 9.\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:47:12.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
