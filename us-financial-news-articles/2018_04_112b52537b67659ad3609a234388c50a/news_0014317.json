I don't want to regulate them half to death,\" Kennedy said. \"But we have a problem. Our promised digital utopia has minefields in it.\"\nFacebook on Friday endorsed legislation known as the Honest Ads Act, which is aimed at countering concerns about foreign nationals using social media to influence American politics.\nThe legislation would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements.\nThe legislation, introduced last October but not yet passed, is aimed at countering concerns about foreign nationals using social media to influence American politics, which is part of the investigation into possible Russian meddling during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Russia denies involvement.\nUnder the act, digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views would need to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than $500.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T23:02:23.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
