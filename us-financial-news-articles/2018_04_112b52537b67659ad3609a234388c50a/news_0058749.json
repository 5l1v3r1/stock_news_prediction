Net cash provided by operating activities was higher as a result of an increase in sales volume, partly offset by an increase in cash operating costs.\nAdjusted net income attributable to EQT increased 253% for the first quarter 2018, excluding the impairment charge, non-cash derivative gains, and approximately $35.7 million of transaction-related expenses. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased 116%, including the transaction-related expenses and excluding the non-controlling interests in EQT Midstream Partners, LP (EQM) and Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP).\nThe Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as important disclosures regarding certain projected non-GAAP financial measures.\nRESULTS BY BUSINESS\nEQT PRODUCTION Financial Results Three Months Ended March 31, ($ millions, except average realized price) 2018 2017 Difference Sales volume (Bcfe) 357.0 189.9 167.1 Pipeline and net marketing services $ 59.6 $ 14.5 $ 45.1 Operating revenue $ 1,348.6 $ 828.7 $ 519.9 Adjusted operating revenue (a non-GAAP measure) $ 1,188.0 $ 665.0 $ 523.0 Operating expenses $ 3,242.4 $ 571.1 $ 2,671.3 Operating (loss) income $ (1,893.8) $ 257.5 $ (2,151.3) Adjusted operating income (a non-GAAP measure) $ 338.1 $ 110.2 $ 227.9 Average realized price ($/Mcfe) $ 3.33 $ 3.50 $ (0.17) The $2,151.3 million decrease in operating income in the quarter was primarily due to a recorded impairment charge of $2,329.0 million associated with non-core production assets and retained pipeline assets in the Huron and Permian plays; lower gains on derivatives not designated as hedges; a lower average realized price; and higher operating expenses, partially offset by increased sales volume of produced natural gas and NGLs. The increase in sales of natural gas, oil and NGLs was primarily a result of the acquisition of Rice, in addition to increased production from the 2016 and 2017 drilling programs.\nThe decrease in the average realized price for the quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the average NYMEX natural gas price, partly offset by an increase in the average natural gas differential and higher liquids prices.\nOperating expenses for the quarter were $2,671.3 million higher than the same period last year. In addition to the impairment, depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) increased $189.0 million; gathering expense increased $69.6 million; transmission expense increased $59.4 million; and processing expense increased $2.3 million, primarily due to increased produced volumes. Per unit cash operating expenses decreased 26%.\nWells Drilled (spud)\nMarcellus Upper Devonian Ohio Utica (net) Q1 2018 24 2 6 2018 Forecast 134 16 25 Q2 2018 Forecast 35 – 40 3 – 5 8 – 10 Q1 2018 average lateral lengths: Marcellus 14,000; Upper Devonian 16,800; Ohio Utica 11,700 2018 forecasted average lateral lengths: Marcellus 12,600; Upper Devonian 15,800; Ohio Utica 11,000\nWells Turned-in-line (TIL)\nMarcellus Upper Devonian Ohio Utica (net) Q1 2018 25 5 4 2018 Forecast 160 – 170 20 – 25 20 – 25 Q2 2018 Forecast 48 – 53 3 – 5 4 – 6 Q1 2018 average lateral lengths: Marcellus 7,900; Upper Devonian 11,300; Ohio Utica 10,000 2018 forecasted average lateral lengths: Marcellus 8,700; Upper Devonian 11,300; Ohio Utica 11,500\nMarcellus Horizontal Well Status (cumulative since inception)*\nAs of As of As of As of As of 3/31/18** 12/31/17** 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Wells drilled (spud) 1,763 1,743 1,288 1,259 1,216 Wells online 1,444 1,424 1,060 1,028 1,013 Wells complete, not online 35 21 21 15 20 Wells drilled, uncompleted 284 298 207 216 183 *These totals may differ from previous presentations to account for purchases, dispositions, wells plugged, or that have had a change in target formation to/from Marcellus.\n**Includes 77 wells acquired in 2016 and 570 wells acquired in 2017.\nEQT MIDSTREAM PARTNERS, LP (EQM)\nThe first quarter 2018 financial results for EQM were released today and provide operational results, as well as updates on significant midstream projects under development by EQM. This news release is available at www.eqtmidstreampartners.com . The summary results are:\nEQM Gathering Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, ($ millions) 2018 2017 Difference Operating revenue $ 125.9 $ 102.3 $ 23.6 Operating expenses $ 27.0 $ 28.6 $ (1.6) Operating income $ 98.9 $ 73.7 $ 25.2 Operating income increased 34% in the first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017, primarily due to higher revenues driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. Revenue from firm reservation fees represented 87% of total revenue during the quarter.\nOperating expenses were $1.6 million lower, primarily as a result of decreased SG&A due to lower personnel costs, partly offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense due to additional assets placed in-service.\nEQM Transmission Financial Results\nThree Months Ended March 31, ($ millions) 2018 2017 Difference Operating revenue $ 106.9 $ 97.7 $ 9.2 Operating expenses $ 27.5 $ 26.1 $ 1.4 Operating income $ 79.4 $ 71.6 $ 7.8 The increase in operating income in the first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017 was primarily due to higher contractual rates on existing contracts with third parties and affiliates, third parties contracting for additional firm capacity and increased seasonal storage-related services. Revenue from firm reservation fees represented 91% of total revenues during the quarter.\nOperating expenses were $1.4 million higher primarily as a result of increased operating and maintenance expense due to additional assets placed in-service.\nOTHER BUSINESS\nNewCo\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company announced a plan to separate its upstream and midstream businesses, creating a standalone publicly traded corporation (NewCo) that will focus on midstream operations. The separation is intended to qualify as tax-free to EQT shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter 2018. Under the separation plan, EQT shareholders will retain their shares of EQT stock and receive a proportional share of the new independent midstream company.\nPermian Sale\nEQT entered into an agreement to sell its Permian Basin assets located in Texas for $64 million. The sale, expected to close by end of June 2018, will reduce the Company’s 2018 production sales volume guidance by 5 Bcfe.\nStreamlining Transaction\nThe Company also announced a plan of action for the midstream streamlining transaction that includes:\nA drop-down of the Rice retained midstream assets to EQM for $1.52 billion -- $1.15 billion in cash plus approximately 5.9 million EQM common units, and EQM’s acquisition of Gulfport’s 25% ownership in the Strike Force Gathering System for $175 million in cash A merger of EQM and Rice Midstream Partners LP in a unit-for-unit transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.3319x, which implies a transaction value of $2.4 billion, including $325 million of assumed RMP debt The sale of RMP’s Incentive Distribution Rights to EQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) for 36.3 million EQGP common units, which is equivalent to $937 million\nPlease see the associated news release on the EQM-EQGP website at www.eqtmidstreampartners.com , or on the RMP website at www.ricemidstream.com .\nEQM / EQGP / RMP Distributions\nOn April 24, 2018, EQM approved a cash distribution to its unitholders of $1.065 per unit for the first quarter. EQGP approved a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.258 per unit for the first quarter 2018. RMP also approved a cash distribution to its unitholders of $0.3049 per unit for the first quarter 2018.\nCalculation of Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interest (NCI)\nThe results of EQGP, EQM, RMP and Strike Force Midstream LLC (Strike Force) are consolidated in EQT’s results. For the first quarter 2018, EQT’s results reflected earnings of $141.0 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, attributable to the publicly held partnership interests and the minority interest in Strike Force.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Unitholder interest in net Non-controlling NCI interest in (millions) income (a)\ninterest (NCI) EQT earnings EQM $ 133.1 71.65 % $ 95.3 EQGP $ 80.7 9.94 % $ 8.0 RMP $ 49.2 71.89 % $ 35.3 Strike Force $ 9.9 25.00 % $ 2.4 Total $ 141.0 (a) Excludes incentive distribution rights\nHedging\nAs of April 24, 2018, the approximate volumes and prices of the Company’s derivative commodity instruments hedging sales of produced gas for 2018 through 2020 were:\n2018 (a)\n2019 2020 NYMEX Swaps Total Volume (Bcf) 496 445 313 Average Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.08 $ 2.99 $ 3.01 Collars Total Volume (Bcf) 85 74 − Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.28 $ 3.12 $ − Average Cap Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 3.79 $ 3.60 $ − Puts (Long) Total Volume (Bcf) 5 3 − Average Floor Price per Mcf (NYMEX) $ 2.98 $ 3.15 $ − (a) April-December 2018\nThe Company sold calendar 2018, 2019, and 2020 calls for approximately 76, 97, and 103 Bcf at a strike price of $3.47, $3.55, and $3.47 per Mcf, respectively. The Company also purchased calendar year 2018, 2019 and 2020 calls for approximately 26, 42, and 35 Bcf at strike prices of $3.34, $3.36, and $3.36 per Mcf, respectively. The Company sold calendar 2018 and 2019 puts for approximately 3 Bcf at a strike price of $2.66 and $3.15 per Mcf, respectively. The average price is based on a conversion rate of 1.05 MMBtu/Mcf.\nOperating (Loss) Income\nThe Company reports operating (loss) income by segment in this news release. Interest, income taxes, and unallocated expense are controlled on a consolidated, corporate-wide basis and are not allocated to the segments.\nThe following table reconciles operating (loss) income by segment, as reported in this news release, to the consolidated operating (loss) income reported in the Company’s financial statements:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands) 2018 2017 Operating (loss) income: EQT Production $ (1,893,807 ) $ 257,549 EQM Gathering 98,891 73,704 EQM Transmission 79,451 71,604 RMP Gathering 44,095 − RMP Water 11,370 − Unallocated expense and intersegment eliminations (63,516 ) (11,880 ) Operating (loss) income $ (1,723,516 ) $ 390,977 Unallocated expenses consist primarily of compensation expense and administrative costs, including transaction costs of $35.7 million. Intersegment eliminations include water services that are provided to EQT Production and capitalized as part of development costs.\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to EQT and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (Adjusted EPS)\nAdjusted net income attributable to EQT and adjusted EPS are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that are presented because they are important measures used by management to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Adjusted net income attributable to EQT and adjusted EPS should not be considered as alternatives to net (loss) income attributable to EQT or earnings per diluted share (EPS) presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income attributable to EQT as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement, asset and lease impairments, transaction costs and certain other items that impact comparability between periods. Management utilizes adjusted net income attributable to EQT to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts; thus, the income from natural gas sales is not impacted by the often-volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. The measure also excludes other items that affect the comparability of results or that are not indicative of trends in the ongoing business. Management believes that adjusted net income attributable to EQT as presented provides useful information for investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings.\nThe table below reconciles adjusted net income attributable to EQT and adjusted EPS with net (loss) income attributable to EQT and EPS as derived from the statements of consolidated operations.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands, except per share information) 2018 2017 Net (loss) income attributable to EQT, as reported $ (1,585,994 ) $ 163,992 Add back / (deduct): Asset and lease impairments 2,332,924 1,837 Transaction costs 35,711 − Gain on derivatives not designated as hedges (62,592 ) (140,742 ) Net cash settlements paid on derivatives not designated as hedges (38,629 ) (8,967 ) Premiums received for derivatives that settled during the period 234 526 Tax impact of non-GAAP items* (413,306 ) 59,233 Adjusted net income attributable to EQT $ 268,348 $ 75,879 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 265,169 173,511 Diluted EPS, as adjusted $ 1.01 $ 0.44 *Blended tax rates of 18.23% and 40.2% were applied to the items under the caption “Add back (deduct)” for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This represents the incremental tax (expense) benefit that would have been incurred had these items been excluded from net (loss) income attributable to EQT.\nOperating Cash Flow, Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT and Adjusted Operating Cash Flow Attributable to EQT Production\nOperating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that are presented as indicators of an oil and gas exploration and production company’s ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt. EQT includes this information because management believes that changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements and therefore may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT is EQT’s net cash provided by operating activities, less changes in other assets and liabilities, adjusted to exclude EQM and RMP adjusted EBITDA, plus EQM and RMP interest expense plus the EQGP and RMP cash distributions payable to EQT. Prior to EQT’s 2018 operational forecast announcement in December 2017, the Company’s calculation of adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT did not include the addition of EQM’s and RMP’s interest expense. The Company believes it is preferable to present this non-GAAP supplemental financial measure with this adjustment as it better reflects EQT’s cash flows by excluding the cost of debt for EQM and RMP. EQT has recast all periods presented to be consistent with this change in the definition of adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT. Management believes that removing the impact on operating cash flows of the public unitholders of EQGP, EQM and RMP that is otherwise required to be consolidated in EQT’s results provides useful information to an EQT investor. As used in this news release, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production means the EQT Production segment’s total operating revenues less the EQT Production segment’s cash operating expense, less gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as hedges, plus net cash settlements received (paid) on derivatives not designated as hedges, plus premiums received (paid) for derivatives that settled during the period, plus EQT Production asset impairments (if applicable). Operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT, and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production should not be considered as alternatives to net cash provided by operating activities presented in accordance with GAAP. The table below reconciles operating cash flow and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT with net cash provided by operating activities, as derived from the statements of consolidated cash flows to be included in EQT’s report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 904,412 $ 514,817 Add back / (deduct) Changes in other assets and liabilities 240 (67,485 ) Operating cash flow (a non-GAAP measure) 904,652 447,332 (Deduct) / add back: EQM adjusted EBITDA (1) (204,431 ) (168,664 ) RMP adjusted EBITDA (1) (69,534 ) – EQM net interest expense 10,833 7,926 RMP net interest expense 1,954 – Cash distribution payable to EQT from EQGP (2) 61,846 45,786 Cash distribution payable to EQT from RMP (3) 13,121 – Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT $ 718,441 $ 332,380 (1) EQM adjusted EBITDA and RMP adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures reconciled in this section. (2) Cash distribution payable to EQT for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, represents the distribution payable from EQGP to EQT related to the respective period. (3) Cash distribution payable to EQT for the three months ended March 31, 2018 represents the distribution payable from RMP to EQT related to the respective period. EQT has not provided projected net cash provided by operating activities or reconciliations of projected adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT or EQT Production to projected net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. EQT is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities because this metric includes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred. EQT is unable to project these timing differences with any reasonable degree of accuracy without unreasonable efforts such as predicting the timing of its and customers’ payments, with accuracy to a specific day, three or more months in advance. Furthermore, EQT does not provide guidance with respect to its average realized price, among other items, that impact reconciling items between net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and EQT Production, as applicable. Natural gas prices are volatile and out of EQT’s control, and the timing of transactions and the income tax effects of future transactions and other items are difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, EQT is unable to provide projected net cash provided by operating activities, or the related reconciliations of projected adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT and EQT Production to projected net cash provided by operating activities, without unreasonable effort.\nEQT Production Adjusted Operating Revenue\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production total operating revenue, as reported in the EQT Production Results of Operations, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Refer to the Financial Information by Business Segment footnote to be included in EQT’s report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018, for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating revenue to EQT Corporation total operating revenue.\nEQT Production adjusted operating revenue (also referred to as total natural gas & liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure used by the Company’s management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating revenue as presented excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and the revenue impact of certain pipeline and net marketing services. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating revenue to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus does not impact the revenue from natural gas sales with the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. EQT Production adjusted operating revenue also excludes \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" because management considers this revenue to be unrelated to the revenue for its natural gas and liquids production. EQT Production \"Pipeline and net marketing services\" includes revenue for gathering services provided to third-parties, as well as both the cost of and recoveries on third-party pipeline capacity not used for EQT Production sales volume. Management further believes that EQT Production adjusted operating revenue, as presented, provides useful information to investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings trends.\nCalculation of EQT Production Adjusted Operating Revenue Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n$ in thousands (unless noted) 2018 2017 EQT Production total operating revenue, as reported on segment page $ 1,348,602 $ 828,662 (Deduct) / add back: Gain on derivatives not designated as hedges (62,592 ) (140,742 ) Net cash settlements paid on derivatives not designated as hedges (38,629 ) (8,967 ) Premiums received for derivatives that settled during the period 234 526 Pipeline and net marketing services (59,636 ) (14,455 ) EQT Production adjusted operating revenue, a non-GAAP measure $ 1,187,979 $ 665,024 Total sales volumes (MMcfe) 357,005 189,934 Average realized price ($/Mcfe) 3.33 3.50\nEQT Production Adjusted Operating Income (Loss)\nThe table below reconciles EQT Production adjusted operating income (loss), a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure, to EQT Production operating income (loss), as reported in the EQT Production Results of Operations. Refer to the Operating Income (Loss) section in this news release for a reconciliation of EQT Production total operating income (loss) to EQT Corporation total operating income (loss), as reported.\nEQT Production adjusted operating income is presented because it is an important measure used by EQT’s management to evaluate period-over-period comparisons of earnings trends. EQT Production adjusted operating income should not be considered as an alternative to EQT Corporation operating (loss) income presented in accordance with GAAP. EQT Production adjusted operating income excludes the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and asset and lease impairments. Management utilizes EQT Production adjusted operating income to evaluate earnings trends because the measure reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts and thus the income from natural gas sales is not impacted by the often volatile fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives prior to settlement. The measure also excludes certain other items that affect the comparability of results and are not indicative of trends in the ongoing business. Management believes that EQT Production adjusted operating income as presented provides useful information for investors for evaluating period-over-period earnings.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands) 2018 2017 EQT Production operating (loss) income, as reported on segment page $ (1,893,807 ) $ 257,549 (Deduct) / add back: Gain on derivatives not designated as hedges (62,592 ) (140,742 ) Net cash settlements received (paid) on derivatives not designated as hedges (38,629 ) (8,967 ) Premiums received for derivatives that settled during the period 234 526 Asset and lease impairments 2,332,924 1,837 EQT Production adjusted operating income $ 338,130 $ 110,203\nEQM Adjusted EBITDA\nAs used in this news release, EQM adjusted EBITDA means EQM’s net income plus EQM’s net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, preferred interest payments and non-cash long-term compensation expense less EQM’s equity income and AFUDC-equity. EQM adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of EQT’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess the effects of the noncontrolling interests in relation to:\nEQT's operating performance as compared to other companies in its industry; the ability of EQT's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its investors; EQT's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nEQT believes that EQM EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing the impact of the noncontrolling interest in EQM on EQT's financial condition and results of operations. EQM adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to EQM’s net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EQM adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect EQM's net income. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQT's or EQM's industries, the definition of EQM adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure. The table below reconciles EQM adjusted EBITDA with EQM’s net income, as derived from the statements of consolidated operations to be included in EQM’s report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands) 2018 2017 Net income $ 177,218 $ 143,196 Add back: Net interest expense 10,833 7,926 Depreciation and amortization expense 23,179 20,547 Preferred interest payments 2,746 2,746 Non-cash long-term compensation expense 331 225 Less: Equity income (8,811 ) (4,277 ) AFUDC – equity (1,065 ) (1,699 ) EQM Adjusted EBITDA $ 204,431 $ 168,664\nRMP Adjusted EBITDA\nRMP adjusted EBITDA means RMP’s net income plus RMP’s net interest expense, depreciation expense, and non-cash compensation expense. RMP adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of EQT’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess the effects of the noncontrolling interests in relation to:\nEQT's operating performance as compared to other companies in its industry; the ability of EQT's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to its investors; EQT's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nEQT believes that RMP adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in assessing the impact of the noncontrolling interest in RMP on EQT's financial condition and results of operations. RMP adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to RMP’s net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. RMP adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect RMP's net income. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQT's or RMP's industries, the definition of RMP adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure. The table below reconciles RMP adjusted EBITDA with RMP’s net income, as derived from the statements of consolidated operations to be included in RMP’s report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended March 31, (thousands) 2018 2017 Net income $ 53,517 $ – Add back: Net interest expense 1,954 – Depreciation expense 13,895 – Non-cash compensation expense 168 – RMP Adjusted EBITDA\n$ 69,534 $ – First Quarter 2018 Webcast Information\nThe Company's conference call with securities analysts begins at 10:30 a.m. ET today and will be broadcast live via the Company's web site at www.eqt.com , and on the investor information page of the Company’s web site at ir.eqt.com , with a replay available for seven days following the call.\nEQT Midstream Partners, LP and EQT GP Holdings, LP, for which EQT Corporation is the parent company, will also host a joint conference call with security analysts today, beginning at 11:30 a.m. ET.

We use certain terms, such as “EUR” (estimated ultimate recovery) and “3P” (proved, probable and possible), that the SEC’s guidelines prohibit us from including in filings with the SEC. These measures are by their nature more speculative than estimates of reserves prepared in accordance with SEC definitions and guidelines and accordingly are less certain.\nTotal sales volume per day (or daily production) is an operational estimate of the daily production or sales volume on a typical day (excluding curtailments).\nDisclosures in this news release contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Statements that do not relate strictly to historical or current facts are forward-looking. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this news release specifically include the expectations of plans, strategies, objectives and growth and anticipated financial and operational performance of the Company and its subsidiaries, including guidance regarding the Company’s strategy to develop its reserves; drilling plans and programs (including the number, type, average length-of-pay or lateral length and location of wells to be drilled and number and type of drilling rigs); projected natural gas prices, basis and average differential; total resource potential, reserves and EUR; projected Company and third party production sales volume and growth rates (including liquids sales volume and growth rates); projected unit costs and well costs; projected pipeline and net marketing services revenues; projected gathering and transmission volume and growth rates; infrastructure programs (including the timing, cost and capacity of the transmission and gathering expansion projects); the cost, capacity, timing of regulatory approvals and anticipated in-service date of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) project; the ultimate terms, partners and structure of the MVP joint venture; technology (including drilling and completion techniques); acquisition transactions; the projected general and administrative savings, capital efficiency savings and other operating efficiencies and synergies resulting from the Rice Merger, and the Company’s ability to achieve the anticipated synergies and efficiencies; monetization transactions, including asset sales, joint ventures or other transactions involving the Company’s assets; whether the Company will sell its Ohio midstream assets to EQM and the timing of such transaction or transactions; the timing of the Company’s announcement of a decision for addressing its sum-of-the-parts discount, and the impact of the results of such review; the projected cash flows resulting from the Company’s partnership interests in EQGP and RMP; internal rate of return (IRR) and returns per well; projected capital contributions and expenditures; potential future impairments of the Company’s assets; liquidity and financing requirements, including funding sources and availability; changes in the Company’s or EQM’s credit ratings; projected net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT, adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT Production, EBITDA, revenues and cash-on-hand; hedging strategy; the effects of government regulation and litigation; projected dividend and distribution amounts and rates; and tax position, projected effective tax rate and the impact of changes in tax laws. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events. While the Company considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance and results of the Company’s business and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 as filed with the SEC, as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company does not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nInformation in this news release regarding EQGP and its subsidiaries, including EQM, and RMP is derived from publicly available information published or to be published by the partnerships.\nAdditional Information and Where to Find It\nIn connection with their proposed business combination transaction, EQM and RMP intend to file a registration statement on Form S-4, containing a proxy statement/prospectus (the S-4) with the SEC.
