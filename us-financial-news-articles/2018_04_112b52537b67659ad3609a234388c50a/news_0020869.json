We would thus ignore the current jitters and buy into the current weakness, particularly with dividend season almost upon us.” \nRussian officials, including central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina and Economy Minister Maxim Oreshkin, sought to calm investors. \nNabiullina, who had to deal with a sharp rouble drop at the end of 2014 amid the first western sanctions, told a forum that the central bank had a wide range of tools at its disposal with which to address the risks. No risks were seen for now to Russia’s financial stability, she said. \nOreshkin told the same forum that the floating rouble rate was helping to offset a possible negative effect on the Russian economy. \nThe economy is projected to grow by 2 percent this year after 1.5 percent increase in 2017. \nDespite the sell-off, some analysts said it was premature to begin to revise economic forecasts. \n“We tend to believe that the impact on economic growth ought to be fairly limited given that Russia has already deleveraged, and economic policies of the recent years ensured stabilization and de-risking of domestic economy,” Renaissance Capital analysts Oleg Kouzmin and Daniel Salter said in a note. \nRussian stock dollar-denominated index has also extended losses after opening up in earlier trade, while the rouble one was on the rise. \nThe dollar-denominated RTS index was down by 4.2 percent to 1,049 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 1.35 percent higher at 2,119.0 points. Russia’s 5-year credit default swaps rose to six-month high, widening from Monday. \nOn Monday, the rouble suffered its biggest daily fall in more than three years and stocks in major Russian companies also slid, as investors reacted to a new round of U.S. sanctions targeting some of Russia’s biggest tycoons. \nThe United States imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and some of their companies on Friday, including Viktor Vekselberg’s Renova and Oleg Deripaska’s En+ Group , Rusal and some other assets. \nRusal was trading down 5.14 percent on Tuesday. \nFor Russian equities guide see \nFor Russian treasury bonds see (Reporting by Katya Golubkova Additional reporting by Andrey Ostroukh, Elena Fabrichnaya and Tatiana Voronova in MOSCOW, Sujata Rao in LONDON Editing by Alison Williams and Richard Balmforth)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T11:50:06.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
