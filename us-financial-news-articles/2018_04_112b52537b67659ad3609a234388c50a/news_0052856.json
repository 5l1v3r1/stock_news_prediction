Ineos was not immediately available to comment and VNG Norge did not respond to a request for comment.\nTwo of the sources familiar with the matter also said firms that had initially shown an interest, including DEA, a vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman which is in the process of merging with Wintershall, and Sweden’s Lundin Petroleum, were unlikely to pursue their interest.\nLundin declined to comment and DEA was not immediately available to comment.\nVNG’s portfolio includes the $1.3 billion Fenja development, one of the largest recent North Sea oil discoveries estimated to hold about 100 million barrels of oil equivalents, as well as substantial stakes in four other operated licences and minor stakes in three producing fields off Norway.\nVNG is majority-owned by German utility EnBW with a 74.2 percent stake.\nOther European utilities that have divested offshore Norwegian assets recently include France’s Engie, which sold its UK and Norwegian North Sea fields, while British utility Centrica combined its North Sea business with Bayerngas Norge, an unlisted arm of German Stadwerke Muenchen and Bayerngas.\nSources told Reuters that Endeavour Energy UK had launched the sale of its North Sea oil and gas assets and Spain’s Repsol was also considering selling its energy portfolio in the region. $1 = 0.8214 euros Reporting by Arno Schuetze, Ron Bousso and Clara Denina; Additional reporting by Nerijius Adomaitis in Oslo and Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T16:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:40:01.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
