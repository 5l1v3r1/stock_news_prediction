Beijing was quick to retaliate on Wednesday, announcing a 25 percent levy on 106 U.S. goods such as soybeans, chemicals, cars, some types of aircraft and corn products.\nMSCI’s emerging stocks benchmark fell 1.5 percent to a 50-day low, turning negative on the year. Asian bourses tumbled with heavyweight Hong Kong down 2.2 percent to touch multi-week lows and Malaysia and South Korea not far behind.\nBut the rekindled fears of protectionism also sapped risk appetite across wider emerging markets, with bourses in Moscow , Turkey and central Europe also trading in the red. South African stocks tumbled more than 3 percent, also suffering from a price target cut.\n“China is a hub where products from the rest of Asia are assembled and re-exported to the Western world, especially the U.S.,” said Inan Demir, senior emerging economist at Nomura International.\n“If Chinese-origin products are subject to tariffs, the likelihood is that other countries will have less room to export to China, because the final destination of those products is the U.S. and also because Chinese growth will slow down.”\nCurrencies also felt the heat, broadly weakening against the softer dollar. China’s yuan eased 0.4 percent, suffering its biggest daily fall in two weeks, while Mexico’s peso and Russia’s rouble matching those falls.\nTurkey’s lira weakened 0.6 percent against the dollar, crashing once again through the 4-to-the-dollar threshold while tumbling nearly 1 percent against the euro.\nInvestor worries over Turkey’s monetary policy and stubbornly high inflation contributed to the latest weakness.\n“Given the market’s concern about over-heating in the Turkish economy, a pronounced reluctance to implement counter-cyclical measures and (to) show a willingness to reduce interest rates further and strengthen credit growth, (this is) adding to market concerns about Turkey’s imbalances,” said Nomura’s Demir.\nMarkets also awaited a number of central bank decisions.\nIn Romania, the central bank is expected to deliver its third interest rate hike in the cycle which it launched early this year. Analysts anticipated a 25 basis point hike to 2.5 percent and a further rise to 3 percent by the end of the year.\nNigeria will publish its first interest rate decision of the year after a political stalemate prevented the monetary policy committee from forming a quorum. Most analysts expect the bank to hold rates at the record of 14 percent with cuts due later in the year.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1152.14 -18.01 -1.54 -0.54\nCzech Rep 1117.71 +1.05 +0.09 +3.67\nPoland 2202.98 -36.17 -1.62 -10.49\nHungary 37497.55 -369.99 -0.98 -4.77\nRomania 8741.82 -22.87 -0.26 +12.74\nGreece 784.64 +5.19 +0.67 -2.21\nRussia 1228.10 -8.96 -0.72 +6.38\nSouth Africa 46834.52 -1345.42 -2.79 -10.85\nTurkey 13841.52 -752.53 -0.66 -1.29\nChina 3131.84 -4.79 -0.15 -5.30\nIndia 33092.12 -278.51 -0.83 -2.83\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.33 25.32 -0.03 +0.80\nPoland 4.21 4.19 -0.28 -0.70\nHungary 311.91 311.82 -0.03 -0.44\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.03 +0.42\nSerbia 118.07 118.09 +0.02 +0.28\nRussia 57.87 57.57 -0.52 -0.37\nKazakhstan 320.11 320.40 +0.09 +3.96\nUkraine 26.25 26.30 +0.19 +7.22\nSouth Africa 11.87 11.82 -0.44 +4.11\nKenya 100.95 101.00 +0.05 +2.13\nIsrael 3.53 3.53 -0.09 -1.56\nTurkey 4.01 3.99 -0.63 -5.58\nChina 6.30 6.29 -0.18 +3.28\nIndia 65.07 64.99 -0.12 -1.90\nBrazil 3.34 3.34 +0.01 -0.86\nMexico 18.29 18.22 -0.40 +7.42\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 321 1 .04 7 94.04 1\nReporting by Karin Strohecker; additional reporting and graphic by Claire Milhench editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:55:03.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
