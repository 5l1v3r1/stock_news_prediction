But I think that, based on the current development of the economy, we will do one more hike this year.”\nThe central bank’s current forecast predicts another increase in the repo rate, now at 0.75 percent, around the end of 2018 or start of 2019.\nCzech inflation has slowed, and while the crown currency has firmed less than the bank had expected, it said at its last monetary policy meeting on March 29 that it assessed risks to the forecast as being slightly anti-inflationary.\nFellow central bank board member Vojtech Benda told Reuters on Tuesday he saw the risks being tilted higher but he also saw no need to raise rates in the short-term.
