LaSalle’s shareholders also can opt to receive cash for up to 20% of their shares, up from the earlier 15%, Pebblebrook said.\nThis is up from the initial all-stock bid at a value of $30.00 a share made on March 28, which LaSalle rejected, saying it undervalued the company.\nLaSalle, which owns approximately 10,400 rooms in 41 hotels, said its board of trustees will carefully review Pebblebrook’s revised proposal. LaSalle’s share price has risen 23% since March 27. Pebblebrook’s share price rose 5.1% over the same period.\n“Pebblebrook’s final offer strikes us as a full and attractive offer for LaSalle’s shareholders,” said Jeffrey Donnelly, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. The revised bid “would likely only be bested by another party with a higher offer and a meaningfully larger cash component,” Mr. Donnelly said, adding that accelerating supply growth in the industry suggests the shares are fairly valued.\nIn an April 20 letter to LaSalle’s board highlighting the benefits of combining the two Bethesda, Md.-based hotel REITs, Pebblebrook said LaSalle might be evaluating other offers at lower prices and urged the company to hold back from entering any agreement that includes a breakup fee.\n“We continue to believe that there will be substantial long-term strategic benefits from combining our companies with significant potential value creation for LaSalle shareholders that would be unavailable in the case of an all-cash offer,” said Jon E. Bortz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Pebblebrook.\nWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T05:28:44.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
