It has also set up a new standby banking facility of NZ$500 million.\nFletcher’s reconfigured capital structure had provided a “permanent solution” to the firm’s breaches of its syndicated lenders agreement and it expected to wrap up its negotiations with it’s U.S. lenders by May 31, Taylor told media.\n“From our perspective the capital raise does put Fletcher Building on a firmer footing to continue to rebuild its businesses,” Shane Solly, portfolio manager at Harbour Asset Management, which owns Fletcher shares, told Reuters.\n“Certainly having a lower gearing target is quite prudent and the proposed sale of Formica and the tile business pulls the business back to its core focus.”\nThe firm reiterated its estimate for earnings before tax estimate of NZ$680 million to NZ$720 million for the full year.\nTaylor told reporters that Fletcher would likely be in a position to resume dividend payments in the 2019 financial year after announcing in February that it would not pay out a dividend for the second half of the current financial year.\nTaylor did not comment on the 5.1 percent stake recently acquired by Australian investment firm Ellerston Capital. Ellerston had no immediate comment on Tuesday, but had listed Fletcher as a “turnaround story” in an investor newsletter.
