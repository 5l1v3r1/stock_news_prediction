He is looking to make amends for his late slip up in Augusta, when he blew his lead by finding the water on the 15th on the final day.\nRahm had a birdie at the 13th before a bogey at the next hole but signed off on a high with an eagle at the 18th, joining compatriot Pastor on five-under.\n\"To be honest, I played a lot better than I expected, especially off the tee,\" Rahm told the European Tour website www.europeantour.com .\n“My driver was really good today - the driver alone set up two birdies, on 13 and on seven. Things like that are obviously a bonus. Too bad I couldn’t make a couple of putts but I guess it’s happening to everyone, the greens are not easy to read.”\nPastor is ranked 113th in the World Amateur Golf Rankings and was making his first appearance on the European Tour, but he flew up the leaderboard with an eagle at 10th the before making birdies at the 13th and 18th.\n“It is a good start in a great tournament,” Pastor said. “As an amateur it is a bit distressing because you don’t play your course or tournament but it feels good. My golf was good so I’m really happy.”\nThe Spanish Open was one of the most prestigious tournaments on the European Tour but took a one year sabbatical last year and switched courses from Valderrama in Andalusia to the Centro Nacional de Golf in Madrid.\nReporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T21:41:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
