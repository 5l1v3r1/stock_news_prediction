Ties between Egypt and Sudan were strained when Khartoum backed the dam because of its need for electricity.\nThe issue is being closely followed in Nile capitals that are dependent on the river for irrigation and drinking water.\n“We were not able to reach an agreement on a joint decision, and it’s a technical issue that we cannot discuss,” Sudanese Foreign Minister Ibrahim Ghandour told reporters after the talks that began on Thursday morning and lasted about 16 hours.\nGhandour said the talks on the dam on the Blue Nile were constructive and important, but more time was needed, Khartoum’s state news agency SUNA said.\nThe talks were attended by the foreign ministers, irrigation ministers and intelligence chiefs of the three countries.\nNo date has been set for further discussions, but irrigation ministers are planning to meet at some point for more talks on the matter, the minister said.\nReporting by Khalid Abdelaziz, Writing by Arwa Gaballa, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T20:02:22.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
