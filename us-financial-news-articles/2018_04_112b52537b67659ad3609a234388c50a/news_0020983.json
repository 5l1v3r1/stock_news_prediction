The agency has requested that the company provide additional information to establish correlation to the predicate.\n“The FDA’s feedback to our submission for the TearLab Discovery™ Platform was very helpful in establishing the steps needed to demonstrate substantial equivalence through the 510k process,” said Seph Jensen, TearLab’s Chief Executive Officer. “We believe we can address the comments raised in the FDA’s letter and plan to submit our response within the allowed 180 day timeframe. We remain on track to have a clearance decision sometime in the second half of 2018.”\nAbout TearLab Corporation\nTearLab Corporation ( www.tearlab.com ) develops and markets lab-on-a-chip technologies that enable eye care practitioners to improve standard of care by objectively and quantitatively testing for disease markers in tears at the point-of-care.
