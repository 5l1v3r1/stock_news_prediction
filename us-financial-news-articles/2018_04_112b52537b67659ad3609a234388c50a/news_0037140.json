(ASM: TSX/NYSE American, GV6: FSE, \"Avino\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to announce first quarter 2018 production results from its Avino property near Durango, Mexico.\nThe silver equivalent production in Q1, 2018 increased by 9% compared to Q1, 2017 due to an increase in the tonnage processed and higher gold grades at the Avino Mine, together with higher silver grades at the San Gonzalo Mine. The gold production in Q1, 2018 increased by 12% compared to Q1, 2017 whereas the silver and copper production decreased by 3% and 5% respectively.\nConsolidated Production Highlights for First Quarter 2018 (Compared to First Quarter 2017)\nSilver equivalent production increased by 9% to 656,699 oz* Gold production increased by 12% to 2,065 oz Silver production decreased by 3 % to 309,927 oz Copper production decreased by 5% to 970,165 lbs\n*For comparison purposes, the silver equivalent ratio has been calculated using metal prices of $16.77 oz Ag, $1,330 oz Au and $3.16 Lb Cu. Mill production figures have not been reconciled and are subject to adjustment with concentrate sales. Calculated figures may not add up due to rounding.\n\"We're pleased with our first quarter production results, as well as the progress being made around our expansion of the Avino Mine and processing plant\" said David Wolfin, President and CEO. \"We anticipate that the expansion at the Avino Mine will be completed early in the second quarter of 2018, and we look forward to an enhanced production profile by the end of the year.\"\nProduction Tables for First Quarter, 2018\nComparative production results from the first quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2017 are presented below:\nQ1\n2018\nQ1\n2017\n%\nChange\nTotal Silver Eq.

Mill production figures have not been reconciled and are subject to adjustment with concentrate sales. Calculated figures may not add up due to rounding.\nAt the Avino mine during the first quarter, we advanced 1,188 metres of underground development, and 116,155 tonnes of mill feed were trucked to the plant for processing. An additional 4,476 tonnes from historic stockpiles were also processed during the quarter. The blending of the historic stockpile material with fresh underground material resulted in lower copper and silver recoveries for the quarter. Gold feed grade for the quarter increased by 16% and gold production for the quarter increased by 23%.\nThe construction of Mill Circuit #4 is almost complete, and the installation of a filter press and a bank of flotation cells from Outotec and piping for the thickener are now underway. This work is expected to be completed later this month. The start-up and commissioning of the ball mill for Mill Circuit 4 commenced during the quarter with the flotation feed from the new ball mill reporting to Mill Circuit 3's flotation cells. There have been no issues encountered, and the mill is operating at design capacity.\nDevelopment is now taking place at level 16.5 near a high grade gold zone for potential future mill feed. Rehabilitation work at the San Luis portal has also started. The portal entrance has been stabilized with shotcrete and the areas with poor ground conditions have been reinforced with wire mesh and rock anchors. A new electrical substation near the portal has been installed to provide power to the mine and piping for a new water line to the portal is currently being installed.\nSan Gonzalo Mine First Quarter 2018 Production Highlights\nComparative figures for the first quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2016 for the San Gonzalo mine are as follows:\nQ1\n2018\nQ1\n2017\nQuarterly\nChange %\nTotal Mill Feed (dry tonnes)\n20,186\n20,133\n0%\nFeed Grade Silver (g/t)\n264\n229\n15%\nFeed Grade Gold (g/t)\n1.1\n1.2\n-10%\nRecovery Silver (%)\n79\n84\n-6%\nRecovery Gold (%)\n75\n76\n-1%\nTotal Silver Produced (kg)\n4,201\n3,873\n8%\nTotal Gold Produced (g)\n16,206\n18,182\n-11%\nTotal Silver Equivalent Produced (oz) calculated*\n176,384\n165,480\n7%\n*For comparison purposes, the silver equivalent ratio has been calculated using metal prices of $16.77 oz Ag, $1,330 oz Au and $3.16 Lb Cu. Mill production figures have not been reconciled and are subject to adjustment with concentrate sales. Calculated figures may not add up due to rounding.\nThe silver grades at San Gonzalo for Q1, 2018 increased by 15% and the gold grades decreased by 10% compared to Q1, 2017, as a result of the mineralization of the area being mined. Mill feed for the quarter came for Levels 4-020, 5-020 and 6-020.\nUnderground development consisted of 362 metres of drifts, 255 metres of raises, and 134 metres of crosscuts for a total of 751 metres.\nAdditionally, the tonnage broken for the quarter was 14,677 tonnes. The plant availability for the first quarter 2018 was 96%, and there were were no major shut downs other than the normal scheduled daily monthly maintenance.\nZinc Circuit\nThe company continued its testing program for recovery of precious metals and zinc from the San Gonzalo tailings. In Q1, 2018, the Company produced 233 tonnes of low quality zinc concentrate grading 1,582 g/t silver, 6.96 g/t gold and 13.35% zinc for an additional 22,343 AgEq ounces. This product is currently being marketed and if successful, this program will continue.\nQuality Assurance/Quality Control\nMill assays are performed at the Avino property's on-site lab. Check samples are sent to SGS Labs in Durango, Mexico for verification. All concentrate shipments are assayed by one of the following independent third party labs: AHK, and Inspectorate in the UK and LSI in the Netherlands.\nQualified Person(s)\nAvino's Mexican projects are under the supervision of Jasman Yee P.Eng, Avino director, who is a qualified person within the context of National Instrument 43-101. He has reviewed and approved the technical data in this news release.\nCompany Announcements\nAvino is pleased to introduce Peter Latta to the technical Team as Senior Technical Advisor where he will work closely with Avino's metallurgical team in Vancouver and with company-wide operations teams.
