The total CAPEX for the required equipment is expected to be in the range of $500,000. The Company will rent a 40 tonne (t) excavator, two 2.5 cubic meter loaders and two 30 t dump trucks to support the processing of Tailings. Diamonds recovered from this operation will solely be for the account of the Company. It is anticipated that this equipment will be mobilized to Oena and operational by the end of the second quarter.\nBluedust 7 Proprietary Limited (“Bluedust”) continues their systematic and detailed geological work of Oena including the opportunity to assess the National Instrument 43-101 Inferred Resource (see 1 December 2014 news release) and several other priority targets. This includes the systematic testing both run of mine (“ROM”) material in several separate areas, as well as Tailings.\nMr. Samer Khalaf\nCEO\nTango Mining Limited\ninfo@tangomining.com\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nForward-Looking Statement\nCertain information set forth in this news release contains “forward-looking statements” and “forward-looking information” under applicable securities laws.
