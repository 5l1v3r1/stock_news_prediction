The assessment will stress-test the system under various fuel supply disruption scenarios to better understand potential future reliability concerns.\n“We have the ability to identify risks to the system and to put a value on resources that offset that risk,” Ott said, noting certain generators with weeks of fuel on hand or multiple sources of fuel could receive more money for the resiliency they provide.\nSome coal plants, for example, keep weeks of fuel on hand or have access to mines on site. Nuclear plants can hold up to two years worth of fuel in their reactors. Some gas plants can also burn oil and have access to multiple pipelines, gas straight out of the ground and liquefied natural gas supplies.
