REUTERS/Lucas Jackson\nIn March the U.S. State Department approved the possible sale of Javelin systems to Ukraine at an estimated cost of $47 million.\n“I can confirm that the long-awaited weapon arrived in the Ukrainian army” Poroshenko said on Facebook.\nKiev and Washington believe that the Javelin system will help Ukraine build its long-term defense capacity.\nThe United States has been one of Kiev’s staunchest supporters since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the subsequent outbreak of fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 10,000 people.\nBut the decision to provide lethal aid was sensitive and Russia has repeatedly said supplying weapons to Ukraine would further destabilize the situation by encouraging Kiev to use force.
