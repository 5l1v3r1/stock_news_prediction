The 20,000-square-foot was purchased in 1931 by the Sisters of the Order of St. Dominic of Amityville for roughly $250,000 .\nThe nuns maintained control of the estate until it was sold again for $35 million in 2005, when it reportedly went to footwear designer and Nine West co-founder Vince Camuto. The estate reportedly went back on the market in 2008 with an asking price that reached $100 million at one point.\nBespoke Real Estate Camuto died in 2015 and the estate's most recent sellers and buyers were not publicly revealed (though Camuto's family were reported to be the sellers). \nBespoke Real Estate Cody Vichinsky of Bespoke Real Estate, who handled the deal, told \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich\" that Villa Maria's most recent owner invested nearly $40 million over several years to refurbish the property, which now features such luxuries as $500,000 wrought-iron decorative railing that Vichinsky says was custom-made in Austria \"by a gentleman whose sole job is to make this look like it's been here for a hundred years.\"\nBespoke Real Estate The mansion also features a dome imported from Italy that Vichinsky says is \"centuries old,\" as well as a marble tub in the master bathroom that cost $50,000 and weighs 4,000 pounds (it was cut from a single piece of stone, the broker says).\nBespoke Real Estate The house's master suite is 2,700 square feet, made up of six rooms and spans the entire western wing of the house. Meanwhile, all of the furniture at Villa Maria was custom-made for the house and \"meant to evoke 'Hamptons chic,'\" Vichinsky says.\nDon't miss: Look inside this $69 million home on the French Riviera, where the 1% of the 1% live \nLike this story?
