The unit will merge with rival Sainsbury’s, creating the largest supermarket chain in the country, with revenues of around $70 billion. Walmart brought in a new international business chief, Judith McKenna, a few months back. At the moment, Walmart’s non-U.S. locations account for more than half its stores, but only around a third of its revenues. Fortune\nMarathon and Andeavor\nMarathon Petroleum intends to shell out over $23 billion for pipeline and refining firm Andeavor. Ohio-based Marathon is the U.S.’s second-biggest refiner and owner of the Speedway convenience store chain, and it generally operates in the east of the country. Texas’s Andeavor, formerly known as Tesoro, operates mostly in the west. The combined operation will be able to process around 3.1 million barrels a day, Marathon says. WSJ\nWPP Future\nMartin Sorrell may be out as head of WPP, the ad giant he founded, but the company is not looking at a full break-up, even though some see it as unmanageable by anyone else. Joint chief operating officer Mark Read said he would consider a restructure, though. WPP’s latest quarterly results are better than analysts had expected, so its shares climbed by as much as 9% in this morning’s trading. BBC\nFacebook’s Cambodian Woes\nA political opponent of Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen wants Facebook to hand over information that might help him fight legal claims against him by the government. Facebook is resisting the request, but Sam Rainsy’s lawyer today will ask a San Francisco court to compel the social network to comply. Rainsy claims Hun Sen and his regime have bought Facebook ads to distribute propaganda against him. Facebook claims he’s on a “fishing expedition for material to use in his longstanding campaign against the prime minister of Cambodia.” Bloomberg Advertisement Around the Water Cooler\nFacebook Downvoting\nFacebook’s experiment with letting users downvote and upvote comments, Reddit-style, seems to be expanding. The company first started testing the feature almost three months ago, but now the experiment appears to have grown to take in some users in Australia and New Zealand. Downvoting might provide a way to allow participants in a Facebook conversation to collectively moderate the discussion, without introducing a potentially aggressive “dislike” reaction feature. CNET\nChinese Censorship\nThe Chinese government’s online censorship doesn’t just hurt foreign companies—it’s a burden on domestic firms, too. As the Financial Times notes, the content crackdown has forced China’s biggest news aggregator to suspend its mobile app. Zhang Yiming, the founder of Junri Toutiao, said the app had “walked the wrong path” and the company “did not realize that technology must be guided by socialist core values.” FT\nHyperloop Competition\nHyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) and Virgin Hyperloop One are duking it out in the Middle East. HTT, which lays claim to the brand name “hyperloop”—a futuristic transport system that essentially involves sucking people through a vacuum tube at high speed—says it is “building the first commercial line in Abu Dhabi.” Virgin boss Richard Branson says his company will have a hyperloop operational in two to three years. CNBC\nLarry Harvey\nLarry Harvey, the founder of the Burning Man festival, has died at the age of 70 after suffering a stroke earlier this month. Harvey kicked off the festival in 1986, when he and about a dozen others burned a wooden man on a San Francisco beach. Today, the festival draws tens of thousands to the Nevada desert, among them many top tech executives. Fortune\nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer .
