Under the deal, Intesa will also sell some 10 billion euros in bad debts at around 30 percent of their book value.\nA spokesman for Intrum referred to the company’s statement in January which first revealed talks with Intesa were ongoing.\nIntrum’s Managing Director for Italy Antonella Pagano said last week the negotiation had entered an “intense phase.” (Reporting by Valentina Za and Gianluca Semeraro,)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T21:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:40:21.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
