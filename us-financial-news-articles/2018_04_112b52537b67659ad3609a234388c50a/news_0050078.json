REUTERS/Phil Noble \nShares of the company fell nearly 8 percent to $76.01 before the bell and were set to open at their lowest since December 2016 after the company blamed the liquidation of its biggest retail customer and unsold inventory for the drop in revenue. \nHasbro had warned in February that much of the Toys ‘R’ Us impact would be felt in the first two quarters of the year and peer Mattel ( MAT.O ) added to the sense of crisis in the sector by appointing its fourth chief executive in three years last week. \nThe toy industry’s traditional players have been undone in recent years by a shift towards thousands of rival, smaller producers selling on Amazon and other e-commerce sites as well as kids picking electronic games over physical toys.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nMattel, which reports on the first quarter on Thursday, also saw its shares drop another 5 percent after the Hasbro results. \n“We are working to put the near-term disruption from Toys’R’ Us behind us,” Hasbro Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said. \n“Our global retailers view this as an opportunity in a key consumer category and are partnering with Hasbro to develop growth plans for our brands.” \nNet revenue in Europe, a region where Hasbro struggled to clear excess inventory and suffered due to the liquidation of the UK Toys ‘R’ Us operation, fell 28 percent. \nExcluding certain items, Hasbro earned 10 cents per share, compared to analysts’ estimate of 33 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, its first miss in at least two years. \nThe net loss attributable to the company was $112.5 million, or 90 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 1, compared with a profit of $68.6 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. \nThe company’s revenue fell 16 percent to $716.3 million, missing analyst’s estimate of $814 million.
