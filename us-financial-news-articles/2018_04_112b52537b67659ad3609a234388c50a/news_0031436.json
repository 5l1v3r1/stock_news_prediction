I would request the Indian government to boycott the Games.” \nSingh wants to take up the issue with International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, who is scheduled to arrive in Delhi later on Wednesday. \nSports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, a double trap silver medallist at the 2004 Athens Olympics, has also written to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) requesting a review of the decision. \nMore than 56,000 people have signed a petition asking CGF to reinstate shooting at the Birmingham Games.
