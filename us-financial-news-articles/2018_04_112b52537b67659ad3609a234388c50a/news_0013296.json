China's commerce ministry said it would \"fight back with a major response \" if provoked.\nEarlier in the year, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imported solar panels , as well as steel and aluminum imports. \nChina, in turn, implemented additional tariffs on 128 U.S. products, including fruit and pork, in response to the Trump administration's decision to impose duties on steel and aluminum. It also announced extra tariffs on 106 U.S. products last week, although no start date was given for those measures. \nTrump said in a tweet on Sunday that China will remove trade barriers as that was the \"right thing to do.\" The president also expressed optimism that the countries would strike a deal on intellectual property. \nMarkets have been on edge over elevated trade rhetoric between the two countries possibly resulting in a potential trade war, which would be a negative for global economic growth.\nSome analysts, however, were more sanguine about an agreement eventually being brokered as threats from the Trump administration were seen as part of its negotiation tactics.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
