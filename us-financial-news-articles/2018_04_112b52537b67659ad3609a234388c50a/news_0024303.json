If done soon, the waiver could be in effect in time for the 2018 summer driving season.\nEPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not comment on the E15 waiver but said that during Trump’s meeting Monday he “instructed his Cabinet to continue to explore options that protect American farmers and America’s refinery workers.”\nBiofuels proponents have heaped pressure on the White House after reports that the EPA was granting dozens of small refineries exemptions from the RFS to help them avoid the costs of compliance, something the ethanol industry says will weaken demand for their product.\nOn Monday, Trump acknowledged farmers may bear the brunt of the economic harm if China retaliates against Washington’s threat of tariffs, noting that “we’ll make it up to them”. Many U.S. farmers are battling debt after years of excess global supplies and depressed prices.\n“We need some good news out here,” said Monte Shaw, the Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.\n“The best news (Trump) could give us right now is year-round sales of E15,” he said.
