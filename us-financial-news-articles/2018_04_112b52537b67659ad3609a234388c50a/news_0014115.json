I know 63 is the course record, 62 is the lowest-ever in a major. \n“(I was) not particularly nervous, just kind of having a good time and obviously didn’t do it, but it was fun.” \nCasey’s round was highlighted by a brilliant run as he picked up six strokes in five holes from the 11th. \nThe former world number three came into the Masters in sizzling form after his one-stroke win over Patrick Reed and Tiger Woods at the Valspar Championship in March. \nHe made the cut with nothing to spare on Friday after rounds of 74 and 75, but added a 69 and 65 over the weekend in a massive transformation. \n“It shows you anything can happen in golf. You think you just scrape through the cut and kind of pop up on the leaderboard, kind of cool,” Casey said. \n“It was a bit of a disappointing week through Friday and it turned out to be one of my certainly more enjoyable experiences because of what happened on the weekend.” (Reporting by Andrew Both Editing by Ian Chadband)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T01:03:17.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
