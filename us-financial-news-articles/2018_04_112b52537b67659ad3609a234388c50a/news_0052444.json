We see a very big evolution,” he said.\nThemelin estimates that this 50 percent threshold can be achieved by the beginning of the next decade, compared to 30 percent five years ago and 40 percent last year.\nMersen is also in talks about an acquisition in power electronics that could be concluded in the coming months.\nThe company said it had posted 11 percent like-for-like growth in first quarter sales supported by an exceptional performance in Asia and a robust contribution from renewable energies, electronics, and aeronautics, with nearly 50 percent growth in solar.
