(NYSE: BMI) announced that Kenneth Bockhorst has been promoted to president, effective immediately. Richard Meeusen will continue to serve as chairman and chief executive officer of the company. In addition, today its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share to shareholders of record on May 31, 2018, payable June 15, 2018. This is the same amount voted in the previous quarter.\n“Ken’s leadership at Badger Meter has been a positive force since his first day on the job,” said Richard A. Meeusen, chairman and chief executive officer of Badger Meter. “His deep and diverse experience in global manufacturing, product development and continuous improvement have proven to be a tremendous asset to our company, colleagues and customers. I look forward to continuing to partner with Ken as he effectively influences our strategic growth, both domestically and internationally.”\nBockhorst joined Badger Meter in October 2017 as chief operating officer, overseeing the company’s municipal water and flow instrumentation manufacturing, engineering, sales and marketing and acquisition activities. Previously, he served as executive vice president of the energy segment of Actuant Corporation (NYSE: ATU), a $1.1 billion diversified industrial company with operations in more than 30 countries.\n“Since joining Badger Meter, I have been impressed by the experience of our team, the sophistication of our products and operations and our strong financial position, which together have positioned us to grow both organically and, when strategically appropriate, through acquisition,” said Bockhorst. “I’m thrilled to be part of this great organization and look forward to continuing to work with the team to shape the future of water conservation, consumption and process control.”\nAs previously announced, one member of the board of directors did not stand for re-election at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting, held today. As planned, the board decreased the number of directors constituting the board by one to a total of eight, with seven members serving as independent directors, effective today.\nAbout Badger Meter\nBadger Meter is an innovator in flow measurement, control and communications solutions, serving water utilities, municipalities, and commercial and industrial customers worldwide.
