It wasn’t the only German city seeing explosive property rate inflation either: Hamburg, Munich, and Frankfurt also landed in the top 10. \nThe Turkish city of İzmir, where property rates jumped 18.5% last year, came in second behind Berlin, followed by Reykjavik, Iceland (16.6%). Vancouver, Canada (16.0%), Hong Kong (14.8%), and Budapest, Hungary (15.5%) rounded out the list’s top five. \nIn the U.S., average property prices rose 6.3%, with rates rising in Seattle (number 12 overall) and Francisco (27) by 12.7% and 9.3% respectively. \nBerlin’s property prices have prompted warnings of a market bubble. In February, the German central bank warned that property rates in German urban centers may be overvalued by as much as 15%, and 35% in Berlin, Reuters reported.
