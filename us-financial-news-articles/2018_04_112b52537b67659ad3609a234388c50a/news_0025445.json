This effectively curtails operations over water or remote areas. \nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) will also order increased inspections of affected engines in line with actions outlined by Rolls-Royce. \nEarlier on Friday, Rolls Royce warned it would require more money and more inspections to fix problems with Trent 1000 engines on Boeing 787 Dreamliner planes, leading to further disruption for airlines.
