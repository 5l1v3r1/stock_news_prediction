Postpaid connections jumped 10.9 percent from the year before, while prepaid fell 6.4 percent.\nThe company expanded its fiber-to-home high-speed broadband network, increasing connections by 47 percent in annual terms.\nThat helped average revenue per user (ARPU) climb by healthy margins in the broadband and data segments, though an ARPU decrease in the company’s voice segment held back gains.\nTotal operational costs fell 1.2 percent from the same period a year before. But a noticeable increase in some segments, such personnel, limited overall savings.
