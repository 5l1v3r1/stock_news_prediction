Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 25, 2018 The start of the race REUTERS/Brandon Malone/File Photo \nLiberty Media, who took over in January last year, met team bosses and the governing FIA at the Sakhir circuit ahead of Friday’s opening practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix. \nThere was no immediate response from reigning champions Mercedes and Ferrari, the biggest and wealthiest teams who have expressed concern in recent months about where the sport is heading. \nFerrari, who enjoy special financial privileges and a veto on rules, have warned repeatedly that they could walk away if they did not like what was on offer. \n“The teams have to digest the proposals that we’ve made,” Formula One’s managing director of motorsport Ross Brawn, a former Ferrari technical director and ex-Mercedes team principal, told Reuters. \n“I think they were all accepted in good spirit,” he said. \n“There’s no doubt there will be different opinions. I think everyone, all the teams, is pleased to see the landscape laid out completely on some key elements.” \nFormula One said future engines needed to be “cheaper, simpler, louder, have more power and reduce the necessity of grid penalties.” \nThey must also remain road relevant for manufacturers, and hybrid, with the rules making it attractive for any new entrants.

Governance of the sport also needed to be simple and streamlined. \n“We are driven by one desire: to create the world’s leading sporting brand,” said Formula One chairman Chase Carey. \n“Fan-centered, commercially successful, profitable for our teams, and with technological innovation at its heart.” Editing by Alan Baldwin and Christian Radnedge", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T14:39:28.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
