Because of the smell of weed and stale urine - it’s just like being in the projects. What would really make me feel at home, if somebody spray painted graffiti on my star.” \nMorgan, who stars in the new Time Warner Inc-owned ( TWX.N ) TBS comedy “The Last O.G.” with Tiffany Haddish, was introduced by Oscar winner Jordan Peele and comedian Martin Lawrence, who gave Morgan his first break in 1994 on his TV comedy series “Martin” Slideshow (12 Images) \n“The Last O.G.” is Morgan’s first big step back into Hollywood after he was seriously injured in 2014 when a Wal-Mart truck crashed into his limousine on the New Jersey Turnpike killing his friend, the comedian James McNair. \n“He’s been through so many things and he’s come out with an outlook on life that is absolutely beautiful,” Peele told the assembled crowd. \n“He’ll take you all over the map in a conversation with him,” Peele added. “You’ll be laughing one second, you’ll be crying the next second. He’ll have you thinking one second and then he’ll say something so stupid it’s just funny the next second.” \nThe Hollywood Walk of Fame is administered by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
