Advantest Corp soared 3.4 percent, silicon maker Sumco Corp surged 4.4 percent and semiconductor equipment maker Screen Holdings advanced 3.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix added 0.2 percent to 1,771.98.\nEditing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T06:09:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
