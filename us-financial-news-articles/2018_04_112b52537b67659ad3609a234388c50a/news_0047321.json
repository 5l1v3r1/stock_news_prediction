Whatever you plan to do on this special occasion, enjoy!\nThe Great Gig in the Sky A big media-merger theme for the newsletter today. This is just in: Comcast has made formal its £12.50-per-share all-cash bid for Sky , which would value the European pay-TV operator and broadcaster at £22 billion ($31 billion). The thinking is that Comcast can use Sky’s 23 million retail customers to expand its international footprint and invest more in original and acquired content. In response, Sky’s independent committee is withdrawing its recommendation for 21st Century Fox’s December bid for the 61% of Sky it does not already own. Your move, Fox and Disney (which itself has made a $66 billion bid to acquire key Fox entertainment assets). Fox said Wednesday it remained committed to buying all of Sky. What’s more, the WSJ reports that Comcast is “weighing whether to play interloper” on Disney’s pending deal to acquire those Fox assets, according to people familiar with the situation. It’s never simple, is it? (Reminder: The Wall Street Journal’s parent company News Corp and 21st Century Fox share common ownership.) Comcast’s Sky bid came on the same day it reported 21% profit growth for its first quarter, compared with the year-earlier period. Revenue at the NBCUniversal unit increased 21% to $9.5 billion, for which Comcast credited its broadcasts of the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl.\nWhat About Bob? “Bob’s a special kind of friend. The kind that drives you crazy!” is the tagline from the classic ‘90s Bill Murray movie, “What About Bob”: Which leads us nicely to the WSJ’s Keach Hagey and Joe Flint’s behind-the-scenes look at the key question holding up the proposed Viacom-CBS deal: What role will Viacom Chief Executive Bob Bakish take on in the combined company ? Shari Redstone, president of National Amusements, which controls both companies, doesn’t think there’s a chance of a deal without a senior role for Mr. Bakish. But CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves wants his current COO, Joe Ianniello, as his top lieutenant. Mr. Ianniello wants that, too: Make sure you read the testy over-dinner exchange between the trio detailed in the article when Mr. Bakish suggested he should be the company’s president. Sources say CBS is also concerned that Mr. Bakish could be a proxy for Ms. Redstone to influence the media assets her family controls. To that end, people familiar with the matter say Ms. Redstone has already begun interviewing potential new CBS board members, which could make it easier to oust Mr. Moonves.\n—Not-So-Silent Bob—\nViacom reported its second-quarter earnings this morning . The company reported better-than-expected profit and said it’s on track to make more than $100 million in cost savings in fiscal 2018. Overall revenue fell 3% to $3.1 billion as the company’s filmed entertainment unit’s 17% drop in revenue dragged down on the 1% growth posted by the media networks division. The earnings call takes place just after I press “send” on this newsletter, where we’ll be hearing from Bob himself, who’ll likely receive lots of merger-related questions from analysts.\nLight Reading WPP’s new co-COO Mark Read has given his first interview since taking that role after the abrupt departure of Martin Sorrell earlier this month. Speaking to the Financial Times, the former Wunderman boss said he’s thrown his hat in the ring for WPP’s top job: “I assume I’ll be considered.” Elsewhere, Mr. Read addressed the chorus of voices calling for WPP to be broken up, saying it “doesn’t make sense” when clients want more integrated services. Nevertheless, he let the possibility of a breakup linger, “If someone could explain to us how breaking up would create shareholder value then we would look at that,” he added. (For what it’s worth, analysts have said the sale of market-research unit Kantar would raise around $5 billion, which WPP could use to reduce debt or return cash to shareholders.) Elsewhere, clients don’t seem unnerved by Mr. Sorrell’s exit, according to Mr. Read, who said, “Not one client has said to me that, despite being sad to see Martin go, they will make any change to how they work with WPP.”\nBolloré Held The ad industry is awash with concerns, conjecture and allegations about non-transparent practices. Headlines out of France on Tuesday won’t help matters. As Le Monde newspaper first reported, French police detained billionaire Vincent Bolloré for questioning Tuesday as part of a probe on how his holding company Bolloré Group won port concessions in two African countries nearly a decade ago. What’s that got to do with advertising? A person familiar with the matter said the investigation stems from a complaint that Havas, a subsidiary of Bolloré Group at the time (now owned by Vivendi in which Bolloré Group has more than a 20% stake), worked on political campaigns in Guinea and Togo at below-market prices. In return, the person said, Bolloré Group is alleged to have won contracts to run container terminals in Conakry, Guinea, and Lomé, Togo. In a statement, Bolloré Group said, “The contracts pertaining to these billings were carried out with total transparency,” adding the company is “happy to cooperate with the investigation to set the record straight.”\nBest of the rest Coca-Cola says its revamp of Diet Coke—which included four new flavors, a packaging makeover and a big marketing campaign—helped the brand post its first quarter of volume growth since 2010. [ WSJ ]\nOracle’s Data Cloud division has acquired Grapeshot, a U.K.-based ad-tech company that focuses on brand safety and contextual targeting. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. [ TechCrunch ]\nBloomberg is reportedly set to start charging readers to access stories on Bloomberg.com. [ Business Insider ]\nTwitter’s first-quarter revenue and earnings beat analysts’ expectations. The company credited growth across all its major products and geographies, including another quarter of double-digit year-over-year daily active user growth. [ CNBC ]\nFacebook published its content removal policies for the first time and is allowing people to appeal takedown decisions. [ Bloomberg ]\nSpeaking after reporting earnings Tuesday, Verizon finance chief Matt Ellis acknowledged the company had looked at potential acquisitions but said it wasn’t likely to make media deals any time soon. Revenue at Oath, the company’s advertising and content unit, decreased sequentially by 13% from the fourth quarter to the first, which the company said was due to seasonally lower display ad volumes. [ WSJ ]\nSearch-marketing firm SEMrush raised $40 million to expand its operations. The round was co-led by venture-capital firms Greycroft, e.ventures and Siguler Guff. [ CMO Today ]\nSpotify announced a new mobile version of its ad-supported, free service that will allow users to access many features of the company’s paid version.
