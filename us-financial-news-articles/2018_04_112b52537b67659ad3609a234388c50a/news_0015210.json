This can be inspired by the CETA (Canada-EU free trade agreement) or Japan FTA (free trade agreement) provisions, but this will need to go further. It should prevent any reduction of the key pre-Brexit standards.” \nBarnier said that without such a legal safeguard, Britain could decide to reduce its environmental protection standards to gain competitive advantage in trade. \nThis would not only increase pollution and environmentally harmful production in Britain, but also raise pollution for Britain’s neighbors. \n“Reduced UK ambition on air pollution could result in neighboring states (Ireland, Belgium, France the Netherlands) needing up to 9 percent more effort to reach their clean air objectives – with significant additional costs,” he said. \nBarnier noted that British   assured the EU London would not engage in a race to the bottom in environmental protection and that her words were reflected in Britain’s proposed 25-year plan on the environment. \n“This is welcome, but my responsibility as the EU negotiator is to remain extremely vigilant,” he said.
