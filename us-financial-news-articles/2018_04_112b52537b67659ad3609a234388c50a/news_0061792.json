This, in combination with her knowledge of the capital markets, and the unique operational and accounting challenges inherent to the construction industry, makes her an ideal choice for our Board of Directors.\n“Over time we have worked to develop a team of top-shelf level executives that bring to the Company’s Board of Directors an extensive background and knowledge of the industry, capital markets experience and whose attributes will contribute greatly to the overall growth and expansion of our business. Laurel adds further depth to our board, following our latest appointee, Mike McNally, former CEO of Skanska USA, who joined the Company’s Board of Directors last September and whose leadership skills are already a valuable resource for the Company.
