Farmers shareholders will be entitled to receive 1.053 shares of WesBanco common stock and cash in the amount of $5.00 per share for each share of Farmers common stock for a total value of approximately $378.2 million in aggregate based on WesBanco's market close price of $43.03 on April 18, 2018.

Clossin, President and Chief Executive Officer of WesBanco, stated, \"The merger with Farmers significantly expands WesBanco's existing franchise within Kentucky, and bridges the gap between our Louisville-Southern Indiana and our recently enhanced Southeast Ohio-Huntington, West Virginia markets. In addition to gaining entry into the Frankfort, Kentucky MSA with top market share, the merger with Farmers will enhance our presence in several major metropolitan markets with attractive demographics, which is consistent with our stated long-term growth strategy. In addition, Farmers has a solid trust and investment business with approximately $560 million of trust assets that will provide a very nice platform upon which to grow our wealth management business throughout Kentucky. We believe we can provide customers of Farmers with a broader array of banking services, including expanded commercial and mortgage lending capabilities as well as enhanced wealth management solutions.\"\nExcluding certain one-time merger charges, the transaction is anticipated to be approximately 3% accretive to earnings in 2019, and approximately 5% accretive to earnings in 2020 once anticipated cost savings are fully phased-in. Estimated tangible book value dilution at closing of approximately 2.1% is expected to be earned back in approximately 2.4 years using the \"cross-over\" method, including estimated pre-tax merger-related charges of $22.3 million. The acquisition is subject to the approvals of the appropriate regulatory authorities and the approval by the shareholders of Farmers. It is expected that the transaction should be completed during the second half of 2018.\n\"Farmers is a strong performing, community-based financial institution with low cost deposits that shares our commitment to client service and community banking. We are pleased to be able to partner with Farmers and continue to build on the solid platform that has been created,\" said WesBanco Chairman of the Board, James C.

In addition, I look forward to continuing my relationship as Chairman of the Central & Southern Kentucky market advisory board for WesBanco, which will be comprised of the current board members of Farmers to help ensure a smooth transition in the local market.\"\n\"Through our partnership with WesBanco, we will be in a much stronger position to deliver additional value to our customers, employees, and shareholders as we maintain our commitment to the communities we serve,\" said Mr. Bennett, Farmers Chairman of the Board.\nAt March 31, 2018, WesBanco had consolidated assets of approximately $10.2 billion, deposits of $7.2 billion, loans of $6.3 billion, and shareholders' equity of $1.4 billion.\nAt March 31, 2018, Farmers had consolidated assets of approximately $1.7 billion, deposits of $1.4 billion, loans of $1.0 billion, and shareholders' equity of $0.2 billion.\nWhen the transaction is consummated, WesBanco will have approximately $12.8 billion in total assets and will provide banking and financial services through 211 financial centers in five states, including the recent acquisition of First Sentry Bancshares in Huntington, WV.
