The car failed to stop after the incident.\n“At this time we have not ruled in or out the potential that this could be terror-related but we’re keeping an open mind until we have investigated further,” said Detective Inspector Greg Evans.\n“The investigation is at an early stage and we’re still trying to establish exactly what has happened,” he added.\nThe incident happened in the Aston area of the city on Friday afternoon.
