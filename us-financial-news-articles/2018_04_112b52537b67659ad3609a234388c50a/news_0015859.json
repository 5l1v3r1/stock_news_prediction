BTPs (fixed-rate state-issued bonds) have done well over the past few weeks. We expect to remain fairly neutral,” he said. \nSince the national elections more than a month ago, Italy’s parties have not been able to form a coalition government. Another round of formal talks with the president are due this week. \nFinancial markets have so far shown little alarm about the prospect of prolonged political stalemate, one of the euro zone’s most heavily indebted nations.
