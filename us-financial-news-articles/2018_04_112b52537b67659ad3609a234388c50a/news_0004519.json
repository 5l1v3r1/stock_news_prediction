(together with its affiliates, \"Engine\"), a shareholder of Navigant Consulting, Inc. (\"NCI\" or, the \"Company\") (NYSE: NCI), with an ownership of approximately 4.4% of the Company, today issued a statement regarding the Company's apparent delay in taking the steps to schedule and hold its 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\").\nArnaud Ajdler, Managing Member of Engine Capital, said, \"We are deeply concerned that Navigant may be seeking to delay holding its Annual Meeting, as the Company has yet to provide public notice of the record date or meeting date. Historically, the Company has held its annual meetings in mid-May going back to 2012, with a corresponding record date between March 25th and March 31st. Navigant set a record date of March 30, 2017 for last year's \"virtual-only\" annual shareholder meeting through a notification to Broadridge Financial Solutions on or around January 24, 2017. As of today, more than two months after the one-year anniversary of its notification to Broadridge of the 2017 record date, we understand that the Company has yet to provide Broadridge with notice of its 2018 record date. At this stage, given the SEC requirement that Navigant provide 20 business days' advance notice of the record date to banks and brokers, we believe the earliest the Company could possibly set the record date under applicable SEC and NYSE rules would be in May. We are troubled by this development and hope the Company is not delaying its annual meeting in an attempt to improperly perpetuate the status quo.\"\nMr. Ajdler continued, \"We remain open to a constructive dialogue with the Company in order to avoid a proxy contest, but rather than engage with us, the Board has rejected our settlement offers out of hand and now appears to be delaying the shareholder vote on directors. We urge the Board not to pursue entrenchment tactics, such as delaying the annual meeting or seeking to unilaterally add self-selected directors in an effort to reactively appease other shareholders and avoid real change. We remain confident that our slate of highly qualified director candidates would, if elected, revitalize the Board and help put the Company on the right path towards delivering long-term shareholder value. We call on the Company to announce its 2018 Annual Meeting date without further delay.\"\nABOUT ENGINE CAPITAL\nEngine Capital is a value-oriented special situations fund that invests both actively and passively in companies undergoing change.\nInvestor contacts :\nEngine Capital, L.P.\nArnaud Ajdler\n(212) 321-0048\naajdler@enginecap.com\nJohn Ferguson\nSaratoga Proxy Consulting LLC\n(212) 257-1311\njferguson@saratogaproxy.com\nCERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THE PARTICIPANTS\nEngine Capital, L.P.
