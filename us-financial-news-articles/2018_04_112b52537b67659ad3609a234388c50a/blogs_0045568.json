Goldman Sachs , however, has come to the maligned active managers’ defense, arguing they are actually rather good stock-pickers.\nAnalysts at the investment bank said in a 36-page report that two important factors have concealed the stock-picking skills of mutual fund managers. First, mutual funds have to keep a certain percentage of their assets in cash so that they can meet potential demand for redemptions; that has dragged returns down when the market has been going up. Also, mutual fund returns include fees, which have averaged around 100 basis points per year since 1990.\nExcluding both the fees and the cash drag, Goldman said mutual funds would have outperformed the S&P 500 by 82 basis points per year since 1990. They still would have outperformed the market by 22 basis points annually if only fees were excluded.\nBut here comes the problem: investors don’t really care if fund managers are good stock pickers if they don’t get to share the benefits. The high fees have more than wiped out whatever outperformance the fund managers achieved.\nSome relief could be on the horizon: fees are coming down. The average expense ratio for large-cap mutual funds was 0.8% in 2017 versus 1.3% in 1990, according to Goldman. If the trend continues, mutual fund investors may soon be able to get a fair return on the money they have paid.\nShare this: Mutual Funds Overheard Previous WSJ City: Barclays CEO Fined but Keeps Job, Don't Worry About a Recession (Yet) Next WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Retirement, Cryptocurrency, Weird LA Museums", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T11:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T10:42:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
