The person is showing no symptoms.” \nNeither organization gave any more information about the lab worker or the accident. \nOKI said there was no threat to co-workers or the public. \nMore than 11,300 people died in total during the worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease, which mainly affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2013 to 2016.
