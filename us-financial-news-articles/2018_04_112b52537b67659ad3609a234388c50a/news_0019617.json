The office is located at One Riverway, Houston, TX 77056.\n“The CAP team is excited to welcome Chris as we further broaden our geographic reach and industry coverage,” said Margaret Engel, Founding Partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. “As the center of the U.S. energy industry and the country’s fourth largest city, Houston offers a broad industrial base and serves as headquarters for many Fortune 500 companies. This represents an incredible opportunity for Chris to leverage his expertise and CAP’s capabilities, brand and outstanding staff to provide excellent service throughout the region. In addition, I will be spending part of my time in Texas and Oklahoma to support Chris and enable CAP to service companies in the western states as effectively as possible.”\n“As the oil & gas industry recovers from one of its worst downturns in history, companies should be taking the opportunity to review relative pay levels and recalibrate incentive plans for 2018 and 2019,” said Mr. Earnest. “I’m thrilled to bring my industry expertise to CAP and look forward to spearheading the firm’s expansion into the region with Margaret. A significant focus on the energy industry comes with the territory, but the firm also plans to leverage our combined experience across the increasingly diverse market including manufacturing, technology, and retail.”\nChris brings to CAP more than a decade of experience as an executive compensation consultant primarily serving the oil and gas industry from Houston. His focus has been on the assessment and development of executive compensation programs, executive contracts, incentive plan design, board of director compensation, and compensation disclosure pursuant to SEC rules and guidelines. His experience also includes IPO-related compensation issues and he has testified as a designated compensation expert in the Southern District of Texas in bankruptcy related proceedings. Chris holds both a Juris Doctorate and a Master’s in Business Administration from the University of Tulsa. He is an active member in the Houston and Austin Chapters of the National Association of Corporate Directors (NACD) and the Houston Bar Association.\nAbout Compensation Advisory Partners\nCompensation Advisory Partners (CAP) is an independent executive compensation consulting firm specializing in executive and director compensation and related corporate governance matters.
