Pot stocks have soared in the last year. Shares of Aurora Cannabis, a Canadian producer of medical cannabis, are up nearly 240 percent in the last 12 months. Cronos Group is also up nearly 240 percent in the same period. And the stock of medical marijuana company Canopy Growth has gained more 200 percent in the last year. \nThe total U.S. cannabis industry is worth about $50 billion right now and will reach $75 billion by 2030, Azer said. \n\"It's just that a lot of it is going through the black market right now,\" she said. \nThe good news, she said, is that, \"the industry is gaining a lot of traction in terms of gaining consumer support.\"\nAccording to an October 2017 Gallup poll , 64 percent of U.S. adults are in favor of legalizing adult use cannabis â€” the highest level of support in five decades. \nAzer said her firm remains bullish on cannabis and cautious on beer stocks, as she suspects the trend will continue.\n\"About 80 percent of consumers do report some kind of reduction in alcohol consumption when they're also engaging in cannabis consumption,\" Azer said. \nThe top cannabis stocks she expects to outperform are Canopy Growth, the pharmaceutical company MedReleaf and Kush Bottles, a medical wholesaler. \n\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T20:11:58.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
