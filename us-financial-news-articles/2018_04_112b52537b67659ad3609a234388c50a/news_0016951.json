Some brought folding chairs, while others stood or sat on the floor. \nOutside the Capitol Building, which houses Congress, online protest group Avaaz set up 100 life-sized cutouts of Zuckerberg wearing T-shirts with the words ‘Fix Facebook’ on them. \nZuckerberg, who founded Facebook in his Harvard University dorm room in 2004, is fighting to demonstrate to critics that he is the right person to go on leading what has grown into one of the world’s largest companies. \nFacebook faces a growing crisis of confidence among users, advertisers, employees and investors after acknowledging that up to 87 million people, mostly in the United States, had their personal information harvested from the site by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign among its clients. \nZuckerberg, who has never testified in a congressional hearing, said in written testimony on Monday that he had made mistakes and had held too narrow a view of the social network’s role in society. \n“Now we have to go through every part of our relationship with people and make sure we’re taking a broad enough view of our responsibility,” he said. \nFacebook hired several outside consultants to help coach Zuckerberg, even holding mock sessions to prepare him for questions from lawmakers. \nIn an olive branch on Friday, Zuckerberg threw his support behind proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads. Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) also said on Tuesday, for the first time, that it supports the bill, called the Honest Ads Act. \nU.S. lawmakers have discussed legislation that would strengthen data privacy protections and enforcement. Tighter regulation of how Facebook uses its members’ data could affect its ability to attract advertising revenue, its lifeblood.

On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a member of the Judiciary committee, complained via Twitter about fake profiles. \n“On today of all days, I just found out that there are two fake Facebook accounts impersonating me, and guess what? Many of the ‘friends’ appear to be Russian accounts,” he tweeted. “@facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg-this is unacceptable.” \nZuckerberg will get a second dose of questioning on Wednesday from the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. \nHis perch atop Facebook is assured as long as he wants it, given that he remains its controlling shareholder. \nBut his reputation has suffered as television comedians have mocked his perceived robotic speaking patterns and allegedly cavalier attitude toward privacy. \nShares in Facebook are down more than 14 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last month.
