(NYSE: CCO) (the “Company”) announced today that the Company will be delayed in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the “Form 10-K”) beyond the extended deadline of April 2, 2018. As previously disclosed, the Company’s delay in filing the Form 10-K is due to the ongoing special investigation regarding the misappropriation of funds by employees of Clear Media Limited, an indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose ordinary shares are listed but suspended from trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and other matters discovered during the course of the special investigation. In light of the ongoing procedures being undertaken in connection with the special investigation, the Company was unable to file the Form 10-K by April 2, 2018. The Company will file the Form 10-K as soon as practicable.\nAs a result, the Company has received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) that the Company is not in compliance with the NYSE’s continued listing requirements under the timely filing criteria. The NYSE informed the Company that, under the NYSE’s rules, the Company will have six months from April 3, 2018 to file the Form 10-K with the SEC. The Company can regain compliance with the NYSE listing standards before that date by filing the Form 10-K with the SEC.\nAbout Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.\nClear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. is one of the world’s largest outdoor advertising companies, with over 580,000 displays in 31 countries across four continents, including 43 of the 50 largest markets in the United States.
