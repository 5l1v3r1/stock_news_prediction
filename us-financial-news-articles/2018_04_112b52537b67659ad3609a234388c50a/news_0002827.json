A man walks past a newly-opened Sharjah Islamic Bank branch on Sheikh Zayed road in Dubai January 11, 2012. REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh \nThe Islamic bonds will be of benchmark size, which normally means upwards of $500 million (Â£355.6 million), and are expected to have a five-year tenor. \nThe notes will be issued over the next few weeks, and the sale could be announced as soon as this week, depending on market conditions. \nThe bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nHSBC and Standard Chartered are global coordinators for the planned deal, but other banks will join as arrangers, said one of the sources. \nSharjah Islamic Bank has $500 million in outstanding sukuk, issued in 2013, that matures this month. It has sold two additional international sukuk of $500 million each in 2015 and 2016, both with five-year maturities.
