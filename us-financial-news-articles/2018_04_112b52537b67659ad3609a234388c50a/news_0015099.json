He said the driver's identity was not yet known and that it was too early to speculate about his motive.\nHe said police were checking witness reports that other perpetrators might have fled from the van at the scene of the crash.\nPolice tweeted that residents should \"avoid the area near the Kiepenkerl pub\" in the city's historic downtown area where a large-scale police operation was underway.\nBode said six of the 20 injured were in severe condition. The city's university hospital called on citizens to donate blood Saturday night to help them.\nPolice also said they found a suspicious object in the van that they were examining to see if it is dangerous. They told German news agency dpa that was the reason authorities cordoned off such a large area around the crash, which took place at 3:27 p.m. on a warm spring day.\nThe Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper also said the suspect's apartment was being searched Saturday night for possible explosives.\nMuenster, a major university city, has about 300,000 residents and an attractive city center rebuilt after World War II.\nGerman news Television n-tv showed a narrow street sealed off Saturday with red-and-white police tape. Dozens of ambulances were near the cordoned-off downtown area. Helicopters were flying overhead.\nThe Kiepenkerl is not only one of the city's best-known traditional pubs, but also the emblem of the city, depicting a traveling salesman with a long pipe in his mouth and a big backpack on his back.\nGermany's top security official said he's \"dismayed by the terrible incident in Muenster\" and that city and regional police were working hard to clear up what happened. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said federal authorities were in close contact with officials in North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Muenster is located.\nLino Baldi, who owns an Italian restaurant in Muenster near the scene of the crash, told Sky TG24 that the city center was packed due to a Saturday market and summer-like temperatures, which had risen to 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) from just 12 degrees (low 50s) a day earlier.\nGerman President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his thoughts are with the victims and relatives of the crash in Muenster.\n\"We have to assume this was a serious act of violence,\" he said. \"My deep sympathy goes to all those who have lost a loved one.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T18:10:18.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
