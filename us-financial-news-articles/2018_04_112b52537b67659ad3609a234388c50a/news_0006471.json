REUTERS/Erik De Castro Trump agreed in a National Security Council meeting this week to keep U.S. troops in Syria a little longer to defeat Islamic State but wants them out relatively soon, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.\nTrump had signaled his desire to get U.S. forces out of Syria in a speech last week, and officials said he had privately been pressing for an early withdrawal in talks with his national security aides.\n“We’ve always thought that as we reach finality against ISIS in Syria we’re going to adjust the level of our presence there, so in that sense nothing actually has changed,” Marine Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie told a Pentagon briefing.\nMcKenzie said Trump has not given the U.S. military any timeline.\n“We think as we go forward one of the things that we haven’t been given is a timeline and that is actually very effective... (The) President has actually been very good in not giving us a specific timeline, so that is a tool that we will use to our affect as we move forward,” McKenzie said.\nThe United States is conducting air strikes in Syria and has deployed about 2,000 troops on the ground, including special operations forces whose advice has helped Kurdish militia and other U.S.-backed fighters capture territory from Islamic State, also known as ISIS.\nThe Pentagon and State Department have said a longer term U.S. effort would be needed to ensure that Islamic State’s defeat is a lasting one.\nThe militant group is widely expected to revert to guerrilla tactics once the last remnants of its once self-styled “caliphate” are captured by U.S.-backed forces.\nReporting by Idrees Ali and David Alexander; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T21:35:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
