The wholesale price of basic wine in Italy has gone up 74% over the previous year, 45% in Spain, and more than 10% in France, according to European Commission figures reported by CNNMoney .\nBut the biggest price jump will likely be seen amongst those cheap bottles , as the producers of these wines already have the lowest margins.
