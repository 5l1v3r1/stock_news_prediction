Recent Census figures say women earn, on average, $0.81 for ever dollar men take home . The gap is most often referred to in overarching, nationwide terms, yet the National Partnership for Women & Families has published an interactive map that analyzes the gap state-by-state, presenting its impact in dollar terms that hit closer to home. \nThe map, based on U.S. Census Bureau data, looks at the wage gap for workers in each U.S. state, and breaks it down by race and ethnicity and what women’s lost wages could buy. \nThe state closest to gender pay parity is Florida, where the average woman earns $5,474 less than the average man. New York and California rounded out the top three most equal paid states. You can explore the data here . \nBut disturbing trends exist even in the best-performing states. In California, for instance, Latina women are paid a staggering $41,251 less than men, even though the gender pay gap for all women is just shy of $6,000. If a Latina woman were paid the same as a man, she could afford over four more years of childcare, two and a half years of rent, or 4.3 years at a four-year public university.
