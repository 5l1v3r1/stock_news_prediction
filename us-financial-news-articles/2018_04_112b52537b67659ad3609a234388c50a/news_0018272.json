The procedure accounts for 16 percent of all abortions performed in Kentucky. \n“Kentucky politicians have already shut down all but one abortion clinic in our state,” Michael Aldridge, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky, said in a statement. “Now they want to invade the exam room and stop doctors from providing safe, quality care. It’s shameless, insulting, and dangerous.” \nBevin’s office could not immediately be reached to comment. \nLast year, a similar measure passed by Texas lawmakers was struck down by a federal judge. Similar bans in other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma, have also been struck down by courts. \nLast month, Mississippi’s governor signed into law the most restrictive U.S. abortion measure, banning all abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. However, that state’s only abortion clinic sued to block that law as well. \nSince last year, when Republicans took control of the Kentucky House for the first time since 1921, the state’s legislature has passed several measures to restrict access to abortion, including banning all abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. \nLast year, the ACLU sued to keep the EMW Women’s Surgical Center in Louisville open, and a federal judge struck down a law passed in January 2017 that required women to undergo an ultrasound exam before receiving an abortion. \nAfter the Kentucky General Assembly passed the bill late last month, state Representative Addia Wuchner, its main sponsor, said she was not seeking to prevent a woman’s access to an abortion but to restrict a “brutal and cruel” procedure. \nWhile dilation and evacuation is used in most second-trimester abortions, nearly 90 percent of all abortions are performed in the first trimester, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. \n(This version of the story corrects typo in governor’s name to make it “Bevin” instead of “Bevins” in 3rd and 5th paragraphs) Reporting by Steve Bittenbender; editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T20:30:52.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
