First- quarter core profit was 52.0 million euros.\nThe company’s orders increased by 37.8 percent compared with fourth quarter of 2017, due primarily to capacity additions for smartphone applications, it said.\nIt said analysts expected the assembly equipment market to continue to grow in 2018. It also said VLSI Research revised down its 2018 market growth estimate based on recent announcements by semiconductor manufacturers.\nOn Monday, Apple sensor supplier AMS warned of a slowdown in sales in its second quarter and reported Q1 sales at the lower end of its guidance range\nThe warning came after Taiwan Semiconductor, another big Apple supplier, last week also reported weaker numbers, and adds to signs of strain in the supply chain\nBut Franco-Italian rival STMicroelectronics, which reported results on Wednesday, was upbeat on the second-half.\nReporting by Stratos Karakasidis.
