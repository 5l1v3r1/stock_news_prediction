He also tied a career high with six RBIs for the second time in his career.\nSmoak also was the first Blue Jay with six RBIs against the Yankees since Ernie Whitt on Sept. 12, 1987.\nDevon Travis added an RBI single for the Blue Jays, who salvaged the split of the series by winning the last two games.\nBrandon Drury hit his first home run for the Yankees during a four-run third. Didi Gregorius added an RBI double and Neil Walker contributed a run-scoring single.\nAfter Marcus Stroman allowed four runs and three hits in five innings, four relievers combined on four shutout innings. Tyler Clippard pitched a scoreless eighth to earn the win and Seung Hwan Oh pitched the ninth for the save.\nNew York’s Sonny Gray allowed one run on seven hits in four-plus innings but needed 89 pitches.\nGray struck out the side after putting two on in the first inning, but Toronto took a 1-0 lead with two outs in the second on a base hit by Travis, whose hit occurred after right fielder Aaron Judge threw out Russell Martin at the plate.\nThe Yankees tied the game with two outs in the third when Stanton walked and scored on a double to deep left field by Gregorius. Walker made it 2-1 with a single to left field that easily scored Gregorius.\nDrury made it 4-1 by drilling a 0-2 breaking ball over the left field fence.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:47:57.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
