First-quarter gross profit in the UK fell 7.1 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent decline in the previous quarter.\nThe UK business made up 18 percent of gross profit.\nWith the difficult comparisons and Easter holidays, the company’s UK performance this year is expected to be similar to that of last year, Chief Executive Steve Ingham told Reuters.\nThe company, which finds candidates mainly to fill permanent positions, said gross profit rose 10.3 percent to 187.7 million pounds ($266.4 million) in the first quarter.\nOn a constant currency basis, gross profit grew 12.3 percent.\n“Brexit-related uncertainty continued to impact confidence, particularly within our Michael Page business, which was down 10 percent,” PageGroup said.\nThe company added that it was comfortable with current market consensus for full-year operating profit of 132 million pounds.
