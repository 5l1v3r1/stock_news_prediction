Brands Inc’s KFC to ensure they were not violating employment laws.\nJollibee and KFC Philippines did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nMcDonald’s Philippines does not practice contractualisation and has not used the services of manpower agencies since it started operations in 1981, Adi Timbol-Hernandez, the company’s senior communications manager, said in a statement.\nThe Philippines allows employers to hire workers to meet demand at peak times. These contracts typically span five months to avoid a six-month rule that would require employers to make an employee permanent.\nThe practice is popularly called “endo”, an abbreviation of “end of contract”.\nIn 2011, the labour agency allowed companies to engage contractors to supply workers for short-term jobs, helping spread the practice of “endo” to job-intensive sectors such as retailing and manufacturing.\nTwo-thirds of the country’s 39-40 million workforce are on short-term contracts, according to a 2016 government estimate.\nDuterte had said he wanted to eradicate “endo” by 2017, but it proved a challenge as it required changing the law.
