REUTERS/Rafael Marchante \nFollowing discussion between local authorities, safety teams and the surfers, the organisers decided to restart the competition with added ski and drone presence. \nWright, the WSL champion for the past two seasons, overcame Paige Hareb of New Zealand with a score of 14.73 in round two before advancing past France’s Johanne Defay and Coco Ho of Hawaii in round three with 14.06. \nAt the close of round three, surf conditions deteriorated causing further competition to be postponed, including cancellation of any activity on Tuesday. A reassessment will be made on Wednesday.
