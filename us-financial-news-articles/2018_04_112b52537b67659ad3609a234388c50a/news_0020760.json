Buyers are scrambling to try to replace where they can, to plug the gap left by not having Russian-origin metal,” said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale in London. \n“This seems to be just the start (of rallying prices). Given this is a balanced if not tight market I don’t see how you can easily replace that missing Russian origin material in the short term.” \nThree-month aluminium on the LME surged to a peak of $2,277.50 a tonne, the highest since Jan. 24, closing 2.2 percent higher at $2,250 per tonne. \n* GLENCORE: Trader Glencore, a Rusal shareholder and customer, will declare force majeure on some aluminium supply, a source familiar with the matter said. \n* PREMIUMS: Physical premiums for aluminium deliveries to mainland China from Shanghai Futures Exchange bonded warehouses rose by $5 to $135 a tonne <0#BASEBW-SHMET>. \nIn the United States, the Comex aluminium premium jumped to 20.7 cents a pound ($456 a tonne) from 18.4 cents on Friday, the highest in three years. \n* ALUMINIUM STOCKS: On-warrant LME aluminium inventories, those not earmarked for delivery, rose 6,675 tonnes MALSTX-TOTAL, but more inflows were expected, industry sources said. \n“LME stocks will go up because if you are a financing bank holding Rusal’s metal, you will be looking to cut that exposure,” a source at a commodity trader told Reuters. \n* ALUMINIUM SPREADS: The April LME aluminium contract rose to a premium of $12 a tonne to the three-month futures CMALJ18-3, up from $7.25 on Tuesday and compared to a discount of $15.75 on Friday. \nThe rising premium indicates short supply of nearby material. \n* NICKEL: LME nickel added 1.2 percent to $13,865, as traders worried about a possible knock-on impact from sanctions, since Rusal owns a 28 percent stake in Norilsk Nickel . \n*PRICES: LME copper ended barely changed at $6,950, zinc fell 0.1 percent to $3,239, lead added 0.7 percent to $2,409 and tin rose 0.65 percent to $21,000.
