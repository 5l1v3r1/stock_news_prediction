The European Union condemns in the strongest terms the use of chemical weapons and calls for an immediate response by the international community.”\nThe bloc called on the U.N. Security Council to re-establish its checks to identify perpetrators of chemical attacks and on Russia and Iran to use their influence with Assad to prevent further attacks.\nThe Syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical attack in the town of Douma.
