The official cause of death was a self-administered overdose of the painkiller fentanyl, but no prescriptions were found for the powerful drug that is 50 times stronger than heroin.

At that time, they had not identified who supplied the dose of fentanyl that caused his death or where it came from.

Some of the painkillers found at the residence had prescriptions in the names of other people. \nInvestigators were told that the singer, whose legal name was Prince Rogers Nelson, had a history of going through withdrawals believed to be tied to prescription pain medication abuse, the unsealed documents showed. \nPrince, known for his androgynous style and sexually charged songs, died a day before he was set to meet a California-based doctor who specializes in addiction treatment for a “life-saving mission.” \nAfter his death, his longtime collaborator and protege Sheila E. told “Entertainment Tonight” that Prince had been suffering from hip and knee pain from decades of intense performing, much of it in heels. \nLater in his life, the singer and composer of such hits as “When Doves Cry,”“Little Red Corvette” and “Raspberry Beret,” crafted a public image of living a clean and healthy vegan lifestyle.
