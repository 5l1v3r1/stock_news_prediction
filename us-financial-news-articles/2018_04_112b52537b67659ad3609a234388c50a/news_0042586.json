There have also been numerous arrests. ULTRAS \nLevski condemned Wednesday’s violence in a statement but the club face a potential three-match home stadium ban and a fine of 30,000 levs (13,461 pounds). The Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) will announce its decision in the case on Friday. \nMost Balkan states, including Bulgaria, are known to have groups of hardcore soccer fans, known as ‘ultras’ who are frequently behind stadium trouble. \nFootball-related violence has spiralled in Bulgaria since the fall of communism in 1989 with threats and even physical violence against players and officials now commonplace. \nThe Bulgarian sports ministry said another measure to combat stadium violence should be the creation of a working group to prepare legislative changes that will lead to “increased personal responsibility”. \n“There must be a public response and irreconcilability to such hooliganism,” said the interior ministry’s Chief Secretary Mladen Marinov. “We have to jointly oppose such acts.” \nThe interior ministry’s police union called for stricter sanctions for people showing aggression or showing disrespect to police officers. \n“The incident at the football match is part of the terror spread across the stadiums and streets, which is directed against the law, morality and the whole society,” the union said.
