Across all Canadian issues there were five new 52-week highs and 17 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Interfor Corp , which rose 3.5 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Life Sciences, down 6.8 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc, Aurora Cannabis, and Prometic Life Sciences. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 26.74 million, while the total volume on Tuesday was 47.55 million shares.
