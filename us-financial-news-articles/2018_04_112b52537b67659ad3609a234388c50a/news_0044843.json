It hopes to raise roughly $4 billion and will seek a valuation of roughly $12 billion in the offering, the people said. The company is expected to start trading in the first week of May.\nAXA Equitable Holdings is one of America’s oldest life insurers, founded in 1859 in New York, and was long known as Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. AXA acquired it in 1992.\nSome of the proceeds of the IPO will be used by AXA Equitable Holdings’ parent company to help finance its $15.3 billion purchase of XL Group Ltd. AXA announced its plans to buy XL in early March.\nAfter announcing the XL deal, Paris-based AXA said it would accelerate existing plans to split off its large U.S. life-insurance business in a public offering. That division owns a majority stake in AllianceBernstein, a money manager that has struggled recently against competition from cheaper index funds.\nAhead of the deal, AXA was planning to raise less in the IPO of its U.S. arm—roughly $2.5 billion—but decided to increase its target for proceeds to help finance the deal, one of the people said.\nSo far this year, Brazilian financial technology company PagSeguro Digital Ltd. , which raised $2.6 billion, is the largest U.S. IPO by deal value, according to Dealogic.\n—Leslie Scism contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T06:24:51.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
