Their destination was the rebel-held areas of Idlib and Jarablus in northern Syria, Syrian state television said.\nOnly one pocket of rebel-held territory remains near the Syrian capital, an area south of the city where Islamic State holds a pocket next to one held by rebel factions.\nPro-government forces are bombarding the enclave, which includes the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp, Hajar al-Aswad district and neighboring areas.\nIn a sign of the state’s control of the Qalamoun area, Syrian security forces began deploying in several villages there on Wednesday.\nState television showed footage of convoys of police cars and motorcycles entering the village of Ruhaiba, with dozens of civilians gathering and cheering in the streets.\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has sought to wipe out the last few rebel enclaves near Damascus. In early April Assad took control of the largest rebel-held area near Damascus, eastern Ghouta.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T13:37:37.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
