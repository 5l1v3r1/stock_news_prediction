But we were founded 10 years ago in order to be sold.”\n3D printing has mostly been used in prototyping in aerospace but companies are trying to get the process certified for serial production.\n“Aerospace customers don’t want only prototypes, they want parts that will fly,” APWorks CEO Joachim Zettler said.\nHe said flying taxis, currently being explored by various companies in both the aerospace and automotive industry, were a future market for 3D printing.\nPremium Aerotec, which uses additive manufacturing for parts in the Airbus A350 and the A400M military transporter, wants to achieve certification from European and then U.S. authorities for the additive manufacturing process, rather than having to get certification for each part. That will allow the company to scale up production.\n“There are more tests than we initially thought, which is good, but we are on the way to achieving the certification this year,” Ehm said.\n3D printer maker Stratasys has also been investing in certification in order to make its printers more attractive to aerospace customers. At the Hamburg Aircraft Interiors show last week, it demonstrated ducts, space dividers and cup holders made by additive manufacturing.\nStratasys worked to reduce the variance in products created by its printers and has set up a database of statistical results that has been endorsed by authorities to help customers more easily certify parts.\n“Now we have the database, it will drive sales,” Jim Orrock, vice president product leader at Stratasys, told Reuters. “A customer can use that to gain certification more quickly than if they wanted to do it on their own.”\nStratasys said on Tuesday that more than 100 parts for U.S. space agency NASA’s deep-space capsule Orion will be made by 3D printers.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T19:53:09.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
