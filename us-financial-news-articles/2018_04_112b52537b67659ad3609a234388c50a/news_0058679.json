It was overturned for supposed foul play by Savea’s brother Ardie.\nThe Sunwolves then virtually camped in the Hurricanes’ half but were unable to capitalise in the face of some superb defence from the home side.\nWinger Kenki Fukuoka scored his side’s second try when he was the first to a speculative kick by Yutaka Nagare to reduce the deficit to 26-15 before Aso and Shields scored in the final six minutes to blow the score out.
