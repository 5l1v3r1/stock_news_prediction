These are criminals dedicated to drug-trafficking,” he said at the summit in Lima. “They will feel the full force of the law and our armed forces.” \nMore than a thousand FARC fighters refused to demobilize under the accord with Santos and continued drug trafficking across the nation. Those operating in Colombia’s southern jungles have attacked Ecuadorean security forces along the border. \nThe FARC, which battled for more than a half century, attacked military targets and civilian towns but generally allowed journalists to work freely, unless they went against the rebels’ interests.
