Currently only about 80 percent of American households subscribe to internet access and we believe this number will continue to expand,\" CFO Mike Cavanagh said on the company's earnings call. \"We have an opportunity in our footprint through new home formation and by extending our plant within our footprint.\"\nIt was the NBCUniversal segment, though, that posted the strongest growth in the first quarter.\nNBCUniversal, owner of film studios, theme parks, as well as NBC News and CNBC, brought in $9.53 billion, bolstered by coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics and the Super Bowl.\nThat represents a 21 percent year-over-year upside and far outpaces expected revenue for the division.\n\"NBCUniversal continues to grow at a faster pace than any of us originally imagined,\" CEO Brian Roberts said on the earnings call. \" On the back of these incredible big events, NBC is on track to finish number one for the fifth consecutive year in demo and is number one in total viewers for the first time in 16 years.\"\nMeanwhile, Comcast continues to diversify. The company earlier Wednesday formalized its $31 billion bid for British broadcaster Sky , and earlier this month announced it's getting into health care .\nShares of Comcast rose more than 3 percent in morning trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T13:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T13:03:21.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
