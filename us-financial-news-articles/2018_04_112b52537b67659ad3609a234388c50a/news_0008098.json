REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo The six-song “Universal Love” album is meant to give the community songs that reflect their own gender identity by flipping pronouns or having male and female singers reverse traditional roles.\nDylan, the Nobel Prize-winning composer and performer, covers “He’s Funny That Way,” a standard sung by Ella Fitzgerald and Diana Ross that has also been part of Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby’s songbooks as “She’s Funny That Way.”\nGuitarist and singer St. Vincent, who has said publicly she identifies as neither gay nor straight, performs “And Then She Kissed Me,” a version of girl group The Crystals’ 1963 hit “Then He Kissed Me.”\n“The great thing about music is that it transcends all the barriers and boundaries, and goes right to peoples’ hearts,” St. Vincent said. “And everyone has a heart.”\nFILE PHOTO: Kesha performs \"Praying\" at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards Show in New York, U.S., January 28, 2018.
