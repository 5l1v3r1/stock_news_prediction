Banks historically paid some of the highest taxes, due to their U.S.-centric business model. Before the Trump tax cuts, these banks paid between 28 to 31 percent of their income each year in corporate taxes. \nThe results show why banks supported the tax overhaul. Tax rates at banks such as JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley dropped to between 17 and 23 percent.
