The underwhelming IPO investor reception illustrates that concerns about the volatility of its business persist, even as steel tariffs announced by U.S. President Donald Trump last month were expected to buoy its fortunes.\nGrafTech priced its IPO at $15 per share, the source said, well below the targeted range of $21 to $24 per share. The Brooklyn Heights, New York-based company also sold only 35 million shares, slightly fewer than the 37.8 million shares originally planned. The IPO pricing gives GrafTech a market value of around $4.5 billion.\nGrafTech and Brookfield declined to comment.\nBrookfield bought GrafTech for around $1.3 billion, including debt in 2015, when the steel industry was struggling with a slump in prices due to record exports by China.\nAll of the net proceeds from the IPO will go to an affiliate of Brookfield and Brookfield Business Partners LP ( BBU_u.TO ), GrafTech said in its IPO prospectus.\nGrafTech is scheduled to make its New York Stock Exchange debut on Thursday under the symbol “EAF”.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.S ) are the lead underwriters of the offering.\nReporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Tom Brown and Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T01:49:41.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
