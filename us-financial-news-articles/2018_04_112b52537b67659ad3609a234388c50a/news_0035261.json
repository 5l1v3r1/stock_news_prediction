(“iAnthus” or “the Company”), (CSE:IAN) (OTCQB:ITHUF), which owns, operates, and partners with licensed cannabis operations throughout the United States, announced today the completion of its acquisition of the remaining 20% of Pilgrim Rock Management, LLC (“Pilgrim Rock”), the affiliated management and services company that provides intellectual property licensing, professional and management services, real estate and equipment leasing, and certain other services to Mayflower Medicinals, Inc. (“Mayflower”). Mayflower, a non-profit Massachusetts corporation affiliated with Pilgrim Rock, has received two provisional licenses to operate Registered Marijuana Dispensaries (\"RMDs\") in Massachusetts, with a third RMD application pending before the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (\"DPH\"). Following the acquisition, iAnthus now owns 100% of Pilgrim Rock.\nTo effectuate the acquisition, VSH PR, Inc. (the “Seller”) was merged into iAnthus’ wholly-owned subsidiary, iAnthus Capital Management, LLC. The Company thereby acquired the Seller’s 200,000 Class A-2 units of Pilgrim Rock in return for 1,655,734 common shares of the Company issued to the Seller. The common shares were issued pursuant to prospectus exemptions in Canada and are subject to a Canadian hold period expiring on August 17, 2018. iAnthus and the Seller are arms-length parties.\n“We are pleased to have completed this transaction and our acquisition of 100% of Pilgrim Rock, which is instrumental in enabling Mayflower to become a leading licensed cultivator, processor and dispensary operator in Massachusetts’ flourishing cannabis industry,” said Randy Maslow, President of iAnthus. “iAnthus is focused on securing 100% ownership of its strategic assets around the United States, which ensures us control of each licensed operation and provides our investors with full exposure to the growth of each of our state operations.”\niAnthus further provided the following updates regarding Mayflower’s operational progress:\nMayflower’s 36,000 cultivation facility in Holliston is fully operational, and its first extraction cycle for processed product was completed last week; Mayflower's first harvest will be shortly moving to the drying and curing rooms. The first harvest, as a pilot, utilized a subset of the facility's total grow space. Mayflower will quickly move to optimize the full capacity of the facility in subsequent harvests; and The flagship Harvard Avenue dispensary in the Allston neighborhood of Boston is now completed and staffed. Pending final regulatory approval, Mayflower expects to open in early May 2018 to medical patients.\nAdditional information about iAnthus may be accessed on the Company’s website at www.iAnthusCapital.com and under the Company’s SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com .\nAbout iAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc.\niAnthus Capital Holdings, Inc. owns and operates best-in-class licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities throughout the United States, providing investors diversified exposure to the U.S. regulated cannabis industry.
