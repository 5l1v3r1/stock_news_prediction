Park and Canellos served under Mary Jo White. Mr. Canellos is also the former co-director of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe Manhattan U.S. attorney’s office has opposed the use of a special master, saying a “filter team” of prosecutors who are walled off from the probe would be most efficient for sorting out privileged materials from the materials relevant to the investigation.\nIf the court chooses to appoint a special master, the government proposed three former magistrate judges who have retired from Manhattan federal court: Frank Maas, James C. Francis and Theodore Katz. Judges Maas and Katz have since joined JAMS, a private arbitration service, and Judge Francis teaches at CUNY School of Law.\nRelated\nThe Michael Cohen Case Explained Before their appointments to the bench, Judge Maas was a former Manhattan federal prosecutor, while Judge Francis and Judge Katz both worked at the Legal Aid Society.\nThe government said the former judges have “many years of experience resolving disputes on the issue of privilege in the context of criminal investigations,” and that prosecutors are prepared to provide their views of the names put forward by Mr. Cohen’s team.\nThe proposal for a special master was part of a request for a temporary restraining order filed by Mr. Cohen’s lawyers last week, as they sought to block the government from conducting the initial privilege review of materials seized by federal agents from Mr. Cohen on April 9 as part of a continuing criminal investigation.\nAt a hearing on Monday, U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood denied the temporary restraining order . She said a government filter team was a “viable option” but said a special master may also have a role to promote the “perception of fairness.” She hasn’t made a final ruling on the issue.\nMr. Trump’s lawyers have objected to the use of a special master, saying at Monday’s hearing that Mr. Trump objects to “anyone other than himself making the...initial claim of privilege.”\nProsecutors said in a filing Wednesday that they can likely hand over copies of all the seized materials to Mr. Cohen’s lawyers by May 11. The government has so far “voluntarily refrained” from reviewing any of the evidence, the filing said.\nBoth sides proposed a hearing on May 25 to update the court on the volume of seized materials.\nWrite to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T01:25:41.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
