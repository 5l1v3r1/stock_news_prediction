The break was fixed with a titanium screw in the operation. \n“If the results are positive, he will be able to begin his rehabilitation on Saturday,” the team said. \n“His participation in the Austin GP will be decided consequently.” \nAustin’s Circuit of the Americas hosts the third round of the season on April 22.
