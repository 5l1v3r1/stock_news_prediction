In 2016, the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting.\nSinclair Broadcast Group Inc’s proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co relies in part on that reinstated rule in order to meet regulatory requirements. Democrats say the FCC inspector general is investigating whether Pai took a series of actions to benefit Sinclair.\n“The FCC, under your leadership, has taken numerous actions that call into question your independence in the matter, and at the very least demonstrate the appearance of preferential treatment for Sinclair,” said Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat, at a House hearing on Thursday.\nPai has denied wrongdoing and told Quigley he is not required to recuse himself from the Sinclair review by the FCC general counsel’s office. He declined to forecast when the FCC may decide on whether to approve the deal.\nIn November, the FCC voted to remove key roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies.\nThe FCC voted 3-2 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market. It also voted to make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market.\nThe FCC in December voted to consider whether to rescind rules prohibiting one company from owning stations that serve more than 39 percent of U.S. television households.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T00:43:25.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
