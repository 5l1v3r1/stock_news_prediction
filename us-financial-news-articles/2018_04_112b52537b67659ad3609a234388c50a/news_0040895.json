Critics accused the pope of not understanding the depth of the crisis after he initially defended Barros, saying the bishop was a victim of slander.\nIn a turnaround, the Pope then assigned one of the Vatican’s most experienced sexual abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, to visit Chile and interview clergy and alleged victims.\nScicluna’s resulting 2,300-page report prompted Francis to summon Chile’s bishops to Rome for a meeting in mid-May.\nChilean Cardinal Ezzati also said that neither he nor the Chilean Church had deceived the pope, while calling on anyone who had to come forward.\n“Those who have committed errors should recognise them, regret and repair them,” he said.\nReporting by Antonio de la Jara; Writing by Dave Sherwood\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T02:04:13.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
