In an interview, he said the current concept envisions satellites weighing close to 500 pounds each, with a total cost for the system above $1 billion. But those numbers could change. \nVeteran satellite entrepreneur Greg Wyler, a partner of Airbus and SoftBank 9984, +2.90% on a separate Internet-via-satellite project called OneWeb, is the fourth investor. He declined to disclose how much had been raised in the initial funding round, but said “we have the investors with the wherewithal to make it happen.” \nGates and Wyler are investing personal funds, while Hannigan said Airbus EADSY, +1.57% is both an investor and a partner on the project. \nBased in a Seattle suburb with a minimal staff, the startup is being unveiled as interest surges in small satellites operating relatively close to Earth to serve both commercial and national-security markets. Hannigan said EarthNow is targeting a broad range of applications including tracking illegal fishing, watching migrations in conflict zones and monitoring agriculture. It has potential competition. For instance, Stratolaunch Systems Corp., founded by billionaire Paul Allen, plans to launch satellites with small rockets carried under the wings of a giant carrier aircraft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:42:48.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
