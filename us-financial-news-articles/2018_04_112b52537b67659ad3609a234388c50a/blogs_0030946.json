Icelandic media have the case the \"Big Bitcoin Heist.\" If used for its original purpose — to create new bitcoins — the thieves could turn a massive profit in an untraceable currency.\nPolice have arrested 22 people altogether, including a security guard, without solving the burglaries.\nThe escaped prisoner was being held at the Sogn prison in rural southern Iceland, 95 kilometers (59 miles) from the airport. The prison is unfenced and inmates have telephone and internet access.\nStefansson had been in custody since February. He was moved to the open prison 10 days ago, police said.\n\"He had an accomplice,\" Police Chief Gunnar Schram told Visir, an online news outlet in Iceland. \"We are sure of that.\"\nA passenger on the same flight to Sweden as the inmate told national broadcaster RUV that Iceland's prime minister, Katrin Jakobsdottir, was also on that flight.\nJakobsdottir was among five Nordic prime ministers who met with India's prime minister Tuesday in Stockholm.\nEgill Bjarnason contributed from Iceland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:11:40.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
