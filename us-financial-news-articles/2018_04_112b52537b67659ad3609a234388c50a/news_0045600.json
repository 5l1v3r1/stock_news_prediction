(OTC PINK: TAUG ) (\"Tauriga\" or the \"Company\"), engaged in building its business through the development, distribution, and licensing of proprietary products as well as the evaluation of potential acquisition opportunities and other investments, today announced that its Board of Directors (“Board”) has approved and ratified a reverse stock split of its common stock on a 1 for 75 basis. For example, 750,000 pre-split common shares of TAUG will be reduced to 10,000 post-split shares, with a simultaneous and immediate initial increase in its trading price by 75 times its then current per share value.\nThe Company believes that recent events that specifically affect the publicly traded micro-cap industry necessitate this corporate action at this time. The Company believes that an amended capital structure, as discussed above, will be requisite to the Company’s plans to source and execute future transactions that our board of directors believes will contribute to our shareholder value.\nThe Company wishes to also assure it shareholders that, in accordance with Florida corporations law, this reverse stock split will include a directly proportional reduction of the Company’s authorized common stock from 7,500,000,000 to 100,000,000 shares, and a reduction of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 3,920,000,000 to approximately 52,300,000 shares.\nThe Company will announce in a future press release and in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the date on which our common stock will begin trading of the post-split shares (the Effective Date”), the new CUSIP number for our common stock and the filing of an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of the State of Florida, which is necessary to effect the reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split will affect all shares of the Company's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the market opening on the Effective Date, and the reverse stock split will affect a reduction in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants, and upon the conversion of the Company's remaining convertible notes.\nNo fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split, and any such stockholders whose number of post-split shares would result in a fractional number will have his/her/its shares rounded up to the next number of shares. [Transfer Agent] is acting as exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split and will send instructions to stockholders of record who hold stock certificates regarding the exchange of their old certificates for new certificates, should they wish to do so. Stockholders who hold their shares in brokerage accounts or \"street name\" are not required to take any action to effect the exchange of their shares.\nAdditionally, the Company believes that there may be some tangential benefits resulting from this reverse stock split, including:\nthat its amended capital structure will be more attractive to potential institutional investors, with respect to both open market support and private placement capital; that it will likely be successful in achieving its desired up-listing to the OTCQB Exchange (versus its current situation: OTC Pink Current Information Tier); that its non-institutional investors will have a significantly easier time depositing our common stock shares at various brokerage firms (many of which are prohibited from accepting shares for deposit that trade at less than 1 cent per share or “$0.01”); and that its amended capital structure will be far more attractive to a potential merger/acquisition candidate should the Company decide to utilize its equity as part of any such transaction.\nTauriga’s Chief Executive Officer Seth M. Shaw commented, “The Company has decided to enact this reverse stock split at this time due to the potential material benefits described above, which we believe will be beneficial to its shareholders. Most micro-cap companies are not able to implement such a restructuring from a position of relative strength, as Tauriga can at this time. The Company has approached this decision in a patient and respectful manner and believes that the timing is correct to do so.”\nABOUT TAURIGA SCIENCES, INC.\nTauriga Sciences, Inc.
