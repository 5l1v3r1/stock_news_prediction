Foreign outflow is also continuing,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings. \nForeign investors sold shares worth net 19.1 million rupees on Friday extending the year-to-date net foreign outflow to 890.7 million rupees worth of equities. \nShares in Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Plc ended 3.2 percent lower, while Dialog Axiata Plc closed 0.7 percent down, Soflogic Holdings Plc ended 2.6 percent weaker and John Keells Holdings Plc closed 0.3 percent lower. $1 = 155.4000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T15:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:33:20.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
