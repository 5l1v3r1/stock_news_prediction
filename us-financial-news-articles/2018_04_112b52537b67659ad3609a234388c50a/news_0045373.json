Ryan Braun had an RBI single and also collected two hits and two walks for the Brewers, who prevailed in the opener of a nine-game road trip.\nZach Davies (2-2) pitched six solid innings to win his second straight start. The right-hander gave up two runs, four hits and three walks while striking out two.\nSalvador Perez homered in his season debut for the Royals, who have dropped 11 of their past 13 games.\nKansas City right-hander Ian Kennedy departed after three innings with a bruised right foot. He was struck by Braun’s run-scoring liner in the top of the third.\nX-rays were negative. Kennedy was diagnosed with a bruise and is expected to make his next start.\nKennedy (1-3) allowed four runs and six hits and issued one walk.\nThe early departure ended Kennedy’s streak of striking out at least one batter at 237 appearances. It was the second-longest active streak in the majors behind Boston’s David Price (238).\nPerez and Royals left fielder Alex Gordon were activated from the disabled prior to the contest.\nPerez, a five-time All-Star, had been sidelined since tearing the MCL in his left knee while taking his suitcase up the stairs in his home on March 27. He went 1-for-4.\nGordon, a three-time All-Star, sustained a tear in his left hip on April 9. He went 2-for-4.\nMilwaukee scored four runs in the third inning to take control, the first tally coming on Braun’s two-out liner that hit Kennedy’s foot. Jonathan Villar, who led off the inning with one of his three singles, scored from third base.\nShaw followed by slugging a 2-2 offering 437 feet over the fence in right-center to make it 4-0.\nPerez belted a one-out homer in the fourth to get Kansas City on the board.\nThe Royals manufactured a run in the fifth when Gordon doubled to left center, moved to third on an infield out and scored on a sacrifice fly to left by Alcides Escobar.\nCain hit the first pitch of the seventh inning from right-hander Burch Smith 413 feet over the fence in right center to make it 5-2. The homer drew a nice ovation from Kansas City fans, who showed appreciation for a player who was a key cog for the 2015 World Series championship team.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:20:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
