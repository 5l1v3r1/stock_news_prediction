However, it is in the provinces that the difficulties may be greatest.\nAccording to U.S. estimates, the government has firm control over no more than around 56 percent of the country and vulnerability will increase as the process continues into district centres and rural areas. ‘A SMALL PUNISHMENT’\nBalkh, one of Afghanistan’s more stable provinces with valuable trade crossings into Central Asia, is a long way from the Taliban heartlands in the south and is considered far more secure than neighbouring Kunduz province, where the Taliban dominate many areas. But even here, the militants appear determined to lay down a marker.\nShams, a resident of Dowlat Abad district in the north of the province, said the most recent visit by Taliban tax collectors levying ushr (land tax) and zakat (an Islamic tax) included an explicit warning to stay away from the elections.\n“They came with a great show of force because the elections are coming up and they wanted the people to see,” he said.\nTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the movement was issuing warnings about burning houses but said they were telling people to stay away from the election. However, other Taliban officials were more open.\n“Burning a house is a small punishment if they are caught in supporting this U.S. operation to prolong their stay in Afghanistan,” said one Taliban commander, who asked not to be identified.\nAfghan security forces have launched operations to drive the Taliban back and promise people will be able to vote in safety.\n“We will not allow anyone to stop elections taking place in this province,” said Balkh’s provincial governor, Mohammad Isaaq Rahgozar. “If the Taliban has issued warnings, that’s one of their techniques to intimidate people, but we are trying to make sure that nobody suffers any harm through this.”\nHowever, many Afghans in the area, who over the years have seen repeated military clearance operations followed by the return of the Taliban, are sceptical.\n“The Taliban have had a presence in this area for a very long time,” said Fazel Ahmad, a resident of Chemtal district in Balkh. “The government and the security forces don’t have the capacity to provide security. If we vote, we’ll be killed.” Additional reporting by Jibran Ahmad in PESHAWAR; Writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Paul Tait", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T11:32:19.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
