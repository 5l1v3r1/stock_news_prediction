I don’t see what happens behind and unfortunately he got hurt,” said Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion. “My job is to go when the light says so. Hopefully, he’s OK.”\nThe Finn was left sitting in his car for a while before stepping out while the mechanics focused on their stricken team mate on the floor.\nFerrari chairman Sergio Marchionne wished the mechanic a speedy recovery in his post-race statement.\n“I am sorry for Kimi who could certainly have finished on the podium,” he added.\nIt was the second time Ferrari had been penalised for an unsafe release over the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend.\nThey were fined 5,000 euros after Raikkonen was sent out of the pits with a loose wheel in Friday practice.\nRace stewards said that in Sunday’s incident the car was released “in a manner endangering team personnel and causing injury.”\n$1 = 0.8145 euros Writing by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ian Chadband\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:17:51.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
