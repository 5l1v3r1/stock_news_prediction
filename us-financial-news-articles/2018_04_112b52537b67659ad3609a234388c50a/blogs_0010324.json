Taking deep, slow breaths reduces anxiety and stress , research finds. Have some fun \nAs adults, many people feel like they don't have time to be creative and engage in playful activities, Seppala notes. But studies show that when people do entertain their childlike side, they actually feel less bogged down by work. \n\"Play has a positive impact on creativity because—in addition to helping us both mind-wander and diversify — it stimulates positive emotion, which research shows leads to greater insight and better problem solving,\" Seppala writes in \"The Happiness Track.\" show chapters 11:24 AM ET Fri, 6 Jan 2017 | 01:14 \nFor workers, this may look like taking team meetings outdoors, going to a comedy show with coworkers or playing a game of pool. \n\"When we feel good, we gain the ability to pay attention to a wider range of experiences,\" Seppala writes. \"In other words, if you feel stuck in a rut or you can't think yourself out of a problem or don't see a way out of a situation, play may be a way of getting 'unstuck' and coming up with innovative ideas.\" Add some plants to your office \n\"In terms of spring cleaning your career, add plants to your office,\" Seppala recommends. \"Research shows it will improve your mental well-being significantly.\" \nHaving greenery at your desk or around your office has the ability to clear the air quite literally, as one NASA study found plants remove indoor toxins in the air. \nAccording to a study from the University of Exeter, having plants in the office can also increase concentration, workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life. The study further found that plants make workers more physically, cognitively and emotionally involved in their work. \n\"Similarly, resolve to take walks outside on your breaks instead of scrolling through your phone,\" she says. \"This small action can significantly boost your happiness.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T18:02:38.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
