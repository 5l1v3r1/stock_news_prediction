In addition, the lithium industry “has shown a poor track record of delivering projects on time,” he added.\nSQM, officially known as Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, currently has annual lithium carbonate production capacity of 48,000 tonnes in Chile, which it will expand to 70,000 tonnes by mid-2018 and to 100,000 tonnes in 2019, Jimenez said.\nThe company also has 6,000 tonnes of annual capacity for lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content batteries, which will more than double to 13,500 tonnes by June this year.\nUnder a deal struck with Chilean development agency Corfo in January, SQM will be able to produce up to 216,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year through 2025 if it makes certain investments and obtains the relevant permits. However, the company has not yet decided whether to go beyond 100,000 tonnes.\nCorfo has also asked antitrust regulators to block the sale of a 32 percent stake in SQM held by Nutrien Ltd to Chinese lithium producer Tianqi Lithium.\nOutside Chile, SQM has a joint venture with Lithium Americas at the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina, which has a targeted production capacity of 25,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate per year and is expected to come on line around 2020.\nIn Australia, SQM partners Kidman Resources at the 40,000 tonne per year Mount Holland project, which is scheduled to start producing either lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide in 2021.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:03:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
