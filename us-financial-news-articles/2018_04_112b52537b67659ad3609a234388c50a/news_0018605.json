Mar 29, 2018; Rancho Mirage, CA, USA; Brooke Henderson tees off on the second hole during the first round of the ANA Inspiration women's golf tournament at Mission Hills CC - Dinah Shore Tournament Course.

I’m seeing the line, which is always nice as well.” \nHenderson leads on 10-under 134, two shots ahead of American Mo Martin (67) and first-round leader Shanshan Feng of China (69).
