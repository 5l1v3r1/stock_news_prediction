He also says that the beer’s label was intended to be a “joke,” which is how he feels customers have taken it. \nSony is suing Knee Deep for trademark infringement and unfair competition and is seeking monetary damages as well as an injunction to prevent the brewery from using the Breaking Bud name and its current logo going forward.
