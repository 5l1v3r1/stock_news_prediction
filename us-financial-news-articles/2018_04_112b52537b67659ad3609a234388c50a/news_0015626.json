It launched a red version of the iPhone 7 in March 2017, for example. Part of the revenue generated from sales of (PRODUCT) RED devices and accessories is donated to help people with HIV and AIDS.\nApple didn't announce a red version of the iPhone X , its most high-end iPhone, and instead will launch a red leather case for that phone. The iPhone 8 has similar features, however, including support for wireless charging, Apple's newest processor and the company's latest cameras.\nThe red iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will be available to order online on Tuesday and will arrive in stores and begin shipping this Friday. It starts at $699.\nWATCH:  Apple is working on a 'foldable' iPhone for release in 2020, says Bank of America show chapters Apple is working on a ‘foldable’ iPhone for release in 2020, says Bank of America      5:43 PM ET Fri, 23 March 2018 | 00:43", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:12:58.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
