Cautionary flyers will also be distributed warning guests of the legal repercussions of harassment, Schiappa added, though no additional details on the phone line were given.\nThe move is especially pertinent to Cannes as mega-producer Harvey Weinstein , the catalyst of the #MeToo movement, was accused of assaulting women at the festival in previous years.\n“One of the rapes that Harvey Weinstein is accused of happened at Cannes, and so the festival cannot fail to act,” Schiappa said, referring to allegations from actress Asia Argento.\nEarlier this month, Cannes artistic director Thierry Fremaux said the festival would review its practices, saying, “The Cannes Film Festival will never be the same again,” according to the Hollywood Reporter .\nCannes opens on May 8 and runs until the 19th.", "external_links": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/cannes-thierry-fremaux-says-festival-will-never-be-same-again-weinstein-earthquake-1102027", "https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/cannes-film-festival-to-open-anti-harassment-hotline"], "published": "2018-04-28T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:51:49.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
