REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nApple said the flaw, reported in some 13-inch Macbook Pros without touch bars, is not a safety issue. \nThe affected units were manufactured between October 2016 and October 2017, Apple said on its support page, without giving the actual number of MacBooks affected. \nThe iPhone maker previously came under scrutiny after it confirmed in December that software to deal with aging batteries in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models could slow down performance. The company later apologized and lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models to $29 from $79.
