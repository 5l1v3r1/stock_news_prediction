He said the company wanted to extend privacy guarantees worldwide in spirit, but would make exceptions, which he declined to describe.\nAsked what parts of the EU law he would not extend worldwide, Zuckerberg said: \"We're still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing.\"\nThe law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is billed as the biggest overhaul of online privacy since the birth of the internet, giving Europeans more protections for their data than ever before.\nLast month, Facebook acknowledged that personal information about more than 50 million users wrongly ended up in the hands of consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. \nPrivacy advocacy groups have been urging Facebook and its Silicon Valley competitors to adopt worldwide all of the protections that they implement in Europe.\nZuckerberg said many of the tools that are part of the law, such as the ability of users to delete all their data, are already available for people on Facebook.\n\"We think that this is a good opportunity to take that moment across the rest of the world,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T00:04:11.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
