China, however, said that Washington was to blame for trade frictions, repeating that it was impossible to negotiate under \"current circumstances\". Investors are now waiting for a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum on Tuesday. Asia shares ex-Japan rose 0.6 percent, while the U.S. S&P 500 e-Mini futures climbed 0.8 percent.

Thailand's economy is expected to grow 4.1 percent this year, up from a forecast 3.6 percent, as the recovery is broadening, the World Bank said on Monday. The country's monetary policy still needs to remain accommodative for some time until the economic recovery has become clear and broad-based, the central bank governor said. Malaysian shares ended 0.7 percent higher, their third session of gains, underpinned by higher material stocks.
