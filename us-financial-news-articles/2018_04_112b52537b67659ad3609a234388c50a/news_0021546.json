That’s an exaggeration,” he said. “We envisage the level going to Imam Hatips will be 23 percent. Twenty-three percent is not bigger than 62.” \n“We are not forcing anyone to do anything,” he said, adding parents did not have to send children to particular schools. \nWhile Imam Hatip students make up 11 percent of the total upper school population, they were allocated some 23 percent of funding in this year’s budget, a Reuters report showed in January. \n“The government is trying to direct successful pupils towards Imam Hatips by raising their profile, having been unable to achieve the desired success and increase demand for them,” main opposition CHP party MP Utku Cakirozer told Reuters. \nMore than one million students will complete middle school this year and the 90 percent who are not placed through exams will make preferences for schools near their homes. \nUnder the previous system, all students took the upper school entrance exam and Yilmaz said the new system was designed to limit the number of students facing the stress of exams. \nThe Egitim-Sen teachers’ union said in a statement it was launching a court challenge to the new system. \n“The AKP continues to insist on a policy of making education religious,” it said, referring to Erdogan’s ruling AK Party.
