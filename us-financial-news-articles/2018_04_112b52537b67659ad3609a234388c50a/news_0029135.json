Although Republicans can defeat it, the resolution is symbolically important because it represents the most senators ever to call for a Cabinet member’s ouster in resolution, its sponsors said. \nOne of the supporters was Senator Bernie Sanders who is an independent but votes with Democrats. More than 130 U.S. representatives also signed a companion resolution in the House of Representatives.
