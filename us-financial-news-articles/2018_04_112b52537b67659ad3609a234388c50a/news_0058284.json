It must have got infected or something because I kept biting it over and over.\n“So I had to get that taken out and stitched back up in London.”\nRicciardo said he had precious little time to relax after the Shanghai win as he prepared for Sunday’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix in Baku.\nThe Perth-born driver’s contract with Red Bull expires at the end of the season and his future has been the subject of frenzied speculation.\nHe has been linked to a possible move to Ferrari or Mercedes but told reporters on Thursday that he had only spoken to his Red Bull team about his racing future.\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T09:25:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
