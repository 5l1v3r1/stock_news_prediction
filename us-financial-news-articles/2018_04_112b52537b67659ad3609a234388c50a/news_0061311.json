He walked one and struck out four.\nGregor Blanco had two hits for the Giants, who have won six of their last eight games.\nThe three RBIs ran Longoria’s total to a team-leading 15.\nCody Bellinger collected a pair of hits for the Dodgers, who have lost five of six with still seven games remaining on an 11-game trip.\nBellinger and Chris Taylor had the only extra-base hits for Los Angeles, a double apiece. The Dodgers out-hit the Giants 8-6.\nMaeda went six innings, allowing four runs and five hits. He walked four and struck out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:19:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
