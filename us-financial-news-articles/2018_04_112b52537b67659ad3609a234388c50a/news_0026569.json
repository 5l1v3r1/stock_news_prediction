FILE PHOTO: Geoffrey Kirui of Kenya crosses the finish line to win the men's division of the 121st Boston Marathon in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., April 17, 2017.

He carries a personal best of 2:06:27 to Rupp’s 2:09:20. \nThe U.S. women’s drought at Boston stretches back to 1985. \nFlanagan, Jordan Hasay, Molly Huddle and Desi Linden will try to change that against an international field that may not be as strong as in past years. \nFlanagan, 36, who grew up in Massachusetts, is the sentimental favorite, with Hasay holding the best Boston finish. \nThe 26-year-old made it to the podium in 2017, finishing third at both Boston and Chicago. The Boston race was her marathon debut. \nLinden and Huddle are both experienced marathoners with Linden fourth in Boston in 2017 and Huddle third in the 2016 New York City Marathon. \nKiplagat, the Kenyan mother of five who is now 38, returns to defend her title after finishing second in the world championships and fourth in New York City in 2017. \nAselefech Mergia, a former London winner, and fellow Ethiopian Mamitu Daska, who was third in New York last year, could be Kiplagat’s biggest international challengers along with former Boston winners Buzunesh Deba (Ethiopia) and Caroline Rotich (Kenya).
