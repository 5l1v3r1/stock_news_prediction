They resigned their portfolios and decided to sit with the opposition, weakening the SLFP’s coalition with Wickremesinghe’s United National Party (UNP). \nSirisena appointed four ministers on a temporary basis to handle the main ministries. \nLakshman Yapa Abeywardena, one of the 16 legislators who decided to join the opposition said: “We were to cross over and sit with the opposition on April 19. Now we will do that on May 8.” Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Euan Rocha and Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T22:29:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
