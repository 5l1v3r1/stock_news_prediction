Sky Italia was not included in the review and will continue to be supported by MEC and Simple Agency, it said. \nMediaCom said it was “thrilled” to renew its partnership, which will cover ad spending of about 425 million pounds ($604 million), according to industry paper Campaign. \nLosing the business would have been a blow to WPP, and to Sorrell, who is facing an investigation into alleged misconduct. \n($1 = 0.7038 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:16:24.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
