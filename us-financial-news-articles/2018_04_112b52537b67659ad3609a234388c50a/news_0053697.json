It did not give specific details of the deal.\nThuraya, a UAE-based, 20-year old mobile satellite operator has two satellites that serve over 140 countries. Yahsat, a fixed satellite provider, owned by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Company currently has three satellites.\n“The acquisition will significantly expand Yahsat’s current satellite solutions portfolio for both commercial and government verticals as well as its global footprint,” the statement said.\nThe combined satellites will cover Europe, Africa, the Middle East, South America and Asia, providing fixed and mobile satellite services.
