BA 4.04% and Airbus SE EADSY 1.61% on Tuesday added orders for jets valued at more than $10 billion, adding pressure on both to further boost production.\nThe U.S. plane maker also said it delivered 184 planes during the first quarter to outpace its European rival as both wrestle with supply-chain hiccups during efforts to boost output.\nBoeing delivered 25 more jets than in the same period last year while Airbus handed over 121, a drop of 15 from a year earlier amid supplier turmoil. With order books stretching out for more than five years, investors are more focused on the plane makers’ ability to deliver new jets and secure the bulk of payments due from airlines and leasing companies.\nHowever, incremental deals demonstrate the plane makers’ ability to juggle customers as airlines change their plans and leasing companies flush with cash from Asian investors look to expand their portfolios.\nMore in Transportation \nTrucking Hiring, Logistics Payrolls Surged Last Month April 6, 2018 Hurricane-Damaged Cars Moving Again as U.S. Exports April 5, 2018 Heavy-Duty Truck Orders Hit a Record Pace April 4, 2018 NYSE Moves to Delist Shares of Trucker Celadon April 3, 2018 Boeing announced a deal for 50 of its 737 Max 10 jets from Lion Air, the Indonesian budget airline that is one of its largest customers for its jets and those of Airbus. Boeing had previously booked the deal but hadn’t disclosed the customer.\nAirbus also won a top-up deal from an existing customer when Scandinavia’s SAS Group said it would buy 35 of its A320neo single-aisle jet and take 15 more from leasing companies.\nSAS is taking planes from lessors because Airbus didn’t have any more available production capacity to deliver planes. Airbus Chief Commercial Officer Eric Schulz said more deals are in the pipeline so a similar development could be repeated.\nBoeing and Airbus are raising production of their single-aisle planes to satisfy that demand. Airbus by mid-2019 is expected to build 63 narrowbodies a month, and has indicated it could boost output further. “The demand is here,” Mr. Schulz said in an interview. Boeing plans to build its 737s at a rate of 57 a month starting next year.\nThe two plane makers so far have held off raising output to assure suppliers can make the engines, seats and other items needed for additional aircraft. Suppliers have stumbled in the past to keep pace with the plane makers, causing plane delivery delays.\nAlthough the plane makers are enjoying strong demand for their narrowbodies, deals for more lucrative wide-bodies have been relatively scant. Airbus didn’t book any wide-body deals in the first quarter, though Emirates Airline finalized an order for 20 A380 double-deckers. The Toulouse, France-based Airbus booked 45 net orders in the first three months of the year.\nMr. Schulz said he expects demand for wide-bodies to rebound again in 12 to 18 months, in line with executives at Boeing, who point to the need for airlines to replace aging planes in the early 2020s.\nOf Boeing’s 221 net orders in the quarter, 50 were for wide-bodies, including 18 freighters being bought by United Parcel Service Inc. and 25 of its 787s ordered by Turkish Airlines . \nWrite to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com and Robert Wall at robert.wall@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T21:11:56.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
