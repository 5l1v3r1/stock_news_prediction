But due to rising dollar hedge costs, the company plans to shift to European bonds and higher-yielding U.S. corporate bonds from U.S. Treasuries.\nDaido currently puts currency hedging on about 80 percent of its foreign bond investment, he said.\nThe investor is considering lowering the hedge ratio when it expects the dollar to strengthen. During the current financial year, Daido expects the dollar to move between 98 and 118 yen and to firm to around 112 yen by next March, compared with 109.20 yen now, Okita said.\nIn the previous financial year, Daido increased foreign bonds by 200 billion yen ($1.83 billion). In addition, it increased its foreign stocks by 65 billion yen, domestic stocks by 5 billion yen and domestic bonds by 25 billion yen, Okita said.\nDaido managed 6.5 trillion yen ($59.55 billion) of funds as of December.\n($1 = 109.16 yen)\nWriting by Hideyuki Sano; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T10:36:48.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
