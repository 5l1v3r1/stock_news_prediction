Any encouragement from a 1-1 draw with Ukraine was dashed by Roberto Martinez’s Belgium side who thrashed the Saudis 4-0 with Romelu Lukaku scoring twice.\nWhile Saudi Arabia stumble towards the World Cup’s opening game against hosts Russia, their ex-coach van Marwijk has been parachuted into Postecoglou’s old position with the Socceroos.\nGiven barely three months to fine-tune an Australia team that struggled in the latter stages of qualifying, he oversaw an encouraging 0-0 draw with Colombia last month after a 4-1 debut thrashing against a Norway side who failed to reach the finals.\nNishino, meanwhile, will be hard pressed to lift the mood of a Japan camp that has been battered in recent months.\nA record 4-1 loss by South Korea in December could have been dismissed as inconsequential had Halilhodzic steered the team to positive results against Mali and Ukraine last month.\nBut a draw with the African side was followed by a loss to the Ukrainians, prompting the normally conservative JFA to fire a coach who had been under pressure for much of the last year.\n“I want to get results,” Nishino said at his unveiling on Thursday. “It’s the World Cup, so I want us to show that we are good enough to get to the knockout round.\n“But first of all I want the players to perform in the way that they are capable of. I want to bring that out of them.\n“We have the players with the spirit to do that.”\nIran, the region’s highest ranked nation at number 36, appear to be Asia’s best hope for success in Russia, despite being drawn to face Spain, European champions Portugal and Morocco in the group phase.\nBut with Queiroz’s tumultuous relationship with the Iranian authorities a constant source of conflict, the experienced Portuguese coach could still face testing times ahead.\nWriting by Michael Church, Editing by Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T13:16:25.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
