I like to win because I’ve outsmarted and outwitted and outclassed every driver out there and today...the performance didn’t feel like it was on par with what I’m capable of doing,” he said.\n“If my normal level is eagle, birdie, then today was partly par — some pars and then a couple of bogeys. That kind of day when we play golf, and normally when I play golf it’s a triple- bogey,” he said.\nBottas, on the other hand, did nothing wrong.\n“I’m absolutely heartbroken. It hurts a lot,” he said.\n“It is difficult to say anything. Everyone saw what happened. It’s just unfortunate, unlucky. I’ll maybe have 10 pints of beer and be fine.”\nMercedes team principal Toto Wolff, who said he just wanted to give the Finn a hug, described what had happened to his driver as ‘very brutal’.\n“It was Valtteri’s race to win today,” said the Austrian. “Apart from Valtteri, everyone made mistakes today.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T22:27:13.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
