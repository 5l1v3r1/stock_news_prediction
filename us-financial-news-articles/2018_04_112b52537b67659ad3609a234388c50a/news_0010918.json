An estimated 50,000 people protested in March, just before Fico bowed to pressure and resigned to save his three-party government.\nFico picked his deputy, Peter Pellegrini, to lead a reshuffled cabinet that was sworn-in on March 22.\nProtest organisers are demanding police president Tibor Gaspar be removed and legislation be changed to keep the government’s interior minister from handpicking a successor to ensure an impartial investigation of Kuciak’s murder.\nPolice have said the murder was likely connected to his work, and a prosecutor has described it as a contract killing.\nKuciak reported on suspected tax fraud, sometimes involving businessmen with links to the ruling Smer party. He and other Slovak media have also reported on deals between the government and the country’s biggest privately-owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar. The police chief has denied any wrongdoing.\nBefore his death, Kuciak was also preparing a story, which was published posthumously, looking at Italian businessmen in eastern Slovakia with suspected mafia links, one of whom had had business dealings with two people who later worked in Fico’s office before resigning in the wake of the murder.\nThe two have denied any links to the killing.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:11:17.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
