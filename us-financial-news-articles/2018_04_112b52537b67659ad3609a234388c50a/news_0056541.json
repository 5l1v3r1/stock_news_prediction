The day before it sold $1.472 billion on the local spot market, its largest intervention in currency markets in at least 15 years.\nThe bank has frequently intervened to prop up the peso in recent months as a weaker currency could spur inflation in a country that has long lived with double-digit increases in consumer prices. It has sold more than $4 billion since March.
