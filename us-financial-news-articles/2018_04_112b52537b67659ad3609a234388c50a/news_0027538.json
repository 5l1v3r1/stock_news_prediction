The power play was set up after a high sticking penalty called on Philadelphia’s Jake Voracek.\nThe Penguins dominated the early part of the second with three goals to go ahead 4-0.\nBrassard made it 2-0 at 2:48 on the power play.\nThen the Penguins struck for two goals in five seconds. Malkin’s blast on a 4-on-3 power play gave them a 3-0 advantage on his 60th career playoff goal.\nFive seconds later, Dumoulin received a pass from Crosby and scored for a 4-0 lead at 6:53.\nSanheim got the Flyers on the board with his first career playoff goal to get within 4-1 at 13:42.\nPhiladelphia was hurt by its poor power play, going 0 for 4 through the first two periods.\nThe Flyers had a couple of good early chances as Sanheim had a shot saved by the right pad of Murray with 17:52 left in the first.\nPittsburgh struck first as Crosby scored on a beautiful wraparound at 10:25. It was Crosby’s fourth goal of the series following a hat trick in Game One.\nValtteri Filppula nearly equalized for the Flyers with 1:44 remaining but Murray stymied the opportunity with a great save.\nMurray was terrific in the first as he stopped all 11 Philadelphia shots.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:32:58.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
