(ASML) today publishes its 2018 first-quarter results.\nQ1 net sales of EUR 2.29 billion, net income EUR 540 million, gross margin 48.7 percent ASML expects Q2 2018 net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion and a gross margin around 43 percent reflecting a significant increase in EUV sales\n(Figures in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated) Q4 2017 1 Q1 2018 Net sales 2,561 2,285 ...of which Installed Base Management sales 2 606 617 Other income (Co-Investment Program) 24 0 New lithography systems sold (units) 48 48 Used lithography systems sold (units) 9 1 Net bookings 3\n2,935 2,442 Gross profit 1,156 1,113 Gross margin (%) 45.2 48.7 Net income 644 540 EPS (basic; in euros) 1.50 1.26 End-quarter cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments 3,288 3,194 (1) As of January 1, 2018, ASML has adopted the new Revenue Recognition Standard (ASC 606) and Lease Standard (ASC 842).

During the quarter we shipped three EUV systems and an additional system is in the process of being shipped. The continued growth of our EUV business is confirmed by nine more orders for NXE:3400B EUV systems in Q1. Customers have publicly discussed taking EUV into high volume production starting by the end of this year. We will support this launch with a plan to ship 20 EUV systems in 2018 and have production capacity for at least 30 systems in 2019. Furthermore, regarding the next-generation EUV platform, High-NA, we received the first four orders from three customers and we also sold options to buy eight more systems. High-NA is an extension of EUV lithography and will enable geometric chip scaling beyond the next decade, offering a resolution and overlay capability which is 70 percent better than today's most advanced EUV systems,\" said ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink.\n\"All in all, we saw a good start of the year and we reiterate our expectation for continued solid growth in 2018, both in sales and profitability.\"\nQ1 Product Highlights\nIn our DUV business, our latest NXT machines have shown capability to run in excess of the productivity milestone of 6,000 wafers per day, with an average five percent productivity increase over 12 months, supporting our customers' value requirements. In our Holistic Lithography product portfolio to date we have shipped multiple e-beam-based pattern fidelity metrology systems (ePfm5) which deliver high resolution capability to detect systematic defects. This innovation, where ASML's e-beam metrology is combined with its computational lithography software, will make it possible to provide e-beam-based feedback to the lithography scanner in a production environment. We also demonstrated the first proof of concept of multiple e-beams to further improve productivity of e-beam metrology and expand the application opportunity in high volume production. Throughput of our EUV platform continued to improve, with more than 125 wafers per hour measured at a customer site (testing based on ASML's Acceptance Test Procedures - ATP), meeting the productivity milestone agreed with our customers. We also demonstrated 140 wafers per hour at ASML.\nOutlook\nFor the second-quarter of 2018, ASML expects net sales between EUR 2.5 billion and EUR 2.6 billion, a gross margin around 43 percent, reflecting a significant increase in EUV sales, R&D costs of about EUR 375 million, SG&A costs of about EUR 115 million. Our target effective annualized tax rate is around 14 percent.\nDividend Proposal\nASML has submitted a proposal to the 2018 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to declare a dividend in respect of 2017 of EUR 1.40 per ordinary share (for a total amount of approximately EUR 600 million), compared with a dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share paid in respect of 2016.\nUpdate Share Buyback Program\nAs part of ASML's financial policy to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and regularly timed share buybacks, in January 2018 ASML announced its intention to purchase up to EUR 2.5 billion of shares to be executed within the 2018-2019 time frame. ASML intends to cancel these shares after repurchase, with the exception of up to 2.4 million shares which will be used to cover employee share plans.\nThrough April 1, 2018, ASML has acquired 1.0 million shares under this program for a total consideration of EUR 170 million.\nThe current program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. All transactions under this program are published on ASML's website ( www.asml.com/investors ) on a weekly basis.\nMedia Relations Contacts Investor Relations Contacts Monique Mols, phone +31 6 5284 4418 Skip Miller, phone +1 480 235 0934 Lucas van Grinsven, phone +31 6 1019 9532 Marcel Kemp, phone +31 40 268 6494 Brittney Wolff, phone +1 408 483 3207 Craig DeYoung, phone +852 2295 1168\nInvestor and Media Conference Call\nA conference call for investors and media will be hosted by CEO Peter Wennink and CFO Wolfgang Nickl at 15:00 Central European Time / 09:00 AM U.S. Eastern time.

More information about ASML, our products and technology, and career opportunities is available on www.asml.com .\nUS GAAP and IFRS Financial Reporting\nASML's primary accounting standard for quarterly earnings releases and annual reports is US GAAP, the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Quarterly US GAAP consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of cash flows and consolidated balance sheets, and a reconciliation of net income from US GAAP to IFRS as adopted by the EU ('IFRS') are available on www.asml.com .\nThe comparative figures in the consolidated balance sheets, the related consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for the quarter and year ended, are presented without taking into account the new accounting standards ASC 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and ASC 842 - Leases.\nIn addition to reporting financial figures in accordance with US GAAP, ASML also reports financial figures in accordance with IFRS for statutory purposes. The most significant differences between US GAAP and IFRS that affect ASML concern the capitalization of certain product development costs and the accounting of income taxes.
