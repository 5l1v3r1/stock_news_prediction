He also wanted Shkreli to cover the legal costs he incurred in trying to redeem his MSMB hedge funds investment and more than $200 in costs related to his testimony at Shkreli's trial. \nMatsumoto, however, said Shkreli would have to pay Kochher only $388,336.49. \nThat amount, the judge noted, represents Kocher's lost profits from the real estate deal and his legal costs related to the hedge fund fraud, less the value of the $390,421.14 in Retrophin stock and cash he previously got as a settlement from Shkreli. \nA message left at Kocher's office requesting comment on Matsumoto's order was not immediately answered. \nShkreli's lawyer Brafman declined to comment on the order. \nBrafman last month filed a notice of appeal of Shkreli's conviction. \nThat appeal will play out while Shkreli remains locked up in federal custody in a Brooklyn, New York, jail, where he has been since last September. \nShkreli landed in jail when Matsumoto revoked his $5 million bail after saying he represented a threat because of his offer of a $5,000 bounty for each strand of hair from the head of Hillary Clinton provided to him by his Facebook followers. \nThe U.S. Bureau of Prisons has yet to disclose where it intends to send Shkreli to serve the remainder of his sentence. \nBrafman has asked for Shkreli to do his time in a minimum security federal camp adjacent to the U.S. Penitentiary Canaan in northeastern Pennsylvania , or another such facility near New York City. Matsumoto has endorsed Brafman's request, but her recommendation is not binding. \nShkreli gained notoriety in 2015 while heading another drug company, then known as Turing Pharmaceuticals, and raising the price of its drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent . The drug is used to treat a parasitic condition found in pregnant women, babies and HIV-infected people.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:14:54.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
