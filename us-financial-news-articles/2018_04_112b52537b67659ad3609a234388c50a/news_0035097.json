Bostic also voted to raise the Fed’s benchmark policy rate at the March 20-21 meeting.\nThe Fed’s regional bank presidents take turns voting on monetary policy and the heads of the Chicago and Minneapolis Fed banks do not have a vote this year.\nReporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:54:27.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
