Higher rates will make it harder for companies to refinance and will put pressure on them once the stimulative effects of tax cuts wear off, Minerd said.\nOnce short-term rates hit 3 percent, that will be enough to drive up defaults and cause a recession, he added.\n\"As interest rates keep ratcheting higher, with record levels of corporate debt it's going to be harder and harder to service,\" Minerd said. \"At some point, as the economy starts to mature and as cash flows start to stabilize and decline, it's going to be difficult for everybody to pay this interest.\"\n\"Defaults are going to be concentrated in corporate America, where in the past downturn they were basically focused in areas of consumer activity,\" he added.\nFrom there, Minerd figures the Fed will get involved, going back to the quantitative easing policies that helped pull the economy out of the last recession and pushed a surge in stock market prices but also coincided with lackluster economic growth.\n\"All that will do is defer the problem into the future and allow excesses to continue to build and the collision course that we're on will just come later and probably be worse,\" he said.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T13:03:38.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
