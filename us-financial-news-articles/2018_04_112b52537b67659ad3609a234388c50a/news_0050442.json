A lower operating ratio shows improvement in profitability.\nThe railroad struggled to reign in expenses, which increased 4 percent to $1.9 billion from the year-ago period, although higher fuel prices and costs from slower train speeds were partly offset by efficiency gains.\nQuarterly revenue increased 6 percent to $2.7 billion from the first quarter of 2017, driven by a 3 percent rise in overall cargo volumes. Consumer goods grew 8 percent, which offset declines in merchandise and coal volumes.\nAnalysts expected $2.68 billion in revenue.\nNorfolk Southern said first-quarter net income rose to $552 million, or $1.93 cents per share, from $443 million, or $1.48 per share a year earlier.\nThe railroad said it was increasing its expected annual share repurchases to $1.5 billion for 2018.\nReporting by Eric M.
