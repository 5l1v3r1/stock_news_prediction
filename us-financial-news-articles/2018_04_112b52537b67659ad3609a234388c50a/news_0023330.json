Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" were also being used to dovetail with human workers and make production lines more flexible.\n\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "https://twitter.com/cnbci"], "published": "2018-04-11T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T10:53:58.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
