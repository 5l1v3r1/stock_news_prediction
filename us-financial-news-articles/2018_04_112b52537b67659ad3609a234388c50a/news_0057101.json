It has been hitting record lows for five straight sessions through Friday.\nThe rupee has fallen 0.9 percent so far this week and 1.5 percent this month.\n“It was a buyer’s market today. The demand was there. There were some exporter (dollar) conversions in the morning but the persistent demand was there,” a currency dealer said.\nSome dealers said dollar purchases by oil importers, who usually buy dollars from banks, weighed on the currency.\nThe rupee has weakened 2.7 percent so far this year. It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 1.8 billion rupees ($11.5 million) so far this year through April 18, central bank data showed.\nStock, bond and foreign exchange markets are closed on Monday for a public holiday and markets will resume trading on Tuesday.
