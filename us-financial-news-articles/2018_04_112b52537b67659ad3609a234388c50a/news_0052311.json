This decrease reflects the impact of the lower margins for Channel Frederator Network and on owned IP compared to animation production service work. In addition, the Company recorded a $0.3 million provision against tax credits receivable for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to no provision in 2016.\nAmortization of investment in film and television\nAmortization of investment in film and television during the year relates primarily to the amortization of productions completed during 2017 including Reboot: The Guardian Code and Castlevania Season 1 .\nFinance costs\nThe decrease in overall finance costs from 2016 to 2017 of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, is largely due to a decrease in interest expense on convertible debentures which were settled as part of the Company’s series of acquisitions and reorganizations which occurred in December 2016 (the “Reorganization”).\nDepreciation and amortization\nThe increase in depreciation and amortisation during the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily related to the $4.3 million in amortization expense for the year, for the identified intangible assets that were acquired as part of the Reorganization.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company reports using certain supplemental indicators of the Company’s financial and operating performance in addition to results reported in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“GAAP”). These measures are referred to as non-GAAP measures, and include operating earnings, operating earnings per share and operating EBITDA. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures reflect the Company's ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in its business.\nThe Company defines operating profit or loss as net profit or loss excluding the impact of specified items affecting comparability, including, where applicable, share of loss of equity accounted investees, other non-operational income and expenses, deferred taxes and other gains or losses. The use of the term \"non-operational income and expenses\" is defined by the Company as those that do not impact operating decisions taken by the Company's management and is based upon the way the Company's management evaluates the performance of the Company's business for use in the Company's internal management reports. Operating profit or loss per share is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding and does not represent actual profit or loss per share attributable to shareholders. The Company believes that the disclosure of operating profit or loss and operating profit or loss per share allows investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company's ongoing business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indicator of the Company's performance or expected performance of recurring operations.\nThe Company defines operating EBITDA as profit or loss net of amortization of investment in film and television, but before interest, taxes, corporate expenses, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for certain items affecting comparability as specified in the calculation of operating profit or loss. Operating EBITDA is presented on a basis consistent with the Company's internal management reports. The Company discloses operating EBITDA to capture the profitability of its business before the impact of items not considered in management's evaluation of operating performance. Unless otherwise stated, the Company includes the amortization of investment in film and television in the calculation of EBITDA.\nOperating profit or loss, operating profit or loss per share and operating EBITDA do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company cautions readers to consider these non-IFRS financial measures in addition to, and not as an alternative for, measures calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.
