Both the Western-backed government in Kabul and the main Islamist militant group, the Taliban, fight Islamic State.\nThe militant group first appeared in Afghanistan three years ago. As well as its main stronghold in the eastern province of Nangarhar, on the border with Pakistan, its fighters have been active in northern Afghanistan.\nWhile sectarian violence in mainly Sunni Muslim Afghanistan was previously rare, a series of attacks over recent years, many claimed by IS, have killed hundreds of Shi’ites.\nReporting by Hamid Shalizi in Kabul; Writing by Rod Nickel in Kabul; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T11:44:20.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
