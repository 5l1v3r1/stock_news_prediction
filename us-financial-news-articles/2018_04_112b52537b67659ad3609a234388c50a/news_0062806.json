The data showed China's services extending its solid run in April, while activity in the manufacturing sector slowed slightly. Published 15 Hours Ago Reuters\nActivity in China's vast manufacturing sector eased in April, as export orders slowed in another sign of ebbing economic growth, while a simmering Sino-U.S. trade row heightened risks for the industrial sector.\nThe official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) released on Monday fell to 51.4 in April, from 51.5 in March, but remained well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. It marked the 21st straight month of expanding business conditions in China.\nAnalysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast the index would ease slightly to 51.3.

The official services PMI rose to 54.8 from 54.6 in March, extending a solid run of activity.\nThe services sector accounts for over half of China's economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.\nThe composite PMI covering both manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.1 in April, from March's 54, well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T05:41:35.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
