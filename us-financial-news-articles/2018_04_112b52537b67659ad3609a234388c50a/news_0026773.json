REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo \nIreland’s economy has been the best performing in Europe since 2014 and the Finance Ministry, whose figures form the basis of the government’s budget policies, previously predicted GDP growth of 3.5 percent for 2018 and 3.2 percent for 2019. \nThe sharp upgrade for this year surpasses the country’s central bank which last week increased its GDP forecasts to 4.8 percent. It predicts growth of 4.2 percent in 2019.
