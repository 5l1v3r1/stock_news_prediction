The Oficina de Envigado was placed on the list in June 2014.\n“This de-listing demonstrates that Treasury sanctions to combat drug cartels can effectively disrupt their ingrained financial investments and hinder their long-term plans to launder money through the sports industry,” Mandelker said in the statement.\nThe team, based near the central city of Medellin, is well-known for training rising stars.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T19:27:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
