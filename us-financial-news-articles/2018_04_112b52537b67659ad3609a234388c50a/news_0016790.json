The kiosks large size makes them able to hold items as big as televisions, Walmart said. \nThe addition of Pickup Towers at its various stores is another way Walmart is trying to adapt to more people wanting to shop for goods online, which has greatly benefited its huge competitor Amazon . \nAmazon (amzn) , for its part, has been debuting similar projects, including its Instant Pickup program, in which people can retrieve their purchased goods from giant Amazon-sanctioned vending machines scattered around different city locales. \nThe online retail giant also recently launched its Hub delivery lockers , which can be installed in condo or apartment complexes so that people can pick up their deliveries where they live. \nWalmart said it is “testing additional concepts, similar to the Pickup Tower,” in a corporate blog post after referencing a recent partnership with Google to let people place Walmart orders while speaking to search giant’s voice-activated digital assistant. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nAs Google (goog) and Walmart both compete with Amazon in areas like voice assistants and online retail, among other areas, people should expect these companies to continue teaming up against the Jeff Bezos-led behometh.
