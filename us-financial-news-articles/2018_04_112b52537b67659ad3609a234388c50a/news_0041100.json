After that, gift cards will be worthless.\nToys ‘R’ Us gift card holders are actually lucky, despite the time crunch. Sometimes, gift cards become useless as soon as a chain files for bankruptcy, according to giftcards.com . Courts must grant struggling companies permission to continue honoring gift cards after a bankruptcy filing, and even then they are often accepted only for a limited time.\nLiquidation sales began at Toys ‘R’ Us locations across the country in March, and the company has shut down its e-commerce site. All purchases made during these sales are final.
