REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nWilliam and Kate’s third child follows siblings George and Charlotte and pushes Harry down a place to sixth in line to the throne.\nWilliam’s wedding role means he will miss English soccer’s FA Cup final because it clashes with the May 19 ceremony, media reported. William, President of the Football Association, usually presents the trophy to the winners.\nHarry and Markle have invited 600 guests to their wedding and a lunchtime reception afterwards at Windsor, with another 200 attending a private evening event at nearby Frogmore House.\nNo political leaders are among the invitees. The guests will be people who have an existing direct relationship with the groom or the bride.\nHowever, the couple have invited 1,200 members of the public into the grounds of Windsor Castle as part of the celebrations.
