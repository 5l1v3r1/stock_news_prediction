I hope it’s not my last goal of the season and not my last game.” \nAtletico coach Diego Simeone said: “Fernando made a very important contribution today and so did everyone in the team. \n“We scored three lovely goals and we played exactly how we needed to. Once again, given the small squad we have, we continue to respond in a spectacular way.” \nAtletico are second in the standings on 71 points, 11 behind Barca and seven ahead of Real Madrid, who are fourth in the table but can climb above Valencia and into third if they win at basement club Malaga later on Sunday. \nLevante had won three and drawn one of their last four games under new coach Paco Lopez to ease their fears of relegation but Deportivo La Coruna’s win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday means they are now only five points above the drop zone.
