Ramos said no such evidence was presented. \nThe judge also held that New York law “protects the rightful owner’s property where that property had been stolen, even if the property is in the possession of a good faith purchaser.” \nRaymond Dowd, lawyer for the Grunbaum heirs - named in the case as Timothy Reif, David Frankel and Milos Vavra - hailed the decision as a landmark in bringing justice to Holocaust victims. \nThe ruling, he said, “brought us a step closer to recovering all of the culture that was stolen during the largest mass theft in history, which until now, has been overshadowed by history’s largest mass murder.” Reporting and writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Michael Perry", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T06:20:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
