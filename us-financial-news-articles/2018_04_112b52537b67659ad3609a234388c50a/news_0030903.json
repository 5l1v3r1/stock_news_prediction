The financial details of the deal were not disclosed in a blog post bit.ly/2J1onsd by Coinbase, but tech publication Recode reported that the transaction was worth slightly more than $100 million. \nFormerly known as 21 Inc, Earn.com started out as a bitcoin mining startup, but eventually became a cryptocurrency-based professional networking platform that allows users to earn bitcoin by answering emails and completing other tasks. \nSrinivasan was formerly a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. \nThe Earn.com deal follows Coinbase’s acquisition last week of Cipher Browser, a mobile decentralized application browser and wallet. \nCoinbase is the largest cryptocurrency company in the world and was most recently valued at $1.6 billion, according to PitchBook.
