Padres starter Luis Perdomo and Arenado received five-game suspensions after Arenado charged the mound when Perdomo’s pitch sailed behind the third baseman.\nColorado outfielder Gerardo Parra began serving his four-game suspension Sunday. Padres pitcher Buddy Baumann was also suspended.\nThere were no fireworks Monday, except in San Diego’s seventh-inning rally that blew open a close game. The Padres trailed 5-4 before erupting on Colorado’s bullpen.\nCordero started the rally with a two-run homer off Rockies lefty Jake McGee (0-1), and he singled later in the inning. After Myers singled and Eric Hosmer walked, Scott Oberg relieved McGee but struggled.\nAfter Oberg got Jose Pirela to ground into a fielder’s choice, Asuaje had an RBI hit and Cory Spangenberg and Matt Szczur each had two-run singles. Myers, who also had two hits in the seventh, finished the rally with a two-run double off Antonio Senzatela.\nBoth teams started the game swinging the bats. The Padres took a 4-0 lead on Colorado starter Chad Bettis in the top of the first inning, backed by Asuaje’s three-run home run.\nThe Rockies quickly tied it on two-run home runs from Arenado and Story, then went ahead 5-4 in the third inning on a double by Ian Desmond.\nSan Diego starter Bryan Mitchell allowed five runs on eight hits in 5 1/3 innings and left with his team trailing. Robbie Erlin (1-2) struck out both batters he faced in relief of Mitchell.\nBettis yielded four runs on five hits in five innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T12:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:23:49.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
