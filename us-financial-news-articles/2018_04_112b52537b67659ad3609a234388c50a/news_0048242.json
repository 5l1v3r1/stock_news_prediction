Supervalu has invested heavily on its e-commerce strategy, including home delivery and picking up in stores products bought online.\nBut Chief Executive Officer Mark Gross said the company is fit to compete.\n“As food becomes more and more fragmented and there are more and more places that are selling food... they might not necessarily have the distribution network to fully embrace all food, particularly in the cold chain,” said Gross.\n“We’re very comfortable.”\nShares of the Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based company rose about 3.5 percent to $15.12 in extended trading.\nThe company also said on Tuesday that it was pursuing the sale of its grocery store chain Shop ‘n Save in St. Louis and the chain’s retail operations along the East Coast. In March, Supervalu said it would sell 21 of its 38 Farm Fresh Food and Pharmacy stores for about $43 million in a bid to steer its resources away from the retail business and remake itself as a distributor.\nExcluding certain items, the company earned 61 cents per share, missing the average analysts’ estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company also forecast net sales for fiscal 2019 to be $15.5 billion to $15.7 billion. Analysts on an average are expecting revenue of $17.16 billion.\nReporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; editing by Arun Koyyur and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T01:44:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
