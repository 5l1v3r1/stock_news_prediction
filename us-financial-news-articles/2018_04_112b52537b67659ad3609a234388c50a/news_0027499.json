They were set to end the week up around 2 basis points, the biggest weekly rise since early February.\nThere was some focus on Spain ahead of a Moody’s ratings review later in the day.\nSpain, one of the strongest-performing euro zone bond markets so far this year, has seen its ratings lifted to single A territory by Fitch and S&P Global in recent months.\nMoody’s rates Spain at Baa2, two notches below the Fitch and S&P ratings for Spain, making an upgrade on Friday a possibility, analysts said.\n“There is the feeling in the market that the factors resulting in the Fitch and S&P upgrades are likely to draw a similar response from Moody’s,” analysts at Mizuho said in a note.
