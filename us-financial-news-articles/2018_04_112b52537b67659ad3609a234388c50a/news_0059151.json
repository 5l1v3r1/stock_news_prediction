EURO STRENGTH BITES\nSanofi said a stronger euro had a negative effect of 8.3 percent on sales in the first quarter. Over the full year, the hit from currency swings is seen at around 7 percent on earnings per share compared with a previous estimate of 3-4 percent.\nDiabetes and cardiovascular sales were down 15.7 percent - a new insulin missed estimates - but revenue at the specialty care Genzyme unit rose 16.2 percent.\nSanofi agreed in January to buy U.S hemophilia specialist Bioverativ BIVV.O for $11.6 billion and Belgium’s Ablynx ( ABLX.BR ), which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros.\nIt is also in exclusive talks with private equity firm Advent International to sell its Zentiva European generics drugs arm for 1.9 billion euros.\nFollowing the integration of Bioverativ and Ablynx, Sanofi reported sales of 64 million euros in a new rare blood disorder franchise.\nSanofi is still grappling with a health scare surrounding its world-first dengue vaccine in the Philippines that shows no sign of abating. Separately, some investors have said the firm is still lacking a robust portfolio of new drugs.\nSanofi hopes its hiring of former Roche ( ROG.S ) top scientist John Reed to head its research operations from July 1 will help soothe those concerns. He will replace departing industry veteran Elias Zerhouni when he retires.\nAsked whether the group’s dengue vaccine still had a future after the World Health Organization recommended Dengvaxia should only be used after testing, Brandicourt reiterated his confidence in the drug.\n“Dengvaxia has a very important role in the future to play. What we have experienced may be something that will happen to other vaccines in development against dengue.”\nJapan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ), the United States National Institute of Health and Brazil’s Butantan Institute are developing rival products.\n($1 = 0.8263 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T13:18:11.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
