It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nThe central bank has bought around $400 million from the market in the first three months of this year to help build reserves and repay some debt. \nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government. \nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 1.8 billion rupees ($11.48 million) so far this year through April 18, the central bank data showed.
