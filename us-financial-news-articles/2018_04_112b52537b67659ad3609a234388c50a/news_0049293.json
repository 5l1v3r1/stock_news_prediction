The targets were the online services of banks, business sector and public institutions across the globe.\nThe cyber attacks were aimed at slowing down or blocking online services by directing a huge amount of data traffic towards a particular website.\nEvery user of Webstresser.org could buy access to online DDoS infrastructure for attacking web sites for a price starting at 15 euros, police said.\nThe arrested Croat will be charged for criminal acts against computer systems. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to eight years.\nThe Croatian police said they had cooperated with forces from The Netherlands, Great Britain, Canada, Spain, Italy, Serbia and Hong Kong in an international action where many helpers and users of the DDoS service were also arrested.\nAndrei Barysevich, a researcher and dark web expert at security firm Recorded Future, said so-called “stressors’ often portray themselves as legitimate services to assist security engineers to test the resilience of corporate networks against extreme traffic loads while explicitly barring any illegal use.\n“In reality, such policies are just a facade, designed to create the appearance of legitimacy,” Barysevich said.\nAlongside other similar services, Webstresser has been openly operating in the darknet since 2015 and was a commonly recommended solution for turn-key DDoS attacks.\nBarysevich cautioned that since there are more than 50 underground DDoS vendors offering such services: “I am afraid the problem is not likely to be solved any time soon.”\nReporting by Igor Ilic in Zagreb; additional reporting by Eric Auchard in London; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T20:02:55.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
