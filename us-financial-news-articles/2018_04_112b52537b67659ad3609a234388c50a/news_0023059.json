REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File Photo \nThat, coupled with the latest data which showed Asia’s third-largest economy beat China to regain top spot as the fastest growing major economy. That should give policymakers some relief as they seek to keep inflation under control without hurting growth. \nAnnual consumer price inflation INCPIY=ECI was expected to have softened to 4.20 percent in March from February’s 4.44 percent, according to a poll of 35 economists taken April 4-10. \nForecasts ranged from 3.90 to 5.10 percent. \nIf the consensus matches the actual release, it would be the smallest annual increase in retail prices since October. It would also mark the third consecutive month of easing after hitting a 17-month high in December. \n“We anticipate a slight easing in the headline inflation number. The current softening is not broad-based and is primarily limited to the food category,” said Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank. \nWhile inflation has stayed above the RBI’s medium-term target of 4.0 percent, the central bank kept its repo rate on hold last week and sharply cut its projection for price rises from April through September. \nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) lowered its inflation forecast for April-September to 4.7-5.1 percent from 5.1-5.6 given at the February meeting.

[RBI/INT] \nThe wholesale price index INWPI=ECI increased slightly to 2.58 percent in March from February’s 2.48 percent, the latest poll found. \nIndustrial production INIP=ECI in February slowed to 7.0 percent annually from 7.5 percent in January, the poll also showed. \nIndia’s infrastructure output, which comprises eight core industries and accounts for nearly 40 percent of total industrial production, grew 5.3 percent in February from a year ago.
