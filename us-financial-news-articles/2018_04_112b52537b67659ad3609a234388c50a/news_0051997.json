The Chinese banks, he said, make good investments because they're paying higher dividends now than they did last year.\nThe financial sector will benefit generally from higher interest rates, Duhra said. Banks in Malaysia and Singapore , for example, are also paying improved dividends and have seen risks recede.\n\"North Asia is still the favorite exposure for us, but dividend growth is coming through in many different sectors and countries,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T08:08:10.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
