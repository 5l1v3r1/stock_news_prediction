REUTERS/Denis Balibouse//File Photo Philips, which flagged in February its quarterly earnings would be weak, made adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation (EBITA) of 106 million euros ($129 million), down from 127 million euros in the same period a year ago.\nAnalysts polled for Reuters had seen EBITA rising to 129 million euros.\nAt 0730 GMT, Philips shares were down 10.1 percent at 27.00 euros.\nThe drop in earnings was “mainly due to a weak performance in Home, most notably in the United States,” said CEO Eric Rondolat in a statement, referring to a division that focuses on newer technologies in lighting such as its Hue line of networked LED lights that can be adjusted by mobile phone.\nEBITA at its traditional lamps business, which is highly profitable but in long-term decline, fell to 78 million euros from 100 million a year earlier, as better margins could not compensate for a 24 percent drop in sales.\nGroup sales fell 3.5 percent to 1.50 billion euros, while EBITA margins slipped to 7.0 percent from 7.5 percent.\nOn a call with reporters, Rondolat said the weakness at the Home division came after resellers had built up excess inventory for the holiday season and were working through it - the reason for the February warning.\n“Our other three businesses (lamps, LEDs and professional lighting) further improved their operational profitability,” particularly the professional division, Rondolat said.\nING analyst Marc Zwartsenburg said in a note the results made “the investment case weaker as Professional and Home lighting are the future growth drivers.”\nHe repeated a “hold” rating on the shares.\nBright spots in the earnings included a note that declines in LED prices are slowing. The company also kept its full-year forecast for EBITA margins of 10-10.5 percent, with growing sales.\n($1 = 0.8214 euros)\n(This version of the story corrects “suppliers” to “resellers” in paragraph 8)\nReporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and MarkPotter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:36:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
