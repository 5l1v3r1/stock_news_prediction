(OFAC)\n“OFAC issued a second license explicitly unblocking Sulzer assets to the extent these were blocked,” a Sulzer spokesman said on Saturday.\n“Sulzer is fully back to normal,” he said.\nReporting by John Revill; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T16:58:47.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
