I stayed with riders I probably should have and would have been able to drop if I needed to. \n“I think we could have fought no matter which circuit it would have been this weekend.” \nFrenchman Johann Zarco finished a close second for Tech3 Yamaha after a last lap battle for the lead while Honda’s reigning world champion Marc Marquez was penalised for a collision with Yamaha’s Italian great Valentino Rossi. \nSpaniard Alex Rins was third for Suzuki, his first MotoGP podium, at the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit. \nThe race start was delayed for safety reasons amid farcical scenes, with rain before the event leaving all riders except Australian pole sitter Jack Miller on wet weather tyres. The fast-improving conditions then triggered a mass return to the pits for a change of tyres with only Miller’s Pramac Ducati remaining on the grid. \nOrganisers decided, after consultations with team bosses in order to avoid a mass start from the pits, to leave Miller alone out front and several rows clear of the others after grid penalties. \nMarquez then stalled, the four-times MotoGP champion wheeling the bike clear, bump-starting it and then riding the wrong way down the track to resume his starting position against the rules. \nMarquez quickly reeled the Australian in and passed him before receiving a ride-through penalty for the start infringement, knocking him back to 19th. \nMiller, Rins, Zarco and Crutchlow broke clear with all four leading in turn while Marquez and Rossi tangled with four laps to go. \nThe Spaniard was handed a 30 second penalty, dropping him down to 18th with Rossi, who went off track and fell following the collision before resuming, in 19th. \nThe next race is in Texas, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, on April 22.
