REUTERS/David Gray Gentle gave Jake Birtwhistle a 40-second buffer over Alistair Brownlee that the individual silver medalist held to give their team, which also included Gillian Backhouse and Matt Hauser, the gold.\nEach of the two male and two female competitors completed a 250-metre swim, seven kilometer bike ride and 1,500-metre run in the race.\nHauser and Jonny Brownlee had been locked together at the halfway stage before Gentle put pressure on Learmonth to open up the gap they needed.\nAustralia finished in a combined time of one hour, 17 minutes and 36 seconds, with Alistair Brownlee crossing the line 52 seconds later.
