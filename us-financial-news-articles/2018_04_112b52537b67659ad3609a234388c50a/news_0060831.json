Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), America’s Builder, today reported that net income attributable to D.R. Horton for the second fiscal quarter increased 53% to $351.0 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, compared to $229.2 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. Homebuilding revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 16% to $3.7 billion from $3.2 billion in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. Homes closed in the quarter increased 15% to 12,281 homes compared to 10,685 homes closed in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The current quarter results included $30.1 million of pre-tax inventory and land option charges to cost of sales, of which $24.5 million related to the settlement of an outstanding dispute associated with a land transaction.\nFor the six months ended March 31, 2018, net income attributable to D.R. Horton increased 24% to $540.3 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, compared to $436.1 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in the same period of fiscal 2017.

The six-month period ended March 31, 2018 included a one-time non-cash income tax charge of $108.7 million to re-measure the Company’s net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act.\nNet sales orders for the second quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 13% to 15,828 homes and 13% in value to $4.7 billion compared to 13,991 homes and $4.2 billion in the same quarter of the prior year.

Net sales orders for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 14% to 26,581 homes and 15% in value to $8.0 billion compared to 23,232 homes and $7.0 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company’s homes in inventory at March 31, 2018 increased 8% to 29,400 homes compared to 27,100 homes at March 31, 2017. The Company's homebuilding land and lot portfolio at March 31, 2018 increased 13% to 257,700 lots, of which 48% were owned and 52% were controlled through option contracts, compared to 227,300 lots at March 31, 2017, of which 52% were owned and 48% were controlled through option contracts.\nThe Company ended the second quarter with $528.9 million of homebuilding unrestricted cash and a homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of 24.2%. Homebuilding debt to total capital consists of homebuilding notes payable divided by stockholders’ equity plus homebuilding notes payable.\nDonald R. Horton, Chairman of the Board, said, “The D.R. Horton team delivered strong results in our second quarter. Net income in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 53% to $351 million on a 17% increase in consolidated revenues to $3.8 billion. Our pre-tax profit margin improved 80 basis points to 11.7%, and our net sales orders increased 13%. These results reflect the strength of our experienced operational teams, diverse product offerings from our family of brands and solid market conditions across our broad national footprint.\n“Our balance sheet strength, liquidity and continued earnings growth are increasing our strategic and financial flexibility, and we plan to maintain our disciplined, opportunistic position to enhance the long-term value of our company. We continue to expect to grow our revenues and pre-tax profits at a double-digit annual pace, while generating increasing annual operating cash flows and returns. With 29,400 homes in inventory at the end of March and 258,000 lots owned and controlled, we are well-positioned for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and future years.”\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company paid cash dividends of $47.1 million and repurchased 500,000 shares of common stock for $22.5 million.

Horton reaffirms its previously issued fiscal 2018 guidance for other metrics including:\nHomebuilding SG&A expense of around 8.7% of homebuilding revenues Financial services operating margin of approximately 30% Outstanding share count increase of less than 1%\nPresentation\nConsistent with fiscal 2018, the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations present its homebuilding, Forestar land development, financial services and other operations on a combined basis.
