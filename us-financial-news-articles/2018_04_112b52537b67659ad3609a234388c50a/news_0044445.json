The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down.\nInvestors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.9173 percent, its highest since Feb. 21.\nThe 30-year bond fell 1-7/32 in price to yield 3.1097 percent, from 3.046 percent late on Wednesday.\nThe dollar rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies as the higher yields and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate increases offset concerns about a trade war and a ballooning U.S. budget deficit.\nAdditional reporting by Maytaal Angel in London, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Richard Leong and David Gaffen in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T03:57:16.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
