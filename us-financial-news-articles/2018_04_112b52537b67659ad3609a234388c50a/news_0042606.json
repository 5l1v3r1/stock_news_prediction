We all remember how those pledges and commitments went down over past decades,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul.

CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee to become the next secretary of state, secretly visited North Korea and met with Kim to discuss the summit three weeks ago. \nSenator Tom Cotton, told CBS’“Face the Nation” he hoped the three Americans detained by North Korea would be released before any meeting. The Republican was unimpressed by the North’s overture, saying it “is better than continued testing but it’s not much better than that.” \nU.S. officials say North Korea had in the past repeatedly reneged on denuclearisation agreements, the latest in 2012 when the North launched a long-range rocket after agreeing to a moratorium on missile testing. \nWhite House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” the U.S. goal remains “full denuclearisation” in which Pyongyang no longer has nuclear weapons. Slideshow (4 Images) PROGRESS OR EMPTY PROMISES? \nSouth Korea said the North’s testing pledge signified “meaningful” progress that would create good conditions for successful summits with Seoul and Washington. \nMoon, who welcomed Kim’s announcement as a “major” step towards denuclearisation, is making Friday’s summit his sole focus this week, a Blue House official said on Sunday. \nFor the past few weeks, South Korea has been renovating Peace House, on its side of Panmunjom, to prepare for the summit with Kim, who will be the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the 1950-1953 Korean War. \nMoon now has a direct phone link with Kim on his office desk, instead of having to communicate through a hotline at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, which had been the main channel between the two sides over the Winter Olympics in February. \nThe two leaders are expected to talk over the newly installed phone for the first time this week, before the summit, South Korea said on Friday. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS ) \nA senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Susan Thornton, called North Korea’s latest announcement “a very positive step” as she started a three-day visit to Seoul on Sunday. \n“We are going to be doing a lot of close coordination with South Korea, allies and partners this week,” the Yonhap news agency quoted her as saying. \nCorker said Washington needed to be clear-headed about what a meeting with Kim could accomplish. \n“To think that somebody’s going to go in and charm him out of that is not realistic,” he told the ABC “This Week” programme. “Is there some progress that can be made? I hope so, but that’s a big hurdle.” \n(GRAPHIC: Lines of communication with North Korea tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS ) Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Heekyong Yang in Seoul; Additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Haejin Choi in Seoul; Editing by Stephen Coates and Lisa Shumaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T11:55:26.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
