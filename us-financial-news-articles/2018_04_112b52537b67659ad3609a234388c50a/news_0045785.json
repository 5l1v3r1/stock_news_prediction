The annual list spotlights the 100 most influential women in Silicon Valley from the public, private and nonprofit sectors.\n“It is an honor to be recognized along with some of the brightest and most influential women in Silicon Valley,” said Garde. “Cybersecurity is a dynamic industry under constant adaptation and evolution, and it impacts everyone whether through imperceptible backend technology or high-profile privacy initiatives like GDPR. I hope my influence in this industry will encourage more women to choose a career path at high-tech companies.”\nAs general counsel at Centrify, Garde oversees the company’s worldwide legal affairs, including corporate governance, intellectual property, data protection, transactions, litigation management, international, employment and real estate.\nPrior to Centrify, Garde held legal positions at public and privately-held companies including BloomReach, Marin Software and VMware.
