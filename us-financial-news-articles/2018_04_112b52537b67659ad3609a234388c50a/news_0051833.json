That's a steal compared to the $2.3 million the rapper paid for the 6,026-square-foot home in 2002 .\nTweet\nWith an estimated net worth of $18 million , Lil Kim has more value than her home, though she struggled to pay mortgage for years. This prompted HSBC Bank to initiate foreclosure in 2010, according to NJ.com.

The two-acre property is located in Alpine, a posh neighborhood just minutes from Manhattan, which is one of the wealthiest zip codes in America . The median home value in Alpine is $2.9 million, with notable homeowners including comedian Chris Rock and President Donald Trump's adviser Kellyanne Conway .\n39 Timberline Drive, soon to be Lil Kim's former address, is estimated to be worth $3 million .\nLike this story?
