Only Russia pumps more crude, at almost 11 million bpd.\nIn a sign that oil supplies remain ample, China's Sinopec and several other Asian refiners plan to cut Saudi crude imports in May, instead buying from alternative sources, after Saudi Aramco set higher-than-expected official prices, a company official said on Monday.\nJPMorgan said it expects Brent and WTI prices to average $69.50 and $65.20 per barrel in 2018, respectively, while it forecasts $64 per barrel for Brent and $58.50 per barrel for WTI in 2019.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Gopakumar Warrier)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:08:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
