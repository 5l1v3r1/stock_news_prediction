(NYSE: HF) (the Company or HFF) reported today its financial and production volume results for the first quarter of 2018. Based on transaction volume, HFF is one of the leading and largest full-service commercial real estate financial intermediaries, providing commercial real estate and capital markets services to both the consumers and providers of capital in the commercial real estate sector.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenue was $131.6 million, a 5.2% decrease year-over-year. Net income was $17.1 million, as compared to $19.7 million in the prior year period. Net income per diluted share was $0.42, as compared to $0.50 in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $20.7 million versus $32.5 million in the prior year period.\n“We remain confident in the industry’s fundamental drivers and HFF’s market position, as we look beyond our first quarter results. Many of the factors that impacted this quarter’s results primarily pertain to the Company’s continued investment in its platform and people, which historically have proven effective. We believe the combination of our unique partnership culture, the synergies and diversification afforded by our capital markets centric business model, our strong balance sheet, and the strategic investments we continue to make enable us to add value and provide best in class services to our clients while positioning the Company for future growth,” said Mark Gibson, chief executive officer of HFF.\nResults for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2018\nThe Company’s revenues were $131.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, which represents a decrease of $7.2 million, or 5.2% compared to revenue of $138.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Company generated operating income of $2.7 million during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $18.1 million, or 87.0% when compared to operating income of $20.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. This decrease in operating income is primarily due to the 5.2% decrease in revenues and additionally, due to (i) increases in the Company’s compensation-related costs and other expenses associated with the net growth in headcount of 85 associates during the last twelve months, (ii) the payment of an additional compensation award, as described below, (iii) an increase in non-cash stock compensation and (iv) increases in other operating expenses due to the increase in headcount.\nInterest and other income, net, grew 40.6% to $15.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily a result of an increase in securitization compensation and higher income from the valuation of the Company’s mortgage servicing rights which was partially offset by a decrease in other agency-related income. The Company reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $17.1 million, a decrease of approximately $2.6 million, or 13.2%, when compared to net income of $19.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 net income per diluted share was $0.42 compared to $0.50 for the first quarter of 2017. Net income per diluted share benefited by approximately $0.06 from the reduction in statutory corporate federal tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act and benefited by $0.11 from the additional tax deductions related to equity compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure whose reconciliation to net income can be found within this release) for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 36.2% to $20.7 million, compared to $32.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. This decrease in Adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the decrease in operating income. The Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 15.7%, compared to the Adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nAdditional Compensation Award\nIn the first quarter 2018, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Compensation Committee) approved an additional compensation award which included cash payments and restricted stock awards (the Omnibus Awards) with a total award value of $8.4 million to certain members of the Company's Leadership Team. The award recognized those individuals who played key roles in the Company’s growth and extraordinary operating performance, and also the Company’s future leaders. The additional compensation award included cash payments in the amount of approximately $4.2 million, which amount was included in the operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018. The impact of these cash payments was a decrease in operating income and Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter by $4.2 million. The cash payments associated with the additional compensation award also decreased earnings for the first quarter 2018 by approximately $0.08 per diluted share.\nThe additional compensation award granted by the Compensation Committee under the Omnibus Awards included restricted stock awards with a grant date value of $4.2 million, which are subject to vesting conditions. The equity compensation expense associated with the Omnibus Awards had no material impact to operating income or net income for the first quarter 2018.\nHFF, Inc.

The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA in its business operations to, among other things, evaluate the performance of its business, develop budgets and measure its performance against those budgets. The Company also believes that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate its overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. The Company finds Adjusted EBITDA to be a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because it eliminates items related to capital structure and taxes, including the Company’s tax receivable agreement. Note that the Company classifies the interest expense on its warehouse lines of credit as an operating expense and, accordingly, it is not eliminated from net income in determining Adjusted EBITDA. Some of the items that the Company has eliminated from net income in determining Adjusted EBITDA are significant to the Company’s business. For example, (i) interest expense is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and ability to generate revenue because it incurs interest expense related to any outstanding indebtedness, (ii) payment of income taxes is a necessary element of the Company’s costs and (iii) depreciation and amortization are necessary elements of the Company’s costs.\nAny measure that eliminates components of the Company’s capital structure and costs associated with the Company’s operations has material limitations as a performance measure. In light of the foregoing limitations, the Company does not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also considers its GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nSet forth below is an unaudited reconciliation of consolidated net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Company is calculated as follows: (dollars in thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 17,068 $ 19,656 Add: Interest expense 5 7 Income tax expense 805 11,895 Depreciation and amortization 5,481 3,667 Stock-based compensation (a) 5,752 3,906 Valuation of mortgage servicing rights (8,405 ) (6,674 ) Increase (decrease) in payable under the tax\nreceivable agreement\n- - Adjusted EBITDA $ 20,706 $ 32,457 (a) Amounts do not reflect expense associated with the stock component of estimated incentive payouts under the Company’s firm profit participation plan, office profit participation plans and executive bonus plan that are anticipated to be paid in respect of the applicable year. Such expense is recorded as incentive compensation expense within personnel expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income during the year to which the expense relates. Following the award, if any, of the related incentive payout, the stock component expense is reclassified as stock compensation costs within personnel expenses. See Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in the quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for further information regarding the Company’s accounting policies relating to its firm profit participation plan, office profit participation plans and executive bonus plan.
