They have been grabbing market share away from traditional tobacco companies, and are available in different flavors.\nThe FDA said that such products are also more difficult for parents and teachers to recognize or detect, potentially adding to its appeal for the youth.\nJuul Labs, launched in 2015, brands its products as an alternative for adult smokers. The San Francisco-based firm offers a number of products designed for tobacco as an alternative to ordinary cigarettes, including e-cigarettes and vaporizers.\nJuul in a statement said it agreed \"with the FDA that illegal sales of our product to minors is unacceptable\" and would announce \"more aggressive plans\" regarding the violations in the coming days.\nThe FDA also said eBay Inc removed several listings of Juul products after the regulator raised concerns.
