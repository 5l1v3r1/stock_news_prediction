And that includes the Czech gas business. I am confident that the Czech gas business will eventually find its way to E.ON. Provisions have been made in our contracts for this,” Marc Spieker told Reuters.\nInnogy and E.ON declined to comment on KKCG’s statement.\nInnogy’s management and supervisory boards will publish their recommendations on E.ON’s offer within the next two weeks. They have urged shareholders not to take any action until then.\nInnogy’s shares closed little changed at 36.28 euros.\nThe E.ON-RWE deal, expected to close in late 2019, is seen resulting in as many as 5,000 job cuts as E.ON targets 600-800 million euros in synergies.\nE.ON boss Johannes Teyssen has said he hopes job reductions can be done without forced redundancies.
