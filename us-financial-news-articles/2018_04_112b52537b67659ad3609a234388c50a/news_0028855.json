Afghan officials have alleged that Pakistani troops crossed onto Afghanistan soil, prompting firing on Sunday by border forces and the local tribal force. \nThe two sides later agreed on a ceasefire. \nBorder skirmishes in the area are common, although detention of a foreign soldier is rare. Each national government alleges that the other allows sheltering of Taliban militants who stage cross-border attacks. \nThe tribesmen handle security in their Zazi Maidan district of Khost. \nThe Pakistani military has previously said that two of its soldiers were killed. An Afghan army commander has said two tribesmen were killed in the skirmish. \nA spokesman for the Pakistani military could not be immediately reached.
