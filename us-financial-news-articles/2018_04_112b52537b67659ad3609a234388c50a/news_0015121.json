Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City vs Manchester United - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 7, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola looks on as Manchester City's Danilo is in action Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith \nCity could have sealed the league title with a win over their neighbours at the Etihad Stadium but United’s spectacular comeback, led by a brace from midfielder Paul Pogba, in the second half delayed their title celebrations. \nPep Guardiola’s side now turn their attention to overcoming a 3-0 deficit when they host Liverpool in the second leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie. \n\"There's a feeling of sadness and disappointment... But we must turn the page as soon as possible because we have another big challenge on Tuesday,\" Danilo told City's website. www.mancity.com \n“I could tell you many reasons why we didn’t win... We win together and we lose together.
