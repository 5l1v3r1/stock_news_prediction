Dr. Tang is CEO of First Dimension BioSciences, a genetic information database company focusing on cancer genomes in order to establish a statistical compendium of mutation profiles in a state-of-the-art computational data center. Dr. Tang has 20 years of experience in genomics and bioinformatics research.\n“The addition of Dr. Thomas Tang to the SIWA team will resurrect to a productive past partnership,” explained Lewis Gruber, Co-founder and CEO of SIWA. “Tom was an early scientist at my first company, Hyseq, Inc., and was key in developing Hyseq’s genomics database, one that grew to be among the largest of the 1990s. As SIWA’s antibody has been shown to statistically significantly reduce senescent cells, and to decrease cancer metastasis in mice, we are now focusing on certain cancers. Tom’s cancer genomic database expertise will be invaluable since we are helping build a senescent-cell related database.”\n“I am very pleased to be working with Lewis in developing another database,” Dr. Tang remarked. “Collaborating with SIWA should enhance the firm’s ability to develop drugs that fight cancer and aging and aging-related diseases.”\n“Dr. Tang’s extensive experience in building major databases will be instrumental as we move data on senescent cells in various tissues into the database we are developing,” Gruber added. “We believe that the new database will become useful in determining dosages for our drugs and in determining where to apply them.”\nDr. Tang has published dozens of research papers in leading scientific journals and has procured 90 U.S. patents. Most importantly, he has led scientists to develop more than 20 percent of all human genes. He has discovered and named four important gene families, including an insulin-like family of human hormones; a GPCR-like membrane protein family; a family of neural growth factors, and a family of stem cell growth factors. His degrees include a BS in Biology and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah.\nABOUT SIWA Therapeutics, Inc.\nSIWA is a privately-held biotechnology company based in Chicago. SIWA has proven that its monoclonal antibody, SIWA 318, targets and reduces senescent cells in animal models without observable side effects. Senescent cells are causally implicated in a wide variety of diseases including neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and infectious conditions. Today, SIWA’s therapeutic focus is on certain specific cancers.
