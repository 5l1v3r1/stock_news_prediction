Taiwan also lays claim to most of the sea. \nEarlier, Australia’s Defence Department said in a statement emailed to Reuters that its forces had “maintained a robust program of international engagement with countries in and around the South China Sea for decades”. \n“As they have done for many decades, Australian vessels and aircraft will continue to exercise rights under international law to freedom of navigation and overflight, including in the South China Sea,” the Defence Department said. \nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, in London for a Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, declined to confirm the interaction between the Australian warships and the Chinese military, Fairfax media reported. ‘NO PROBLEM’ \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing China’s consistent position was to support and actively safeguard the right of all countries to have freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, in accordance with international law. \n“If Australia is referring to freedom of navigation in accordance with international laws, there is no problem whatsoever,” Hua said in Beijing. \n“But if Australia has other motives, we hope it can see the trend in the South China Sea is stable and improving, and work together with China and other neighboring countries for the peace and stability of the region.” \nChina’s construction of islands and military facilities in the South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually, has sparked concern it is seeking to restrict free movement and extend its strategic reach. \nThe United States has conducted “freedom of navigation patrols” through the South China Sea, stoking tension with China which says it will protect its sovereignty. \nAustralia is a staunch U.S. ally. \nIts navy ships Anzac, Toowoomba and Success are on a three-month deployment in Southeast Asia, which will involve exercises with a number of countries in the region, the Australian Defence Department said in a statement on April 17. \nThe Toowoomba sailed to Vietnam from Malaysia, while the other two Australian warships went through the South China Sea from Subic Bay in the Philippines.
