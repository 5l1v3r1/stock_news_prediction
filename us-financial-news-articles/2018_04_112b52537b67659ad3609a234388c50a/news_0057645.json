(NASDAQ:BJRI) today reported financial results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended Tuesday, April 3, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights Compared to First Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues grew 8.0% to $278.5 million (non-GAAP total revenues increased 8.2% to $279.0 million when excluding the impact from the 2018 first quarter adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-10 related to Revenue from Contracts with Customers) Total restaurant operating weeks increased approximately 5% Comparable restaurant sales increased 4.2% Net income increased 58.3% to $14.7 million from $9.3 million (first quarter 2018 net income includes a $1.1 million excess tax benefit from equity awards, offset by the $0.7 million pre-tax impact from the adoption of ASU 2016-10) Diluted net income per share increased 67.6% to $0.70 from $0.42 (first quarter 2018 diluted net income per share includes a $0.05 excess tax benefit from equity awards, partially offset by a $0.02 reduction in diluted net income per share from the adoption of ASU 2016-10)\n“The sales building initiatives we implemented last year continue to resonate with our guests, leading to strong 2018 first quarter revenue, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant and consolidated operating margins, and diluted net income per share,” commented Greg Trojan, CEO. “Led by our slow roast menu items, Daily Brewhouse Specials, our handheld server tablets and investments in our off-premise channels, our teams drove 4.2% growth in comparable restaurant sales, a 0.4% increase in guest traffic, a 27.0% rise in operating income and a 30 basis point year-over-year improvement in restaurant operating margins, which together led to a 59.5% increase in diluted net income per share before the excess tax benefit and new accounting standard. Our solid first quarter bottom line results highlight the significant operating leverage in our model, as well as our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and quarterly cash dividends.\n“Over the last year, BJ’s team members mastered new cooking methods, became proficient taking orders on handheld devices, and streamlined processes to bring efficiencies to our growing off-premise revenue stream. As a result, our slow roasted prime rib special has become a weekend guest favorite and our Daily Brewhouse Specials continue to build mid-week restaurant traffic, while our growing off-premise channel is providing our guests with the convenience of enjoying BJ’s high quality food and beverages at home, at work or on the go. We are also very excited about our upgraded BJ’s Premier Rewards Plus loyalty program, which launched in all of our restaurants in February. We are already seeing a very positive guest response to our upgraded program which simplifies our reward structure, making it easier for guests to be rewarded for choosing BJ’s. We believe these sales building initiatives have further differentiated and elevated BJ’s already high quality menu offerings, strong value proposition, and culture of service and hospitality, which collectively have positioned BJ’s to continue gaining share in the casual dining space.”\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, BJ’s opened its 198th restaurant in Warwick, Rhode Island, marking the 27th state where the Company operates. “Our recent restaurant openings are performing well and our 2018 pipeline is in excellent shape. We remain on track to open new restaurants in Hagerstown, Maryland and Albany, New York by the end of the second quarter and two to three additional restaurants in the second half of the year. In the current environment, we believe our fiscal 2018 expansion plan of five to six new restaurants provides the right balance of growth and flexibility to allocate our strong cash flows to share repurchases, dividends and other initiatives to enhance shareholder value. Our development team is building a solid pipeline for fiscal 2019 and 2020 new restaurant openings as we remain committed to our long term expansion plans,” Trojan added.\nDuring the 2018 first quarter, the Company adopted ASU 2016-10, an amendment to ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which impacts the way we account for our loyalty program. ASU 2016-10 provides a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In accordance with ASU 2016-10, we now use loyalty points earned to allocate the transaction price between the goods delivered and the future goods that will be delivered, on a relative standalone selling price basis. As a result of the adoption of this standard, $1.1 million of 2018 first quarter revenues have been deferred until those loyalty points are redeemed in the future. Under the previous standard we estimated the cost of the loyalty reward based on the equivalent cost of the food and beverage earned and recorded this cost as a marketing expense included in “Occupancy and operating” on our Consolidated Statements of Income. This standard does not impact our calculation of comparable restaurant sales. A reconciliation of the impact from ASU 2016-10 is provided at the end of this release.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased and retired approximately 0.1 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $5.6 million. Since the Company’s first share repurchase authorization was approved in April 2014, BJ’s has repurchased and retired approximately 9.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $363.0 million and has reduced its outstanding share count by approximately 31%. The Company currently has approximately $37.0 million available under its authorized $400 million share repurchase program.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.11 per share of common stock payable May 28, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2018. While the Company intends to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc. will conduct a conference call on its first quarter 2018 earnings release today, April 26, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time (5:00 p.m. Eastern Time).

This performance measure includes only the costs that restaurant level managers can directly control and excludes other operating costs that are essential to conduct the Company’s business, as detailed in the table below. Management uses restaurant level operating margin as a supplemental measure of restaurant performance. Management believes restaurant level operating margin is useful to investors in that it highlights trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Because other companies may calculate restaurant level margin differently than we do, restaurant level margin as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nA reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant level operating margin for the first quarter ended April 3, 2018 and April 4, 2017 is set forth below:\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc.
