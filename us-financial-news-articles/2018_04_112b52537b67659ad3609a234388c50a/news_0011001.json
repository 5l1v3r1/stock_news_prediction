Trading in Shanghai crude futures will resume on Monday.\nMeanwhile, Japan's oil demand decline is set to accelerate amid a shrinking population. Annual forecasts by the Japanese government's energy committee showed on Thursday the country's oil demand, excluding fuel oil used for power generation, is projected to fall 1.7 percent per year on average over the next five fiscal years.\n(Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori Editing by Aaron Sheldrick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T03:32:45.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
