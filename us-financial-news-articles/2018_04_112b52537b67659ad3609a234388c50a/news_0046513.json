REUTERS/Benoit Tessier The exchange operator had postponed the launch of the weekly commitments of traders (COT) reports several times this year, citing the need to check the data being submitted by market participants.\nCOT data, already a feature of U.S. commodity markets, gives a clearer picture of trading activity by providing information on who has been buying and selling which products. <CFTC/>\nEuronext said it would release its report on its website every Wednesday by the close of business, gathering positions at the close of trading the previous Friday.\nCFTC reports in the United States are published on Fridays based on data by the close of Tuesday.\nEuronext operators are divided into five categories defined by EU regulators: investment firms or credit institutions; investment funds; other financial institutions; commercial undertakings; and operators with compliance obligations under 2003/87/EC, which include operators with obligations to hold greenhouse gas emissions permits.\nFor each category, the exchange published the number of long and short positions, changes versus the previous week, percentages of the total open interest, and overall number of market participants holding a position.\nEuronext posted reports for its milling wheat, rapeseed, rapeseed meal and maize contracts. Other products such as skimmed milk, rapeseed oil, nitrogen fertilisers or wood pellets are untraded.\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-26T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T23:11:05.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
