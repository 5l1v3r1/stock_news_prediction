It can bring profile, credibility, more funding, facilities. Skateboarding ticks all the social boxes,” Hope-Gill told the newspaper. \nHope-Gill, whose efforts to hold a UK national championship was unable to find financial support, said that rival nations were well ahead in terms of preparations for the Games. \n“Australia, Italy, Spain, France, Germany and some Scandinavian countries are already being funded by their governments,” he said. \n“In France, they have 17 skateboarders, members of staff, traveling the world skating together to create a real team ethos.” \nSkateboarding at the Tokyo Games will have a total of four medal events for 40 men and 40 women in two categories — park (a hollowed-out course featuring a series of curves) and street (a straight course featuring stairs, handrails and curbs).
