Neither did representatives for Mattel in Mexico or the Frida Kahlo Corporation. \nKahlo’s image and her extensive body of work have been widely commercialized as the artist’s popularity has grown. \nSince her death in 1954, Kahlo, who was married to Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, has been regarded as one of the greatest painters of the 20th century for her moving and intimate self -portraits, reflecting her personal experience of pain and isolation. \nMattel’s Barbie also drew the family’s ire because it lacks the artist’s signature unibrow, which has become a symbol of her feminist stance.
