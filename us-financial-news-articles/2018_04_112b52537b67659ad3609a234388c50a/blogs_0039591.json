Her firm was started by capitalizing on gender inequality, she added, to change the status quo in the industry.\nSoGal has gone on to make 52 investments in the past two and a half years, but the executive said she did not always expect to head down that path.\n\"I would say I did not plan on going on this path at all,\" Sun said. \"When I started SoGal, it was really to solve my own personal pain point. I wanted to see more women in venture capital events and entrepreneurship events.\"\nThe dream grew bigger, however, and turned into a desire to create an empire for future generations of women to play a central role in the industry, Sun told CNBC's Dan Murphy at the Credit Suisse Global Megatrends Conference in Singapore.\n\"So now, three years later, we've had 52 investments under our belt, which is just unbelievable.
