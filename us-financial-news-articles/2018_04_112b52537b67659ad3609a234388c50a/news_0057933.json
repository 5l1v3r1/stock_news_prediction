Yields fall as bond prices rise.\nYields declined Friday after the Commerce Department said gross domestic product—the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., adjusted for inflation— rose at an annual rate of 2.3% from January through March. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 1.8% reading. Weaker consumer spending was behind the moderate slowdown in growth from the fourth quarter, when output grew at a 2.9% rate after increasing 3.2% in the third quarter.\nA rise in the employment-cost index , a measure of wages and benefits for civilian workers, failed to push yields higher. The index increased 2.7% over the past year, the strongest annual pace since the third quarter of 2008, the Labor Department said Friday.\nSome investors had waited to buy Treasurys until 10-year yields to reached 3%, a level hit earlier in the week.

Inflation is a threat to the value of bonds because it erodes the future value of their fixed coupon payments.\nThe GDP data confirmed the message of previously released reports without altering the narrative, said Simona Mocuta, a senior economist at State Street Global Advisors. While price pressures are trending higher, “they’re not spiking,” she said. “Inflation is a process, not an event.”\nSome investors had waited to buy Treasurys until 10-year yields reached 3%, a level attained earlier in the week. With yields showing little sign of a rapid return above that level, some investors are buying now, analysts said.\nThe wide gap between government debt yields for the U.S. and other developed nations also is luring some foreign investors. The 10-year Treasury note yields about 2.4 percentage points more than German debt and 2.2 percentage points more than French debt, according to Tradeweb.\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T04:23:49.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
