Such operations are normal and in accordance with the design of the Linked Exchange Rate System,” Norman Chan, chief executive of HKMA, said in a statement. \nThe Hong Kong dollar is pegged at 7.8 to the U.S. dollar, but can trade between 7.75 and 7.85. Under the currency peg, the HKMA is obliged to intervene when the Hong Kong dollar hits 7.75 or 7.85 to keep the band intact. \nThe currency traded at 7.8499 against the U.S. dollar at 1208 GMT. \n“Depending on capital flows, the weak-side CU may be triggered again in the future,” Chan said. “The HKMA is fully capable of maintaining the stability of the HKD and managing large scale capital flows. There is no need to be concerned.” \nIn early March, the HKMA said it was confident Hong Kong could deal with volatile asset markets and challenges arising from capital outflow. \nThe Hong Kong money market remains awash with liquidity due to equity market inflows and remnants of money printing from global central banks. \nThe HKMA last intervened in the market in 2015, selling Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the strong end of its trading band.
