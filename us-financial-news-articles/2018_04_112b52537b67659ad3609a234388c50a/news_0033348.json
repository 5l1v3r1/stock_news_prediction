He walked one and struck out six.\nConsecutive two-out singles by Jason Kipnis, Ramirez and Brantley made it 5-0 off Twins reliever Taylor Rogers in the seventh.\nKluber lost his shutout bid in the seventh after having allowed just three hits through six.\nMax Kepler led off the seventh with a double, and he scored two outs later when Brian Dozier also doubled.\nKluber (2-1) was then replaced by Andrew Miller, having allowed one run and five hits in 6 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out six.\nAlonso greeted Gabriel Moya, the fourth Twins pitcher, with a leadoff homer in the eighth, his third of the season, completing the game’s scoring.\nThe Indians posted their sixth win in seven games.\nRamirez and Brantley had three hits apiece for the Indians, who out-hit the Twins 12-6.\nDozier had two hits for the Twins, who had won three straight before getting rained out in their past three scheduled games.\nThe contest was the first regular-season major league game in Puerto Rico since the New York Mets and Miami Marlins met there in 2010.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:10:07.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
