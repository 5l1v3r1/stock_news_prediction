This is one step closer to a strike,” said Tahir Maepa, deputy general manager at the PSA.\nThe dispute meant that if conciliation talks between the parties mediated by the Public Service Co-Ordinating Bargaining Council failed to break the impasse within 30 days, a strike could potentially go ahead, said Maepa.\nHe told Reuters that a snap poll taken among their members found that 83 percent felt a strike was “the only option”.\nThe lead negotiator for labour federation Cosatu, which has large unions representing nurses, teachers and police, was not available to comment if they would follow suit.\nSouth Africa’s inflation slowed to 3.8 percent in March, its lowest rate in seven years, as food prices fell.
