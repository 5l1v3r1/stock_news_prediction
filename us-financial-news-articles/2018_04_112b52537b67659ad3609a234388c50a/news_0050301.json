They are at around 250 basis points currently, compared with 153.18 at the end of March last year, Reuters calculation shows.\n“We cannot secure returns from U.S. and German government bonds after hedging costs,” Iwao Matsumoto, Sumitomo Life’s senior executive officer, said at a semiannual media briefing on investment strategy.\nSumitomo Life is Japan’s fourth-largest private sector life insurer, which manages about 30 trillion yen ($275 billion) in assets.\nHe said the insurer is shifting its foreign sovereign debt investment to French and other euro-zone government bonds, which generate enough returns since, contrary to the dollar, those who buy euro/yen hedges receive money from the counterparty.\nHedging costs are determined by a gap between two currencies’ short-term interest rates as well as investor demand for them.\nTo cope with the rise in the dollar hedging costs, Matsumoto also said the insurer will increase holdings of credit assets, or those with default risks, such as corporate bonds, as they have enough spreads over risk-free rates of U.S. Treasuries and other sovereign debt.\nIn addition, the insurer said it will buy U.S. bonds without currency hedges when the dollar falls sharply against the yen, a move that would generate extra gains when the U.S. currency rebounds.\nSumitomo Life and other Japanese life insurers, which manage combined $3.2 trillion in assets, are among the most affected by the Bank of Japan’s massive stimulus started in April 2013.\nYields on 20-year and 30-year JGBs , tenors of choice for life insurers, have fallen below 1 percent, making it difficult for insurers to meet obligations to policy holders.\nThat has prompted hunt for yield overseas. Sumitomo Life’s holdings of foreign currency-denominated bonds stood at about 7.1 trillion yen at the end of September last year, up from 3.5 trillion yen at the end of March 2013.\nSumitomo Life said it would continue to curb investment in super-long Japanese government bonds for the current financial year.
