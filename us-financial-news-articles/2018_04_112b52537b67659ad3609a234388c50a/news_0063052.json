He rolled it amazing all week.”\nHorschel’s 2013 win was his first on the PGA Tour, but he said Sunday’s triumph also meant a lot.\n“You never want to let a team mate down and to feel you helped out the team to victory, that was huge,” said Horschel of winning his fifth tour title, one better than Piercy’s career tally of four.
