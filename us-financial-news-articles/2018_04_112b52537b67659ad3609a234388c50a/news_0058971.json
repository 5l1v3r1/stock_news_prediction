NII was in line with analysts’ forecasts.\nIn an effort to boost its revenues, Caixabank bought BPI in February of 2017.\n$1 = 0.8260 euros Reporting By Jesús Aguado; editing Paul Day\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:31:18.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
