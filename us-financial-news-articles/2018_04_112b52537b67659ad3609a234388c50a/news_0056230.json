Heliospectra officially launches HelioCORE™ as the new light control system becomes avaliable for order.\nA Word From the CEO\nDear shareholders of Heliospectra AB (publ),\nI'm pleased to report to you that 2018 started strong for Heliospectra. Our industry-leading technology was selected for several milestone projects around the globe. This includes one of the top 5 largest LED horticultural light system installations for medicinal crops, and one of the world's most prestigious botanical gardens – Kew Royal Botanical Gardens.\nOur Company continues to execute against every aspect of our 2018 business plan from revenue growth to capital and operational cost containment. This is evidenced by the 140 percent improvement in recognized revenue versus the year-ago period. Order intake increased by 31 percent, which is indicative of larger transaction sizes. Additionally, we achieved a bottom-line gain of 35 percent by improving both our market competitiveness and operational efficiency. While increased order size can lead to margin compression, we have offset this with improved economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies.\nOur customer collaborations, including those with HelioCORE™ control system beta program participants, produced the outstanding results we projected. For example, the John Innes Centre, an esteemed plant science institution in the UK, bred food staple crops 57 percent faster through our system's demonstrated ability to accelerate harvests compared to any other lighting product. Additionally, a leading Canadian microgreens producer is reporting summer season crop yields and quality while using energy in the most efficient manner. Our HelioCORE™ system adjusts light output based on natural light conditions and energy prices to use only the energy required for optimal light levels and minimal costs year-round. After a successful beta period, we are pleased to announce the general availability of the HelioCORE™ system.\nWe are moving through the first half of the year at a strong clip that will accelerate. Through 2018, you'll appreciate our focus on improving operational performance to strengthen these essential Heliospectra market differentiators: expand undisputed quality leadership, deliver world-class customer service, and relentlessly improve business performance. With this mission firmly in mind, I thank both my team and you, our shareholders, for your steadfast commitment to the Heliospectra vision.\nAli Ahmadian, CEO\nHeliospectra AB (publ)\nFor the full report: http://ir.heliospectra.com/en/financial-reports/\nGothenburg 2018-04-27\nInvestor Relations:\nAli Ahmadian,\nCEO of Heliospectra\n+46 (0)72-203 6344\nir@heliospectra.com\nRedeye is Heliospectra Certified Advisor for Nasdaq First North - www.redeye.se\nhttp://www.heliospectra.com\nThis information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.com\nhttp://news.cision.com/heliospectra/r/heliospectra-ab--publ--interim-management-statement-january---march-2018,c2507313\nThe following files are available for download:\nhttp://mb.cision.com/Main/5333/2507313/831110.pdf\nPDF\nhttp://news.cision.com/heliospectra/i/interim-report-financials-jan-mar-18,c2397955\nInterim report financials Jan-Mar 18\nhttp://mb.cision.com/Public/5333/2507313/9eedc8a03b03b56e.pdf\nHeliospectra Interim Report Jan-Mar 2018\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/heliospectra-ab-publ-interim-management-statement-january--march-2018-300637879.html\nSOURCE Heliospectra", "external_links": ["http://news.cision.com/", "http://ir.heliospectra.com/en/financial-reports/", "http://mb.cision.com/Main/5333/2507313/831110.pdf", "http://news.cision.com/heliospectra/r/heliospectra-ab--publ--interim-management-statement-january---march-2018,c2507313", "http://www.redeye.se/", "http://www.heliospectra.com/", "http://news.cision.com/heliospectra/i/interim-report-financials-jan-mar-18,c2397955", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/heliospectra-ab-publ-interim-management-statement-january--march-2018-300637879.html", "http://mb.cision.com/Public/5333/2507313/9eedc8a03b03b56e.pdf"], "published": "2018-04-27T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:06:49.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
