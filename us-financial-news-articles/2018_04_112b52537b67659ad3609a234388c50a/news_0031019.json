The Company has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation who owns 25% of the mine. The Copper Mountain mine has a large resource of copper that remains open laterally and at depth. This significant exploration potential will be explored over the next few years in order to fully appreciate the property's full development potential. Recently, Copper Mountain shareholders approved the acquisition of Altona Mining Limited which brings with it approximately A$30M cash, the Cloncurry project with development-ready Eva Copper Project and a massive exploration potential in the acquired ~ 4,000 square km (379,000 hectare) mineralized land package within the highly prospective Mt. Isa inlier area in Queensland, Australia.\nAdditional information is available on the Company's web page at www.CuMtn.com .\nOn behalf of the Board of\nCOPPER MOUNTAIN MINING CORPORATION\n\"Jim O'Rourke\"\nJim O'Rourke, P.Eng.\nChief Executive Officer\nNote: This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
