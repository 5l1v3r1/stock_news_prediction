The price will be defined on Thursday. The company did not immediately comment on the matter.\nThe company and its controlling shareholder intend to raise between 1.8 billion reais ($532.17 million) and 2.1 billion reais.\nAccording to one of the sources, at 16 reais, the mid point of the range, Intermédica had demand from investors equivalent to 3.5 times the amount of the offering shares. Another source said that there are buyers for the shares at all prices set in the range.\nIntermédica’s will be the first initial public offering in São Paulo stock exchange this year, as three other Brazilian companies called off previous IPO plans due to market volatility.\nNext week, three other companies are lined up to price their offerings: online lender Banco Intermedium SA, shoemaker Dass Nordeste SA and healthcare provider Hapvida Participações e Investimentos SA.\nReporting by Carolina Mandl; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:50:26.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
