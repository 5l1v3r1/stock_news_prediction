Recruiting for the technology and consumer sectors has started, it added.\nLate in 2017, the department purchased a significant minority stake in KKR India Financial Services, an alternative credit provider.\nThis year, the department will continue to deploy capital in line with its strategy of increasing its sector-led investment activity, with a focus on evaluating structured equity opportunities, defensive industries and other private-asset investments, ADIA said.\nHowever, it warned current valuation levels and increasing competition for deals amongst market participants suggests that the industry might enter a period of lower returns than those experienced in recent years.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar and Tom Arnold; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T09:25:32.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
