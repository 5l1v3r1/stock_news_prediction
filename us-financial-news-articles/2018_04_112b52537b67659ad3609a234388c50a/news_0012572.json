( reut.rs/2fjGexX )\nDimon said new federal tax law and “a more constructive regulatory environment” adopted since the 2016 presidential election give him hope that JPMorgan will be able to invest more of its excess capital to grow the bank and expand into new markets.\nHe also emphasized JPMorgan’s ability in the new climate to earn a return on tangible equity of 17 percent, two points higher than the target before corporate tax cuts were enacted and nearly four points greater than the company delivered in 2017.\nOffering bank investors a view of the company stock, Dimon contended that it still makes financial sense for JPMorgan to buy back shares “even at or above two times tangible book value” per share, which was $53.56 at year-end. JPMorgan shares closed at $110.99 on Wednesday.\nTo show that government regulation needs to be “smart”, Dimon included a reprint of a 1992 newspaper essay by the late liberal U.S. senator and Democratic Party presidential candidate George McGovern who recounted how he had learned late in life that regulations can crush businesses.\nDimon, 62, has said in the past that he was a Democrat, but in recent years he has avoided siding with a political party. He said in the letter that partisanship causes bad public policy.\nHe said the U.S. should revisit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, which Trump has rejected.\nHe also called for “improved merit-based immigration”, particularly for those who get an advanced degree in the United States. “We need skilled individuals in America,” he wrote.
