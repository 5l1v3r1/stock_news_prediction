So it’s looking on the up.” \nFinau admitted he went through an elaborate process to secure his ailing ankle before the round. \n“There’s quite a bit of tape on it and just ice, rest, elevate, just all the stuff everybody knows with a sprained ankle,” he said. \n“And obviously putting it under pressure quite fast, but we’re in the Masters, why not? \nFinau said he had to favour his right side to keep pressure off his injured ankle. \n“I put the ball back (in my stance) and I got to stay back on my right side at the start,” he said. “I don’t really think about anything else from there. I try to make just a normal swing. I hit some really good shots out there.” \nDespite the discomfort, Finau said he was very satisfied. \n“I feel pretty good. Especially what I’ve been through just the last 48 hours, with my body and with my ankle, just emotionally it’s been a roller coaster for me,” he added. \n“But I’m going to be in the hunt and going into the weekend, and I’m excited about that at a major championship.” (Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T02:56:30.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
