Questions about synergies arising from the deal also have been raised.\nShareholder activism is rare in South Korea but the chaebols are under mounting pressure to reform after a corruption scandal last year led to the jailing of Samsung Group’s heir apparent and the ouster of former President Park Geun-hye.\nSouth Korean brokerage NH Investment & Securities ( 005940.KS ) said it is advising Hyundai on the reorganization plan.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin in SEOUL and Liana B.
