The local share price index futures rose 10 points to 5746.0, a 13.4-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark fell 0.5 percent on Thursday, ahead of the Easter weekend. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell about 0.6 percent in early trade and was on track for its third straight session of declines.
