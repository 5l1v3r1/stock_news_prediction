REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File photo Parente, chief executive officer of state-run oil firm Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ), on Wednesday accepted the invitation of the group to become chairman of BRF, opening the way for a swift resolution to the troubled company’s leadership dispute.\nBRF shareholders will vote on the election of new board members on April 26.\nParente is a former CEO of agribusiness company Bunge Brasil and has proven to be a solid chief executive in the recovery of Petrobras. BRF shares jumped almost 10 percent on Wednesday on the news that he accepted the invitation to chair the board.\nBRF shares extended gains on Thursday, closing up 4.9 percent.\nKey shareholders Tarpon Investimentos and pension funds Petros and Previ, and current BRF Chairman Abilio Diniz agreed to elect Parente, as well and Francisco Petros, Walter Malieni and Flavia Buarque to serve two years on the board, BRF said.\nIf they have enough votes, the group of shareholders also plans to elect to the board, in the following order, Augusto da Cruz Filho, Roberto Rodrigues, José Luiz Osorio, Roberto Mendes, Dan Ioschpe and Luiz Fernando Furlan.\nIn a statement accepting Diniz’s invitation, Parente said he would resign his post as chairman of financial exchange operator B3 SA Bolsa Brasil Balcao ( B3SA3.SA ) if elected to chair BRF’s board.\nFurlan, the 15th largest shareholder of BRF, said on Tuesday that a prolonged leadership struggle could damage plans for a turnaround of the company and called for a board that will work as a team.\nReporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:39:37.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
