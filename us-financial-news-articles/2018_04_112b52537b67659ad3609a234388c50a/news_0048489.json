Shares of the company are flat for the year after its most recent earnings report failed to beat Wall Street estimates for the first time in two years, but Marshall said that he expects its revenue to continue to grow at above-market rates.\n\"They have the better mousetrap and if there are additional tariffs to bring its products back then they will be well positioned to pass those costs on,\" he said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese imports to the United States to punish China for what government officials regard as Beijing's predatory industrial policies and abuse of U.S. intellectual property. Beijing has vowed to retaliate.\nA trade war between the two countries would lop 0.7 percent off of the U.S. GDP and push inflation up 0.1 percent, according to estimates from MSCI. That, in turn, would sink U.S. stocks by about 5 percent, the firm estimates, a fall it says may already be priced into the market. Should other countries also raise tariffs, then U.S. stocks could drop by another 10 percent.\nIn the \"Beige Book,\" a survey of current U.S. economic conditions released Wednesday, the Federal Reserve noted that it had received scattered reports of companies successfully passing on prices in the manufacturing, information technology, transportation, and construction industries.\nDomestic niche Lamar Villere, a portfolio manager at New Orleans-based Villere & Co., said that he has been reducing his exposure of small and mid-cap companies with international revenues and is focusing more on those that dominate their domestic niche in order to offer protection from the effects of tariffs.\nHe has been adding to his position in companies such as Pool Corp. , the country's largest supplier of residential pool supplies, in large part because it has few competitors that will be able to undercut it on prices, he said. Shares of the company are up 12.5 percent for the year to date.\nHe also has been adding to online higher education company 2U and Axon Enterprise , the parent company behind the Taser brand of non-lethal weapons and body cameras used by police departments, because both are dominant players that also have recurring revenue streams from long-term contracts.\nShares of 2U are up 34.8 percent for the year, while shares of Axon are up 63 percent for the year to date.\n\"The companies that are going to be able to withstand this are the ones that have a sort of moat around their businesses,\" he said.\nNot all fund managers are as convinced that the Trump administration's threats, which pushed the benchmark S&P 500 down more than 10 percent to enter a correction in February, will become a reality.\nMargie Patel, a senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Funds, said that she expects to see little to no effect from trade tariffs and has been adding to companies such as PNC Financial Services that have sold off in the market downturn.\n\"I think at the end of the day that virtually all of the 'trade war' effects will be negotiated away and the true economic impact on industries as well as specific companies will be very small, so I haven't factored the impact of any trade war considerations into my portfolio,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T15:46:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
