That came after Beijing retaliated against proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods by targeting key American imports. \n“The trade wars aren’t escalating, at least not right now, there’s a little bit more of a risk appetite around the globe,” said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. \nBenchmark 10-year notes fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.814 percent, after earlier rising to 2.830 percent, the highest since March 27. \nData on Thursday showed that the U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1/2-year high in February as both exports and imports rose to record peaks, but the shortfall with China narrowed sharply. \nThis week’s major economic catalyst will be Friday’s closely watched U.S. jobs report, which will be evaluated for accelerating jobs gains and wage pressures. \nThe U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February, at 313,000 jobs. \nAnalysts noted that March’s jobs gains often disappoint. \nAccording to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 195,000 in the month. \nThe ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed employers added 241,000 jobs in March. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is also due to speak about the economic outlook at an event in Chicago on Friday.
