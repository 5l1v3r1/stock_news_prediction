Local media have reported that Amazon is exploring a possible counter offer for Flipkart. \nBoth sources declined to be named as the talks are private. \nWalmart will buy both new and existing Flipkart shares, with the new shares expected to value the Bengaluru-based firm at at least $18 billion, the sources said. The price for existing shares would value the firm at about $12 billion, one of the people said. \nJapan’s SoftBank Group ( 9984.T ), which owns roughly one-fifth of Flipkart via its Vision Fund, is unlikely to sell any of its shares due to the low price being offered for the existing shares, this source said. \nReuters has previously reported that early investors such as Tiger Global, Accel and Naspers will likely sell their entire stakes in Flipkart to Walmart if a deal is reached. \nA deal is not yet finalised, and talks between Walmart, Flipkart and its investors are ongoing, one of the people said. \nFlipkart also counts eBay ( EBAY.O ), Tencent Holdings ( 0700.HK ) and Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) among its investors. \nFlipkart did not respond to a request for comment, a representative for Walmart in India declined comment while SoftBank said it doesn’t comment on speculation. Slideshow (2 Images) BIG INDIAN BATTLE \nFor Walmart, the world’s largest retailer known for its superstores, a deal with Flipkart would open up the vast Indian market. \nWalmart has for years tried to enter India but has remained confined to a ‘cash-and-carry’ wholesale business amid tough restrictions on foreign investment. It currently operates 21 such stores in India. \nBy comparison, Amazon closely trails Flipkart, which along with its fashion units controls nearly 40 percent of India’s online retail market, according to estimates by researcher Forrester. \nFlipkart’s investors are concerned that any deal with Amazon would run into regulatory hurdles as a combination would have more than 70 percent of India’s online retail market, one of the sources said. \nWalmart’s push into e-commerce comes as Amazon has embraced offline retail, with an affiliate of the Seattle-based company picking up a $27.6 million stake in Indian retailer Shopper’s Stop Ltd ( SHOP.NS ). \nIn the United States, Amazon also bought high-end grocer Whole Foods Market Inc for $13.7 billion last year. \nWalmart’s investment would give Flipkart not just additional funds to fight Amazon, but also arm it with a formidable ally with extensive experience in retailing, logistics and supply chain management. \nFormer Amazon employees Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 in India’s tech hub of Bengaluru. \nLike Amazon’s founder Jeff Bezos, they began by selling books, but have diversified rapidly, including by selling smartphones, such as those made by China’s Xiaomi, through exclusive flash sales, and now compete with Amazon in almost all product categories.
