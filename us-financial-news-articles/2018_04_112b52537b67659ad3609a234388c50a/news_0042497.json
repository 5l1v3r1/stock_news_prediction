I would like to have a nationwide rural connectivity network,” Mawingu CEO Tim Hobbs told Reuters in an interview. \nSuch increases would help Mawingu to grow revenue and to become profitable, he said, without giving a timeframe. \nThe firm is using a $4 million loan from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to expand, he said, adding that Mawingu would raise more funds later this year. \n“We are not profitable yet but we are heading that way,” said Hobbs, adding that Mawingu’s partners needed to see it making money in a sustainable way from the Microsoft TV white spaces technology, which is cheaper than fiber or providing 3G and 4G using base stations. \nMawingu sells 650 megabytes of data for 100 shillings ($1.00) more than the 200 megabytes sold for 100 shillings by established operators. \nThe Kenyan government forced broadcasters to migrate to digital from analogue in 2014, to free up spectrum frequencies as part of a drive to boost Internet connections. \n“Our network will reach parts that other networks can’t reach,” Hobbs said. \nMicrosoft, which has a representative on Mawingu’s board, said it viewed such partnerships as key to its goal of ensuring the world is connected. \n“For businesses and individuals alike to be able to participate in that digital transformation and take advantage of it they need to be connected to broadband,” Lutz Liob, who works with Microsoft Africa, said.
