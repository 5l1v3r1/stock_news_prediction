That’s why we have such a geographically diversified portfolio, (...) when one market doesn’t have a good dynamic, another generally picks up,” Gault said.\nThe company released first-quarter results on Thursday, with sales growth of 3.4 percent for the whole group compared to the previous year, driven by the performance of Iberia (+6.4 percent), and France-Belgium (+3.1 percent), offsetting the Italian slowdown.\nThe company reiterated its outlook for 2018.\nKlepierre approached Hammerson after the British company had agreed an all-share offer to buy smaller rival Intu Properties . Hammerson’s proposed 3.4 billion pound takeover of Intu was later scrapped.\nKlepierre had wanted to buy Hammerson without Intu Properties but finally abandoned its final 635 pence-a-share bid after Hammerson repeatedly stated that Klepierre’s offer undervalued it.\nThe group’s shares went down 9 percent after it approached Hammerson and back up more than 4 percent when it dropped the deal.\nAccording to Jefferies analysts, Klepierre might re-bid for the British peer in the coming months, but this time with a lower offer after Hammerson withdrew its bid on Intu.
