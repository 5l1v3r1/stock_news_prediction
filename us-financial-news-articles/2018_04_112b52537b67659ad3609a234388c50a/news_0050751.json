They had been working on a video in a Guadalajara suburb at a house provided by an aunt of one of the students. But it was owned by a member of the rival cartel, according to the state attorney general’s office.\n“Without knowing it, the students were in a place of great risk, watched by a cell of the New Generation Jalisco Cartel,” the office said late Monday in a videotaped explanation of the investigation. Officials said there were no indications the three students had ties to any criminal group.\nExperts from the Jalisco Institute of Forensic Sciences working last week at the house from which three film students went missing last month.

More than 25,000 people were murdered in the country last year, the most in any year of the last two decades.\nThe rising violence has become a thorn in the side of departing President Enrique Peña Nieto and is widely cited as one reason why the ruling-party candidate is trailing in a distant third position just over two months before the vote.\nMeanwhile the leading candidate, leftist nationalist Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has come under fire from opponents and security analysts for suggesting he would seek an amnesty for drug traffickers in an effort to stanch the violence.\n“Words are not enough to understand the dimension of this madness,” prizewinning Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro wrote on his Twitter account. “3 students are murdered and dissolved in acid. The ‘why’ is unthinkable, the ‘how’ is terrifying.”\nMr. del Toro was born in Guadalajara, where the three students attended a prestigious private film school.\nA candle-lit memorial to the three missing students outside the Jalisco state governor's residence in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Monday.

We’re all in shock,” said Marina Luján, a student at the University of Guadalajara.\nStudents have held protest marches in Mexico City and Guadalajara demanding that police find the three after they went missing on March 19, and another is planned for Thursday in Guadalajara.\nAt Monday’s press conference, Jalisco state prosecutors said six armed men intercepted the students and forced them into pickup trucks after the three had left the house, where they were working on a video. They were taken to a second location where one was beaten to death under interrogation, and the other two then killed. The bodies were carried to a third location where police found large drums of sulfuric acid, often used by criminals to get rid of the bodies of their victims.\n“The situation in Mexico, and in Jalisco, has reached levels of violence and impunity unthinkable just some years ago. Everybody can be a target,” said Guillermo Zepeda, a public-policy professor at El Colegio de Jalisco, a university in the Guadalajara suburb of Zapopan. He said his cousin’s 20-year-old son was kidnapped last week.\nMore than 35,000 people were missing and unaccounted for in Mexico by the end of February, according to the national registry of missing people. In Jalisco, the country’s fourth most populous state, some 3,000 people are officially missing, most of them between 15 and 34 years old.\nThe increase in violence is largely attributed to the growth of the New Generation Jalisco Cartel, which last year had a presence in 22 of Mexico’s 32 states, according to government intelligence reports.\nThe fate of the three students echoed a notorious 2014 case in southern Guerrero state, where 43 students of a teachers college were detained by police and handed over to drug-gang members. According to government investigators, the gang members killed them, burned their bodies and threw the ashes into a nearby river. The official investigation, sharply criticized by parents and international organizations, remains controversial.\nIn that case like the current one, the 43 persons killed were mistaken by one gang for members of a rival gang.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T02:14:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
