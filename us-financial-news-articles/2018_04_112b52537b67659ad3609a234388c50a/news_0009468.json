UBI two years ago examined a possible bid for the Tuscan bank but decided against it.\nCEO Victor Massiah told reporters a new assessment would be necessary if UBI were asked again to look at Monte dei Paschi. “Two years ago conditions (for a bid) were not there ... we would have to conduct a fresh analysis,” Massiah said.\nMassiah said UBI was weighing its options as Italian banks head toward an expected new round of mergers, but has had no contact with anyone so far.\n“There is not just one option for UBI,” he added. “The positive thing - and I hope this will be increasingly true going forward - is that we’re among those who can help, rather than a bank whose problems need solving.”\nRegulators are urging banks to merge to buttress profits in the face of tougher regulatory constraints and soaring investments needed to keep up with technological advances.\nREGULATORY PRESSURES Italian banks, traditionally focused on lending to the country’s myriad small businesses, have seen profits hit by loan losses following a deep recession and low interest rates.\nUBI last year acquired for a token sum three small banks which Italy rescued from bankruptcy in November 2015.\nYielding to regulatory pressure like other major Italian banks, UBI has recently stepped up its clean-up goals, declaring it will cut soured debts below 10 percent of total lending by 2020.\nMassiah refused to provide any figures about bad loan disposals but said UBI was considering tapping a state guarantee to ease a sale.\nAsked about analysts’ concerns over the bank’s lower-than-average provisions against loan losses, Massiah said UBI had a higher share of secured corporate loans.\n“And if anyone had further doubts, I’d like to remind them the ECB (European Central Bank) analyzed in detail half our impaired loans and all of our corporate loans,” he said. “We booked the bulk of the extra provisions in 2017, the rest will be booked in the first quarter, which, as I said, will show good results.”\nMassiah said the bank was on track with its business plan overall and confirmed a forecast of “markedly better” 2018 results compared with last year.\nEditing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T18:37:17.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
