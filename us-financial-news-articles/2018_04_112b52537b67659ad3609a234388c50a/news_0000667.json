No civilians were hurt, but separatists torched a house, a school and a hospital, said Aidi. \nAccording to the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), a separatist group, one of its members was shot dead in a clash with Indonesian special forces near Banti village early on Sunday morning. \nHendrikus Uwamang, a spokesman for the group, said at least 28 Indonesian security personnel and several guides were also killed in the clash. Fighting continued on Monday and a 10-year-old boy was also killed, when his house was hit by a shell and caught fire, he said. \nPapua Police chief Boy Rafli Amar was quoted in state media last week as saying attacks by “armed criminals” had become more frequent lately near the Grasberg mine. Amar could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.Members of Indonesia’s security forces have been accused by rights activists of abducting and torturing Papuans and using deadly force to quell protests. \nTPNPB, which is linked to the Free Papua Movement (OPM), says it is at war with Indonesian authorities and wants to “destroy” Freeport in an effort to gain sovereignty for the region. \nPresident Joko Widodo, after coming to power in 2014, had pledged to speed up development of Papua and ease media restrictions. \nBut while investment has risen and efforts made to address some human rights concerns, activists say foreign journalists continue to be blocked or face obstacles when trying to report there. \nJakarta is currently in talks with Freeport over ownership of Grasberg, and hopes to gain a majority stake in the world’s second-biggest copper mine this month, with the Papua government and a local regency jointly gaining rights to a 10 percent stake.
