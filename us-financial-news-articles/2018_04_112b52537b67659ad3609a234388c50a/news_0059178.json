Timelines can always change, but right now we’re on target,” he said.\nThe current plan called for the Marines to carry out an operational evaluation after testing ends in December 2019 that will pave the way for a declaration of “initial operational capability”.\nMarine Corps Assistant Commandant Lieutenant General Glenn Walters said he was confident the Marines would meet their schedule.\nThe CH-53K, which offers three times the carrying power of its predecessor, made its international debut at the Berlin show on Wednesday after being transported to Germany in a C-17 transport plane.\nGermany will choose between the CH-53K and Boeing Co’s smaller, twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook to replace its ageing fleet of CH-53G heavy-lift helicopters, an order valued at around 4 billion euros.\nThe German defense ministry expects to release a formal request for proposals in the second half of 2018, with a contract award due in mid-2020, for deliveries to start in 2023.\nSikorsky President Dan Schultz told reporters in a separate briefing his company was working hard to reduce the expected average procurement cost of $87 million for each of the CH-53K helicopters.\nPurchases by Germany, which is considering buying 45 to 60 aircraft, and Israel, which wants to purchase over 20 aircraft, could help drive the cost down further by increasing efficiencies and order quantities, he said.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:50:11.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
