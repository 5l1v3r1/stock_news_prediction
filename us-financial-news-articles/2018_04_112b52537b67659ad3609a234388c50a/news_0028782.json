Its 2018 output is expected to be between 13,000 and 14,000 tonnes. Zinc and lead output at Sasa mine is expected to remain largely flat in 2018.\nClarke said CAML was still considering buying new mines but that the priority would be to fully integrate the newly acquired Sasa mine into the group.\n“Nothing is off the table and we look at lots of things,” he said.\n“Do we look at (acquisitions) in Southern Africa? Yes, but amongst lots of other countries in the world,” Clarke said, adding that the main requirement was for the potential acquisition to be low cost.\nReporting by Zandi Shabalala; editing by Susan Fenton and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T15:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:47:13.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
