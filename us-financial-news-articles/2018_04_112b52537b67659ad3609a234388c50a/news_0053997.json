After Freddie Freeman led off with a double — one of his three hits — against reliever Wandy Peralta (1-1), Acuna rapped a two-out RBI double to right. Acuna then scored an insurance run when Dansby Swanson singled to left.\nIt was the second straight win for the Braves, giving them a split of the four-game series.\nThe winning pitcher was Sam Freeman (1-1), who threw 1 1/3 scoreless innings. Arodys Vizcaino allowed a double and walk in the ninth, but retired pinch hitter Tucker Barnhart to end the game and earn his second save.\nAtlanta starter Sean Newcomb went six innings and allowed four runs on five hits and three walks, striking out seven. It was the third consecutive start in which Newcomb has not received a decision.\nCincinnati starter Homer Bailey threw five innings and allowed four runs on seven hits, two of them home runs, and one walk. He struck out a season-low one batter.\nAtlanta scored a run in the first on a Nick Markakis single and another run in the second inning on Acuna’s solo homer.\nThe Braves scored two times in the fifth inning and took a 4-0 lead when Ozzie Albies hit his eighth home run, a two-run shot to right field.\nThe Reds tied the game with a four-run rally in the fifth against Newcomb. Jose Peraza drove home the first run on a fielder’s choice and Joey Votto followed with a three-run homer, his third. Votto has homered in three straight games.\nAlbies, who was 2-for-5 with three RBIs, gave Atlanta an insurance run with a run-scoring double in the ninth inning.\nThe Reds begin a three-game interleague series at Minnesota on Friday. The Braves continue their road trip with a three-game set in Philadelphia that starts on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:39:56.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
