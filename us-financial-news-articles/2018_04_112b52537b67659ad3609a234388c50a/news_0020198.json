China is expected to pour billions of dollars into Belt and Road projects.\n“Central to our investment proposition is the ‘One Belt One Road’,” Grewal said.\n“Kazakhstan is strategically located and is actually very critical to the success of the ‘One Belt One Road’ for China... It is now becoming a very important transit, logistics, warehousing hub for a lot of goods.”\nOil-rich Kazakhstan, hard hit by the global fall in commodity prices, has embarked on an ambitious privatisation drive to sharply cut the state’s role in the economy by 2021.\nTo raise money it plans to sell off hundreds of companies held by Samruk-Kazyna in whole or in part, ranging from the very small to behemoths such as energy producer KazMunayGaz (KMG) and flagship carrier Air Astana.\n“Commodity prices have already started to rebound. We are seeing a lot of interest into Kazakhstan and Central Asia as a whole, especially from markets like China, Asia, Singapore, and so on,” she said.\nIn China, Samruk-Kazyna had signed “a couple of MOUs on this trip”, but Grewal declined to provide details.
