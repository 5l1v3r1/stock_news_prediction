In addition to saying that Cohen had done just a small fraction of his legal work, Trump had also said that the lawyer had handled \"this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.\"\nDaniels is a porn star who has said Cohen paid her $130,000 right before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump. The White House has denied such an affair.\nCohen, when asked what he thought about Trump's statements on \"Fox and Friends,\" told CNBC, \"I'm on the other line with my lawyers.\" He then hung up the phone.\nThere has been widespread speculation that Cohen, who is married and has several children, will agree to cooperate with prosecutors as a part of a deal to receive leniency. Such a deal could include giving prosecutors information about Trump.\nWATCH: Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies show chapters Trump's fight against 'fake news' has been a boon for media companies 11:50 AM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 01:49", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:32:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
