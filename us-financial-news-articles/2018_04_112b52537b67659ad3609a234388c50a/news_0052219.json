This is the second year Amazon has won a contract with the NFL, reportedly paying $50 million to stream the ten Thursday night games last season, beating out Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. In 2016, Twitter reportedly paid $10 million for the same rights. The battle for sports content has been heating up between the tech giants over the last few years. Facebook recently announced that it would exclusively stream 25 Major League Baseball games while YouTube made a deal with Los Angeles' Major League Soccer team. More: Amazon to raise annual Prime subscription to $119, a 20% increase YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki said on stage in February that she would \"love to stream the NFL,\" but clearly Amazon won out once again. Prime is Amazon's $99-a-year membership program which gives users access to free two-day shipping and other perks alongside the Thursday night streaming. It has more than 100 million members worldwide. Interestingly, the games will also be available to users of Amazon's streaming service, Twitch. You don't need to have an Amazon Prime account to use Twitch, so viewing the games there would, presumably, be free. CNBC has reached out to Amazon to clarify and will update when we hear back. The announcement comes as Amazon reports bang-up first quarter earnings that sent its stock soaring 7% after-hours. \"Amazon was a tremendous partner for Thursday Night Football in 2017 and as we continue our mission of delivering NFL games to fans whether they watch on television or on digital platforms,\" the NFL's chief media officer, Brian Rolapp, said in a statement, \"We are excited to work with them again for the next two seasons.\" Â© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
