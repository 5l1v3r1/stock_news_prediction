The oil and gas producer’s operating expenses rose 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, and it has been selling non-core assets to fund its capital spending program and pay down debt. \nOn Monday, Cation said its director nominees hold, or exercise control of 1,478,772 common shares, representing 0.3 percent of the company’s total common shares, Reuters could not immediately determine Cation’s total stake in the company. \n“Notwithstanding poor corporate performance over recent years, remarkably executive compensation has ballooned, with an increase of 17 percent in total compensation since 2016,” Cation’s President Sandy Edmonstone, who oversaw global energy platform operations at Macquarie, said in a letter addressed to Crescent Point’s board last week. \nToronto-listed Crescent Point’s shares have fallen about 47 percent in the last 12 months, compared with an 8 percent rise in the Canadian Energy Sector Index.
