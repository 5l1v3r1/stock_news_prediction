REUTERS/Bobby Yip China’s flag carrier posted profit attributable to shareholders of 2.63 billion yuan ($415.6 million) for January to March, 79.2 percent higher than the 1.47 billion yuan it reported for the same period last year.\nIts rival China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) ( 0670.HK ), the country’s second-largest by passenger numbers, said on Thursday its net profit attributable to shareholders fell 29.6 percent to 1.98 billion yuan for the quarter.\nFILE PHOTO: An Air China Airbus A330-200 aircraft takes off from Zurich Airport January 9, 2018.

It has also helped them offset higher operating costs as fuel prices rise.\nAir China’s 2017 results had lagged analysts’ forecasts due to higher-than-expected operating costs.
