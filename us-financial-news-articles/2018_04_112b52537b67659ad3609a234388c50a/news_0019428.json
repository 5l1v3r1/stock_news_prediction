A vote is expected in the evening. \nShould the opposition get more than one-third of votes it would signal weakening support for Zaev’s policies on EU and NATO accession, said political consultant Petar Arsovski. \nVMRO-DPMNE has returned to parliament after a boycott that began in December when five of its MPs were arrested over last year’s clashes between nationalist protesters and deputies in parliament in which Zaev was injured. \nIts presence is key for the passage of laws including one on judiciary reform that is a pre-condition for EU accession and requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority. \n“Zaev: you are leading the most inefficient and unworkable government in the history of our country,” Dragan Danev, the VMRO-DPMNE’s parliamentary coordinator, told deputies. \n“It’s not only me talking or my party, it’s the perception of the people. This government has shown that it does not have the capacity to hold executive power,” he said. \nZaev government took office last May ending a two-year political crisis that brought a VMRO-DPMNE government down.
