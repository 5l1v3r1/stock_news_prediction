It simply wasn’t cooked. It was white and flabby,” Wallace told Good Morning Britain. \n“She (Zaleha Kadir Olpin) didn’t go out because her (chicken) skin wasn’t crispy. She went out because the other cooks were better.” A plate of chicken rendang is pictured at a restaurant in Cyberjaya, Selangor, Malaysia April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nHaikal Johari, 41, executive chef of Michelin-star restaurant Alma by Juan Amador in Singapore, said he had never heard of chicken rendang being crispy, echoing comments by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad, who for once agreed with his arch rival. \nWhile hashtags “gastrodiplomacy” and “rendanggate” cropped up online, Wallace and Torode defended their judgement. \n“I did a whole series on Malaysia. Malaysian food is fantastic,” Australian-born Torode said. “But I said to her, it wasn’t cooked enough.” \nHowever, Torode riled Malaysians by suggesting on Twitter that chicken rendang was from Indonesia. He later deleted the tweet, which ended with “namaste”, an Indian greeting. \nHowever, the jury is still out on which country owns the dish, with neighboring Indonesia already claiming it. Some suggest the first version of rendang was cooked in Padang, West Sumatra, Indonesia, some 600 years ago.
