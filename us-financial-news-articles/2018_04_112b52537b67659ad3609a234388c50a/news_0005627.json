Baltimore pulled even at 5-5 in the top of the seventh, but the Astros plated five runs in the bottom of the inning.\nHouston (5-1) grabbed a 6-5 lead when George Springer delivered an RBI double to left that scored pinch runner Jake Marisnick from second base. Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa worked walks against right-hander Pedro Araujo (0-1), leading to a pitching change that called upon southpaw Nestor Cortes Jr. to face the left-handed-hitting Reddick.\nReddick responded by lining the eighth pitch of his at-bat into the home bullpen in right-center.\nThe Astros got right-hander Justin Verlander off the hook with their initial rally. Verlander allowed a solo home run to Jonathan Schoop with two outs in the first plus a two-run blast by Adam Jones in the sixth.\nVerlander allowed four runs (three earned) on six hits and one walk with nine strikeouts over 5 2/3 innings.\nJones’ homer was his second. He added an RBI single in the seventh off Hector Rondon (1-0) to tie the game at 5-5, and he finished 3-for-5 with three RBIs. Schoop was 3-for-5 and scored three runs.\nErrors by Bregman in the sixth and Springer in the seventh aided Baltimore (1-4). However, the Orioles’ bullpen couldn’t stave off the Astros after right-hander Mike Wright Jr. worked an effective five innings, surrendering three runs on four hits and one walk with six strikeouts.\nTwo of those runs came in the first inning when Correa delivered an inside-the-park home run, the 40th in franchise history and first by the Astros since Jon Singleton turned the trick against the Toronto Blue Jays on Aug. 2, 2014. Correa finished 2-for-2 with three RBIs and three runs.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T12:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:43:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
