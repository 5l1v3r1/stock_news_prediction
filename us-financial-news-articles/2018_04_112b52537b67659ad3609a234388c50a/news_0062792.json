Lender Emirates NBD was up 0.9 percent.\nEmaar Properties jumped 2.7 percent, while its unit Emaar Development climbed 0.9 percent after the development firm recorded a net profit of 819 million dirhams ($223 million) in the first quarter of 2018, versus 506 million a year earlier.\nSICO Bahrain had forecast a net profit of 767 million dirhams and EFG Hermes’ forecast was 800 million dirhams.\n“The results from Emaar Development as well as Emaar Malls suggest the group is navigating the current downturn rather well,” said Vrajesh Bhandari, a portfolio manager at Al Mal Capital.\nEmaar Malls’ net profit rose 1.7 percent to 548 million dirhams, in line with SICO Bahrain’s forecast.\nEmaar and other property stocks have been a drag on the Dubai stock market this year due to concerns over the outlook for property prices. The Dubai index is down 9 percent so far this year.\nIn Saudi Arabia, the main index was down 0.2 percent, with banks largely providing support. Energy stocks were hit by oil’s correction and profit-taking after recent gains.\nRabigh Refining and Petrochemical dropped 5.6 percent as investors took profit after the stock’s big rally this year.

The stock has been volatile after an English court refused the company’s application to overturn a previous order restraining Dana Gas from distributing dividends to its shareholders for 2017.\nQatar’s index lost 0.3 percent as lender Masraf al Rayan shed 0.5 percent and Barwa Real Estate fell 1.8 percent.\nIn Egypt, Global Telecom Holding continued its downward spiral, falling 3 percent.\nThe stock has been under pressure since the start of the month after majority shareholder Veon withdrew an offer to buy the rest of the company and said it would not make another.\nIt has lost more than a fifth of its value in the last month. The benchmark index was flat.\n($1 = 3.6728 UAE dirham)\n* The index shed 0.2 percent to 8,209 points. DUBAI\n* The index climbed 0.6 percent to 3,066 points.
