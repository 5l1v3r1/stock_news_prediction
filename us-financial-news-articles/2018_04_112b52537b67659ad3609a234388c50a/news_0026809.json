He surged ahead on the home straight of the four-and-a-half mile course and looked set for a comfortable win.\nBut David Mullins chased him down on Pleasant Company and Tiger Roll required all his courage to hold off the stirring challenge from the 25-1 shot.\nBless The Wings was third at 40-1 and Ireland completed a clean sweep of the top four with Anibale Fly (10-1).\nThe winning jockey, Ireland’s 38-year-old Davy Russell, said he was delighted to have finally won the race at his 14th attempt.\nHorse Racing - Grand National Festival - Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool, Britain - April 14, 2018 Double Ross ridden by Thomas Bellamy (C) in action at Canal Turn during the 17:15 Randox Health Grand National Handicap Chase Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff “He’s an unbelievable horse. I’ve won this race a thousand times in my head as a child. It is amazing to have finally won; it is a marvelous event,” he said.\nRussell’s win was laced with emotion following the death of his mother earlier this year.\n“She was a marvelous woman, getting up at 6 a.m. to drive me around Ireland for races. She always did what was best for her children,” he said.\nFor O’Leary it was a second triumph after Rule The World in 2016. “At the elbow we were all celebrating, at the line we were all panicking,” he said. “It’s a wonderful day for Davy, and for Gigginstown.”\nElliott has also won the race before, training Silver Birch in 2007. He said: “It’s unbelievable. Tiger Roll is a yard favorite. It’s great for the yard, for Gigginstown (House Stud, owners), for everyone.”\nBefore the race, much attention had been focused on the three female jockeys who were hoping to make history by becoming the first to win the world’s most famous steeplechase.\nOf the trio, Bryony Frost was best placed, finishing fifth on Milansbar.\nWriting by Neil Robinson, Editing by Ken Ferris and Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T19:56:31.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
