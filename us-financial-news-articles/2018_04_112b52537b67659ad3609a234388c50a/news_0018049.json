The Dubai index was down 0.9 percent, hit by property stocks and financials; Emaar Development fell 1.9 percent and Dubai Islamic Bank was down 0.6 percent. \nTheme-park operator DXB Entertainments initially rose after reporting a 45 percent jump in first-quarter visitor arrivals, but then gave up its gains. \nThe Abu Dhabi index was down 1.0 percent, hit by weakness in banking stocks. First Abu Dhabi Bank slipped 1.2 percent. \nQatari’s index was down 0.7 percent, with Commercial Bank sinking 3.7 percent.
