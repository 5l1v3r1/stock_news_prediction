The underwriters will have a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 9,450,000 shares of common stock from the selling stockholder.\nHilton is not offering any shares of common stock in the offering and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares in this offering. In addition, none of Hilton’s officers or directors are selling any shares of common stock beneficially owned by them in the offering.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P.

UBS Investment Bank, Barclays, Wells Fargo Securities and Credit Suisse are also acting as joint book-running managers and underwriters for the offering.

Hilton has the right to increase the number of shares repurchased, up to an aggregate of 16,500,000 shares, by providing notice to HNA prior to the pricing of the offering. The share repurchase will be effected in a private, non-underwritten transaction at a price per share equal to the price per share at which the underwriters will purchase shares from the selling stockholder in the offering, less an amount equal to 1% of the public offering price per share (subject to certain adjustments). Hilton expects to fund the share repurchase with available cash, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and/or new unsecured indebtedness. Although the share repurchase will be conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the offering, the closing of the offering will not be conditioned upon the closing of the share repurchase. The share repurchase has been approved by a committee of the Company’s board of directors comprised of independent directors who are not affiliated with HNA or the selling stockholder, and is apart from, and will not count toward, the Company’s existing share repurchase program.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Hilton\nHilton (NYSE: HLT) is a leading global hospitality company, with a portfolio of 14 world-class brands comprising more than 5,300 properties with more than 856,000 rooms, in 105 countries and territories.
