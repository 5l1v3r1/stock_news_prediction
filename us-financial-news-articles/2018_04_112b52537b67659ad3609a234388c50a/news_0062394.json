a disabled family head living in an urban slum; or an indigenous nomad in Mongolia or the Sahel.\nSuch households may be the hardest to reach using the traditional method of connecting homes to the power grid - but there are alternatives, Kyte emphasized.\n“With mini-grids, micro-grids or off-grid systems, those people are reachable, and they are reachable with clean energy and they are reachable affordably,” she said.\nVALUE FOR MONEY Governments of countries doing badly on energy access need to set national targets, invest in infrastructure, and tackle corruption, Kyte said.\nEven for the poorest states or those emerging from conflict, “prioritizing energy access is a real value-for-money approach to take, because lots of other things happen,” she added.\nSwitching from polluting fuels such as kerosene and diesel to solar power can improve people’s health, help children study and allow small businesses to flourish, experts say.\n“Distributed energy” solutions - small-scale systems that operate independently of the main grid and are often powered by renewables - can be built quickly and nimbly in difficult situations, Kyte said.\nThey are also suitable for use in and around camps for refugees and displaced people, where failure to provide solar lamps or efficient cooking stoves can lead to deforestation.\nKyte hopes international agencies and businesses will put in place a global action plan in the coming months to provide clean power to people forced to flee their homes.\nSimilarly, she urged development banks, governments and companies to team up and work out what financial and technical aid is needed for the 20 countries that are home to four-fifths of the 1 billion still in the dark.\nAnother priority for poor nations is energy efficiency, she said, which could help avoid pollution and smog in their cities.\n“If you talk about energy efficiency as the way to ensure clean air, clean water, low energy bills, buildings you want to live in, transport you want to travel in, then that becomes a big part of leaving no one behind,” Kyte said.\nReporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling;
