You’re not allowed to fake the guy behind.\n“Because naturally if there was not that rule, that’s what you’d do because eventually you’d catch them sleeping. You’re not allowed to do that.\n“Every re-start I’ve done...I’ve abided by that,” the Briton told reporters. “In Australia, Sebastian accelerated and then braked and I nearly went up the back end of him. And today he did it like maybe four times.”\nHamilton said he believed Whiting had passed the matter on to stewards for their consideration but they had decided not to take action because the other cars were doing it.\nThe four-times world champion said that was because of a domino effect.\n“That now sets a precedent, so that means everyone leading a grand prix under a safety car can start and stop, start and stop,” he said.\n“I need to get that rectified when I have the briefing next because clearly they don’t care about it, and if that’s the case then we will see more of that. And I will expect that from him next time I am racing with him.”\nSunday’s race had two safety car periods due to crashes, with drivers weaving to keep heat in their tires in cold and gusty conditions.\nVettel was leading from pole position at the first re-start, with Hamilton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas at the head of the field for the second with the Ferrari behind and Hamilton third.\nThe German overcooked an attempt to pass Bottas at the second re-start, with Hamilton and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen going through as he went wide. Bottas retired with a puncture three laps from the end.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:25:44.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
