(NYSE:QEP) (QEP or the Company) today reported first quarter 2018 financial and operating results.\nDelivered record net oil equivalent production in the Permian Basin of 30.9 Mboed, including record oil production of 24.0 Mbod Reported net gas equivalent production of 286.0 MMcfed in Haynesville/Cotton Valley, a 110% year-over-year increase Increased 2018 production guidance and forecasted capital expenditures to reflect an accelerated well delivery cadence in the Permian Basin resulting from significant improvements in drilling and completion efficiency Opened data rooms for the divestiture of the Company’s Williston and Uinta basin assets Commenced execution of an authorized $1.25 billion share repurchase program\n\"During the first quarter we delivered strong production growth in the Permian Basin, driven by the continued success of our 'tank-style' completions and operational efficiency gains in both drilling and completion activities,\" commented Chuck Stanley, Chairman, President and CEO of QEP. \"We accelerated the well delivery cadence in the Permian through faster drill times and a step-change in the number of frac stages completed each month by each of our two completion crews. As a direct result of these efficiencies, we were able to put 31 net wells on production during the quarter in the Permian Basin, compared to our original plan of 18 net wells. We now expect to complete and put on production nine more net wells than originally forecasted during 2018, resulting in an increase in Permian oil volumes and an associated increase in capital expenditures.\"\n\"As we continue to focus on balancing capital investments and cash flow, we have reduced capital allocated to our Williston Basin and Haynesville/Cotton Valley assets for the remainder of 2018 to support additional investment in the Permian Basin. We have delineated and refined our tank-style completion methodology over the past year and are now in full development mode on our Permian assets, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver the results set forth in our revised guidance.\"\n\"We also made great progress on our strategic and financial initiatives (Strategic Initiatives) announced in February, which will result in QEP becoming a pure-play Permian Basin company. Data rooms for the Williston and Uinta basin assets are open and we expect to have these asset sales completed during the second half of 2018. We also began executing our share repurchase program by opportunistically repurchasing over 6.2 million shares of common stock in March,\" concluded Stanley.\nThe Company has posted to its website www.qepres.com a presentation that supplements the information provided in this release.\nQEP First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nThe Company reported a net loss of $53.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2018 compared with net income of $76.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017.\nNet income or loss includes non-cash gains and losses associated with the change in the fair value of derivative instruments, gains and losses from asset sales, asset impairments and certain other items. Excluding these items, the Company’s first quarter 2018 Adjusted Net Loss (a non-GAAP measure) was $47.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with Adjusted Net Loss of $34.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) for the first quarter 2018 was $171.9 million compared with $170.7 million for the first quarter 2017, primarily due to an increase in average realized prices and an increase in oil equivalent production in the Permian Basin and Haynesville/Cotton Valley, which were partially offset by the loss of Adjusted EBITDA from the Pinedale Divestiture, which closed in September 2017, and increases in general and administrative and lease operating expenses.\nThe definitions and reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) are provided within Non-GAAP Measures at the end of this release.\nProduction\nOil equivalent production was 11.7 MMboe for the first quarter 2018 compared with 13.1 MMboe for the first quarter 2017, an 11% decrease. Oil and condensate production increased 6%, while natural gas and NGL production decreased 17% and 33%, respectively. First quarter 2018 equivalent production was positively impacted by increased drilling and completion activity in the Permian Basin and Haynesville/Cotton Valley. The increase was offset by lower production resulting from decreased drilling activity in the Williston Basin and the loss of 3.5 MMboe of production in Pinedale as a result of the Pinedale Divestiture.\nOperating Expenses\nDuring the first quarter 2018, lease operating expense (LOE) was $72.5 million, or $6.18 per Boe, an increase of 17% compared with the first quarter 2017, primarily due to the loss of lower LOE cost per Boe production in Pinedale as a result of the Pinedale Divestiture. Excluding the Pinedale Divestiture, LOE per Boe was down 2% in the quarter, primarily due to a decrease in the Permian Basin, which was driven by lower LOE cost per Boe production from recent horizontal well completions offsetting higher LOE cost per Boe production associated with low volume vertical wells obtained in the 2017 Permian Basin acquisition.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, Adjusted transportation and processing (T&P) costs (a non-GAAP measure) were $46.7 million, or $3.98 per Boe, a decrease of 26% compared with the first quarter 2017, primarily due to the loss of higher per Boe T&P cost production in Pinedale as a result of the Pinedale Divestiture. Excluding the Pinedale Divestiture, Adjusted transportation and processing costs per Boe were down 28% in the quarter, primarily due to decreased T&P costs per Boe in the Haynesville/Cotton Valley, driven by an increase in production that increased utilization of the Company's firm transportation commitments on interstate pipelines. The definition and reconciliation of Adjusted transportation and processing costs to the transportation and processing costs presented in QEP's statement of operations are provided within Non-GAAP Measures at the end of this release.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, production and property taxes were $28.9 million, or $2.47 per Boe, an increase of 11% compared with the first quarter 2017. The increase in production and property taxes was primarily due to an overall increase in average field-level oil equivalent prices in the Permian Basin and an increase in production volumes in Haynesville/Cotton Valley during the first quarter 2018. The increase was partially offset by the Pinedale Divestiture.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, general and administrative expense was $60.1 million, or $5.13 per Boe, an increase of 79% compared with the first quarter 2017. The increase in the first quarter 2018 was primarily due to an increase in termination benefits and severance expenses associated with our Strategic Initiatives. In addition to these restructuring costs, QEP recognized an increase in share-based compensation and changes in the mark-to-market value of the Deferred Compensation Wrap Plan, an increase in outside services, an increase in labor, benefits and employee expenses and an increase in legal expenses.\nCapital Investment\nCapital investment, excluding property acquisitions, was $418.8 million (on an accrual basis) for the first quarter 2018, compared with $214.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Approximately $400.2 million of the capital expenditures was related to the drilling, completion and equipping of wells and $17.9 million was related to infrastructure investment. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily related to increased drilling and completion activity in the Permian Basin and Haynesville/Cotton Valley and significant improvements in drilling and completion efficiency primarily in the Permian Basin, which have accelerated the well delivery schedule for 2018.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, QEP acquired various oil and gas properties, which primarily included proved and unproved leasehold acreage in the Permian Basin, for an aggregate purchase price of $36.2 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Of the $36.2 million, $35.7 million was related to acquisitions of additional oil and gas interests in certain properties in the 2017 acquisition of oil and gas properties in the Permian Basin (the 2017 Permian Basin Acquisition) on substantially the same terms and conditions as the 2017 Permian Basin Acquisition.\nShare Repurchase\nDuring March 2018, the Company repurchased and retired 5,621,540 shares at a weighted average price of $9.37 per share, for $52.8 million. Additionally, the Company entered into trades to repurchase an additional 592,310 shares at a weighted average price of $9.37 per share, for $5.6 million in late March 2018. The shares purchased in late March 2018 were settled and retired in April 2018.\nAsset Divestitures\nQEP closed on the sale of several non-core assets for total proceeds of approximately $33.3 million during the first quarter 2018. In addition, in April 2018, the Company has provided data for potential buyers to evaluate for the divestiture of the Company's Williston and Uinta Basin assets.\nLiquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, QEP had $385.0 million of borrowings outstanding and $1.0 million in letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility. The Company estimates, that as of March 31, 2018, it could incur additional indebtedness of approximately $315.0 million and be in compliance with the covenants contained in its revolving credit facility.\n2018 Strategic Initiatives\nIn February 2018, QEP’s Board of Directors unanimously approved certain Strategic Initiatives, summarized below, to transition the Company to a pure-play Permian Basin company and to address the significant discount to net asset value reflected in the Company's share price.\nDivest of the Company’s Williston and Uinta basin assets Market remaining non-Permian assets, including the Haynesville/Cotton Valley, in the second half of 2018 Use proceeds from asset sales to fund Permian Basin development program until the program reaches operating cash flow neutrality in 2019, reduce debt and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases Authorized a $1.25 billion share repurchase program (1)\n(1) Subject to available liquidity, market conditions and proceeds from asset sales.\nUpdated 2018 Guidance\nThe Company’s updated guidance assumes no additional property acquisitions or divestitures, other than those executed in the first quarter 2018, and assumes that QEP will elect to reject ethane from its produced gas for the entire year where QEP has the right to make such an election, except in the Permian Basin where processing economics support ethane recovery.\nQEP's updated full year 2018 guidance is detailed below.\nRig Count\nPermian Basin (average of four and one-half rigs) - expected to drop to four rigs in May 2018 for balance of year Williston Basin (average of one-quarter rig) - rig released on April 9, 2018 Haynesville/Cotton Valley (average of one-half rig) - rig expected to be released mid-May 2018\nWells Put on Production:\nCompany: approximately 120 net operated wells Permian Basin: approximately 104 net operated wells\nRefracs:\nApproximately 28 net refracs between the Williston Basin and Haynesville/Cotton\nSlide 7 in the April 2018 Investor Presentation provides additional details on QEP's 2018 Guidance.\n2018 Guidance 2018 2018 Previous Forecast Current Forecast Oil & condensate production (MMbbl) 21.0 - 22.5 21.5 - 23.0 Gas production (Bcf) 132.0 - 143.0 135.0 - 145.0 NGL production (MMbbl) 4.7 - 5.2 4.25 - 4.75 Total oil equivalent production (MMboe) 47.7 - 51.5 48.3 - 51.9 Lease operating and transportation expense (per Boe) (1) $9.00 - $10.00 $9.00 - $10.00 Depletion, depreciation and amortization (per Boe) $17.50 - $18.50 $17.00 - $18.00 Production and property taxes (% of field-level revenue) 8.5 % 8.5 % (in millions) General and administrative expense (2) $185 - $205 $195 - $215 Capital investment (excluding property acquisitions) Drilling, Completion and Equip (3) $965 - $1,065 $1,000 - $1,100 Infrastructure $50 $60 Corporate $10 $10 Total capital investment (excluding property acquisitions) $1,025 - $1,125 $1,070 - $1,170\n(1) Lease operating and transportation expense (per Boe) is calculated using adjusted transportation and processing costs, a non-GAAP measure.

Permian Basin\nPermian Basin net oil equivalent production averaged approximately 30.9 Mboed (89% liquids) during the first quarter 2018, a record for the Company in the basin, and an 11% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and a 101% increase compared with the first quarter 2017.\nIn the first quarter 2018, the Company put on production 31 gross-operated horizontal wells, 13 more than originally forecast, in the first quarter 2018 (average working interest 100%) in two, one-half-mile wide drilling spacing units (DSU), one DSU with nine and the other DSU with 22 wells. While the majority of the wells were still in the process of cleaning up at the end of the quarter, early performance suggests the wells are performing at or above expectations, based on their respective well densities. The greater than planned delivery of wells in the first quarter 2018 was due to decreased drilling times and better than forecast completion efficiency. Since entering the Permian Basin in 2014, the Company has achieved an almost three-fold increase in the number of frac stages completed per frac crew per month, with the two crews working for QEP averaging over 355 stages per crew per month during the first quarter 2018. The Company has also reduced drill times (spud to total depth) by more than 25% over the past twelve months.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company had 20 gross-operated horizontal wells in process of being drilled (of which nine had surface casing set, but had no drilling rig present), eight horizontal wells at total depth under drilling rigs (average working interest 96%), 15 horizontal wells waiting to be completed (average working interest 96%), six horizontal wells undergoing completion (average working interest 100%), and nine fully completed horizontal wells awaiting first production, which were part of a tank \"pressure wall\" (average working interest 100%).\nCurrent QEP-operated drilled and completed authorization for expenditure (AFE) well costs for the Permian Basin are detailed on slide 24 of the April 2018 Investor Presentation.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company had six operated rigs in the Permian Basin.\nSlides 9-16 in the April 2018 Investor Presentation depict QEP's acreage and activity in the Permian Basin.\nWilliston Basin\nWilliston Basin net oil equivalent production averaged approximately 41.4 Mboed (85% liquids) during the first quarter 2018, a 15% decrease compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and a 23% decrease compared with the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company completed and returned to production seven gross-operated refracs on South Antelope (average working interest 97%) during the first quarter 2018. None of the seven refracs had reached peak oil rates by the end of the quarter. The Company also plans to complete eight additional refracs on South Antelope during the remainder of 2018. Current average gross QEP-operated Williston Basin refrac costs are approximately $4.8 million per well.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company had one gross-operated horizontal well being drilled (working interest 50%), five horizontal wells at total depth under drilling rigs (average working interest 100%), two gross-operated horizontal wells waiting to be completed (average working interest 100%), two horizontal wells undergoing completion (average working interest 100%), and one fully completed horizontal well awaiting first production (working interest 100%), all on South Antelope.\nCurrent QEP-operated drilled and completed AFE well costs for the Williston Basin are detailed on slide 24 of the April 2018 Investor Presentation.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company had one operated rig in the Williston Basin on South Antelope.\nSlides 17-19 in the April 2018 Investor Presentation depict QEP's acreage and activity in the Williston Basin.\nHaynesville/Cotton Valley\nHaynesville/Cotton Valley net gas equivalent production averaged approximately 286.0 MMcfed (47.7 Mboed) during the first quarter 2018, a 9% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and a 110% increase compared with the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company put on production two gross operated wells during the first quarter 2018 (average working interest 100%). The first well put on production in the quarter had a peak 24-hour IP rate of 44.4 MMcfed (100% gas) with a lateral length of 9,725 feet. The second well put on production in the quarter had a peak 24-hour IP rate of 38.3 MMcfed (100% gas) with a lateral length of 9,947 feet.\nDuring the quarter the Company completed and returned to production seven QEP-operated refracs, with an average incremental 24-hour rate increase of 14.6 MMcfed (average working interest 99%). The Company expects to refrac approximately six additional net operated wells during 2018.\nCurrent average gross QEP-operated Haynesville refrac costs are approximately $4.9 million per well.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company had one operated rig in Haynesville/Cotton Valley and two gross horizontal wells in the process of being drilled (average working interest 100%).\nSlides 20-21 in the April 2018 Investor Presentation depict QEP's acreage and activity in Haynesville/Cotton Valley.\nUinta Basin\nUinta Basin net production averaged approximately 53.6 MMcfed (8.9 Mboed) (23% liquids) during the first quarter 2018, a 2% decrease compared with the fourth quarter 2017 and an 18% decrease compared with the first quarter 2017.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company put on production two gross operated vertical wells (average working interest 100%).\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company had no drilling rigs in the Uinta Basin.\nSlide 22 in the April 2018 Investor Presentation depicts QEP's acreage and activity in the Uinta Basin.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results Conference Call\nQEP’s management will discuss first quarter 2018 results in a conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018, beginning at 9:00 a.m. EDT.

QEP RESOURCES, INC.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThis release contains references to the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Management defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted to exclude changes in fair value of derivative contracts, exploration expenses, gains and losses from asset sales, impairment and certain other items. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate QEP's financial performance and trends, make operating decisions and allocate resources. Management believes the measure is useful supplemental information for investors because it eliminates the impact of certain nonrecurring, non-cash and/or other items that management does not consider as indicative of QEP's performance from period to period. QEP's Adjusted EBITDA may be determined or calculated differently than similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry, which would reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP financial measure when comparing our performance to that of other companies.\nBelow is a reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) (a GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA. This non-GAAP measure should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Net income (loss) $ (53.6 ) $ 76.9 Interest expense 35.0 33.8 Interest and other (income) expense 0.7 (0.6 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (13.9 ) 45.6 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 196.5 191.8 Unrealized (gains) losses on derivative contracts 10.0 (177.3 ) Exploration expenses — 0.4 Net (gain) loss from asset sales (3.5 ) — Impairment 0.7 0.1 Adjusted EBITDA $ 171.9 $ 170.7 Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nThis release contains references to the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Management defines Adjusted Net Income (Loss) as earnings excluding gains and losses from asset sales, unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts, asset impairments and certain other items.

Adjusted Transportation and Processing Costs\nThis release contains references to the non-GAAP measure of adjusted transportation and processing costs. Management defines adjusted transportation and processing costs as transportation and processing costs presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and transportation and processing costs that are included as part of \"Oil and condensate, gas and NGL sales\" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These costs are added together to reflect the total operating costs associated with QEP's production. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful supplemental information for investors as it reflects the total production costs required to operate the wells for the period and is a more comparable measure to the operating costs of its peers.\nBelow is a reconciliation of adjusted transportation and processing costs to transportation and processing costs as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (a GAAP measure).
