However, an eagle on the eighth helped him take the lead.\nThe 28-year-old then made eight straight pars but a slight wobble towards the end meant that he could not extend his lead further.\n“There were a lot of guys on eight under par this morning and I tried to push on and widen the gap but the weather didn’t really allow me to score. Hopefully the weather will be kind.”\nSpain’s Nacho Elvira was tied second alongside Australia’s Jason Scrievner and America’s Sihwan Kim.\nThe Spanish pair of Jorge Campillo and Adrian Otaegui were at seven under alongside France’s Julien Guerrier and South Korea’s Soomin Lee in fifth.
