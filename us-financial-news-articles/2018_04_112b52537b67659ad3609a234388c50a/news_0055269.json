We were granted three patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office with numerous patents pending, which demonstrates a strong product pipeline.\"\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2018, total operating expenses were $3.6 million, compared with total operating expenses of $4.3 million in the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.8 million, or $0.03 per share, compared with a net loss of $5.2 million, or $0.09 per share, during the prior fiscal year's fourth quarter.\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense, the impact of the change in the fair value of the warrant liability, and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $3.4 million, or $0.03 per share. During the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year, the comparable non-GAAP net loss was $4.4 million, or $0.08 per share.\nFull Year Financial Results\nTotal operating expenses for the fiscal year were $16.7 million, compared with $18.0 million in the prior fiscal year. The decrease resulted primarily from lower expenditures for the company's clinical trial activities related to BPX-01.\nNet loss for the fiscal year was $16.6 million, or $0.19 per share, compared with a net loss of $18.5 million, or $0.52 per share, during the prior fiscal year.\nExcluding stock-based compensation expense, a charge related to the modification of certain warrants, the impact of the change in the fair value of the warrant liability, and amortization of purchased intangible assets, non-GAAP net loss for the year was $15.0 million, or $0.17 per share. In the prior fiscal year, the comparable non-GAAP net loss was $17.1 million, or $0.48 per share.\nCash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2018, were $7.6 million. Additionally, BioPharmX reported that after the end of the year and through the date of this press release, the company received $7.0 million in cash through warrant exercises subsequent to January 31, 2018.\nBioPharmX also disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, filed April 26, 2018 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that its audited financial statements contained an audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm that included a going concern paragraph. See further discussion in footnote 2 to BioPharmX's consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This announcement is made pursuant to NYSE American Company Guide Section 610(b), which requires separate public announcement of the receipt of an audit opinion containing a going concern paragraph.\nAbout BioPharmX Â® Corporation\nBioPharmX Corporation (NYSE American: BPMX) is a Silicon Valley-based specialty pharmaceutical company, which seeks to provide products through proprietary platform technologies for prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), and supplement applications in the health and wellness markets, including dermatology and women's health. To learn more about BioPharmX, visit www.BioPharmX.com .\nBPX-01 is BioPharmX's investigational product for the treatment of acne. It has successfully completed its Phase 2b studies. BPX-04 is BioPharmX's investigational product for the treatment of rosacea, for which the Phase 2 program has commenced. Both products share a novel topical delivery system to carry a minocycline gel to the target area in the skin.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nBioPharmX Corporation has supplemented its reported GAAP financial information with non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP net loss, and non-GAAP net loss per share, that do not include stock-based compensation expense, the impact of changes in the fair value of the warrant liability, expense related to the modification of warrants, and the amortization of purchased intangible assets. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses the non-GAAP information internally to evaluate its ongoing business, operational performance and cash requirements and believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors as they provide the same basis for evaluating BioPharmX Corporation's performance as applied by management.\nBioPharmX Corporation has provided a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. BioPharmX Corporation believes that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with its results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. BioPharmX Corporation encourages investors and others to review the company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nStock-based compensation expenses represent non-cash charges related to equity awards granted by BioPharmX Corporation. The change in fair value of the warrant liability results from the periodic revaluing of the warrant liability. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, BioPharmX Corporation amended certain warrants resulting in a one-time charge. This amount is excluded from its non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because it is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. Although these are recurring charges to BioPharmX Corporation's operations, management believes the measurement of these amounts can vary considerably from period to period and depend substantially on factors that are not a direct consequence of operating performance that is within management's control. Thus, management believes that excluding these charges from non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share facilitates comparisons of BioPharmX Corporation's operational performance in different periods, as well as with similarly determined non-GAAP financial measures of comparable companies.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets results from the purchase of a license related to molecular iodine technology. This amount is excluded from non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share because it is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information in this press release contains forward-looking statements and information Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are subject to the \"safe harbor\" created by those sections.
