It made large purchases late in January, in February and in April and has published an investor newsletter that listed Fletcher as a “turnaround story”. \n“In New Zealand at the moment there’s huge opportunities,” said John Tookey, professor of construction management at the Auckland University of Technology. \n“Fletchers have a lot of reach in the marketplace,” he added, as demand for housing, retail commercial and infrastructure construction remains strong. \nEllerston did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Fletcher declined to comment. Wesfarmers, which has previously declined comment on the Sydney Morning Herald report, did not immediately respond to a request for fresh comment. \nA stake of more than 5 percent needs to be formally disclosed in a filing, according to New Zealand stock exchange regulations. \nFletcher slumped to a half-year loss in February, capping a year of earnings downgrades, as labour charges and materials costs on its two biggest commercial building jobs ran out of control. \nThe cost blowouts, even as booming construction has powered New Zealand’s economy to 20 consecutive quarters of growth - have cost its chief executive and chairman their jobs and prompted the firm to scrap its dividend for the first time in its history. \nOn Monday, Fletcher’s stock lost ground after initial gains to trade 1 percent lower. It gained 9 percent on Friday after the Wesfarmers report but is still down 17 percent for the year to date.
