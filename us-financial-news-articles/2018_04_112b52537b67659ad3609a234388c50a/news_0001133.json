O'Neil is a spokesman for the NTSB. He says, \"in each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely cooperative on assisting with the vehicle data.\" He adds, \"the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla.\"\nThe NTSB says its next update will come in a preliminary report, which generally takes weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:51:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
