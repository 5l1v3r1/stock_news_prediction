Song returned to Beijing without meeting Kim. \nNorth Korea’s ties with China, its sole ally, had become strained over the past couple of years over the North’s contentious missile and nuclear tests. \nKim and Song also exchanged their views on deepening the bilateral relations, the KCNA said. Kim said he would develop their friendship into a “fresh phase of development as required by a new era by further strengthening of the bilateral relations.” Reporting By Jane Chung; editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T02:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T02:56:46.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
