The updated guidance equates to a projected Adjusted EBITDA of between $28 and $30 million. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is provided as an exhibit to the release.\nThe improvement in expected results is driven by three factors:\nImproved sales volume strength in the Metals Segment. Unaudited sales of stainless steel pipe and tubing and seamless carbon pipe and tubing have shown tremendous growth during the first quarter 2018, showing year over year gains of approximately 30% and 47%, respectively. Order backlogs have increased to almost four months, providing confidence in the durability of current activity levels through 2018. Higher than previously anticipated sales mix of special alloy and carbon steel products combine to support higher improved projected product margins. Rising nickel and alloy pricing is generating substantial improvement in projected conversion margins for the year.\nOutlook\nWe are very optimistic that our 2018 financial results will achieve the revised guidance targets. Our primary end markets continue to point toward increasing demand and improving prices. The recent actions against dumping of imported stainless steel pipe and tube are already resulting in improved market dynamics for this critical product line. The Specialty Chemicals Segment performed well in the first quarter 2018, generating unaudited sales approximating plan, and slightly ahead of 2017. Excluding contributions from any acquisitions, our current forecast for 2018 calls for between a 19% to 22% increase in revenue and between a 124% and 140% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. The Companyâ€™s balance sheet is in excellent shape and we have ample borrowing capacity to meet our needs going forward.\nSynalloy Corporation (Nasdaq:SYNL) is a growth-oriented company that engages in a number of diverse business activities including the production of stainless steel pipe and tubing, fiberglass and steel storage tanks and specialty chemicals and the master distribution of seamless carbon pipe and tubing.
