Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Systems often don’t get the attention they deserve until they fail. Does this assessment, offered by David A. Powner, director of information technology management issues at the United States Government Accountability office, strike a chord? He made the comment to CIO Journal’s Angus Loten in reference to Tuesday’s IRS systems failure, but the tendency to let systems slide into disrepair extends well beyond federal IT.\nThe hardware failure that delayed filing highlights the risks for CIOs struggling with aging backend IT systems, tight budgets and growing pressure to provide innovative front-end services, according to Mr. Loten. “For the IRS this was a mission-critical system that processes most of our $3.3 trillion in taxes every year,” Mr. Powner, told CIO Journal. “But we still don’t see a definite plan to get it into shape.”\nThe agency’s legacy hardware systems are programmed with assembly language, a computer language initially used in the 1950s, Mr. Powner said. This includes the agency’s Individual Master File, or IMF, its main computer system for data on individual taxpayer accounts, he added. It is the computer system underpinning the agency’s modernized e-file system, which taxpayers use to file returns online, he said.\nDespite recent federal IT modernization efforts, officials across the federal government tend to shy away from overhauling backend systems that remain operational, Mr. Powner said. That means systems often don’t get the attention they need until they fail, he said.\nCLOUD \nA view of a the Seljalandsfoss Waterfall in Rangarping eystra, Iceland.
