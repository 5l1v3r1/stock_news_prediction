U.S. President Donald Trump has accused both Russia and China of devaluing their currencies while the U.S. raises interest rates. Russia’s central bank said it would not intervene in currency markets following the rouble’s sharp fall last week.\nBroader emerging markets also remained under pressure as geopolitical tensions dampened overall risk appetite.\nMSCI’s benchmark emerging stocks index fell 0.4 percent , with the United States and Britain blaming Russia for cyber attacks and the U.S. accusing Russia or Syria of blocking international inspectors from reaching the site of a suspected poison gas attack in Syria.\nChow said geopolitical events and trade tensions increased the probability of tail risk events that could harm global activity and emerging market exports, and were making investors cautious.\n“But they don’t alter the central scenario, which is that emerging market growth is still pretty solid and improving,” he added, flagging China’s continued resilience.\nChina’s economy grew by 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous quarter, and slightly above expectations.\nBut March industrial output missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed.\nChina’s yuan was steady but mainland stocks fell 1.5 percent to near eight-month lows, and Hong Kong shares fell 0.8 percent as trade tensions between China and the U.S. lingered.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce has banned U.S. companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp for seven years, U.S. officials said on Monday. ZTE’s shares were suspended from trading in Shanghai and Hong Kong.\nIn emerging Europe, Turkish stocks led the selling, down 1.3 percent, while the lira weakened 0.4 percent.\nEarlier in Asia, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority intervened again in the currency market as the Hong Kong dollar repeatedly hit the lower end of its allowable trading band.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1158.53 -4.72 -0.41 +0.01\nCzech Rep 1129.22 -7.38 -0.65 +4.74\nPoland 2296.41 -3.79 -0.16 -6.70\nHungary 38258.11 -38.17 -0.10 -2.84\nRomania 8889.49 -14.11 -0.16 +14.65\nGreece 826.58 +5.70 +0.69 +3.02\nRussia 1118.82 +33.66 +3.10 -3.08\nSouth Africa 49914.30 -206.90 -0.41 -4.98\nTurkey 09869.42 -818.31 -0.74 -4.74\nChina 3067.52 -43.13 -1.39 -7.25\nIndia 34350.27 +44.84 +0.13 +0.86\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.25 25.26 +0.03 +1.10\nPoland 4.16 4.15 -0.20 +0.37\nHungary 310.61 310.04 -0.18 -0.03\nRomania 4.65 4.64 -0.18 +0.64\nSerbia 118.00 118.00 +0.00 +0.34\nRussia 61.55 61.13 -0.68 -6.33\nKazakhstan 328.50 329.26 +0.23 +1.31\nUkraine 26.07 26.08 +0.03 +7.95\nSouth Africa 12.02 12.05 +0.28 +2.83\nKenya 100.40 100.50 +0.10 +2.69\nIsrael 3.53 3.53 -0.01 -1.37\nTurkey 4.11 4.09 -0.42 -7.81\nChina 6.28 6.28 -0.02 +3.67\nIndia 65.65 65.46 -0.29 -2.78\nBrazil 3.42 3.42 -0.00 -3.13\nMexico 18.03 18.00 -0.16 +8.97\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 318 -1 .06 7 93.52 1\nReporting and graphic by Claire Milhench; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:45:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
