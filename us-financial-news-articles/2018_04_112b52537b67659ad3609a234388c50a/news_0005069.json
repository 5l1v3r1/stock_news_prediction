Some 26 legislators, many from the SLFP, were absent. \n“We can have a fresh start from tomorrow,” Harin Fernando, a minister with the UNP told the parliament during the debate. \nBut many UNP legislators urged Wickremesinghe to sack the SLFP ministers who had expressed no confidence in him - suggesting the unity of the coalition was fraying.

But the center-left SLFP had opposed many liberal economic policy measures proposed by the center-right UNP. \nWickremesinghe has faced criticism for failing to deliver on economic growth which slumped to a 16-year low of 3.1 percent last year here , its worst pace since a recession in 2001. The rupee currency is hovering at a record low. \nThe government is also under pressure as it tries to manage China’s expanding infrastructure push in Sri Lanka, located near key shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean. Over-dependence on China for borrowing, however, has raised fears that this may push the tiny country deeper into debt. \nForeign direct investments doubled to $1.6 billion last year, but more than 40 percent of that was from China, for two key projects that have dragged on for more than a year.
