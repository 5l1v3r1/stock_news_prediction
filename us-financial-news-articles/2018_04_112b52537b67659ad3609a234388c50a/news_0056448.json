REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/Files The transaction, if it closes as seems likely, will create a company commanding more than a quarter of the combined world market for seeds and pesticides in the fast-consolidating farm supplies industry.\nBayer declined to comment.\nThe U.S. Justice Department said in March it was pressing on with its antitrust review of the deal.\nThe merger has already cleared key hurdles. Russia’s antitrust regulator FAS approved it last week and the European Commission last month gave conditional clearance, following a conditional nod in Brazil.\nAlso last week, the German group raised 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) by selling new shares to Singapore’s state investment company, with further moves expected to increase its capital.\nBayer previously said it would only launch a cash call once it had sufficient clarity that the deal, signed in September 2016, would get the go-ahead.\nReporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Ludwig Burger in Frankfurt; Editing by Douglas Busvine and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:38:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
