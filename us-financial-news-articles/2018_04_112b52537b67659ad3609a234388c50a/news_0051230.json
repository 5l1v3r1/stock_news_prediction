Helvea Baader, JP Morgan, Kepler Cheuvreux and Bernstein all cut their price targets on the stock, while HSBC cut it to “reduce” from “buy”.\nFirst-quarter results helped propel Rotork shares up 7 percent to the top of the index, however.\nM&A news also rumbled on. Shares in Swiss banking software business Temenos gained 4.9 percent after it said it would not raise its bid for Fidessa.\nThe British financial trading systems firm ditched Temenos in favour of a 1.5 billion pound deal with rival bidder Ion.
