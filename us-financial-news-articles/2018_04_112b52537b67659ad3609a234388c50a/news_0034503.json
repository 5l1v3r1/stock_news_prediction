This approach has weakened accountants' control over these core business services and hampered their ability to best serve their clients.\nSince 2000, AccountantsWorld has committed to countering this trend by using cloud technology to bring control of accounting and payroll services back to accountants. Stronger control of these services helps accountants better serve their clients, raise their relevance and become more successful. Today, AccountantsWorld offers a complete suite of professional Accountant-Centric cloud solutions for accounting, payroll processing, document management, client portals, after-the-fact payroll and practice management. AccountantsWorld never sells its products or services directly to accountants' clients.
