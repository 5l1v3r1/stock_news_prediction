Kidnapping for ransom is common in parts of Nigeria.\nFive gunmen ambushed a vehicle carrying construction workers and opened fire on them along Sabon Titi Madobi road at around 7:45 a.m. (0645 GMT), a police spokesman said. The road is on the outskirts of the state’s capital city, also called Kano.\nThe vehicle was carrying staff of Dantata & Sawoe Construction Company, a Nigerian firm, to a building site, Kano police said in a statement. A police sergeant, who was part of a protection unit escorting the group, was killed and the German man was abducted, the statement added.\nThe “manhunt of the abductors is ongoing,” said Kano state police in a statement. The German embassy in Nigeria declined to comment. The company also did not immediately respond to calls and an email requesting comment.\nReporting by Desmond Mgboh; Additional reporting by Paul Carsten in Abuja and Alexis Akwagyiram in Lagos; Writing by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T18:27:44.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
