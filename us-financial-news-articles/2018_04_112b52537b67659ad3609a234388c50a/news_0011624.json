Yields rise as bond prices fall. It was the largest one-day increase in more than six weeks.\nRecent volatility in stock prices has contributed to the appeal of bonds, some investors said, driving the 10-year yield to its lowest closing level since Jan. 31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed Tuesday down 9.7% from its Jan. 26 peak.\nThe decline in stocks also has raised some questions among investors about whether financial conditions will tighten enough to prevent the Federal Reserve to meet its forecast of three rate increases this year, which policy makers penciled in at their December meeting.\nFederal funds futures late Tuesday afternoon were signaling a 73% probability that the Fed will raise rates two more times by the end of 2018, according to data from CME Group. CME data show an 85% likelihood that the next central bank rate increase will happen at the Fed’s June meeting.\nThe next major test for investors is Friday’s scheduled release of the Labor Department’s report on nonfarm payrolls. Investors will be looking for any signs that a tight labor market is leading to mounting wage pressures, which would help spur inflation in the broader economy.
