The Company’s approach centers on its pipeline featuring late-stage assets targeting rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including fosmetpantotenate for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN), a life-threatening neurological disorder that typically begins in early childhood, and sparsentan for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), disorders characterized by progressive scarring of the kidney often leading to end-stage renal disease. Research in additional rare diseases is also underway, including a joint development arrangement evaluating the potential of CNSA-001 in phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic metabolic condition that can lead to neurological and behavioral impairment. Retrophin’s R&D efforts are supported by revenues from the Company’s commercial products Chenodal®, Cholbam® and Thiola®.\nRetrophin.com\nContact:\nChris Cline, CFA\nVice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Communications\n646-564-3680\nIR@retrophin.com\nSource:Retrophin, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2b7a0942-d134-4d53-98e0-1e555fb2f5dc", "http://www.retrophin.com/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=z9rM4n2Jp1Wi_ew0X1t_fxonWZI9OLNyD34xlxCz07MSTspiPJJyyUrvSEUa6Y9zTjB5Js706x5m0dPh6O3thw==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sMwq8-ird2NE4-0C2vhb9hwEduO4-i_FjYVyLPoTZVnRfQGkZVmDVEzEXu9S-Pb7cMuoRx8qF3mM0ckIJ-49bg=="], "published": "2018-04-18T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:22:03.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
