At the top of the pricing range, the lower volume of shares would be sold, raising about 3 billion rand ($249 million).\nThere is also a greenshoe option, or overallotment, of up to 114.1 million shares to underwriters.\nThe top-end of the range values Consol at as much as 9.7 billion rand, or about six times the company’s 2017 core earnings of 1.6 billion rand.\nThe listing, slated for May 4, is subject to Consol raising at least 2.5 billion rand.\nGoldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are working on the listing, along with South African banks RMB and Standard Bank, who will market the deal to domestic investors.\nConsol, which counts blue-chip companies such as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Diageo and Heineken among its customers is one of the biggest glass packagers in sub-Saharan Africa. It has plants in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, and is also building a factory in Ethiopia.
