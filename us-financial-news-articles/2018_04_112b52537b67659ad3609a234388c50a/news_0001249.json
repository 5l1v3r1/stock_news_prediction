Images circulating on social media showed Campos, his head dripping with blood, being hauled away to a hospital. \n“Presumably this was done with a brass knuckle,” Falcon said at a news conference.

Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nFalcon is hoping to beat Maduro in a May election that the rest of the opposition is boycotting because it says the electoral process is stacked against it, with two top opposition candidates barred from office. \nMany opposition members are suspicious of Falcon, once a member of the ruling socialists, and are planning to abstain from voting on May 20. \nBut the 56-year-old former soldier vowed to plow on. “None of this will stop us,” Falcon said.
