(\"CHFN\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CHFN) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by CenterState Bank Corporation (\"CSFL\") (NASDAQ: CSFL). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive 0.738 of a share of CSFL common stock and $2.30 in cash, representing consideration of $22.76 based on CSFL's April 24 stock price of $27.72.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CHFN's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $32.00 per share, or $9.24 above the offer price.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether CHFN's Board acted in the best interests of CHFN's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.
