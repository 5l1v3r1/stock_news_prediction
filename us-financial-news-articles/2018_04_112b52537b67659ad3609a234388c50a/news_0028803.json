It added that stocks at Tianjin Phase 2 drew last year, and that information from data analytics company Kayrros showed that CNPC’s Dushanzi reserve also drew to two-thirds of its capacity during 2017.\nThe Chinese government’s reporting put strategic reserves at 274 million barrels by mid-2017, 33 million barrels higher than the middle of 2016.\nReporting By Libby George, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:36:38.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
