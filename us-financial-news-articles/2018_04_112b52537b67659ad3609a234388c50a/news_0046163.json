Excluding the effect of a stronger euro, revenue rose 49%.\nSales in North America, mainly the U.S., led the way, rising 64%, Kering said. The results mark another quarter of robust growth for Gucci, which has become the world’s second-largest luxury brand by sales, surpassing Hermès and behind only Louis Vuitton. \nInvestors have been watching for signs of shoppers cooling on Gucci, but Tuesday’s results give no indication of that happening. The brand recorded one of its highest growth rates, adjusted for currency effects, of the last three years.\nRead More \nGucci Seeks to Escape Fashion’s Boom-Bust Why Gucci Owner Wants to Kick Off Its Pumas Behind the Scenes at Gucci’s New Hub Gucci performed well in the U.S. among tourists and locals, in retail, department stores and online, said Jean-Marc Duplaix, Kering’s chief financial officer.\n“All this without opening new stores,” Mr. Duplaix said.\nThe quarter saw Gucci pull off a coup with its Milan fashion show. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele doubled down on the eccentric designs that have catapulted the brand into the top ranks of luxury fashion. In February, models strode down the runway carrying baby dragons and replicas of their heads; they wore clothes with Medieval and Renaissance flourishes that were emblazoned with the logos of the New York Yankees and the San Francisco Giants. Tribe Dynamics, which tracks online buzz, said the show helped make Gucci the top-mentioned brand on social media in February.\nMr. Duplaix sought to tamp down expectations that Gucci can maintain such exceptionally strong growth rates, a refrain heard repeatedly from Kering executives before previous rounds of sparkling results. In the second half of last year, a recovery in Chinese luxury consumption gathered momentum , making high year-over-year growth rates more difficult to achieve, he said.\n“As the year progresses, we should see a normalization of growth,” Mr. Duplaix said.\nKering’s other big brands—Saint Laurent and Bottega Veneta—registered significantly lower growth rates, widening the gulf between Gucci and the conglomerate’s other labels. Saint Laurent revenue rose 12% to €408 million. Revenue at Bottega Veneta sank 6%, though it ticked up 0.7% excluding the strength of the euro.\nKering’s overall revenue rose 27% to €3.1 billion. Tuesday’s results mark the first time that the conglomerate reported results without German sportswear company Puma AG . In January, Kering moved to shed most of its controlling stake in the company, announcing a plan to distribute 70% of Puma’s shares to Kering shareholders.\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T00:04:32.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
