Both employee representatives on the board as well as investor representatives on the board cast dissenting votes, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\nIn the end, however, Christian Sewing was chosen as the bank’s new CEO, amid frustration over continuing losses at the German lender and a sagging share price.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment.\nReporting by Andreas Framke and Kathrin Jones Writing by Tom Sims Editing by Victoria Bryan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-21T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:22:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
