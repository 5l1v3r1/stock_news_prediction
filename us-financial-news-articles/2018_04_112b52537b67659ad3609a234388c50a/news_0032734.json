(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its first quarter 2018 operating results (unaudited) in accordance with IFRS.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nEUR million Q1 2017 (restated) Q4 2017 (restated) Q1 2018 New orders 204.2 203.2 206.5 Net sales 156.8 181.5 159.0 Gross profit margin % 43.0 % 39.6 % 37.8 % Operating result 19.4 26.0 11.8 Result from investments (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) 35.4 14.0 16.3 Amortization intangible assets (resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013) (5.8 ) (4.6 ) (3.8 ) Result from sale of ASMPT shares - 183.9 - Net earnings 40.4 215.9 15.0 Normalized net earnings (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013 and result from sale of ASMPT shares) 46.2 36.6 18.8 Prior quarter results were restated for the effects of IFRS 15. Please refer to Annex 2 for details.\nNew orders at €206 million were at the highest level ever and 2% above the Q4 2017 level and 1% above the level of Q1 2017. Net sales for the first quarter 2018 were €159 million, a decrease of 12% compared to the restated previous quarter. Gross profit margin was 37.8% in Q1 2018. The margin was beside the effects of new product introductions impacted by sales mix and preparation for anticipated higher activity levels. Operating result decreased to €12 million compared to the previous quarter. The decrease is mainly the result of the lower sales level. Normalized net earnings for the first quarter 2018 decreased by €18 million compared to the fourth quarter 2017.\nCOMMENT\nCommenting on the results, Chuck del Prado, President and Chief Executive Officer of ASM International said:\n\"In Q1 we realized sales of €159 million and an order intake of €206 million. Our sales were at the lower end of our guidance while order intake was at the higher end of our guidance. The gross margin in Q1 at 38% was impacted by an unfavorable product mix and costs related to our preparation for further growth. We estimate our gross margin in Q2 to show a substantial improvement bringing it back again in the range of low to mid 40's.\"\nOUTLOOK\nFor Q2, on a currency comparable level, we expect sales of €200-230 million, and we expect an order intake of €160-200 million. The broad ranges for Q2 reflect some uncertainty around the exact timing of individual tools.\nFor 2018, market watchers currently expect the wafer fab equipment market to increase with, on average, a high single digit percentage. We aim to outgrow the wafer fab equipment market in 2018.\nSHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nOn April 24, 2017, ASMI announced a partial sale of a stake of approximately 5% in ASMPT, whereby ASMI indicated to use the proceeds of approximately €245 million for a new share buyback program.
