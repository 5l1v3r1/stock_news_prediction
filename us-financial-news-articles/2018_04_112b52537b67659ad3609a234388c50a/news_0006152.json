Ethereum fell more than 9 percent to $375.31 while ripple fell more than 10 percent to 50 cents. \nTrade war fears China unveiled new tariffs on 106 U.S. products on Wednesday, a move that has shaken investors and further ignited fears of a trade war.\nCryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which are decentralized and not backed by governments, are extremely volatile assets.\nCharles Hayter, chief executive of CryptoCompare, said that investors were likely fleeing to safer investments as protectionism concerns took hold.\n\"In the grand scheme of things, cryptos lie on (the) extremely risky end of the spectrum and are for times of hot money,\" Hayter told CNBC in an email.\n\"The hint of a trade war puts a bit of fear into the mix and as we all now markets correlate in various periods depending on the exogenous factors.\"\nBitcoin suffered its worst ever start to the year this year, dropping 48 percent over the first quarter. The cryptocurrency hit an all-time high near $20,000 in December.\nWATCH: If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxes show chapters If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxes      11:31 AM ET Wed, 21 Feb 2018 | 02:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T17:42:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
