The current EU-mandated average is 130 g/km.\nPeugeot maker PSA Group’s chief executive Carlos Tavares, who chairs ACEA, has called for the EU penalties to be suspended until governments roll out adequate electric car charging networks, saying last month he planned to raise the proposal at a meeting of Brussels-based ACEA on March 7.\nJonnaert, whose group represents 15 global vehicle makers with plants in Europe, told Reuters on the sidelines of an automotive conference in Prague that the 2020 targets were challenging, but the car sector was committed to meeting them.\n“What we are questioning in this is there are no targets for countries,” he said. “We are asked to meet targets but the countries are not.”\nThe European Commission aims to curb greenhouse gases from transport as part of a drive to cut emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.\nIt has proposed a 30 percent reduction in the average CO2 emission of carmakers’ fleets by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. It also wants an interim goal of a 15 percent reduction by 2025 to help ensure automakers start investments early.\nACEA is seeking a reduction of 20 percent overall.\nJonnaert said EU governments needed to help the industry by creating incentives for consumers to use electric cars in addition to building up the network to power them.\nHe also underlined a warning from PSA’s Tavares that a Chinese buyer could to step in with its own electric vehicle technology if European companies were crippled by fines.\n“It is not just a phantom idea,” Jonnaert said, noting the auto industry employs 12.6 million workers in Europe.\nThere is rising concern about foreign influence over European manufacturers, jobs and technology, which have escalated since China’s Geely snapped up 10 percent of Germany’s Daimler in February.\nReporting by Jason Hovet and Michael Kahn; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:09:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
