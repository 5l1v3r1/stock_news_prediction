(CAI) (NYSE: CAI), one of the world’s leading transportation finance and logistics companies, today reported results for the first quarter of 2018.\nHighlights\nNet income attributable to CAI common stockholders for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.1 million, or $0.83 per fully diluted share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.27 per fully diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Lease-related revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $73.7 million, an increase of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Average utilization for CAI’s owned container fleet during the first quarter of 2018 was 99.2% compared to 95.7% for the first quarter of 2017, and 99.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, CAI invested, or committed to invest, $336 million in new container equipment, of which approximately 80% has committed leases. During the first quarter of 2018, CAI leased out 398 new railcars and have commitments to lease out an additional 340 new cars in the second quarter of 2018. The total of 738 railcars represents approximately 60% of the new railcars we had available for lease during the first quarter. Average railcar utilization during the first quarter of 2018, excluding new railcars not yet leased, was 88.2% compared to 92.7% for the first quarter of 2017, and 87.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, CAI issued 1.6 million shares of its 8.5% Series A fixed-to-floating rate cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of $38.7 million. CAI is the only container leasing company to successfully issue publicly traded preferred shares. During the first quarter of 2018, CAL Funding III Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CAI, issued $348.9 million of fixed rate asset-backed notes, with an average interest rate of 4.0%. After the issuance of the notes, CAI’s fixed rate debt represented approximately 60% of total debt outstanding.\nAdditional information on CAI's results, as well as the state of the industry, is available in a presentation posted today on the \"Investors\" section of CAI's website, www.capps.com .\nVictor Garcia, President and Chief Executive Officer of CAI, commented, “We are very pleased with the exceptional performance of our company during the first quarter of 2018 and the fundamentals of the business remain strong. We reported record quarterly revenue of $95.4 million and net income attributable to CAI common stockholders for the quarter of $17.1 million, or $0.83 per fully diluted share, a record first quarter result. Our results continue to be driven by the ongoing momentum in our container leasing business, which reported average utilization of 99% during the quarter. We have invested, or have committed to invest, $336 million in new container related equipment during the quarter, approximately 80% of which has committed leases, most of which will go into service in the second quarter. Our pace of lease outs and commitments for leases on new factory equipment is more than twice the level of the first quarter of last year. We expect that the utilization of our fleet will remain at a high level this year and that new investment will remain strong due to ongoing global economic growth. Lease rates have stabilized and remain at attractive return levels.\n“Our rail segment continues to experience improved activity in lease outs, and rental rates have improved from where they were two quarters ago. During the first quarter of 2018, we leased out 398 new railcars and have commitments to lease out a further 340 new cars in the second quarter of 2018. We continue to see increased lease activity for railcars across various equipment categories and lease rates are improving for many railcar types. Ongoing economic growth in the US and slowing rail velocity amongst Class 1 railroads has required customers to consider leasing additional equipment. We are more optimistic about the opportunities for our rail segment due to the improving utilization and trend in lease rates over the past few months.\n“Our logistics business is gaining momentum and a growing customer portfolio has led to record logistics revenue this quarter for our company. Demand for logistics services is strong, particularly for trucking where capacity remains very tight due to growing demand and implementation of electronic logging devices. The segment as a whole reported a loss for the quarter but we expect improving revenue and income trends as the year progresses. We will continue to invest in the long-term infrastructure of the business by expanding our personnel throughout the US.”\nMr. Garcia continued, “This quarter we successfully issued 1.6 million shares of perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of $38.7 million. We are pleased to have successfully issued the shares as the capital raised, along with existing senior debt, allows us to expand investment in our fleet, while lowering our overall cost of capital. It also provides our company with the flexibility to utilize some of our existing cash flow to potentially repurchase shares of our common stock if we believe the price of our shares is at a level that adds to long-term shareholder value.”\nMr. Garcia concluded, “We have made a strong start to 2018 with improving momentum in each of our business segments, particularly in the container segment. We expect the momentum for equipment demand to continue as the year progresses and that 2018 will be an earnings growth year for the company.”\nCAI International, Inc.

The total container fleet excludes new units not yet leased and off-hire units designated for sale. Utilization of railcars is computed by dividing the total number of railcars on lease by the total number of railcars in our fleet. The impact on utilization of including new units not yet leased in the total railcar fleet has been included in the table above. CEU is a ratio used to convert the actual number of containers in our fleet to a figure based on the relative purchase prices of our various equipment types to that of a standard 20 foot dry van container. For example, the CEU ratio for a standard 40 foot dry van container is 1.6, and a 40 foot high cube container is 1.7.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the financial results for the first quarter of 2018 will be held on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET.
