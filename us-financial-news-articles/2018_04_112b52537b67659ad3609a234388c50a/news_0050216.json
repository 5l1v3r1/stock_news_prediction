At least one witness described the driver as appearing to deliberately target victims on his roughly mile-long (1.6 km-long) rampage. The driver was in custody, police said. \nA Reuters witness said there were at least two bodies at the site of the incident. At least seven people were brought to nearby Sunnybrook Health Services Centreâ€™s trauma center, the hospital said on Twitter. \nIt was not immediately clear if the incident was a deliberate act by the driver or a traffic mishap in a mixed commercial and residential area.
