The bipartisan legislation has the support of President Donald Trump’s administration.\nCFIUS has gone from virtually unknown several years ago to front-page news this year as one of its probes resulted in President Donald Trump’s forbidding Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom Inc from buying rival Qualcomm Inc.\nTightening the CFIUS process is one of several efforts supported by the Trump administration, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, to establish a more protectionist stance in an effort to tamp down Chinese imports while raising the regulatory bar on what deals get approved.\nNegotiators in the administration, on Capitol Hill and working for the investment and high tech community are on their fourth version of a bill on CFIUS. The bill previously underwent at least one proposed revision that would seek to narrow its scope.\nThe initial draft of the bill could have expanded CFIUS oversight to anything sold by a “critical technology company,” a term meaning technology with military importance. Tech companies criticized that version on concerns that it would limit or slow their own exports. A revision trimmed the oversight language to “critical technology,” in hopes of preventing CFIUS from being flooded with applications related to older technology.
