Due to the complexity of these markets, which include multiple waste streams and regulatory compliance requirements, Quest believes that it can demonstrate the value proposition of its differentiated services offerings.\nAnnounced significant renewals and new wins in automotive vertical – Quest secured competitive wins and renewals to provide waste management services to several national automotive service providers. In addition, Quest plans to expand its reach into this market vertical through joint marketing opportunities with substantial channel partners.\nReduced operating expenses by aligning infrastructure to support targeted mix of business and gaining operational efficiencies – During fiscal 2017, operating expenses decreased by $1.1 million to $21.1 million compared with $22.2 million in 2016.\n\"We made tremendous progress in 2017 executing on our strategic plan. We transitioned our company so that we can continue to deliver exceptional services to our customers and show sustainable improvements in financial performance,” said S. Ray Hatch, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As anticipated, our fourth quarter financial performance marked the inflection point in the transition of our business, during which we exited transactional business that did not meet our minimum thresholds for returns and began replacing it with growth in existing and new vertical markets that benefit from our unique value propositions.”\nHatch continued, “Results for the fourth quarter were impacted by the delay of certain customer implementations that we had anticipated initiating . These implementations have subsequently moved into 2018. While the pace of closing and implementing certain new business is taking longer than we originally anticipated, particularly in new industry verticals, we are continuing to grow the size of our pipeline and are excited about how the positive shift in the revenue mix and positive impact from our procurement improvements will continue to translate into improved financial performance during 2018.”\nQuest currently anticipates sequential revenue growth will be at a measured pace relative to the fourth quarter of 2017 and accelerate during the second half of 2018. As experienced of 2017, the timing of the major changes in our business is taking somewhat longer than originally expected. Results for 2018 will depend on the pace at which we can fully implement our new programs and customers. Therefore, we have widened the range of financial expectations for 2018. Quest currently expects positive net income during 2018 with estimated GAAP earnings between $500,000 and $3 million, or GAAP earnings per share between $0.03 and $0.20, and estimated non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA between $4 million and $7 million, or non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA per share between $0.26 and $0.46. Per share estimates are based upon the issued and outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2017.\n2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast\nQuest will conduct a conference call on Monday, April 2, 2018, at 4:00 p.m. Central Time, to review the financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. Investors interested in participating on the live call can dial 1-800-281-7973 within the U.S. or 1-323-794-2093 from abroad.

From time-to-time, Quest considers and uses this supplemental measure of operating performance in order to provide an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. Quest believes it is useful to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense, (iii) stock-based compensation expense, (iv) income tax expense, and (v) certain other adjustments, and (2) non-GAAP measures that exclude such items. Quest presents this non-GAAP measure because it considers it an important supplemental measure of Quest's performance. Quest's definition of this adjusted financial measure may differ from similarly named measures used by others. Quest believes this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. This non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company's GAAP measures.
