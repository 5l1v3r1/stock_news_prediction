But subsequent projections have pointed to limited rain next week, which could keep crops struggling with drought. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar gained against a basket of currencies on Thursday on higher U.S. bond yields and expectations of more rate increases from the Federal Reserve, while sterling fell to a near two-week low on perceived dovish remarks from the head of the Bank of England. \n* Oil prices on Thursday hit highs not seen since 2014, built on the ongoing drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to push prices higher, though U.S. crude gave back gains in the afternoon to finish lower. \n* Wall Street's three major indexes closed lower on Thursday, with tobacco stocks leading a tumble in consumer staples while concerns about smartphone demand hurt the technology sector and rising bond yields and earnings helped financials rebound. \nDATA/EVENT AHEAD (GMT) \n0600 Germany Producer prices Mar 1400 Euro zone Consumer confidence flash Apr 1645 Washington G20 Finance Ministers hold news conference \nfollowing their talks on the sidelines of the spring meeting of the IMF and World Bank \nGrains prices at 0014 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 490.00 -0.75 -0.15% +3.10% 468.84 53 CBOT corn 381.50 -0.50 -0.13% -0.39% 383.48 39 CBOT soy 1048.25 -0.75 -0.07% +0.62% 1037.55 45 CBOT rice 13.03 -$0.05 -0.38% -1.10% $12.57 63 WTI crude 68.29 $0.00 +0.00% -0.26% $64.43 72 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.234 $0.000 -0.02% -0.25% USD/AUD 0.7715 -0.001 -0.17% -0.86% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
