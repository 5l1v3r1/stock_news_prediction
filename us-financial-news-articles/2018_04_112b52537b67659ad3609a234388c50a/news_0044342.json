Fidessa said on April 5 that it had received an approach from U.S. firm SS&C Technologies ( SSNC.O ), as well as from Ion. \nIon and SS&C have until 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Friday to make a firm offer or walk away from Fidessa. Shares in Fidessa were up 1 percent at 40.40 pounds on Friday morning. \nIt comes amid a wave of deal activity in Britain, as companies take advantage of cheap debt to pursue mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \nThe value of M&A involving British firms jumped by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the highest level since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. \n($1 = 0.7111 pounds) Reporting by Ben Martin in London and Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Edmund Blair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T11:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:14:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
