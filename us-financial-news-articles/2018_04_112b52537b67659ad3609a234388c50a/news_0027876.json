A rise above Friday’s high of 107.780 yen would take the dollar to its highest since Feb. 22.\n“The reaction in currencies have been limited as President Trump had provided advance notice about a possible strike on Syria, giving speculators ample time to brace for the actual event,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n“Many speculators are showing less of a response to yen-supportive factors lately, after the Bank of Japan made clear it was not going to normalise policy soon. This goes for domestic factors as well, like falling support ratings for (Japan Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe.”\nSupport for Prime Minister Abe, plagued by accusations of cronyism and cover-ups, fell to 26.7 percent in a survey by private broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday, the lowest since he took office in December 2012.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade higher at 89.807.\nThe euro was nearly flat at $1.2332 after ending Friday little changed.\nThe pound traded at $1.4244 after rising to a near three-month high of $1.4296 on Friday.\nExpectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England have been a major driver of sterling’s gains in recent days.\nThe Australian dollar was flat at $0.7770 and the New Zealand dollar dipped 0.05 percent to $0.7348.\nThe Hong Kong dollar traded at 7.8499 per dollar, continuing to hover near 7.85, the weak end of its trading band.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped in last week to prop up the Hong Kong dollar, as it is obliged to intervene and keep intact a trading band of 7.75 to 7.85.
