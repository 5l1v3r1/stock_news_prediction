In general the line is used by both sides.” \nPeskov said the Kremlin was closely following Syria-related announcements from Washington and reiterated a Kremlin call for restraint. \n“We continue to consider it extremely important to avoid any steps that could lead to more tension in Syria. We believe that would have an extremely destructive impact on the whole Syria settlement process,” said Peskov.
