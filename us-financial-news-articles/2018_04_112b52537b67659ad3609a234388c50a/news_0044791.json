The Red Sox came into Friday on a seven-game winning streak.\nDylan Bundy (1-2) again gave the Orioles a strong start. The right-hander allowed one run on five hits in six innings, striking out nine while walking just two.\nBundy now has a 1.42 ERA and has pitched well in all five of his starts, though Baltimore has lost in three of those games.\nIn this game, though, the right-hander received just enough while going against Cleveland’s Trevor Bauer (1-2). Bundy helped the Indians to a 1-0 lead in the top of the first when he hit Edwin Encarnacion with the bases loaded, but did not give up anything else in his final five innings.\nMachado tied the game with a one-out solo homer to center in the bottom of the fourth. He hit two homers in the series finale loss to Detroit on Thursday and now has six this season.\nThe Orioles then took a 3-1 lead when Mancini extended his hitting streak to eight games on a two-run double to center off Bauer in the fifth. Mancini then left the game in the eighth when appearing to hurt his right knee trying to dive for a foul ball. He was replaced by Craig Gentry in left field.\nBauer allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings, throwing 116 pitches in the losing effort.\nFor Baltimore, Richard Bleier relieved Bundy and continued his strong early-season work with two shutout innings.\nDarren O’Day closed it in the ninth for his first save this season.\nThe Orioles received some good news pregame when closer Zach Britton, out after tearing his Achilles tendon and having offseason surgery, threw off a half-mound for the first time Friday and did fine.\nBaltimore is hoping he’ll be back by early June at the latest as he becomes a free agent after 2018.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-21T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:51:47.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
