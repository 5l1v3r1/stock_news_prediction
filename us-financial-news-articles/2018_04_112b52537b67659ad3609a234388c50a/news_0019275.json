Airtel Kenya also said it would not comment.\nIndustry executives said that if a deal to acquire all of Airtel Kenya’s assets goes through, it would help both firms make significant savings and acquire the scale to compete effectively with Safaricom.\n“This is a cold, calculated business strategy,” said a telecoms executive who did not wish to be named.\nBharti Airtel has been examining a flotation of a minority stake in its African operations but has said it remains committed to the continent.\nSources said the combined entity could however create concerns because it will enjoy a large slice of prime spectrum.\nA merger of Telkom and Airtel will result in a new company with 77 megahertz of spectrum, compared with just 47 for Safaricom.\nThey said that will create a new challenge for the sector regulator, which had commissioned consultants Analysys Mason to review competition in the industry.\nThat study caused controversy after a leaked draft showed it recommended the breaking up of Safaricom to boost competition, forcing the government to pledge no operator would be broken up.\nExecutives said a joint venture between Telkom and Airtel could render the report useless.\n“The competition study they had done becomes toilet paper,” said the industry official who did not wish to be named.\nEditing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:11:57.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
