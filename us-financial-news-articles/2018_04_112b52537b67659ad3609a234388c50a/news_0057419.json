The missile appeared in a major military parade in Beijing in 2015.\nIn a separate announcement, China’s air force said that its aircraft had again flown around Taiwan, the latest in a series of exercises Taiwan has described as military intimidation.\nTaiwan is one of China’s most sensitive issues and a potential military flashpoint.\nOver the past year or so, China has ramped up military drills around democratic Taiwan, including flying bombers and other military aircraft around the island.\nThe Chinese air force said in a statement it scrambled fighter jets, early warning aircraft, reconnaissance planes and H-6K bombers from multiple airports for “combat military drills” on Thursday.\nThe air force said its H-6K bombers had conducted numerous drills circling Taiwan since April 18 “to improve its ability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\nTaiwan’s Defense Ministry said it sent planes and ships to monitor the activity and ensure its maritime and airspace security, and there were no “abnormal situations”.\nChina’s hostility towards the island has grown since the 2016 election of President Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party.\nChina has been issuing increasingly strident calls for Taiwan to toe the line, even as Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo and keep the peace.\nOn Wednesday, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, said drills near Taiwan were designed to send a clear message to the island, and China would take further steps if Taiwan independence forces persisted in doing as they pleased.\nDefense Ministry spokesman Wu repeated that statement, and added his own warning.\n“Engaging in Taiwan independence is a dead end,” he said.\nReporting by Philip Wen and Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Jess Macy Yu in Taipei; Editing by Nick Macfie, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T10:34:06.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
