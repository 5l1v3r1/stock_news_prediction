More than 300,000 people have pledged to attend one of the “Nobody Is Above the Law” protests, according the MoveOn’s website. \n“If Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller, it will create a constitutional crisis,” MoveOn, which recently supported the March For Our Lives gun control protest in Washington, said on its website. \nThe White House on Tuesday said Trump had the authority to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who has widened his probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. \nRussia has denied it interfered in the election, and Trump and the White House have said frequently that there was no collusion. \nOther organizations in the movement include Common Cause, Public Citizen, Indivisible and Stand Up America, MoveOn said. \nA bipartisan group of senators will introduce legislation on Wednesday to protect the office of the special counsel. \nTrump has grown angry over the Mueller probe, calling it “a disgrace” and an attack on the country. He threatened to fire Mueller after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday, based partly on a referral by the special counsel.
