(NASDAQ:DSKE) (NASDAQ:DSKEW), the largest owner of flatbed and specialized transportation and logistics solutions in North America, has entered into a merger agreement with Aveda Transportation and Energy Services (TSX-V:AVE), one of the largest oil rig moving companies in North America.\nUnder terms of the agreement, Daseke will pay C$0.90 (US$0.71) per share plus the assumption of Aveda debt. In addition, up to C$0.45 (US$0.36) per share in cash contingent consideration to be paid based on EBITDA earnings. All figures have been translated from Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of 0.79.\nAs one of the largest in North America, Aveda provides specialized transportation services and equipment required for the exploration, development and production of petroleum resources in the U.S. and Canada. Aveda owns one of the largest and youngest fleets in the industry with approximately 430 tractors, 660 trailers and 200 light-duty trucks.\nAveda shareholders will have the choice of accepting cash, the equivalent in Daseke stock, or a combination. The agreement was unanimously approved by both companies’ boards of directors, which includes Aveda’s largest shareholders, Werklund Capital Corporation and Werklund Ventures Ltd.—holders of 25% of Aveda’s stock. The transaction is expected to close in June, subject to Aveda shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions.\n“Aveda has built a team with a passion for excellence and a clear vision of their goals thanks to a leadership team that has orchestrated a significant turnaround in the company,” said Don Daseke, chairman and CEO of Daseke. “Hired in April 2016, President and CEO Ronnie Witherspoon built an executive team with considerable experience and took a company with C$8.9 million (US$7.0 million) in revenue upon the quarter of his arrival to over C$53.1 million (US$41.9 million) in the quarter ended December 2017. Highlighting this momentum, Aveda’s fourth quarter 2017 revenue was record-setting and their adjusted EBITDA grew to nearly C$3.6 million (US$2.8 million).”\nBased on Aveda’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 prepared in C$ and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and filed on Canadian System for Electronic Document analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) on April 16, 2018. See Aveda’s MD&A and company filings for more information.\nIn addition to the scope of its fleet, Aveda has one of the lowest employee turnover rates, as competitive wages, ongoing personal development and room for advancement attracts top talent that grow with the company over the long-term.\nAveda’s revenue base is diversified across all seven of the major U.S. oil basins, which account for nearly 90 percent of its revenue. Aveda owns approximately 1,300 pieces of equipment, and a November 2017 outside equipment appraisal valued Aveda’s machinery and equipment at approximately C$114 million (US$90 million).\nIn 2017, Aveda generated C$200 million (US$158.0 million) in revenue, up 172 percent from C$73 million (US$57.7 million) in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 improved significantly to $15.9 million (US$12.6 million) versus a negative EBITDA of $6.9 million in 2016 (negative US$5.5 million).\nBased on Aveda’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 prepared in C$ and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and filed on Canadian System for Electronic Document analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR) on April 16, 2018. See Aveda’s MD&A and company filings for more information.\nDaseke continued: “Aveda is a great company with quality people, a specialized value-additive business and a blue-chip customer base. This transaction is a strong fit for our company and shareholders as Aveda has demonstrated the ability to outpace their market’s growth rate, and we expect joining Daseke will enable them to fuel their continued outperformance. This merger aligns with our stated goal of entering specialized niches where we use our scale to make our operating companies even stronger.\nAveda President and CEO Ronnie Witherspoon stated: “Over the past two years, we have taken significant measures to improve our revenue, expand gross margins and generate meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth. The ‘Aveda Way’ is our fundamental company philosophy to the rig moving experience, and it is grounded in the best people, working safely, and using the best equipment to drive industry-leading results. With 90 percent of our operations in the U.S., we believe joining Daseke’s expansive U.S. operations will provide us with significant benefits due to their scale and resources. This will serve to strengthen our philosophy, and our entire team is excited to join forces as one.”\nConference Call\nDaseke will hold a conference call today, April 16, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss the combination.\nDate: Monday, April 16, 2018\nTime: 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (10:00 a.m. Central time)\nToll-free dial-in number: (855) 242-9918\nInternational dial-in number: (414) 238-9803\nConference ID: 1399220\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
