FILE PHOTO: A Bosch logo is pictured in Renningen near Stuttgart, Germany July 29, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nGerman weekly der Spiegel reported on Friday that the prosecutors suspect Bosch supplied those carmakers with illicit emissions control software. \nThe prosecutor’s office confirmed it had launched preliminary inquiries in connection with Bosch and the four carmakers, but did not provide details. \nIt has not launched any formal investigations on the matter, a spokesman for the office said. \nThe prosecutor’s office launched an investigation over Bosch’s emissions dealings with Volkswagen (VW) ( VOWG_p.DE ) in 2015, when VW’s diesel test-cheating scandal in the United States broke. \nIt later started separate probes in relation to its suspected involvement in alleged emissions irregularities at Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ), VW’s premium unit Audi and Chyrsler. \nBosch said it could not comment on the details of the investigations. \n“We are taking accusations that diesel software was manipulated very seriously,” the company said in a statement, adding it was cooperating fully with the relevant authorities.
