Rossello has vowed to fight the board’s proposed 10 percent pension cuts, as well as some elements of labor reform.\nThe governor has also insisted he can achieve the board’s requested level of spending cuts without layoffs in the public sector workforce, which the board has been skeptical about.\nThe board has set an April 20 deadline to approve a turnaround plan for the island.\nWhile it has extended several past deadlines to continue talks with the governor, a source familiar with the board’s thinking told Reuters on Thursday the board would certify a plan one way or the other on April 20, even if it meant altering the plan to include some of the initiatives resisted by Rossello.\nReporting by Nick Brown; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T21:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:57:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
