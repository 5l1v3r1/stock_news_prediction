REUTERSLucas Jackson Last month, Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued Trump and Cohen to invalidate a non-disclosure agreement related to a $130,000 payment she received from Cohen before the 2016 election to keep quiet about her alleged one-night stand with Trump a decade earlier.\nThe probe of Cohen’s business dealings, and the FBI’s search of his office that uncovered information related to the $130,000 payment, started with a referral from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.\nRussia denies meddling in the election and Trump has denied any collusion.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen leaves federal court in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., April 16, 2018.

At a hearing last week, U.S. District Judge James Otero said he needed more time to review the request for a stay.\nTrump has denied having an affair with Daniels or any knowledge of the $130,000 payment.\nReporting by Amanda Becker and Eric Beech in Washington; Editing by Dan Grebler and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T02:09:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
