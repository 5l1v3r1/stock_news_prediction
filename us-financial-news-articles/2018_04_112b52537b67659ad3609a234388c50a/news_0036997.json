The “ end of an era ” is an overused cliché, but it’s what I kept hearing and reading this weekend in reaction to Martin Sorrell’s resignation as chief executive of WPP . While the current focus is on Mr. Sorrell’s legacy on the ad business and the stunning turn of events that led to his departure, questions linger about a successor and what the future of WPP—and even the wider ad-agency company holding model—will look like.\nExit Music The WSJ previously reported the WPP board appointed an independent counsel to look into an “allegation of personal misconduct” by Mr. Sorrell and whether he had misused company assets. Mr. Sorrell denied any financial impropriety at the time. WPP says the details of the investigation will remain confidential and that it had “no connection or impact on our operations or clients.” Few would have predicted the oracle of the ad industry and the longest-serving CEO on the FTSE 100 would have stepped aside in such an abrupt fashion. In an email to staff Saturday, Mr. Sorrell nodded to a famous Quote: from former Liverpool Football Club manager Bill Shankly, saying “WPP is not just a matter of life and death, it was, is and will be more important than that.”\n—What Now—\nNot a man with a reputation for sitting still, it will be difficult to imagine what Mr. Sorrell will do on his first day of retirement. (Interestingly, WSJ reports Mr. Sorrell’s contract with the company didn’t have a noncompete clause .) As for WPP, life will now be very different without its talisman who had grown the company from a small manufacturer of wire baskets into the biggest ad agency firm in the world. No word on a replacement CEO just yet, but the company has elevated Wunderman CEO Mark Read and WPP’s corporate development director and chief operating officer for Europe, Andrew Scott, to joint chief-operating officer roles. They must stabilize a business in shock at the departure of a leader whose position seemed set in stone. They’re also tasked with turning around a recent run of poor performance — WPP’s share price dropped more than 30% over the past year. And they must weather disruption ranging from cost-cutting clients concerned with ad-agency transparency, to growing demand for data and digital services, and increasing competition from consulting firms and other new entrants vying for marketers’ budgets.\n3 Must-Reads on Martin Sorrell’s Exit:\nWSJ’s Nick Kostov and Suzanne Vranica report on how Mr. Sorrell’s resignation unfolded .\nA former Campaign journalist looks back at “ how an outsider shaped the global ad industry .”\nCampaign also offers a deep dive on WPP’s new joint chief operating officers and the task that lays ahead of them.\nStarbucks Siren The last thing on your mind when dropping into Starbucks for a meeting is leaving the place in handcuffs. On Thursday, two black men were arrested in a downtown Philadelphia store— an incident than quickly went viral on social media , where people accused the company and police of racial discrimination. The city’s police commissioner said employees called the authorities after staff declined to let the men use the restroom because they hadn’t bought anything, and allegedly refused to leave. Starbucks initially issued a statement apologizing to the two individuals and said it was reviewing its policies. CEO Kevin Johnson later issued a far stronger statement saying the incident had led to a “ reprehensible outcome ” and added that he personally would meet with partners, customers, law-enforcement and community leaders. He also plans to offer the two arrested men a face-to-face apology. Jeff Hunt, partner at consulting firm PulsePoint Group, tells me, “Starbucks’ response shows that corporate entities are capable of sensitivity and compassion, something we need more of in the world, and perhaps Starbucks needs more of in its training and store policies.”\nBetter the Devil You Know Netflix is arguably the biggest disrupter to the cable and TV businesses of recent times. The streaming titan is paying out gobs of money for talent and content, persuading consumers to cut the cord and forcing big media companies to rethink their decades-long strategies. So Netflix and Comcast might, at first glance, appear to be strange bedfellows. On Friday, the pair announced Comcast will begin bundling Netflix with its cable, TV, phone and internet plans —Netflix’s first billing integration with a U.S. cable operator. From a marketing perspective, Comcast wants Netflix bingers to pony up for fast broadband packages. And as the streaming market matures in the U.S., Netflix hopes the partnership will make it easier for people who haven’t signed up yet to get its service into their living rooms.\nBest of the rest Tronc’s largest shareholder, Michael Ferro, agreed to sell his stake to a relative of the McCormick family that built the company’s flagship newspaper, the Chicago Tribune, into a media powerhouse in the early 20th century.
