Together they have invested around $1 billion in Korek.\nThe claim by Iraq Telecom, filed in the Dubai International Financial Centre Courts and seen by Reuters, alleges that a director of Korek, Raymond Samir Zina Rahmeh, “has been engaged in self-dealing on a massive scale and has a number of undisclosed interests that have resulted in exorbitant loss and damage to the company and, through its shareholding in the company, the claimant.”\nKorek International Management, the company through which Barzani and other local shareholders hold a stake in Korek’s holding company, said in an email that the proceedings were unfounded and that Rahmeh rejected all the claims against him.\nIraq Telecom last month filed another claim against Rahmeh and two other directors, alleging mismanagement and misappropriation of millions of dollars. That claim was also rejected by Korek International Management.
