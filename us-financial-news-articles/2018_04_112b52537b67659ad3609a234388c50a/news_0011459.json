Caixa Economica’s pension fund Funcef declined to comment.\nThe special fund, called FIP was created in 2010 to invest in a vehicle called CBTD, which in turn was created to acquire Brazilian consumer electronics maker IGB Eletronica, formerly Gradiente Eletronica SA, and now under bankruptcy protection.\nThe fund’s purpose was to pay off IGB Eletronica’s liabilities.\nAccording to federal prosecutors, the Petrobras pension fund Petros and Funcef made a prior deal with CBTD to invest in it without performing required due diligence on the investment of about 17 million reais each.\nAmong those named in the lawsuit are former Funcef President Guilherme Lacerda and Petros CEO Wagner Pinheiro.
