It has given me the opportunity to learn and improve as a coach as well as to contribute to a very talented bunch of players. It will always hold a special place in my heart.”\nReporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T11:22:07.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
