I will try to continue and see where it takes me.”\nSLOW START World number one Nadal, who also had a bye to the second round, packed out the main court at the Real Club de Tenis in Barcelona which is named after him.\nPerhaps still feeling the effects of his triumph in Monte Carlo on Sunday, Nadal made a slow start against Carballes-Baena and was broken in the opening game to fall 2-0 behind.\nThe Mallorcan responded by breaking twice to take a 4-2 lead and went on to claim the first set. Nadal broke in the opening game of the second set but lost his serve in the sixth.\nHe went in front again and had match point at 5-3 but could not take advantage, although he comfortably closed the match out with his next service game.\n“It was a difficult game and I committed a couple of errors at the start. The first game here after Monte Carlo is always hard but I soon found my rhythm,” Nadal told reporters.\nThe victory saw the Spaniard surpass Romanian Ilie Nastase’s record of winning 36 consecutive sets on clay in 1973.\nNadal will now meet another Spaniard, Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, who progressed after 14th seed Kei Nishikori retired from his first match after experiencing pain in his right wrist.\nThe 28-year-old Japanese, who lost to Nadal in the Monte Carlo Masters final on Sunday, withdrew after losing the first set 6-3.\n“My expectations grew in Monte Carlo, despite losing to Nadal,” Nishikori told reporters. “However, I started feeling discomfort again during the first set and I did not want to take any risks.”\nHe missed last year’s U.S. Open and the Australian Open at the start of 2018 after injuring the same wrist in August.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge and Ken Ferris\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T18:38:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
