An officer or employee of an organization which is a target is not automatically considered a target even if such officer's or employee's conduct contributed to the commission of the crime by the target organization. The same lack of automatic target status holds true for organizations which employ, or employed, an officer or employee who is a target.\nA \"subject\" of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation.\nTrump has said publicly that he would talk to Mueller for the probe. According to various media reports, however, the potential for Mueller's team interviewing the president created friction within Trump's legal team. Last month, lead counsel John Dowd resigned from the team. Reportedly, he was opposed the idea of Trump talking to Mueller's team.\nMueller took over the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and potential links between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin in May 2017. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller, a former FBI director, as special counsel after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. In an interview with NBC News, Trump said Russia was one of the things on his mind when he decided to fire Comey.\nWhite House lawyer Ty Cobb declined to comment to CNBC. A representative for the special counsel's office also declined to comment.\nFor more on this story, see the full report in The Washington Post.", "external_links": ["https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-11000-grand-jury#9-11.151", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mueller-told-trumps-attorneys-the-president-remains-under-investigation-but-is-not-currently-a-criminal-target/2018/04/03/d7832cf0-36c1-11e8-acd5-35eac230e514_story.html?utm_term=.e62155ee6660"], "published": "2018-04-04T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T03:43:58.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
