(OTCQB: GIGL) (the “Company”), owner and operator of family-friendly restaurants that bring together high-end, organic food with active, cutting-edge play and entertainment for children, is pleased to announce its founder, Joey Parsi, has participated in the Company’s rights offering.\n“We’re thankful for the strong interest from investors in our rights offering. Nearly 200 shareholders have subscribed so far, and I’m pleased to join them,” stated Joey Parsi, founder of Giggles N’ Hugs. “This is a ground-floor opportunity potentially on par with what early investors experienced in major restaurant brands such as Shake Shack, Cheesecake Factory, and BJs, who’ve reaped significant gains as these companies entered their explosive growth phase. With your help, we’re positioning Giggles N’ Hugs for an exciting future.”\nCoinciding with the closing of the rights offering, Philip Gay, former CFO of California Pizza Kitchen and former CFO and CEO of Wolfgang Puck Food Company, is expected to assume the position of CEO of Giggles N’ Hugs and will join its Board of Directors. Mr. Gay most recently served as the Company’s Chief Business Development Officer and brings nearly three decades of industry-related senior executive experience to Giggles N' Hugs.\nThe subscription period for the Company’s rights offering is scheduled to expire on Monday, April 16, 2018 at 5:00 PM ET. Shareholders of record (those that owned Giggles N’ Hugs common stock as of the close of trading on February 27, 2018) should contact their broker or financial advisor regarding the processing of their subscriptions prior to expiration of the rights offering.\nShareholders of record received two non-transferable subscription rights for every one share of common stock owned on the Record Date and may participate in the rights offering. Each subscription right entitles the holder to purchase one unit for $0.03 per basic subscription right and additional units via the over-subscription privilege. Each unit consists of one share of GIGL common stock and 0.70 of a five-year warrant from the time of issuance. Each whole warrant will be exercisable for one share of GIGL common stock for $0.06 per Warrant. Holders who fully exercise their basic subscription right will be entitled to purchase additional units via the over-subscription privilege (should any of the offering remain unsubscribed at the expiration of the Subscription Period).\nThe rights offering is being offered pursuant to the Company’s effective registration statement on Form S-1 as amended (Reg. No. 333-220302) on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The offering can be made only by a final prospectus. Investors should consider investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.
