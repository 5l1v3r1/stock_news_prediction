The company has approximately 2,800 employees in technology roles today.\nMore from Recode:\nCoinbase has hired a CFO, Alesia Haas\nFacebook is taking its first steps to comply with Europe's strict data privacy rules\nTwo things people get wrong about Snapchat\nThe hires will span roles such as software engineering, user experience design, network engineering and product management, and be located predominately in the company's Atlanta, Austin and Dallas technology offices, the company said.\nThey mark the onset of an $11.1 billion strategic plan, first announced in December, designed to improve Home Depot's online shopping experience, expand its warehouse footprint to speed up deliveries, and make improvements to its stores to help customers find items quicker and check out faster. Recode reported in December that Home Depot had weighed an acquisition bid for the $9 billion logistics company XPO to beef up its shipping and delivery capabilities.\nMatt Carey, Home Depot's chief information officer, acknowledged in an interview that the hiring numbers might not compare to those of the leader in U.S. online retail, Amazon. But they mark an increase of more than a third for Home Depot's technology staff, and Carey said he's confident the company's current plan is a differentiated one.\n\"I don't run their roadmap; I run my roadmap,\" he said of Amazon in an interview with Recode. \"The roadmap we have is one our customers are encouraging us to go execute on. I'm not limited by anything other than time right now.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.recode.net/2018/4/17/17249024/coinbase-cfo-alesia-haas-hired-fintech-cryptocurrency", "https://www.recode.net/2018/4/18/17248400/snapchat-evan-spiegel-mark-suster-upfront-ventures-instagram-whatsapp-kara-swisher-podcast", "https://www.recode.net/2018/4/18/17249406/facebook-eu-gdpr-europe-data-privacy-rules"], "published": "2018-04-18T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:20:08.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
