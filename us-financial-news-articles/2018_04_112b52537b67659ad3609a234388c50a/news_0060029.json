Yet even informal unemployment suffered at the start of 2018 as contracts for temporary holiday-season workers expired.\nFormal employment has yet to show signs of heating up, an indication that Brazil’s slow and uneven economic recovery may take a while before trickling down to the labor market.\nSteady unemployment should keep a lid on price pressures as wages remain stagnated when adjusted for inflation, hurdling the central bank’s efforts to lift it back to its target range.\nThis should keep the central bank on track to cut interest rates by an additional 25 basis points to an all-time low of 6.50 percent at its meeting next month.\nReporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Bill Trott\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:32:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
