PETERSBURG, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- iQor, a global managed services provider embedded in the flow between product, people and services, announced today it is relocating its Houston contact center to a newly renovated, expanded facility located just five blocks away from its current downtown location.\niQor has had a strong presence in Houston for nearly 20 years. The Houston facility is home to 600 contact center agents who focus on customer care for major telecom and utility organizations. iQor’s vice president of operations for the site, CJ Johnson, says the goal has been to find an opportune location in Houston that could accommodate future growth, while ensuring the relocation would have a minimal impact on the company’s clients and employees.\n“iQor’s strength in the industry comes from its strong and talented workforce,” says Johnson. “The new facility allows us to build out a space that strengthens our capabilities in delivering high-quality support services, while also providing an improved and adaptable workspace for our employees.”\nThe renovated space will be outfitted with new furniture, equipment, and a modern and more efficient contact center floor plan. The new facility will have 11,000 more square feet than the previous location, which can be used for further expansion. The new site address is 2100 Travis Street, Houston, Texas. The move is scheduled to be complete by mid-May 2018.\n“We are excited to get the team settled in,” adds Johnson. “We look forward to the site’s continued growth and providing new job opportunities for the local community.”\niQor’s Houston site is currently hiring.
