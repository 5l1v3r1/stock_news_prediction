Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella talked with McKinsey & Co.’s Simon London about surfing disruption by reframing the business. Companies need to broaden the definition of the market they serve and can’t just define themselves by the technology they are using, said Mr. Nadella, who recently led a major reorganization at the company, downgrading Windows.

New research reveals that drinking may stimulate creative problem solving. Harvard Business Review’s Alison Beard talks with Prof. Andrew Jarosz of Mississippi State University, who, in the duty of research, fed vodka-crans’ to a test group of men, ages 21 to 30. “The conclusion: drunk people are better at creative problem solving.” Says Prof. Jarosz: “We think that creative problem solving is one area in which a key effect of drunkenness—loss of focus—is a good thing.”\nShare this: MICROSOFT SATYA NADELLA Previous Building a Framework for the Safe Management of Digital Identities and Data Next Machine Learning at Scale Remains Elusive for Many Firms", "external_links": ["https://hbr.org/2018/05/drunk-people-are-better-at-creative-problem-solving", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-24/intermittent-fasting-is-getting-silicon-valley-startup-treatment", "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/high-tech/our-insights/microsofts-next-act", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7157/G"], "published": "2018-04-27T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T04:21:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
