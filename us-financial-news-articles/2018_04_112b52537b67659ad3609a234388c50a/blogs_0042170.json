He shares the mark with Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan. \nThe score was tied at 1 going into the seventh inning, when Marwin Gonzalez’s two-run single sparked a six-run rally. \nThe Astros opened the scoring in the second. With two outs, Gonzalez lined the first pitch he saw from Mike Leake (2-1) into left field, and Brian McCann followed with a run-scoring double to left. \nThe Mariners tied it in the third as Dee Gordon led off with a bunt single and advanced on Cole’s throwing error in a bid to get him at first. Gordon reached third on a groundout by Jean Segura and scored when Robinson Cano slapped a single to center past a drawn-in infield. \nSeattle nearly took the lead in the fifth, but left fielder Derek Fisher leaped at the wall to take a home run away from Segura to end the inning. \nThe score remained tied until the top of the seventh. \nJosh Reddick led off with a walk and advanced to third on Yuli Gurriel’s ground-rule double down the left field line. Gonzalez then lined a two-run single to center. \nAfter a visit to the mound by Mariners pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre Jr., McCann doubled to right to end Leake’s night. \nEvan Gattis hit a shallow fly down the right field line off reliever Nick Vincent, with the Mariners’ Mitch Haniger dropping the ball for an error. That allowed Gonzalez to score to make it 4-1. \nAfter Fisher struck out, George Springer doubled to right-center field, scoring two more runs. Springer reached third on an infield single by Jose Altuve and scored on a single to left by Carlos Correa, extending the lead to 7-1 and bringing on reliever James Pazos. The left-hander struck out Reddick and got Gurriel to ground into a forceout to end the inning. \nLeake wound up charged with five runs on six hits in six-plus innings. \nAfter losing the opener, the Astros have won the past two nights in the four-game series that concludes Thursday afternoon. \n—Field Level Media", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T16:32:18.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
