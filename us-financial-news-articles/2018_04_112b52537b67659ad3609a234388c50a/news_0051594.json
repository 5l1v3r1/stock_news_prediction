REUTERS/Jorge Silva South Korean President Moon Jae-in will welcome Kim Jong Un as he walks across the military demarcation line between the neighbors, still technically at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n“It is an important moment of our history and a very good chance to feel the history,” said Park Sung-il, vice principal at Baekun Elementary School in the southern city of Gwangju, which is letting students watch events unfold on television.\n“Our kids can get live education about unification by watching South and North Korean leaders shake hands in real time.”\nIt is only the third time the leaders of the countries have met, and previous summits in Pyongyang, the North’s capital, were not broadcast live.\n“There is the sense of excitement in Seoul that almost everybody is preparing for celebration on Friday,” said Victor Cha, a U.S. expert on Korea who was visiting Seoul this week.\nIf the summit goes well, “perhaps people in Washington may be more optimistic” that Kim’s meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, expected in May or June, will go well, he added.\nThe leaders of the two sides will meet at the South Korean border village of Panmunjom, the only place along the heavily fortified border where soldiers face off directly against each other.\nIn Seoul, a gigantic TV screen will broadcast footage outside city hall. The plaza has been festooned in flowers arranged in the shape of the Korean peninsula to “create a conducive environment,” a city official said.\nIn Gwangju, a theater is offering free admission for people to watch the broadcast on its movie screen.\n“Think about South Korean honor guards escorting the leader of our enemy state,” said Lee Shin, the head of a reunification research group in the city. “This is a very significant moment of our history.”\nReporting by Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park; Editing by Malcolm Foster and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:15:38.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
