We saw some demand in the latter part of the day,” a currency dealer said. \nEarlier this month, the country’s central bank governor said if the inflation rate could be maintained between 4 percent and 5 percent, the depreciation in the rupee would be around 2 percent or 3 percent. \nDealers said they expected no impact from the $2.5 billion inflow anticipated later this week in two tranches of sovereign bonds, the country’s largest offering in history. \nThe central bank has bought around $400 million from the market in the first three months of this year to help build reserves and repay some debt. \nThe rupee has weakened 1.73 percent so far this year. It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government. \nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 2.4 billion rupees ($15.36 million) so far this year through April 11, the central bank data showed. $1 = 156.3000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T16:55:51.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
