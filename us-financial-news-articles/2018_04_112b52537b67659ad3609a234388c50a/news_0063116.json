When you attack, everyone attacks together and you must maintain the formation.\n“You have to be compact defensively and defend together, but the team I saw today was not like that.\n“We attacked and lost the ball and we were scattered everywhere, leaving a lot of space.\n“This is not our way of playing. We need to learn from this kind of game.”\nSIPG remain on 19 points from the first eight games of the season but have had their lead trimmed to just one point after Shandong Luneng claimed a third win in a row with a 2-1 victory over Henan Jianye.
