After it is decided, a blue wax Palme is created and buried in plaster. It is heated in a furnace overnight to melt the wax away and leave a hollow plaster mould.\nThe 2018 edition is made from 118 grams (4.16 oz) of 18-carat yellow gold. The molten metal is poured into the mould, which is then dipped in cold water to break the plaster and leave behind a golden Palme.\nExtensive sanding, cleaning and polishing take place before the Palme is deemed fit to sit on the crystal base created by stonemasons.\n“We really wanted this Palme, apart from being a simple trophy, to represent the savoir-faire of different craftsmen,” Marc Couttet, director of Chopard, told Reuters.\nTwo trophies are made, in case there are two top prizewinners at the May 8-19 festival. Five smaller ones have also been commissioned this year for other categories.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Reporting by Denis Balibouse and Cecile Mantovani; Editing by Patrick Johnston and Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:38:28.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
