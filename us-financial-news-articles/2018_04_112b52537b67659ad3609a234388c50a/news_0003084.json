Smith played the puck from behind the net and passed it right to Zack Kassian in the corner, and he fed Slepyshev to deposit the puck into a wide-open net.\nDougie Hamilton tied the game with Calgary’s first shot on Cam Talbot at the 6:43 mark. Hamilton wisely jumped into the play to receive a pass from Backlund as he reached the high slot, and he quickly ripped a top-corner, glove-side wrister for his 17th goal of the season, which leads all NHL defensemen.\nGarnet Hathaway put the Flames ahead with a shorthanded goal at 11:54. Hathaway snapped a 41-game goal-scoring slump when he took a long shot on a 1-on-1 rush and banked in the puck off the far post.\nBacklund, whose line matched against McDavid’s, made it 3-1 with 4:32 remaining in the first period. After Michael Stone’s shot was denied, Backlund pounced on a juicy rebound and swept a shot around the netminder.\nTalbot was pulled after making just four saves. Al Montoya stopped all 13 shots he faced.\nMichael Cammalleri snapped a 32-game goal drought, the longest of his career, at 12:41 of the second period to pull the Oilers within one. Cammalleri neatly deflected a point shot for his first goal since Dec. 21, but that’s as close as the Oilers could get.\nMcDavid was blanked for just the third time in 18 games.\nJohnny Gaudreau was back in the Flames lineup after missing two games to be with his father after he had a heart attack. Spencer Foo, a free-agent signing out of the NCAA ranks last spring, made his NHL debut and skated on a line with Gaudreau.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:44:43.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
