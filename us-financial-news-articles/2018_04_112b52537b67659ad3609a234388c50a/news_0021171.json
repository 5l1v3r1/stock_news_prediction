Unilateral abrogation would almost certainly trigger a diplomatic crisis between the U.S. and the other signatories — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. \nThe Trump administration has accused Iran of fomenting instability and violence across the Mideast, and the deadline gives the White House and Congress limited time to forge legislation punishing the country for that behavior without directly ending the nuclear accord. \nTrump “wants a better deal,” Mnuchin said.
