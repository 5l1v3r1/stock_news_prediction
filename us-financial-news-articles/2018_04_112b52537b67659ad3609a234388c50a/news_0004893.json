Yields had come under pressure in recent weeks as investors sought safety in U.S. bonds due to stock market volatility.\nNervous investors are hoping an unusually strong U.S. earnings season can restore some of the optimism that characterized equity markets last year.\n“In the immediate term there is pressure, but (there is)nothing in long term because the fundamentals are still in place,” said Lloyd.\nInvestors will be able to buy and sell shares in the Swedish music streaming service Spotify in the New York Stock Exchange’s first-ever direct floor listing.\nViacom Inc dropped more than 3 percent after Reuters reported CBS Corp planned to make an all-stock offer that valued the media company below its current market valuation. CBS shares were up 2.5 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.25-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, 2.36-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:37:42.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
