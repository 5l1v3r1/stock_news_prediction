Older people suffer disproportionately from chronic diseases like diabetes, compared to their younger counterparts.\nAlphabet has chosen to focus its challenge on the issue of medical data interoperability. The idea is to make it easier for patients and providers to easily share medical data like lab results or imaging in a computer-readable format (not a PDF). Hospitals and their technology vendors have historically chosen to \"lock-in\" patients to their facilities rather than provide them with easy access to their data.\nApple, through its medical records product, is also focused on solving this problem.\nWith the Google-AMA challenge, the three best ideas submitted will get a combined $50,000 in credit for Google Cloud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T22:14:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
