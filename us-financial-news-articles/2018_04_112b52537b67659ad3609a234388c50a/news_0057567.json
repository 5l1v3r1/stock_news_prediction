(the \"Company\" or \"GoldMining\") (TSX-V: GOLD; OTCQX: GLDLF) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an agreement (the \"Agreement\") with an arm's length vendor (the \"Vendor\") to indirectly acquire the Narrow Lake property (\"Narrow Lake\" or the \"Property\"). The Property includes the N1 and N2 claims, which cover a total area of 618 hectares and are contiguous with the southern boundary of the Company's Nicholas Lake-Ormsby property, one of the four properties that comprise the Yellowknife Gold Project (\"YGP\"). With this latest acquisition, the YGP will have an expanded total area of 12,120 hectares upon closing.\nThe YGP has been the subject of substantial drilling, underground development, metallurgical testwork and historic gold production from the high-grade Discovery Mine, which the Company acquired in July 2017.\nAgreement\nPursuant to the Agreement, GoldMining will pay $50,000 cash and issue $38,000 in common shares of GoldMining (\"GOLD Shares\") on closing and an additional $100,000 in cash or GOLD Shares, at the Company's discretion, on the first anniversary of the closing date, in consideration for the Property. The number of GOLD Shares issuable shall be based on the volume-weighted average price of GOLD Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSX-V\") for the ten trading days immediately prior to the date of such payment. GoldMining granted the Vendor a 1% net smelter royalty with respect to the N1 and N2 claims upon commercial production. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among other things, receipt of requisite approvals. The parties currently expect closing to occur by the end of May 2018.\nNarrow Lake\nNarrow Lake was part of the Morris Lake Project that was explored by Viking Gold Exploration Inc. from 2009 to 2010. Exploration programs included geological mapping, rock and lake sediment geochemistry, geophysics (ground magnetic and electromagnetic surveys) and shallow diamond drilling (2,539 metres in 12 holes), which identified several conductors on strike with the Ormsby gold deposit.\nThe Property has potential for both, bulk mineable gold mineralization as outlined at the Ormsby deposit, located approximately 300 metres to the northeast, and high-grade gold mineralization, as mined from underground at the Discovery Mine located 3 kilometres to the northeast. The Ormsby deposit was the focus of extensive exploration by previous operators, including surface and underground drilling (120,760 metres), underground development (1,579 metres), bulk sampling and metallurgical testwork. The Discovery Mine was in operation from 1949 to 1968 with estimated production of one million ounces of gold. Reference to historical production at the Discovery Mine is for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the Companyꞌs potential future results at the YGP. Future exploration programs would be designed to examine the potential for these styles of mineralization on the YGP and at Narrow Lake.\nShares for Debt\nThe Company has, through a subsidiary, entered into a debt settlement agreement and will issue 34,188 GOLD Shares in satisfaction of $40,000 of debt owed by the subsidiary to an arm's length creditor, at a deemed price of $1.17 per GOLD Share. Such GOLD Shares will be subject to a four month and one day hold period from the date of issuance. The transaction will be completed on or about the date hereof upon receipt of TSX-V approval.\nQualified Person\nPaulo Pereira, President of GoldMining Inc. has reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news release. Mr. Pereira holds a Bachelors degree in Geology from Universidade do Amazonas in Brazil, is a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101 and is a member of the Association of Professional Geoscientists of Ontario.\nAbout GoldMining Inc.\nGoldMining is a public mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition and development of gold assets in the Americas.
