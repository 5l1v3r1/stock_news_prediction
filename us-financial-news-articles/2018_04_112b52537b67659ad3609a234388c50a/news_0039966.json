However, sales slowed as limits on home purchases hit transactions. \nNew home prices rose for the 35th consecutive month in March, with more cities reporting growth as the government supported demand from first-time buyers. \nIn the first quarter of 2017, lending was 1.7 trillion yuan and sales growth accelerated thanks to a boom in smaller cities where home purchase conditions are less restrictive. \nOutstanding property loans rose 20.3 percent by end-March from a year earlier to 34.1 trillion yuan, the PBOC said in a quarterly report posted on its website. \nOutstanding individual mortgage loans rose 20 percent by end of March to 22.86 trillion yuan. \nIndividual mortgage loans increased by 99.49 million yuan in the first quarter. \nChinese banks doled out more loans overall in March and appeared to make solid progress in reining in off-balance sheet lending that has prompted a sweeping crackdown by regulators looking to reduce systemic financial risks. \nRegulators have been cracking down on consumer loans that are being misused for home purchases, warning they cannot be used to “fuel property bubbles”. \nConsumer loans increased by 1.4 trillion yuan in the first quarter, according to PBOC data.
