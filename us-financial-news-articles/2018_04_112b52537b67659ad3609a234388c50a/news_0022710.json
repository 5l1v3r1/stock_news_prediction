Promising results with the new nets have already prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to recommend their wider use.\n“It’s imperative we try to remain one step ahead of insecticide resistance, which threatens to reverse the great gains made in combating malaria,” said Dr Natacha Protopopoff, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who led the field research.\nThe use of insecticide-treated bed nets has helped to cut deaths from malaria over the years, but more recently progress against the disease has stalled.\nThe latest WHO figures show that malaria infected about 216 million people in 2016, up five million from the previous year, and killed 445,000 people, about the same number as in 2015.\nThe vast majority of deaths were in children under the age of five in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T01:49:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
