Revenue also rose above forecasts, to $8.63 billion, above an expected $8.39 billion.\nThe results showed regional differences in orders. Total orders in Europe were down 3 percent, numbers in the Americas were stable, but they were particularly strong for Asia, the Middle East and Africa — with orders up 20 percent. Both large and base orders developed positively in China, India and the United Arab Emirates, ABB said in its earnings report.\nTobias Schwarz | Getty Images Collaborative dual-arm robot YuMi is pictured at the Swiss automation group ABB booth at the Hannover Messe industrial trade fair in Hanover, central Germany on April 13, 2015. Spiesshofer said ABB was well placed to grow globally.\n\"If you look at the way ABB is positioned, we're bringing power from any power plant to any consumption block of electricity. Renewables are kicking in, e-mobility is coming and this will be a great opportunity for us. In the automation side, there is no other player that has process, control, discreet automation, robotics and electrification and a strong digital platform. So we're shaping the world with our offering and we're contributing, so that means we participate in the growth,\" he said.\nThe results showed a \"strengthened ABB\" and that the \"transition year\" of 2017, referring to the restructuring that the company has undergone in recent years, was \"behind us,\" the earnings report from ABB said. Shares of the company soared 4 percent in early deals Thursday.\nWhile the short-term outlook was \"trending positively in Europe and the United States, with growth expected to continue in China,\" it said uncertainties around \"oil prices and foreign exchange translation effects\" are expected to continue to influence the company's results.\nshow chapters ABB CEO: Long-term outlook on capital spending is positive 13 Hours Ago | 02:11 Spiesshofer said the results showed that all of ABB's markets are \"steady or improving.\" Particular focus was placed on the company's Power Grids business which has struggled in recent years. The company has also faced increased shareholder demand to ditch the Power Grids unit.\nSpiesshofer said the division continued to improve, however.\n\"We have improved the underlying performance of this business. We have changed the business model, we cut certain business models and that means we have a dampening effect on the topline, but altogether this is the pristine asset in the power space, it's the number one globally and it's the most profitable by a long distance to its competitors and we are fully committed to continue the improvement journey into the future,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T10:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T10:29:15.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
