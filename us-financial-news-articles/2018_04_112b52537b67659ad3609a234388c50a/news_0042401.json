The environment ministry said last year’s total waste imports fell 12 percent as a result, but it didn’t give an absolute number.\nThe newly formed Ministry of Ecology and Environment said at its inaugural meeting last month that it would step up the fight against foreign waste, saying it was “a symbolic measure for the creation of an ecological civilisation in China.”\nUncovering violations has been a major challenge, however, with smuggling still rife. Customs authorities are also having to step up their detection capabilities in order to identify which shipments violate China’s scrap quality standards.\nChina’s customs department seized 110,000 tonnes of smuggled waste in the first quarter of this year, it said this month.
