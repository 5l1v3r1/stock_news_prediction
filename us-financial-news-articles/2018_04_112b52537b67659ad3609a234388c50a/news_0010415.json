Six players scored in double figures to lead the Jazz (45-33) to their third straight win.\nUtah is tied with San Antonio for fourth place in the Western Conference, a half-game up on Oklahoma City, a game ahead of Minnesota and 1 1/2 games in front of New Orleans.\nKentavious Caldwell-Pope and Kyle Kuzma each scored 26 points to lead the Lakers.\nLos Angeles (33-44) hung tough with Utah despite only having nine players available. Brandon Ingram missed his second straight game (concussion) and Lonzo Ball was sidelined for a third consecutive game (left knee contusion).\nLos Angeles scored on nine straight possessions to open the game. The Lakers made eight straight baskets without a miss to open up a 20-11 lead. Kuzma did most of the damage in that stretch, hitting all four of his first quarter baskets.\nThe Jazz cut the deficit to 22-20 on a turnaround jumper from Mitchell. Utah couldn’t erase the lead entirely. Mitchell gave the ball away on two separate bad passes in less than a minute and Los Angeles scored off each turnover.\nThe Lakers eventually built up a double-digit lead early in the second quarter. They went ahead 43-31 behind a 9-0 run capped by a floater from Tyler Ennis.\nThat lead didn’t last long once Rubio took over just before halftime. Rubio scored 15 points over the final 6:28 of the second quarter. He capped it off with baskets on back-to-back possessions in the final minute to give Utah a 65-60 halftime lead. Rubio had 25 first-half points, a season-high for any Jazz player.\nThe Jazz eventually built up a 15-point lead in the third quarter, going up 91-76 when Mitchell drained back-to-back 3-pointers. Los Angeles still had a run left in it.\nThe Lakers cut it to 95-91 on Josh Hart’s jumper to open the fourth quarter, but could get no closer. Utah reclaimed a 113-102 lead on an Ingles 3-pointer with 2:26 left.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T13:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:23:11.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
