Pruitt heads into the meeting under pressure from lawmakers to resign over allegations he broke ethics rules by renting a room in a Washington condo owned by the wife of an energy industry lobbyist.\nPruitt and Perdue have spent the last several weeks compiling a list of options for Trump to consider on the RFS, ranging from more aggressive tactics like capping the prices of the blending credits at the center of the program, to deferring the whole issue to Congress.\nIn recent weeks, advisers have urged Trump to let lawmakers tackle the issue, and use the threat of executive action to coerce them to make it a priority.\nIowa farmers and biofuel groups sent a letter to Iowa Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst on Friday, urging them to reach out to Trump to express their anger.\n“We urge you to reach out directly to President Trump to make clear that any Administration action to waive or cap RINs will be viewed as nothing less than a declaration of war on rural America and a complete abdication of his repeated promises to protect the RFS,” according to the letter, orchestrated by the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association.\nBiofuel groups are also frustrated with the administration over reports that the EPA was exempting small refineries from the program, including three owned by one of the nation’s largest refining companies, Andeavor.
