(NASDAQ:NHTC), a leading direct-selling and e-commerce company that markets premium quality personal care, wellness, and “quality of life” products under the NHT Global brand, today announced its preliminary revenue estimate for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company estimates total revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 to be $52.4 million, representing a decrease of 13% compared to $59.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 14% compared to $46.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company further estimates that its deferred revenue at March 31, 2018 was $4.1 million, compared to $4.5 million at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2017, deferred revenue was $4.3 million, compared to $4.9 million at December 31, 2016.\n“Our estimated total revenue for the first quarter of 2018 represented the second sequential quarterly increase since last September,” commented Chris Sharng, President of Natural Health Trends Corp. “In addition to our international Ambassador Academy in January which attracted over 5,500 members and guests, we believe that the enhancements we made to our commission plan to better incentivize up-and-coming members, coupled with successful marketing programs, predominately drove the sequential sales growth. We look forward to various productive incentive trips and targeted training programs in 2018 to drive further progress and growth.”\nThe Company expects to issue its complete first quarter 2018 financial results in early May. The revenue estimate is preliminary and has not yet been reviewed by the Company’s independent accountants. Significant updates and revisions may be required before the release of the Company’s first quarter 2018 financial results. In addition, the Company’s financial results will include other factors necessary to calculate additional financial metrics, including gross profit and net income.\nAbout Natural Health Trends Corp.\nNatural Health Trends Corp.
