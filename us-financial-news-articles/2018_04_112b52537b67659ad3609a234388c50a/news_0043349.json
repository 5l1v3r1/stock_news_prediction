REUTERS/Yuya Shino \nThe core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, rose 0.9 percent year-on-year in March, matching economists’ median estimate, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications data showed on Friday. It followed a 1.0 percent gain in February. \nThe so-called core-core inflation index, which excludes fresh food and energy prices and is similar to the core index used in the United States, rose 0.5 percent in the year to March – flat from the previous month. \nAnalysts expect core consumer inflation to peak in the coming months as upward price pressure from energy and food is likely to moderate, which will raise more hurdles in the Bank of Japan’s path to exiting easy monetary policy. \nDespite more than five years of the central bank’s aggressive monetary stimulus, inflation remains distant from the BOJ’s 2 percent target. \nJapan’s economy expanded at an annualized 1.6 percent in October-December, posting its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy, on the back of solid capital spending. \nBig Japanese companies agreed last month at annual negotiations with labor unions to raise wages for a fifth year. \nThis should help support consumer spending and inflation, but many companies likely fell short of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s goal of increasing wages by 3 percent or more. \nJapan’s unemployment rate hovers near a 25-year low at 2.5 percent, which should encourage inflation by putting upward pressure on wages. \nHowever, consumer prices have risen more slowly than the BOJ had hoped, as companies hold off on raising prices and wages, citing uncertainty over the economic outlook.
