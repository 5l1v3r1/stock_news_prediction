Japan demands Koreans wipe map off summit dinner mousse Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has demanded that South Korea rethink a mango mousse dessert it plans to serve at a North-South summit dinner on Friday which features a map of the Korean peninsula, including islands disputed with Japan, a recurring irritant for Tokyo.

Seoul says that Tokyo has yet to deliver a heartfelt apology for its wartime actions.\nBut Moon and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe have vowed to present a united front and exert pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear and missile programmes, which it pursues in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.\nThe North-South summit at the border truce village of Panmunjom is set to be followed by a meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in May or June.
