Last month, it called for six Vivendi-nominated board members, including TIM Chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, to be replaced through a vote on April 24.\nGlass Lewis also recommended that shareholders vote in favour of Amos Genish serving as the phone groupâ€™s chief executive for the next two years.\nGenish was co-opted by the board last September following the resignation of his predecessor, but his appointment has to be approved by shareholders to continue beyond the April AGM.
