What about that too-hot employment number? What about a president who no longer seems to care that much about how the stock market's doing? What about FANG risk and Chinese retaliation? What about NAFTA? You scrap that, I think you could kill the bull,\" Cramer said \n\"Bottom line: don't be so quick to call this rebound a 'tradeable bottom,'\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"If things go the wrong way, it could become an un-tradeable non-bottom pretty quick. That's why I'm counseling caution.\" WATCH: Cramer points to lingering risks in the market show chapters", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://vine.co/u/984542302087651328", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "published": "2018-04-06T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T01:21:57.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
