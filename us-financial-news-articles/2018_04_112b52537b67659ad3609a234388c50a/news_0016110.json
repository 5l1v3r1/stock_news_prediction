The expanded management team will allow Oski to further meet growing demand for its expertise in functional verification sign-off methodology.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405005380/en/\nCraig Shirley, President and CEO of Oski Technology (Photo: Business Wire)\nShirley is a seasoned executive in the Electronic Design Automation industry and comes from IC Manage where he served as the Vice President of Worldwide Sales. He has a strong track record for producing compound double digit growth rates while building sales and technical teams, with over $600 Million in liquidity events and a top performing IPO (Verisity). Prior to IC Manage, he served as Vice President Worldwide Sales at Apache Design Solutions (acquired by ANSYS), Vice President of Worldwide Sales at Jasper Design Automation (acquired by Cadence), and Vice President of North American sales at Verisity Design (acquired by Cadence).\n“Once again, Vigyan has pioneered new Formal Verification Methodologies to accelerate coverage closure across the entire chip,” said Craig Shirley, President and CEO of Oski. “By formally verifying high-risk design features early in the design cycle and avoiding bug escapes, Oski frees up our customers’ verification teams to focus on their simulation-friendly design features. Vigyan’s enhanced dedication to tackling the most complex verification issues will bring even richer value to our customers. I’m excited about transforming Oski’s groundbreaking work into our customers’ competitive advantage.”\nVigyan Singhal was previously the founding CEO of Jasper Design Automation, a leading Formal Verification solutions provider before being acquired by Cadence Design Systems. After Jasper, Singhal founded Oski to invent new methodologies to verify complex semiconductor problems, including sign-off with formal verification and architectural formal verification. Given growing business needs, this new change enables Singhal to focus on customer engagements and solve intractable problems currently beyond the reach of today’s formal verification tools or methods.\n“At Jasper, I had excellent success in bringing in a CEO who could take the company to the next level,” said Singhal, Founder and Chief Oski. “I look forward to working closely with Craig, the Oski team and our customers to achieve greater heights than ever before. Craig’s wealth of business knowledge, experience, and management skills is second to none.”\nFor more information about Oski’s ability to solve critical verification challenges, go to: www.oskitechnology.com\nAbout Oski Technology\nOski Technology established itself as the unsurpassed trusted global leader in the domain of Formal Verification methodology and expertise.
