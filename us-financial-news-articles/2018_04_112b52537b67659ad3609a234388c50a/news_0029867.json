That brew was supposed to be on sale for only a couple of months but the brewery said it was so popular that it is still being made and sold today.\nThe town has royal associations that go back centuries and Windsor, the oldest and largest inhabited castle in the world, has been the family home of British kings and queens for almost 1,000 years.\nBottles of Harry and Meghan's Windsor Knot pale ale are seen on display at the Windsor and Eton brewery in Windsor, Britain April 11, 2018.REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Harry and his brother William both attended the nearby exclusive Eton College school which lies on the opposite bank of the River Thames.\nIn a local Eton pub, the latest royal beer got a seal of approval from two American customers.\n“Pale ales are quite popular in the United States and I really think this is a good one,” said Jaime Naber, a 38-year-old from Wisconsin who was visiting a friend nearby.\nTraci Bunch, 48, said it would get the couple’s approval if they tried it.\nSlideshow (14 Images) “I think they’ll love it,” she said, gulping down the last drop of her beer.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T09:53:01.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
