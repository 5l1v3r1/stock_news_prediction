Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal Things to do for an article about to-do lists:\n1. Make a list of experts on list making. Call or email 16 of them.\n2. Interview Chris Bailey, author of “The Productivity Project,” who says “everyone on the planet” should have a to-do list because the more ideas we get out of our mind, the more we can think.\n3. Pick up dry cleaning!\n4. Come up with a big thought: America is drowning in lists, and it has never been easier to make them.\n• Hundreds of list-making apps are available for smartphones.\n• Software programs like Monday, Basecamp and Evernote promise group to-do lists with coworkers.\n• Dizzingly complex Bullet Journals allow people with too much time on their hands to track yearly, monthly and daily goals. Plus: optional mood trackers!\n5. Email publicist for Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist and Netscape co-founder who created his own list system. Request interview.\n6. Use this response from publicist: “His schedule is nuts, and he won’t be available to participate in this.”\n• Try to resist the urge to point out to publicist that Mr. Andreessen’s first piece of life advice in his own blog post on productivity is: “Don’t keep a schedule.”\n7. Check spelling of Andreessen one more time.\n8. Stress-test the idea that you should put everything in your head onto a list. Some experts say it’s all too much. They argue the best lists require the simplest of ingredients:\n• A pencil\n• A piece of paper\n• Three—and only three—important things to do.\n9. Find a great Quote: making the case. “A good list gives me that really good illusion of control over my life,” says Melissa Camara Wilkins, who home-schools six children while writing a book about simplifying life.\n10. Take coffee break and wonder how someone who home-schools six children has time to write a book.\n11. Sort through interview notes and discover a divide.\n• Camp 1: “write everything down.”\n• Camp 2: “pick a few things that really matter.”\n12. Question whether this difference of opinion is enough to hang a Wall Street Journal story on. Decide it is.\n13. Add a few things we’ve already done to our list, just for the thrill of crossing them off. Progress!\n14. Do some historical research:\n• The Ten Commandments may be the original to-do (and not-to-do) list.\n• Benjamin Franklin tracked progress on “virtues” such as temperance and humility.\n• The “Ivy Lee Method” from the early 1900s involves recording up to six tasks each evening for the next day. Many people still use it. Bet Ivy Lee’s descendants wish he’d trademarked that.\n15. Explain why all this is so important. Pull Quote: from David Allen, a consultant and author of “Getting Things Done”: “Your head was designed to have ideas, not to hold them.” He says that’s why we go to the grocery store to get lemons and return with a bag full of things but no lemons.\n16. Buy lemons!\n17. List some of Mr. Allen’s lists:\n• Task-oriented lists, which include calls to make, creative-writing pieces to finish and a “waiting for” list of things others are supposed to provide.\n• “Agenda lists” with items to raise with various people, with one, for instance, dedicated to his wife.\n• A “someday maybe list” for things that might never happen.\n• Hundreds of other lists such as the 45 movies on his “guy flicks” list for watching when his wife isn’t around.\n18. Ask Mr. Allen if this seems a little crazy. His reply: “People say, ‘I don’t need to keep all these lists.’ Then fine, keep them in your head. I don’t care.”\n19. Figure out this someday-maybe list. Gina Trapani, a web developer and founder of the Lifehacker productivity blog, has one, too. “Someday I’m going to live in Sicily,” she says.\n20. Wonder if our life goals are too boring. Maybe we want to live in Sicily? Google vacation houses for summer.\n21. Count to-do apps at the Apple App Store (quit at 700). Examples:\nPhoto: Photos: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal • List apps for groceries, packing, Christmas shopping.\n• Punishment apps, such as “Angry Moon,” where fearsome moon face gets furious at you if you leave a task undone.\n• Reward apps, such as “Cat Do” that sends a “genuine cat photo selected by our team of cat professionals” for every completed task.\nTake a Look at Other Recent A-Heds\nYou Think Discovering a Computer Virus Is Hard? Try Naming One Who’s Murdering Residents of the Blustery Faroe Islands? Crime Writers Tactic #5 for Avoiding Budget Airline Fees: Wear All of Your Clothes 22. Find expert who makes everyone happy, saying there is no one best practice. “It’s like saying the best height for a person is 5-feet, 7-inches,” says Gretchen Rubin, an author who studies good habits.\n23. Figure out this Bullet Journal system. Watch YouTube videos explaining system of charts and doodles.\n24. Wonder if anyone actually uses the trademarked nickname #bujo and find 1.4 million mentions on Instagram (plus 1.8 million for #bulletjournal). Realize someone had learned a lesson from Ivy Lee.\n25. Call Ryder Carroll, the creator. His journal isn’t nearly that elaborate. He tries not to get bogged down in details. “Productivity can become its own form of distraction,” he says.\nWrite to Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com and Heidi Vogt at heidi.vogt@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T04:12:44.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
