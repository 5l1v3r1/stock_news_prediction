Analysts at RBC said the first-quarter premium rise was “below our expectations for growth”, though they reiterated their “sector perform” rating on the stock.\nHastings’ shares were trading at 261 pence per share at 0724 GMT, the worst-performing stock in the FTSE mid-cap index .\nThe weather system dubbed “the Beast from the East” brought rare snow and sub-zero temperatures to much of Britain in late February and early March.\nThe group said it remained confident of delivering a calendar year loss ratio just below or within the target range of 75 percent-79 percent.\nThe company’s net revenue came in at 184.5 million pounds ($257.17 million) for the quarter ended March 31, up 12 percent from 164.5 million pounds a year earlier.\nHastings offers insurance for private cars, homes, motorbikes, vans, and premium financing and ancillary products. It has made a headway in a competitive sector by focusing on selling motor insurance via price-comparison websites.\nThe insurer said it was on track to meet its targets for 2019, including achieving 3 million customers.
