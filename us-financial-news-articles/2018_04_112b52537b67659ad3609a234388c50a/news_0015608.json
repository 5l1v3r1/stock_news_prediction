REUTERS/Ina Fassbender/File Photo The Justice Department reached an agreement in principle with the two companies in recent days, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Under the deal, Bayer agreed to sell additional seed and treatment assets to BASF SE ( BASFn.DE ) and agreed to make concessions related to digital agriculture, the Journal said.\nShares of Monsanto, the world’s biggest seed company, jumped 6.6 percent, to $125.66.\nFILE PHOTO: Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., May 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Bayer declined comment on the report, but said in a statement it anticipated closing the Monsanto purchase in the second quarter.\n“We remain confident in our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and look forward to continuing to work diligently with regulators to support that process,” it said.\nA spokeswoman for BASF could not immediately be reached for comment. The Department of Justice and Monsanto both declined to comment.\nLast week, Monsanto said in its quarterly earnings report that it was confident the U.S. and other needed regulatory approvals would be secured within the second quarter.\nMonsanto did not host a conference call with analysts to discuss the earnings, as is its usual practice, because of the pending merger.\nEuropean Union antitrust regulators approved the deal in March after the companies agreed to sell a swathe of assets to BASF. China, Brazil and Australia have also approved the proposed merger.\nThe deal is the third in the sector, preceded by a merger of Dow ( DWDP.N ) and Dupont, and a merger of ChemChina CNNCC.UL and Syngenta.\nReporting by Karan Nagarkatti in Bengaluru and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T21:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T21:27:06.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
