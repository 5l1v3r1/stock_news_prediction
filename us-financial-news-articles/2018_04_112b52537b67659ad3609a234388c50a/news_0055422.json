Costs and production remained in line with guidance, and our next generation of profitable mines – Ahafo North, Yanacocha Sulfides and Long Canyon Phase 2 – advanced on schedule to the next stage of development study. We also generated $644 million in adjusted EBITDA and declared a dividend of $0.14 per share, nearly three times higher than prior year quarter,” said Gary J. Goldberg, President and Chief Executive Officer. “This performance is overshadowed, however, by a tragic construction accident at our Ahafo Mill Expansion that resulted in six fatalities. Production has recommenced at Ahafo and Akyem but civil construction at the Ahafo Mill Expansion project will remain suspended until we and the authorities are satisfied that work can resume safely. In the meantime, our priorities are to support the people who lost loved ones in the accident and cooperate with authorities to investigate its causes, and, with great humility and resolve, to renew our commitment to working safely.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary Results\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Newmont stockholders of $170 million or $0.32 per diluted share, an increase of $100 million from the prior year quarter primarily due to higher average realized gold prices.\nAdjusted net income was $185 million or $0.35 per diluted share, compared to $136 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the prior year quarter; favorable pricing was partially offset by lower production and higher CAS. The adjustments to net income of $0.03 related to restructuring, valuation allowances and other tax adjustments.\nRevenue rose eight percent to $1.8 billion for the quarter from higher realized gold price.\nAverage realized price 6 for gold was $1,326, an improvement of $107 per ounce over the prior year quarter; average realized price for copper was $2.88 per pound, an improvement of $0.20 over the prior year quarter.\nAttributable gold production decreased two percent to 1.21 million ounces from lower leach activity at Yanacocha, lower grade and scheduled maintenance at Boddington, and lower grade and reduced recovery at CC&V associated with the stockpiling of concentrate for shipment to Nevada, partially offset by improved production from Merian, Tanami, Carlin and Ahafo.\nGold CAS rose seven percent to $982 million for the quarter. Gold CAS per ounce rose to $748 for the quarter due to higher oil prices, higher mill maintenance costs at Boddington, and higher stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments. These impacts were partially offset by increased sales.\nGold AISC rose eight percent to $973 per ounce for the quarter on higher CAS and increased advanced projects and exploration expense.\nAttributable copper production from Phoenix and Boddington decreased eight percent to 12,000 tonnes for the quarter. Copper CAS totaled $47 million for the quarter. Copper CAS was $1.74 per pound, a 16 percent increase over the prior year quarter due to changes in gold-copper cost allocation at Boddington. Copper AISC for the quarter rose 17 percent to $2.07 per pound on higher CAS.\nCapital expenditures 7 increased by 28 percent from the prior year quarter to $231 million from growth projects including Quecher Main, Subika Underground, and the Ahafo Mill expansion.\nConsolidated operating cash flow from continuing operations fell 29 percent from the prior year quarter to $266 million on higher working capital outflows. Free cash flow decreased $162 million to $35 million for the quarter from lower operating cash flow and higher investment in growth projects.\nBalance sheet ended the quarter with $3.1 billion cash on hand, a leverage ratio of 0.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA and one of the best credit ratings in the mining sector. The Company is committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nProjects update\nNewmont’s capital-efficient project pipeline supports stable production with improving margins and mine life. Near-term development capital projects are presented below. Funding for Subika Underground, Ahafo Mill Expansion, Twin Underground, Quecher Main and Tanami Power projects has been approved and these projects are in execution. Additional projects represent incremental improvements to production and cost guidance. Internal rates of return (IRR) on these projects are calculated at a $1,200 gold price.\nSubika Underground (Africa) leverages existing infrastructure and an optimized approach to develop Ahafo’s most promising underground resource. First production was achieved in June 2017 with commercial production expected in the second half of 2018. The project is expected to increase average annual gold production by between 150,000 and 200,000 ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2019 with an initial mine life of approximately 11 years. Capital costs for the project are estimated at between $160 and $200 million with expenditure of between $80 and $90 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more than 20 percent. Ahafo Mill Expansion (Africa) is designed to maximize resource value by improving production margins and accelerating stockpile processing. The project also supports profitable development of Ahafo’s highly prospective underground resources. First production is expected in the first half of 2019 with commercial production expected in the second half of 2019. The expansion is expected to increase average annual gold production by between 75,000 and 100,000 ounces per year for the first five years beginning in 2020. Capital costs for the project are estimated at between $140 and $180 million with expenditure of approximately $75 to $85 million in 2018. The project has an IRR of more than 20 percent.\nTogether the Ahafo expansion projects (Ahafo Mill Expansion and Subika Underground) improve Ahafo’s production to between 550,000 and 650,000 ounces per year for the first five full years of production (2020 to 2024). During this period Ahafo’s CAS is expected to be between $650 and $750 per ounce and AISC is expected to be between $800 and $900 per ounce. This represents average production improvement of between 200,000 and 300,000 ounces at CAS improvement of between $150 and $250 per ounce and AISC improvement of $250 to $350 per ounce, compared to 2016 actuals. Twin Underground (North America) is a portal mine beneath Twin Creek’s Vista surface mine with similar mineralization. First production was achieved in August 2017 with commercial production expected mid-2018. The expansion is expected to average between 30,000 and 40,000 ounces per year for the first five years (2018 to 2022). During this period CAS is expected to be between $525 and $625 per ounce and AISC between $650 and $750 per ounce. Capital costs are expected to be between $45 and $55 million with expenditure of $15 to $25 million in 2018. The project IRR is expected to be about 20 percent. Quecher Main (South America) will add oxide production at Yanacocha, leverage existing infrastructure and enable potential future growth at Yanacocha. First production is expected in early 2019 with commercial production in the fourth quarter of 2019. Quecher Main extends the life of the Yanacocha operation to 2027 with average annual gold production of approximately 200,000 ounces per year between 2020 and 2025 (100 percent basis). During the same period incremental CAS is expected to be between $750 and $850 per ounce and AISC between $900 and $1,000 per ounce. Capital costs for the project are expected to be between $250 and $300 million with expenditure of $80 to $90 million in 2018. The project IRR is expected to be greater than 10 percent. Tanami Power (Australia) will lower Tanami power costs by approximately 20 percent beginning in 2019, mitigate fuel supply risk and reduce carbon emissions by 20 percent. The project includes a 450 kilometer natural gas pipeline to be constructed connecting the Tanami site to the Amadeus Gas Pipeline, and construction and operation of two on-site power stations. The gas supply, gas transmission and power purchase agreements are for a 10 year term with options to extend. The project is expected to result in net cash savings of approximately $34 per ounce beginning in 2019. Capital costs are estimated at between $225 and $275 million with annual cash lease payments over a 10 year term beginning in 2019 with approximately $10 million of owner’s costs paid in 2018. The project IRR is expected to be greater than 50 percent at $0.75 AUD.\nOutlook\nNewmont’s outlook reflects stable gold production and ongoing investment in its operating assets and most promising growth prospects. Newmont does not include development projects that have not yet been funded or reached execution stage in its outlook, which represents upside to production and cost guidance.\nAttributable gold production remains unchanged at between 4.9 and 5.4 million ounces in 2018 and 2019. Longer term production is expected to remain stable at between 4.6 and 5.1 million ounces per year through 2022 excluding development projects which have yet to be approved.\nNorth America production remains unchanged at between 2.0 and 2.2 million ounces in 2018. Production declines slightly in 2019 to between 1.8 and 2.0 million ounces due to planned stripping at Carlin and then increases to between 1.9 and 2.1 million ounces in 2020 due to higher grades at Twin Creeks, Cripple Creek & Victor and Long Canyon. The Company continues to pursue profitable growth opportunities at Carlin and Long Canyon. South America production remains unchanged at between 615,000 and 675,000 ounces in 2018. Production is expected to be between 590,000 and 690,000 ounces in 2019 with the addition of Quecher Main and between 475,000 and 575,000 ounces per year in 2020 as Yanacocha laybacks are mined out and Merian transitions from saprolite to hard rock. The Company continues to advance near-mine growth opportunities at Merian and both oxide and sulfide potential at Yanacocha. Australia production remains unchanged at between 1.5 and 1.7 million ounces in 2018. Production is expected to be between 1.4 and 1.6 million ounces in 2019 and 2020. In 2020, Boddington completes stripping and accesses higher grade ore which offsets the impact of processing lower grade stockpiles at KCGM. The Company continues to advance studies for a second expansion at Tanami. Africa production remains unchanged at between 815,000 and 875,000 ounces in 2018. Production is expected to be between 1.1 and 1.2 million ounces in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion reaches commercial production and between 880,000 and 980,000 ounces in 2020 as both Ahafo and Akyem reach lower open pit grade. The company continues to advance the Ahafo North project and other prospective surface and underground opportunities.\nGold cost outlook – CAS remains unchanged at between $700 and $750 per ounce in 2018.

AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and longer-term through 2022. Further Full Potential savings and profitable ounces from projects that are not yet approved represent additional upside not currently captured in guidance.\nNorth America CAS improved to be between $730 and $780 per ounce in 2018 due to expected concentrate recovery improvements and higher recoverable leach ounces at CC&V. CAS is expected to be between $680 and $780 per ounce in 2019 and between $655 and $755 per ounce in 2020 on higher production at Twin Creeks, Cripple Creek & Victor and Long Canyon. AISC has improved to be between $920 and $955 per ounce in 2018 on improved unit CAS. AISC is expected to be between $870 and $970 per ounce in 2019 and between $825 and $925 in 2020. South America CAS improved to be between $675 and $735 per ounce in 2018 due to mill feed optimization at Yanacocha. CAS is expected to be between $560 and $660 per ounce in 2019 as Quecher Main reaches commercial production and be between $690 and $790 per ounce in 2020. AISC improved to be between $925 and $1,025 per ounce in 2018 on lower unit CAS. AISC is expected to be between $810 and $910 per ounce in 2019 on improved unit CAS and be between $970 and $1,070 per ounce in 2020. Australia CAS remains unchanged at between $675 and $725 per ounce in 2018. CAS is expected to be between $670 and $770 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. AISC remains unchanged at between $830 and $890 per ounce in 2018. AISC is expected to be between $840 and $940 per ounce in 2019 and 2020. Africa CAS remains unchanged at between $680 and $730 per ounce in 2018. CAS is expected to be between $520 and $620 per ounce in 2019 and between $610 and $710 per ounce in 2020. AISC remains unchanged at between $865 and $925 per ounce in 2018. AISC is expected to be between $700 and $800 per ounce in 2019 as the Ahafo Mill expansion reaches commercial production and between $775 and $875 per ounce in 2020.\nCopper – Attributable production remains unchanged at between 40,000 and 60,000 tonnes in 2018 and 2019, increasing to between 45,000 and 65,000 tonnes longer term through 2022 as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. CAS remains unchanged at between $1.65 and $1.85 per pound in 2018. CAS is expected to be between $1.80 and $2.20 per pound in 2019 before falling to between $1.40 and $1.80 per pound longer term as Phoenix moves into higher copper zones. AISC remains unchanged at between $2.00 and $2.20 per pound in 2018. AISC is expected to be between $2.25 and $2.55 per pound in 2019 and between $1.80 and $2.10 per pound longer term.\nCapital – Total capital remains unchanged at between $1,200 and $1,300 million for 2018 and is expected to remain between $730 and $830 million for 2019. Primary development capital includes expenditure on the Ahafo Mill and Subika Underground expansions in Africa, Twin Underground in North America and Quecher Main in South America and Tanami Power Project. Sustaining capital remains unchanged at between $600 and $700 million in 2018, between $600 and $700 million for 2019 and between $550 and $650 million per year longer term to cover infrastructure, equipment and ongoing mine development.\nConsolidated expense outlook – Interest expense for 2018 remains unchanged at between $175 and $215 million while investment in exploration and advanced projects remains unchanged at between $350 and $400 million. 2018 outlook for general & administrative costs remains unchanged at between $215 and $240 million and guidance for depreciation and amortization remains unchanged at between $1,225 and $1,325 million.\nAssumptions and sensitivities – Newmont’s outlook assumes $1,200 per ounce gold price, $2.50 per pound copper price, $0.75 USD/AUD exchange rate and $55 per barrel WTI oil price. A $100 per ounce increase in gold price would deliver an expected $335 million improvement in attributable free cash flow. Similarly, a $10 per barrel reduction in the price of oil and a $0.05 favorable change in the Australian dollar would deliver an expected $25 million and $45 million improvement in attributable free cash flow, respectively. These estimates exclude current hedge programs; please refer to Newmont’s Form 10-Q which was filed with the SEC on April 26, 2018 for further information on hedging positions.\n1\nNon-GAAP measure.

by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, we present the Non-GAAP financial measures of our continuing operations in the tables below.\nAdjusted net income (loss)\nManagement uses Adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations. The Company believes the use of Adjusted net income (loss) allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries relating to the sale of products, by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Adjustments to continuing operations are presented before tax and net of our partners’ noncontrolling interests, when applicable. The tax effect of adjustments is presented in the Tax effect of adjustments line and is calculated using the applicable regional tax rate. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted net income (loss) are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to Adjusted net income (loss) as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 192 $ 47 Net loss (income) attributable to Newmont stockholders from discontinued operations (1) (22 ) 23 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders from continuing operations 170 70 Restructuring and other, net (2) 5 6 Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, net (3) — (2 ) Reclamation and remediation charges (4) — 3 Impairment of long-lived assets, net (5) — 2 Acquisition cost adjustments (6) — 2 Tax effect of adjustments (7) (2 ) (4 ) Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments (8) 12 59 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 185 $ 136 Net income (loss) per share, basic (9) $ 0.36 $ 0.09 Net loss (income) attributable to Newmont stockholders from discontinued operations (0.04 ) 0.04 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders from continuing operations 0.32 0.13 Restructuring and other, net 0.01 0.01 Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, net — — Reclamation and remediation charges — 0.01 Impairment of long-lived assets, net — — Acquisition cost adjustments — — Tax effect of adjustments — (0.01 ) Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments 0.02 0.12 Adjusted net income (loss) per share, basic $ 0.35 $ 0.26 Net income (loss) per share, diluted (9) $ 0.36 $ 0.09 Net loss (income) attributable to Newmont stockholders from discontinued operations (0.04 ) 0.04 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders from continuing operations 0.32 0.13 Restructuring and other, net 0.01 0.01 Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, net — — Reclamation and remediation charges — 0.01 Impairment of long-lived assets, net — — Acquisition cost adjustments — — Tax effect of adjustments — (0.01 ) Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments 0.02 0.12 Adjusted net income (loss) per share, diluted $ 0.35 $ 0.26 Weighted average common shares (millions): Basic 534 532 Diluted 535 533 (1) Net loss (income) attributable to Newmont stockholders from discontinued operations relates to (i) adjustments in our Holt royalty obligation, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $4 and $(13), respectively, and (ii) adjustments to our Batu Hijau Contingent Consideration, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $1 and $-, respectively.\n(2) Restructuring and other, net, included in Other expense, net, primarily represents certain costs associated with severance and legal settlements. Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(1) and $(1), respectively.\n(3) Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, included in Other income, net, primarily represents gains or losses on various asset sales. Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(1) and $-, respectively.\n(4) Reclamation and remediation charges, included in Reclamation and remediation, represent revisions to remediation plans at the Company’s former historic mining operations or other non-operating mine sites.\n(5) Impairment of long-lived assets, net, included in Other expense, net, represents non-cash write-downs of long-lived assets. Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $- and $(1), respectively.\n(6) Acquisition cost adjustments, included in Other expense, net, represent net adjustments to the contingent consideration and related liabilities associated with the acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in Boddington in June 2009.\n(7) The tax effect of adjustments, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense), represents the tax effect of adjustments in footnotes (2) through (6), as described above, and are calculated using the applicable regional tax rate.\n(8) Valuation allowance and other tax adjustments, included in Income and mining tax benefit (expense), is recorded for items such as foreign tax credits, alternative minimum tax credits, capital losses and disallowed foreign losses. The adjustment in 2018 is due to increases in tax credit carryovers subject to valuation allowance of $5, increases to net operating loss and other deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance at Yanacocha of $11 and other tax adjustments of $1. Amounts are presented net of income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of $(5). The adjustment in 2017 is due to increases in tax credit carryovers subject to valuation allowance of $69, partially offset by other tax adjustments of $10.\n(9) Per share measures may not recalculate due to rounding.\nEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization and Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization\nManagement uses Earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and EBITDA adjusted for non-core or certain items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as non-GAAP measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to, net income (loss), operating income (loss), or cash flow from operations as those terms are defined by GAAP, and do not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. Although Adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are frequently used as measures of operations and the ability to meet debt service requirements by other companies, our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management’s determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by mining industry analysts. Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders $ 192 $ 47 Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (1 ) 11 Net loss (income) from discontinued operations (1) (22 ) 23 Equity loss (income) of affiliates 9 2 Income and mining tax expense (benefit) 105 111 Depreciation and amortization 301 300 Interest expense, net 53 67 EBITDA $ 637 $ 561 Adjustments: Restructuring and other (2) $ 6 $ 7 Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales (3) 1 (2 ) Reclamation and remediation charges (4) — 3 Impairment of long-lived assets (5) — 3 Acquisition cost adjustments (6) — 2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 644 $ 574 (1) Net loss (income) from discontinued operations relates to (i) adjustments in our Holt royalty obligation, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $4 and $(13), respectively, and (ii) adjustments to our Batu Hijau Contingent Consideration, presented net of tax expense (benefit) of $1 and $-, respectively. (2) Restructuring and other, included in Other expense, net, primarily represents certain costs associated with severance and legal settlements.\n(3) Loss (gain) on asset and investment sales, included in Other income, net, primarily represents gains or losses on various asset sales.\n(4) Reclamation and remediation charges, included in Reclamation and remediation, represent revisions to remediation plans at the Company’s former historic mining operations or other non-operating mine sites.\n(5) Impairment of long-lived assets, included in Other expense, net, represents non-cash write-downs of long-lived assets.\n(6) Acquisition cost adjustments, included in Other expense, net, represent net adjustments to the contingent consideration and related liabilities associated with the acquisition of the final 33.33% interest in Boddington in June 2009.\nFree Cash Flow\nManagement uses Free Cash Flow as a non-GAAP measure to analyze cash flows generated from operations. Free Cash Flow is Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of discontinued operations less Additions to property, plant and mine development as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company believes Free Cash Flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing the Company’s performance with its competitors. Although Free Cash Flow and similar measures are frequently used as measures of cash flows generated from operations by other companies, the Company’s calculation of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to such other similarly titled captions of other companies.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP Free Cash Flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the Company’s performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. The Company’s definition of Free Cash Flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, the Company believes it is important to view Free Cash Flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, which the Company believes to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow, as well as information regarding Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities and Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 263 $ 371 Less: Net cash used in (provided by) operating activities of discontinued operations 3 6 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations 266 377 Less: Additions to property, plant and mine development (231 ) (180 ) Free Cash Flow $ 35 $ 197 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (1) $ (236 ) $ (158 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (179 ) $ (52 ) (1)\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities includes Additions to property, plant and mine development, which is included in the Company’s computation of Free Cash Flow.\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce/pound\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce/pound are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are calculated by dividing the costs applicable to sales of gold and copper by gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Costs applicable to sales per ounce/pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.\nThe following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nCosts applicable to sales per ounce\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Costs applicable to sales (1) $ 982 $ 918 Gold sold (thousand ounces) 1,312 1,328 Costs applicable to sales per ounce (2) $ 748 $ 691 (1) Includes by-product credits of $13 and $10 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (2) Per ounce measures may not recalculate due to rounding. Costs applicable to sales per pound\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Costs applicable to sales (1) $ 47 $ 39 Copper sold (million pounds) 27 26 Costs applicable to sales per pound (2) $ 1.74 $ 1.50 (1) Includes by-product credits of $1 and $1 during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (2) Per pound measures may not recalculate due to rounding. All-In Sustaining Costs\nNewmont has worked to develop a metric that expands on GAAP measures, such as cost of goods sold, and non-GAAP measures, such as Costs applicable to sales per ounce, to provide visibility into the economics of our mining operations related to expenditures, operating performance and the ability to generate cash flow from our continuing operations.\nCurrent GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all of the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain production. Therefore, we believe that all-in sustaining costs is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors, and analysts that aid in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor’s visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production.\nAll-in sustaining cost (“AISC”) amounts are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks such as in International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), or by reflecting the benefit from selling non-gold metals as a reduction to AISC. Differences may also arise related to definitional differences of sustaining versus development capital activities based upon each company’s internal policies.\nThe following disclosure provides information regarding the adjustments made in determining the all-in sustaining costs measure:\nCosts applicable to sales. Includes all direct and indirect costs related to current production incurred to execute the current mine plan. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual amounts from Costs applicable to sales (“CAS”), such as significant revisions to recovery amounts. CAS includes by-product credits from certain metals obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. CAS is accounted for on an accrual basis and excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation, which is consistent with our presentation of CAS on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. In determining AISC, only the CAS associated with producing and selling an ounce of gold is included in the measure. Therefore, the amount of gold CAS included in AISC is derived from the CAS presented in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount of CAS attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The copper CAS at those mine sites is disclosed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines is based upon the relative sales value of gold and copper produced during the period.\nReclamation costs. Includes accretion expense related to Reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the related Asset Retirement Cost (“ARC”) for the Company’s operating properties. Accretion related to the Reclamation liabilities and the amortization of the ARC assets for reclamation does not reflect annual cash outflows but are calculated in accordance with GAAP. The accretion and amortization reflect the periodic costs of reclamation associated with current production and are therefore included in the measure. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.\nAdvanced projects, research and development and exploration. Includes incurred expenses related to projects that are designed to increase or enhance current production and exploration. We note that as current resources are depleted, exploration and advanced projects are necessary for us to replace the depleting reserves or enhance the recovery and processing of the current reserves. As this relates to sustaining our production, and is considered a continuing cost of a mining company, these costs are included in the AISC measure. These costs are derived from the Advanced projects, research and development and Exploration amounts presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations less the amount attributable to the production of copper at our Phoenix and Boddington mines. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.\nGeneral and administrative. Includes costs related to administrative tasks not directly related to current production, but rather related to support our corporate structure and fulfill our obligations to operate as a public company. Including these expenses in the AISC metric provides visibility of the impact that general and administrative activities have on current operations and profitability on a per ounce basis.\nOther expense, net. We exclude certain exceptional or unusual expenses from Other expense, net, such as restructuring, as these are not indicative to sustaining our current operations. Furthermore, this adjustment to Other expense, net is also consistent with the nature of the adjustments made to Net income (loss) attributable to Newmont stockholders as disclosed in the Company’s non-GAAP financial measure Adjusted net income (loss). The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.\nTreatment and refining costs. Includes costs paid to smelters for treatment and refining of our concentrates to produce the salable metal. These costs are presented net as a reduction of Sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSustaining capital. We determined sustaining capital as those capital expenditures that are necessary to maintain current production and execute the current mine plan. Capital expenditures to develop new operations, or related to projects at existing operations where these projects will enhance production or reserves, are generally considered non-sustaining or development capital. We determined the classification of sustaining and development capital projects based on a systematic review of our project portfolio in light of the nature of each project. Sustaining capital costs are relevant to the AISC metric as these are needed to maintain the Company’s current operations and provide improved transparency related to our ability to finance these expenditures from current operations. The allocation of these costs to gold and copper is determined using the same allocation used in the allocation of CAS between gold and copper at the Phoenix and Boddington mines.\nAdvanced Projects, Research and Treatment All-In Costs Development General Other and All-In Ounces Sustaining Three Months Ended Applicable Reclamation and and Expense, Refining Sustaining Sustaining (000)/Pounds Costs per March 31, 2018 to Sales (1)(2)(3) Costs (4) Exploration (5) Administrative Net (6) Costs Capital (7) Costs (millions) Sold oz/lb (8) Gold Carlin $ 199 $ 3 $ 4 $ 2 $ — $ — $ 30 $ 238 229 $ 1,039 Phoenix 62 1 1 1 — 2 5 72 77 933 Twin Creeks 64 1 2 — 1 — 5 73 83 885 Long Canyon 16 1 — — — — 2 19 44 428 CC&V 39 — 2 — — — 9 50 62 804 Other North America — — 13 — 1 — 2 16 — — North America 380 6 22 3 2 2 53 468 495 944 Yanacocha 114 10 6 — 1 — 6 137 107 1,276 Merian 67 — 3 — — — 9 79 125 639 Other South America — — 11 3 1 — — 15 — — South America 181 10 20 3 2 — 15 231 232 999 Boddington 128 2 — — — 5 13 148 160 926 Tanami 76 1 5 — 1 — 12 95 126 750 Kalgoorlie 60 1 3 — — — 8 72 88 824 Other Australia — — 3 2 (1) — 1 5 — — Australia 264 4 11 2 — 5 34 320 374 855 Ahafo 90 1 2 — — — 7 100 104 960 Akyem 67 6 — — 1 — 10 84 107 783 Other Africa — — 6 2 — — — 8 — — Africa 157 7 8 2 1 — 17 192 211 904 Corporate and Other — — 13 49 — — 4 66 — — Total Gold $ 982 $ 27 $ 74 $ 59 $ 5 $ 7 $ 123 $ 1,277 1,312 $ 973 Copper Phoenix $ 16 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2 $ 18 8 2.17 Boddington 31 1 — — — 3 3 38 19 2.03 Total Copper $ 47 $ 1 $ — $ — $ — $ 3 $ 5 $ 56 27 $ 2.07 Consolidated $ 1,029 $ 28 $ 74 $ 59 $ 5 $ 10 $ 128 $ 1,333 (1) Excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation.\n(2) Includes by-product credits of $14 and excludes co-product copper revenues of $78.

The estimates in the table below are considered “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws.\n2018 Outlook - Gold Outlook range Low High Costs Applicable to Sales 1,2 $ 3,700 $ 4,250 Reclamation Costs 3 130 150 Advance Projects and Exploration 350 400 General and Administrative 215 240 Other Expense 5 30 Treatment and Refining Costs 20 40 Sustaining Capital 4 600 700 All-in Sustaining Costs $ 5,100 $ 5,800 Ounces (000) Sold 5,300 5,800 All-in Sustaining Costs per Oz $ 965 $ 1,025 (1) Excludes Depreciation and amortization and Reclamation and remediation.\n(2) Includes stockpile and leach pad inventory adjustments. (3) Reclamation costs include operating accretion and amortization of asset retirement costs. (4) Excludes development capital expenditures, capitalized interest and change in accrued capital. (5) The reconciliation above is provided for illustrative purposes in order to better describe management’s estimates of the components of the calculation. Ranges for each component of the forward-looking All-in sustaining costs per ounce are independently calculated and, as a result, the total All-in sustaining costs and the All-in sustaining costs per ounce may not sum to the component ranges. While a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided for 2018 AISC Gold Outlook on a consolidated basis, a reconciliation has not been provided on an individual site-by-site basis or for longer-term outlook in reliance on Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K because such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts. See the Cautionary Statement at the end of this news release for additional information.\nNet average realized price per ounce/pound\nAverage realized price per ounce/ pound are non-GAAP financial measures. The measures are calculated by dividing the Net consolidated gold and copper sales by the consolidated gold ounces or copper pounds sold, respectively. These measures are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. Average realized price per ounce/ pound statistics are intended to provide additional information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.\nThe following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales $ 1,817 $ 1,690 Consolidated copper sales, net (78 ) (71 ) Consolidated gold sales, net $ 1,739 $ 1,619 Consolidated gold sales: Gross before provisional pricing $ 1,744 $ 1,618 Provisional pricing mark-to-market 2 8 Gross after provisional pricing 1,746 1,626 Treatment and refining charges (7 ) (7 ) Net $ 1,739 $ 1,619 Consolidated gold ounces sold (thousands) 1,312 1,328 Average realized gold price (per ounce): Gross before provisional pricing $ 1,330 $ 1,218 Provisional pricing mark-to-market 1 6 Gross after provisional pricing 1,331 1,224 Treatment and refining charges (5 ) (5 ) Net $ 1,326 $ 1,219 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Sales $ 1,817 $ 1,690 Consolidated gold sales, net (1,739 ) (1,619 ) Consolidated copper sales, net $ 78 $ 71 Consolidated copper sales: Gross before provisional pricing $ 85 $ 70 Provisional pricing mark-to-market (4 ) 4 Gross after provisional pricing 81 74 Treatment and refining charges (3 ) (3 ) Net $ 78 $ 71 Consolidated copper pounds sold (millions) 27 26 Average realized copper price (per pound): Gross before provisional pricing $ 3.14 $ 2.65 Provisional pricing mark-to-market (0.14 ) 0.15 Gross after provisional pricing 3.00 2.80 Treatment and refining charges (0.12 ) (0.12 ) Net $ 2.88 $ 2.68\nGold By-Product Metrics\nCopper is a by-product often obtained during the process of extracting and processing the primary ore-body. In our GAAP Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the value of these by-products is recorded as a credit to our CAS and the value of the primary ore is recorded as Sales. In certain instances, copper is a co-product, or significant resource in the primary ore-body, and the revenue is recorded as Sales in our GAAP Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGold By-Product Metrics are non-GAAP financial measures that serve as a basis for comparing the Company’s performance with certain competitors. As Newmont’s operations are primarily focused on gold production, “Gold By-Product Metrics” were developed to allow investors to view Sales, CAS per ounce and AISC per ounce calculations that classify all copper production as a by-product, even when copper is the primary ore-body. These metrics are calculated by subtracting copper sales recognized from Sales and including these amounts as offsets to CAS.\nGold By-Product Metrics are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented on a consolidated basis. These metrics are intended to provide supplemental information only, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks, such as in IFRS.\nThe following tables reconcile these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Consolidated gold sales, net $ 1,739 $ 1,619 Consolidated copper sales, net 78 71 Sales $ 1,817 $ 1,690 Costs applicable to sales $ 1,029 $ 957 Less: Consolidated copper sales, net (78 ) (71 ) By-Product costs applicable to sales $ 951 $ 886 Gold sold (thousand ounces) 1,312 1,328 Total Gold CAS per ounce (by-product) $ 725 $ 667 Total AISC $ 1,333 $ 1,241 Less: Consolidated copper sales, net (78 ) (71 ) By-Product AISC $ 1,255 $ 1,170 Gold sold (thousand ounces) 1,312 1,328 Total Gold AISC per ounce (by-product) $ 957 $ 881\nConference Call Information\nA conference call will be held on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (8:00 a.m. Mountain Time); it will also be carried on the Company's website.\nConference Call Details\nDial-In Number 855.209.8210 Intl Dial-In Number 412.317.5213 Conference Name Newmont Mining Replay Number 877.344.7529 Intl Replay Number 412.317.0088 Replay Access Code 10118009 Webcast Details\nTitle: Newmont Mining Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call URL: https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1627907/904F7D83BC243A0EC3D8AE3833D5B8C7\nThe first quarter 2018 results will be available before the market opens on Thursday, April 26, 2018 on the “Investor Relations” section of the Company’s website, www.newmont.com .

Such forward-looking statements may include, without limitation: (i) estimates of future production and sales; (ii) estimates of future costs applicable to sales and all-in sustaining costs; (iii) estimates of future capital expenditures; (iv) estimates of future cost reductions and efficiencies; (v) expectations regarding the development, growth and potential of the Company’s operations, projects and investment, including, without limitation, expected returns, life of mine, commercial start and first production and upside; (vi) expectations regarding future debt repayments; and (vii) expectations regarding future free cash flow generation, liquidity and balance sheet strength. Estimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Company’s operations and projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (iii) political developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) certain exchange rate assumptions for the Australian dollar to the U.S. dollar, as well as other the exchange rates being approximately consistent with current levels; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, copper and oil; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (vii) the accuracy of our current mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates; and (viii) other assumptions noted herein. Where the Company expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the “forward-looking statements”. Other risks relating to forward looking statements in regard to the Company’s business and future performance may include, but are not limited to, gold and other metals price volatility, currency fluctuations, increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans, political and operational risks, community relations, conflict resolution and outcome of projects or oppositions and governmental regulation and judicial outcomes. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and as well as the Company’s other SEC filings. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any “forward-looking statement,” including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued “forward-looking statement” constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on “forward-looking statements” is at investors' own risk.\nInvestors are reminded that this news release should be read in conjunction with Newmont’s Form 10-Q filed on April 26, 2018 with the SEC (also available at www.newmont.com ).\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005288/en/\nNewmont Mining Corporation\nInvestor Contact\nJessica Largent, 303-837-5484\njessica.largent@newmont.com\nor\nMedia Contact\nOmar Jabara, 303-837-5114\nomar.jabara@newmont.com\nSource: Newmont Mining Corporation", "external_links": ["https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1627907/904F7D83BC243A0EC3D8AE3833D5B8C7", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newmont.com&esheet=51795442&newsitemid=20180426005288&lan=en-US&anchor=www.newmont.com&index=2&md5=295c524dc285de537bae784dd2f37692", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005288/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.on24.com%2Fwcc%2Fr%2F1627907%2F904F7D83BC243A0EC3D8AE3833D5B8C7&esheet=51795442&newsitemid=20180426005288&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.on24.com%2Fwcc%2Fr%2F1627907%2F904F7D83BC243A0EC3D8AE3833D5B8C7&index=1&md5=beec97945d6e7dc2f42317efb16a934d", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newmont.com&esheet=51795442&newsitemid=20180426005288&lan=en-US&anchor=www.newmont.com&index=3&md5=3df7087c7c9579b56b8c69f5523b1fc9"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T17:26:56.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
