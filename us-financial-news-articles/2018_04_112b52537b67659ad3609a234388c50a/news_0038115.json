First-quarter production from the PNG LNG Project, net to Oil Search, was 4.00 mmboe, the company said, while revenue for the quarter slipped to $295 million from $343.7 million.\nIn February, a magnitude 7.5 quake rocked PNG’s energy-rich interior, forcing PNG LNG project operator ExxonMobil Corp to shut down operations. Production resumed last week, about two weeks ahead of schedule.\nOil Search has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project and also resumed operations at its Kutubu field in PNG earlier this month.\nThe company said it expects 2018 unit production costs to be in the range of $10.50-$13.50 per barrel of oil, a reflecting high proportion of fixed costs in the context of the lower production outlook.
