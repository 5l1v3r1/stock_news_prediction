The group makes imaging and proximity sensor products used in the iPhone X, according to analysts.\n“We expect STMicro to benefit from a strong second-half due to continuing strength in the automotive and IoT (Internet of Things) segments, and the ramp of multiple new iPhone models with 3D sensing later in the year,” Liberum said in a note.\nSTMicro does not name its customers, but chief executive Carlo Bozotti said he expected “healthy demand” across all its products in the second-half, including smartphones.\nThe veteran STMicro boss, who is expected to make way for his deputy Jean-Marc Chery to take over in June, said demand from the automotive industry was particularly high.\n“We see a strong demand on automotive everywhere,” he said during a call with analysts. “We don’t see any sign of accumulation of inventories. Just the opposite.”\nFirst-quarter results were in line with market expectations.\nThe group’s quarterly net revenues rose 22 percent to $2.23 billion from a year earlier but fell from the last quarter of 2017 due to a seasonal smartphone dip.\nGross margin rose to 39.9 percent from 37.7 percent.\nThe group sees first-half revenues to grow by 19.8 percent from the same period a year earlier.\n$1 = 0.8193 euros Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Richard Lough, editing by Louise Havens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T13:38:24.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
