The S&P 500 lost 26.48 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,636.36 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 60.21 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,016.34.\nOil prices tumbled, with U.S. crude falling about 2 percent. as China is a large importer of U.S. crude oil.\n“The heightened possibility of an outright tariff war is conjuring up images of slowed economic growth that could curtail the strong oil demand that has helped to revive a strong pricing environment during the past couple of months,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.\nBrent crude futures fell 98 cents to $67.35 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures slid $1.21 to $62.33 a barrel.\nU.S. Treasury and euro zone government bond yields dipped as the trade spat raised the prospect of a full-blown trade war between the world’s two largest economies.\nThe yield on 10-year German government debt, the euro zone benchmark, dipped 2.7 basis points in late trading to 0.494 percent, erasing much of Thursday’s rise.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last rose 12/32 in price to push yields down to 2.7881 percent.\nThe dollar index, tracking the unit against other major currencies, fell 0.3 percent, with the euro up 0.25 percent to $1.2268. The Japanese yen firmed 0.32 percent versus the greenback at 107.07 per dollar.
