REUTERS/Rick Wilking The refiner’s chemicals joint venture with Chevron Corp had fully recovered from Hurricane Harvey and contributed to first-quarter earnings, Chief Executive Greg Garland said.\nThe U.S. shale boom has opened enormous reservoirs of cheap natural gas, a raw material for chemicals and plastics. The chemicals unit’s net income rose to $232 million from $181 million.\nHowever, earnings from the company’s main refining business fell nearly 65 percent to $91 million.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.04 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 89 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRival Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ) reported quarterly results on Thursday and attributed its better-than-expected profit to higher refining margins.\nReporting by Taenaz Shakir in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T19:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:36:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
