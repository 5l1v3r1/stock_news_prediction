She is a nun.”\nThe immigration department said she had engaged in activities not allowed under the terms of her visa.\nIt did not elaborate but Duterte had accused her of violating Philippine sovereignty with criticism of the government. A presidential spokesman recently showed journalists photos of Fox speaking at a rally by farmers and workers.\nFox said in a statement posted on her social media page she was “surprised” about the cancellation of her visa, which she had heard about from media.\n“I had thought the process was that I would have 10 days to put in a counter affidavit to answer the charges,” she said.\n“I am very sad that the decision at present is that I leave the Philippines. I may lose my right to be in the Philippines but I can never lose the learnings and beautiful memories.”\nThe left-wing activist group Bayan (Nation) condemned the expulsion order of the nun who “has done so much for Philippine farmers in her nearly three decades stay here”.\n“The Duterte regime is paranoid and afraid of an elderly nun working for human rights and social justice for the poor,” Bayan leader Renato Reyes said in a statement.\n“The deportation order of Sister Pat is indeed despicable and utterly shameful,” said Reyes.\nDuterte said last week he had ordered immigration authorities to look into Fox’s political activity.\n“It’s a violation of sovereignty,” Duterte said, accusing Fox of badmouthing his administration. “You do not have that right to criticize us. Do not insult my country.”\nThe pictures presidential spokesman Harry Roque showed journalists were of Fox speaking at a rally in Duterte’s hometown of Davao early this month.\nReporting By Manuel Mogato and Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Michael Perry, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T04:51:28.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
