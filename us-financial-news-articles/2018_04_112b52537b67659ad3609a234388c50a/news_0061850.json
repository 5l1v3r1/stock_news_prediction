We were not able to save all of them and I can’t access the house because the door can’t open,” said the mother-of-four in the town of Tana River in lower Coast region.\nHer youngest daughter clung to her neck, the girl’s feet just touching the water. Mattresses and wreckage floated by as handmade boats ferried people, animals and goods to safer ground.\nFloods have blocked major roads across central and northern Kenya and coastal areas - the route from the capital Nairobi to the main port Mombasa was under water last week.\nEight people were killed when mudslides destroyed their homes as they slept in the hilly central region of Murang’a on Friday night, said Kenya Red Cross Secretary General Abbas Gullet.\nGullet said the military and police had deployed helicopters for rescue missions but more efforts were needed.\nOutbreaks of water-borne diseases were another concern across Kenya, he added.\n“We would urge the national government to declare this a national disaster so that deliberate effort can be made and resources mobilised to help the affected people,” Gullet told reporters in the capital on Sunday.\n“We need a national disaster management fund set up.” Reporting by Joseph Akwiri; Writing by Omar Mohammed; Editing by Maggie Fick and Andrew Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:25:30.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
