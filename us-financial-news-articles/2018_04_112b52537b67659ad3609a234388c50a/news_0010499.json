The sanctions could complicate his hopes for good relations with Putin. \nRelations already had worsened recently as the United States expelled Russian diplomats over a poisoning case in Britain and imposed sanctions on Russians for alleged links to cyber attacks. \nThe latest move is aimed at seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, plus 17 senior Russian government officials. They freeze the U.S. assets of the people and companies named and forbid Americans in general from doing business with them. \nTrump has faced criticism - including from fellow Republicans - for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling. The U.S. Treasury Department said the sanctions were in response to Russia’s “malign activity,” including its actions in Ukraine, its support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war and subverting Western democracies. \nU.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of using hacking, false information and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 elections and try to ensure Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. \nPreparations for a meeting between Trump and Putin will not be affected by the sanctions, the White House said. \n“As the president has said, he wants to have a good relationship with Russia but that’s going to depend on some of the actions by the Russians,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters. Related Coverage Russia's GAZ Group says regrets inclusion on U.S. sanctions list OLIGARCHS AND ELITES \nThe sanctions could hurt the Russian economy, especially the aluminum, financial and energy sectors, and are a clear message to Putin and his inner circle of U.S. displeasure. \nOthers on the sanctions list include Viktor Vekselberg, key owner of Renova holding group who Forbes magazine ranks as Russia’s 9th richest businessman. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia. \nAlso targeted is Kirill Shamalov, a minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur. Shamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in 2013 but unconfirmed media reports say they have since split. \nThe CEO of Russia’s gas exporter Gazprom, Alexei Miller, said he was proud to be targeted by sanctions. \n“Not being included in the first list I even had some doubts - may be something is wrong (with me)? But I am finally included. This means that we are doing everything right,” Miller said through his spokesman, referring to an earlier U.S. list of Russian oligarchs. \nGazprom has relationships with major foreign companies, especially in Europe. Gazprom itself is not under sanctions, but the inclusion of Miller on the blacklist could create complicated legal dilemmas for partner companies. Although they are under European Union jurisdiction, they will not want to fall foul of any U.S. legislation \nDeripaska was not immediately available for comment but a spokesperson for his industrial group Basic Element said: “The Company regrets this development and is currently analyzing the situation with its legal advisors.” A combination of file photos show prominent Russian businessmen and officials on a U.S. sanctions list released by the U.S. Treasury Department in Washington, D.C.

REUTERS/Files \nA Cyprus-based company tied to Deripaska sued Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, two former aides to Trump’s presidential campaign, in a New York state court in January, accusing them of misappropriating more than $18.9 million earmarked for deals in Ukraine in 2008. \nThe Russian government said Moscow’s contacts with the U.S. government would not be brought to an end by the sanctions, which it nevertheless criticized. \nRussia denies interfering in the U.S. election. \nShares in some Russian companies targeted by the sanctions plummeted. EN+ Group, which manages Deripaska’s aluminum and hydropower assets, ended down 20.9 percent on the London stock exchange. \nRusal, a Russian aluminum giant fell 10 percent on the Moscow Exchange. \nDouglas Jacobson, an attorney with Jacobson Burton Kelley firm in Washington, said most international Western banks would shy away from helping the companies targeted on Friday to raise capital. “These companies now are radioactive,” he said. \nThe Treasury Department has told investors they have until May 7 to divest any stocks, bonds or other holdings of the Russian companies En+, GAZ,and Rusal. For the 12 companies named on Friday, Treasury said any contracts and activities must be terminated in 60 days. RUSSIA AND TRUMP \nBob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged Trump to set out a clear strategy. \n“Nearly 15 months into this administration, the American people and our allies are still questioning whether the president is willing to fully defend our democracy and our national security,” said Menendez, co-author of the law under which Friday’s sanctions were imposed.

But Daniel Fried, the U.S. government’s former coordinator of sanctions policy under President Barack Obama, said the sanctions list “is a solid piece of work.” \nPutin’s government has been blamed for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent living in Britain last month and the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response.
