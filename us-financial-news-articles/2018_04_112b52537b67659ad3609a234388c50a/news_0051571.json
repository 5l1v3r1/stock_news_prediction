GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said the production drop had reduced pre-tax profit by up to $800 million.\nEarlier this year, GM said 2018 profits would be flat versus 2017, but its all-new pickup trucks would boost margins later this year and in 2019. On Thursday, GM reiterated its full-year 2018 forecast for adjusted earnings in a range from $6.30 to $6.60 per share.\nThe automaker said first-quarter capital expenditures were more than $500 million higher because of investments in the pickup trucks and a family of low-cost compact vehicles under development with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( 600104.SS ).\nThe new GEM (Global Emerging Markets) vehicles, which include sedans and crossovers, will launch in 2019 in China and South America, with annual production ramping up to 2 million by late 2021, Stevens said.\nChief Executive Mary Barra said GM has “a strong franchise” in South America where the new GEM vehicles will be contributing to profits.\nStevens said the automaker has “already indicated that we will make significantly lower investments” in sedans in North America.\nFILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan, U.S., October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo On a conference call with investors, he said GM executives “look at these car lines on a weekly basis, at how to drive performance (and) cost efficiencies.”\nOn Wednesday, rival Ford said it would stop investing in most traditional passenger sedans in North America.\nGM benefited from a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, but its adjusted pre-tax margin fell to 7.2 percent from 9.5 percent a year earlier. Stevens said GM’s profit margin should hit 10 percent or higher in the second quarter and for the full year.\nGM said raw material costs were $200 million higher and it expects those costs to continue rising, which it will offset with cost cutting measures.\n“It is a more difficult environment than it was three or four months ago,” Stevens said of potential steel and aluminum tariffs announced by the Trump administration. “But we are confident we can continue to offset that.”\nGM reported net income of $1.05 billion or $1.43 per share, a drop of nearly 60 percent from $2.61 billion or $1.75 per share a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of $1.24.\nRevenue totaled $36.1 billion, down from $37.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Analysts expected revenue of $34.7 billion.\n“The year-over-year profit decline was expected due to various factors, but now we expect year-over-EPS improvement in the remaining quarters of 2018,” CFRA Research analyst Efraim Levy wrote in a client note.\nIn afternoon trade, GM shares were down 78 cents or more than 2 percent at $37.33.\nReporting by Nick Carey and Paul Lienert; Editing by Nick Zieminski, Phil Berlowitz and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:26:12.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
