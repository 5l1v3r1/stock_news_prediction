Production at Mineral Ridge slowed during the year and mining was suspended in November 2017, as the Company had mined all of its then known mineral reserves and because it was uneconomical to continue mining as a result of higher strip ratios associated with the remaining known mineral resources. As a result, the Company’s revenues from operations in 2017 declined over the previous year.\n19,045 ounces of gold were produced at the Mineral Ridge mine, compared to 36,879 ounces produced during 2016. Revenue of $27.0 million, compared to $42.8 million during 2016. Total cash cost per ounce of gold sold (1) of $1,026, compared to $881 during 2016. Mine operating earnings of $2.6 million, compared to $9.6 million during 2016. Net loss of $4.2 million ($0.03 basic and diluted per share), compared to net earnings of $0.3 million ($0.00 basic and diluted per share) during 2016. Adjusted net earnings (1) of $0.4 million ($0.00 basic and diluted per share), compared to $6.5 million ($0.03 basic and diluted per share) during 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (1) of $2.8 million ($0.01 basic and diluted per share), compared to $9.6 million ($0.05 basic and diluted per share) million during 2016. On January 4, 2018, the Company announced the results of an updated feasibility study (“Updated Feasibility Study and National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report: Mineral Ridge Project”, with an effective date of January 2, 2018 prepared by Novus Engineering Inc.) for the recovery of gold and silver from processed heap leach materials and also additional open-pit- able mineral reserves at its Mineral Ridge property.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 (“Q4”) HIGHLIGHTS\n3,709 ounces of gold were produced at the Mineral Ridge mine during Q4 of 2017, compared to 8,301 ounces during Q4 of 2016. Revenue of $4.8 million, compared to $7.6 million during Q4 of 2016. Total cash cost per ounce of gold sold(1) of $1,188 compared to $873 during Q4 of 2016. Mine operating earnings of $0.1 million compared to $1.5 million during Q4 of 2016. Net loss of $1.2 million ($0.01 basic and diluted per share), compared to net loss of $4.3 million ($0.03 basic and diluted per share) during Q4 of 2016. Adjusted net loss (1) of $0.6 million ($0.00 basic and diluted per share) compared to adjusted net earnings of $0.8 million ($0.00 basic and diluted per share) for Q4 of 2016.

Going Concern\nThe Company’s only source of revenue, the 70% owned Mineral Ridge mine, suspended mining in November 2017 as the Company had mined all of its then known mineral reserves and because it was uneconomical to continue mining as a result of higher strip ratios associated with the remaining known mineral resources. Management expects to generate limited revenues from residual but diminishing gold recoveries from the leach pads until approximately July 2018. As a result, the Company’s revenues from operations have been and continue to be adversely affected, and cash flow from operations will soon be insufficient to support the Company. In addition, the principal of $6.0 million of the Company’s long-term debt matures in August 2018. In light of this situation, the Company does not expect that it will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations to continue as a going concern in the near future. The Company will need to raise additional capital in the coming months in order to support its operations and to settle its long-term debt.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s main focus is to raise sufficient financing to improve its financial position and to re-finance its long-term debt obligations and as such allow it to proceed with the construction of a new processing facility at Mineral Ridge with a view to process heap leach materials and additional open-pit mineral reserves.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nThe discussion of financial results in this press release includes reference to Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Total cash cost per ounce of gold sold which are non-IFRS measures. The Company provides these measures as additional information regarding the Company's financial results and performance. Please refer to the Company's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017 for definitions of these terms and a reconciliation of these measures to reported International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) results.\nAbout Scorpio Gold Corporation\nScorpio Gold holds a 70% interest in the Mineral Ridge gold mining operation located in Esmeralda County, Nevada with joint venture partner Elevon, LLC (30%).
