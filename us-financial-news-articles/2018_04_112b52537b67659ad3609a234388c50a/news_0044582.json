I will be personally accountable for the consequences of this vote,” he added.\n$1 = 0.8125 euros Reporting by Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta/Maya Nikolaeva\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:13:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
