That currently stands at roughly 3 billion euros, and Springer Nature is targeting a leverage of 3.5 times EBITDA after the IPO.\nSpringer Nature and other publishers earlier this month agreed to work together on sharing articles while protecting the rights of authors and publishers in a deal with Researchgate, an online collaboration platform dubbed ‘Facebook for scientists’.\nReporting by Arno Schuetze and Emma Thomasson; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T23:43:04.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
