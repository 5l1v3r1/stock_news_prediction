GetBack debuted in the stock market in July last year, attracting investors with its aggressive growth strategy.\nThe firm bought up large portfolios of distressed debt at much higher prices than its competitors at a time of robust economic growth in Poland, coupled by record low unemployment and quickly rising wages.\nSeveral respected brokerages had a ‘buy’ recommendation on GetBack shares until late last year.\nThe mBank DM brokerage ( MBK.WA ), indirectly controlled by Germany’s Commerzbank, had recommended buying GetBack shares in November last year, praising the company’s “above average effectiveness” and setting a target price of 33.4 zlotys. The recommendation was suspended on Apr. 16.\nThe shares of GetBack have since plunged to 3.75 zlotys and trading was indefinitely suspended by the regulator last week.\nIn February this year, GetBack said that rating agency S&P Global changed the outlook on the firm’s B rating to ‘positive’, citing the growth outlook. S&P has since cut the outlook to negative and suspended the rating altogether.\nGetBack Chief Executive Konrad Kakolewski was dismissed earlier this month.\nThe troubles of GetBack, which is controlled by the private equity funds led by Abris Capital Partners, have dragged down shares of other listed firms, including investment fund Quercus TFI ( QRS.WA ).\nGetBack had been planning share issues worth up to 70 percent of existing capital and said last week the new board was aiming to restore investors’ trust in the company.\n($1 = 3.4898 zlotys)\nReporting by Marcin Goettig; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:18:43.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
