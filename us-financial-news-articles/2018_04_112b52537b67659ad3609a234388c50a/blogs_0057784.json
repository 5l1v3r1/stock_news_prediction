This month, the global benchmark hit highs above $75, a level last seen in late 2014.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude finished Friday's session down 9 cents at $68.10 a barrel.\nBrent turned in a weekly gain of nearly 1 percent, while WTI fell by almost half a percent on the week.\nshow chapters Volatile day for crude 1:17 PM ET Thu, 26 April 2018 | 01:53 U.S. President Donald Trump will decide by May 12 whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of an agreement with six other world powers over Tehran's nuclear program. The renewed sanctions would likely dampen Iranian oil exports, disrupting global oil supply.\n\"That's an issue that is more political in nature that could have a shock in the market,\" said Mark Watkins, a regional investment manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Park City, Utah.\n\"It's one of those wildcards that's out there because if the sanctions do happen, there's going to be oil that comes off the market.\"\nBrent has risen by around 6.5 percent this month.

U.S. crude's discount to Brent hit its widest since Dec. 28 at $6.74 a barrel.\nSurging U.S. production, which rose to 10.59 million barrels per day last week, has encouraged record-high U.S. exports.\nU.S. drillers added five oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 825, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric's Baker Hughes energy services firm said.\nBut while U.S. producers are accelerating shale drilling in areas in the United States, higher production has not necessarily translated into stronger refining results for some oil companies.\nWeak refining margins hurt two of the world's largest integrated energy companies for the second consecutive quarter, although Chevron's oil production gains in the first quarter outshone its larger rival Exxon Mobil .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T07:22:58.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
