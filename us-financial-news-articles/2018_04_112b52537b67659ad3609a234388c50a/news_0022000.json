Although Banco do Brasil is the largest listed lender in the country, rival Itaú Unibanco Holding SA had 29,2 million credit card holders. \nLast year, credit card transactions amounted to 842.6 billion, up 12.4 percent from 2016, according to card industry group ABECS. \nRegarding defaults in loans to consumers, Labuto said that indicators “behaved well” during the first quarter.
