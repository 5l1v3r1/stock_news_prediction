(NYSE:CNHI / MI:CNHI) today announced consolidated revenues of $6,773 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net sales of Industrial Activities were $6,300 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 19% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Net income was $202 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted net income was $204 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $55 million in the first quarter of 2017, with an adjusted diluted EPS of $0.14 ($0.04 in the first quarter of 2017).\nAdjusted EBITDA of Industrial Activities was up 40% to $547 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $391 million for the first quarter of 2017, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.7%, up 1.3 percentage points (\"p.p.\") compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome taxes were $63 million in the first quarter of 2018 ($51 million in the first quarter of 2017). Adjusted income taxes (1)(2) for the first quarter of 2018 were $64 million ($54 million in the first quarter of 2017). The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) (1)(2) of 26% (59% in the first quarter of 2017) improved as a result of a favorable geographic mix of earnings, and the lower U.S. tax rate. For the full year 2018, the Company updates its expectation of an adjusted ETR of approximately 30%.\nNet industrial debt of $1.9 billion at March 31, 2018 increased by $1.0 billion from December 31, 2017, as a result of normal seasonality in working capital in the first quarter. Total debt of $24.7 billion at March 31, 2018, was down $1.2 billion compared to December 31, 2017 primarily as a result of the repayment at maturity of the remaining outstanding CNH Industrial Finance Europe S.A. 6.25% Notes of approximately $1 billion. At March 31, 2018, available liquidity (1)(2) was $7.6 billion, down $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 6.8 million of its common shares for a total amount of $90 million under the buy - back program authorized by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (\"AGM\") held on April 14, 2017. The program has been reauthorized and increased to $700 million from $300 million. Furthermore, in April 2018, the Company repaid at maturity the outstanding $600 million of the CNH Industrial Capital LLC 3.625% Notes from available cash.\nOn April 16, 2018, the Company announced that, as a consequence of a favorable judgment issued by the United States Supreme Court in February 2018, the Company determined to modify the healthcare benefits (the \"Benefits\") provided to certain of the Company's U.S. retirees to make them consistent with the Benefits provided to current eligible CNH Industrial retirees who had been represented by the UAW Union. These Benefits modifications are estimated to result in a reduction of the plan liability by approximately $500 million to $550 million in the second quarter of 2018.\nSegment Results\nCNH INDUSTRIAL\nRevenues by Segment ($ million) Three Months ended March 31, 2018 2017 % change % change excl.

Refer to the specific table in the \"Other Supplemental Financial Information\" section of this press release for the reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measure and the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Agricultural Equipment 's net sales increased 15% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 (up 11% on a constant currency basis). The increase was the result of higher sales volumes and positive net price realization. Industry demand was overall flat, with strong industry volume in APAC and lower demand in LATAM.\nAdjusted EBIT was $186 million in the first quarter of 2018 ($115 million in the first quarter of 2017). Adjusted EBIT margin increased 2.1 p.p. to 7.2% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was due to favorable volume, better mix, and higher production levels, with NAFTA row crop production matching retail demand, as a result of an achieved balanced inventory of used equipment. Price realization, net of a negative foreign exchange transaction impact, represented 2.5% of revenues, and was partially offset by raw material cost increases and higher overhead costs. The Company continues to invest in its product development program for precision farming and compliance with Stage V emissions requirements.\nConstruction Equipment 's net sales increased 36% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 (up 32% on a constant currency basis), as a result of a solid rebound in worldwide demand and market share gains across most regions.\nAdjusted EBIT achieved breakeven in the first quarter of 2018 from a negative adjusted EBIT of $31 million in the first quarter of 2017. Results were favorably impacted by higher sales volume due to improved end-user demand, as well as the related 30% increase in production. Pricing conditions remain favorable, more than offsetting unfavorable foreign exchange impact and raw material cost increases. The order book is up approximately 20% relative to the prior year period.\nCommercial Vehicles ' net sales increased 17% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 (up 5% on a constant currency basis), primarily as a result of higher industry volumes in the light commercial vehicle market in Europe. Net sales increased in APAC and were flat in LATAM.\nAdjusted EBIT was $49 million for the first quarter of 2018 (up from $17 million in the first quarter of 2017). Adjusted EBIT margin increased 1.2 p.p. to 2.0% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was mainly due to favorable end-user demand in light commercial vehicles, improved pricing and manufacturing efficiencies, partially offset by increased spending in new product development initiatives.\nPowertrain 's net sales increased 19% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017 (up 5% on a constant currency basis), as a result of higher sales volume in engine applications. Sales to external customers accounted for 48% of total net sales (45% in the first quarter of 2017).\nAdjusted EBIT was $95 million for the first quarter of 2018, a $21 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2017, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 8.0%, up 0.6 p.p. compared to the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the higher volumes and manufacturing efficiencies.\nFinancial Services ' revenues totaled $502 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, retail loan originations (including unconsolidated joint ventures) were $2.2 billion, up $0.3 billion compared to the first quarter of 2017. The managed portfolio (including unconsolidated joint ventures) was $26.5 billion as of March 31, 2018 (of which retail was 62% and wholesale 38%), up $1.8 billion compared to March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the managed portfolio increased $0.5 billion compared to the same period in 2017.\nNet income was $103 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $16 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a better performance in EMEA and LATAM, and due to the lower U.S. tax rate.\n2018 Outlook (1)\nAs a result of the stronger than anticipated results in the first quarter of 2018 and positive developments in end-user demand, CNH Industrial is increasing its net sales and adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year 2018 to the upper-end of its range as follows:\nNet sales of Industrial Activities of approximately $28 billion; Adjusted diluted EPS (2) of $0.65 to $0.67; Net industrial debt at the end of 2018 unchanged at between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion.\nAbout CNH Industrial\nCNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE: CNHI /MI: CNHI) is a global leader in the capital goods sector with established industrial experience, a wide range of products and a worldwide presence. Each of the individual brands belonging to the Company is a major international force in its specific industrial sector: Case IH, New Holland Agriculture and STEYR for tractors and agricultural machinery; CASE and New Holland Construction for earth moving equipment; IVECO for commercial vehicles; IVECO BUS and Heuliez Bus for buses and coaches; IVECO ASTRA for quarry and construction vehicles; Magirus for firefighting vehicles; Iveco Defence Vehicles for defence and civil protection; and FPT Industrial for engines and transmissions. More information can be found on the corporate website: www.cnhindustrial.com\nAbout this Press Release\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted, on a retrospective basis, updated FASB accounting standards for revenue recognition (ASC 606), retirement benefits accounting (ASU 2017-07) and cash flow presentation (ASU 2016-18). 2017 figures presented in this press release have been recast to reflect the adoption of such updated accounting standards.\nFurthermore, concurrently with the change in accounting standards, the Company reviewed the metrics on which the operating segments will be assessed. Effective January 1, 2018, the Chief Operating Decision Maker began to assess segment performance and make decisions about resource allocation based upon Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA.\nAs such, we have introduced Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA as new non-GAAP measures in our earnings releases this year. These measures replaced our previous Operating Profit non-GAAP measure. The Company believes Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA more fully reflect segment and consolidated profitability. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" for information about these measures, including how CNH Industrial calculates them.\nOn April 16, 2018, the Company published a presentation and a webcast to summarize the key impacts on its prior periods' consolidated financial statements deriving from the adoption of the new accounting standards, as well as the introduction of the new metrics Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdditional Information\nToday, at 3:30 p.m. CEST / 2:30 p.m. BST / 9:30 a.m. EDT, management will hold a conference call to present 2018 first quarter results to financial analysts and institutional investors. The call can be followed live online at: http://bit.ly/CNH_Industrial_Q1_2018 and a recording will be available later on the Company's website ( www.cnhindustrial.com ). A presentation will be made available on the CNH Industrial website prior to the call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nCNH Industrial monitors its operations through the use of several non-GAAP financial measures. CNH Industrial's management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful and relevant information regarding its results and allow management and investors to assess CNH Industrial's and our segments' operating trends, financial performance and financial position. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to identify operational trends, as well as make decisions regarding future spending, resource allocations and other operational decisions as they provide additional transparency with respect to our and our business segments' core operations. These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning presented in U.S. GAAP or EU-IFRS and are unlikely to be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies due to potential differences between the companies in calculations. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and they should not be considered as substitutes for measures of financial performance and financial position as prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and/or EU-IFRS.\nCNH Industrial non-GAAP financial measures are defined as follows:\nAdjusted EBIT under U.S. GAAP: is defined as net income (loss) before income taxes, interest expenses of Industrial Activities, net, restructuring expenses, the finance and non-service component of pension and other post-employment benefit costs, foreign exchange gains/(losses), and certain non-recurring items. In particular, non-recurring items are specifically disclosed items that management considers rare or discrete events that are infrequent in nature and not reflective of on-going operational activities. Adjusted EBITDA under U.S. GAAP: is defined as Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortization (including on assets sold under operating leases and assets sold under buy-back commitments). Adjusted EBIT under EU-IFRS: is defined as profit/(loss) before taxes, financial income/(expense) of Industrial Activities, restructuring costs, and certain non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA under EU-IFRS: is defined as Adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortization (including on assets sold under operating leases and assets sold under buy-back commitments). Adjusted Net Income (Loss): is defined as net income (loss), less restructuring charges and non-recurring items, after tax. Adjusted Diluted EPS: is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income (loss) attributable to CNH Industrial N.V. by a weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period that takes into consideration potential common shares outstanding deriving from the CNH Industrial share-based payment awards, when inclusion is not anti-dilutive. When we provide guidance for adjusted diluted EPS, we do not provide guidance on an earnings per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end. Adjusted Income Taxes: is defined as income taxes less the tax effect of restructuring expenses and non-recurring items and non-recurring tax charges. Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Adjusted ETR): is computed by dividing a) adjusted income taxes by b) income (loss) before income taxes and equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, less restructuring expenses and non-recurring items. Net Debt and Net Debt of Industrial Activities (or Net Industrial Debt): Net Debt is defined as total debt less intersegment notes receivable, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and derivative hedging debt. CNH Industrial provides the reconciliation of Net Debt to Total Debt, which is the most directly comparable measure included in the consolidated balance sheets. Due to different sources of cash flows used for the repayment of the debt between Industrial Activities and Financial Services (by cash from operations for Industrial Activities and by collection of financing receivables for Financial Services), management separately evaluates the cash flow performance of Industrial Activities using Net Debt of Industrial Activities. Available Liquidity: is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash and undrawn committed facilities. Change excl. FX or Constant Currency: CNH Industrial discusses the fluctuations in revenues on a constant currency basis by applying the prior year average exchange rates to current year's revenues expressed in local currency in order to eliminate the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe tables attached to this press release provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nForward-looking statements\nAll statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this earning release including statements regarding our competitive strengths; business strategy; future financial position or operating results; budgets; projections with respect to revenue, income, earnings (or loss) per share, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial items; costs; and plans and objectives of management regarding operations and products, are forward-looking statements.
