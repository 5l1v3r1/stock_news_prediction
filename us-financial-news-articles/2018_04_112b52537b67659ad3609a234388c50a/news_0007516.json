That business foundered as the U.S. freight market stalled out in late 2015 and 2016.\nCeladon hasn’t publicly reported earnings results since last year, when the company said financial statements covering more than a year of its operations couldn’t be relied on after its auditor withdrew its reports for that period . The company has been negotiating with its lenders as a new executive team pursues a refinancing plan to boost liquidity.\nTrading in Celadon’s stock was halted after the company announced late Monday it would be unable to resolve the reporting delinquencies by a May 2 deadline. The stock, which reached close to $30 a share just more than three years ago, closed at $3.45 per share on Monday.\nChief Executive Paul Svindland, who joined the company last year, said in an interview Tuesday he was “disappointed” to learn the accounting problems extended back further than previously thought, but said the company was committed to accurate and transparent financial reporting.\nCeladon confirmed in October it was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMr. Svindland said Tuesday the company was “doing everything possible to cooperate with the SEC.”\nThe company has since disposed of the leasing division at the root of the accounting issues, Mr. Svindland said, and Celadon now is focused on improving its core truckload business. “The business that created the problems, we are now out of,” he said.\nAlso in Logistics\nMaritime Regulator Seeks to Overcome Deep Divisions on Shipping Emissions April 3, 2018 Trucker Roadrunner Says New Financial Reports on Track April 2, 2018 Teamsters, Trucker ABF Freight Reach Tentative Contract Deal March 29, 2018 ACLU Claims Maritime Union Discriminates Against Pregnant Workers March 29, 2018 Over the past year, Celadon has scaled back its domestic truckload division’s fleet by about 20% and it is reducing the number of lanes it serves from nearly 5,000 a year ago to about 1,000, said Thom Albrecht, Celadon’s chief financial and strategy officer.\nThe additional restatements are expected to result in multi-million-dollar adjustments to Celadon’s balance sheet over three and a half years. The projected changes include a roughly $20 million write-down on equipment that was bought and sold at above market prices, as well as a reduction in pre-tax net income of between $200 million to $250 million over the three years ending June 30, 2016.\nThe company is also reviewing the impact for the first two quarters of fiscal 2017.\n“The cumulative effect of the adjustments, along with operating losses and other expenses since the Company’s last filed financial reports, are expected to reduce its reported stockholders’ equity materially,” Celadon said in its statement issued Monday after market close.\nMr. Svindland said the carrier was working with its lenders on a new $100-million asset-based revolving credit facility. The parties are also reviewing a refinancing proposal received March 31 that includes about $200 million of term debt.\nThe carrier had about $380.5 million in total debt as of December 2016, the latest date for which figures are available, and about $136.7 million in liquidity, according to FactSet.\nMr. Svindland declined to disclose Celadon’s current financial state, but said the firm is “comfortable with our liquidity.”\nCeladon has engaged advisers during its credit negotiations with the banks to help it comply with requirements including weekly updates on the business, and to identify potential outside lenders, Mr. Albrecht said.\nMr. Svindland said restructuring through a bankruptcy proceeding is “not an option.”\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T07:06:03.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
