It doesn’t change the story in terms of the risks in my view.”\n* Shares of telecommunications company Rogers Communications jumped 5.3 percent and was the biggest percentage gainer on the TSX after at least two brokerages raised their price target on the stock.\n* The energy sector, which accounts for close to one-fifth of the index’s weight, was down 1.1 percent tracking a dip in prices of oil, one of Canada’s major exports.\n* Enbridge was down 1.2 percent, Canadian Natural Resources fell 1.5 percent and Canadian Natural Resources lost 2 percent.\n* Oil prices fell after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized OPEC and said oil prices were artificially high.\n* The materials sector, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, declined 0.4 percent as losses in gold producers weighed.\n* Spot gold was down 0.6 percent at $1,336.57 an ounce.\n* The TSX posted one new 52-week high and two new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were five new 52-week highs and four new lows.\n* Advantage Oil & Gas fell 4.9 percent and was the largest decliner on the index after the oil and gas producer lowered its second-quarter natural gas production forecast.\n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, Baytex Energy Co and Crescent Pnt.\n* Volume on the TSX index was 21.89 million shares while the total volume on Friday was 32.41 million shares.
