REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo \nThe leadership of the Kovo union, which represents industrial workers, plans to vote on the proposal next Wednesday, which would cover the period from April 1, 2018 to the end of March 2019, although that is seen as a formality. The offer also includes increases in bonuses and incentives. \nCzech wages have been rising rapidly across sectors, putting pressure on employers, following strong economic growth in recent years and a fall in unemployment to its lowest level in two decades. \nSkoda, the country’s biggest exporter, has blossomed under nearly 30 years of Volkswagen ownership to become one of the group’s profit drivers, even beating operating margins at luxury brands Audi ( NSUG.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) last year.
