REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nA blast of Siberian cold dubbed “the Beast from the East” grounded planes, halted public transport and shut businesses in Ireland for two to three days at the beginning of last month. \nThe Investec Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to 56.5 from 57.2 in February, although the survey’s authors cautioned against reading too much into the slowdown given the long-departed weather issues. \nThe index has averaged 58.4 for the last 12 months and has remained above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction since August 2012, when Ireland was halfway through a three-year financial bailout. \nHowever, the March survey showed that margins are being squeezed. Input costs continued to rise as a result of higher prices for materials and increased staff costs, although the rate of inflation in March eased to a six-month low. \n“Despite the rate of growth in input costs having moderated to a six-month low, it remains pronounced,” Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O’Sullivan said. \n“Companies are responding to this by upping output prices (as they have consistently done on a monthly basis throughout the past four years), but despite this the profitability index tumbled to a four month low in March.” \nThe survey also showed that employment continued to rise at a slower pace, with the rate of job creation easing for the third successive month. The pace of growth was the weakest since 2013. \n“Taken together with the Investec Manufacturing PMI report from earlier this week, the narrative appears to be one of a slight moderation in growth across much of the private sector in Q1 2018,” O’Sullivan said. \n“However, given the favourable economic backdrop we would expect to see a pick-up in activity as the year progresses.” Reporting by Graham Fahy, editing by Padraic Halpin, Larry King", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T08:14:25.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
