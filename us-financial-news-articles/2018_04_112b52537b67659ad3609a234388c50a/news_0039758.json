CDRs would be similar to American depositary receipts which, while not technically shares, are certificates that allow investors to hold shares listed elsewhere. \n“(On) CDRs, we are very open to that because our customers, if they have an opportunity to become our shareholder, it’s going to be a win-win for both our customers as well as Ctrip,” Sun said in an interview. \n“We are open and welcome the opportunity if there is (one).” \nShe declined to say when such an offering might take place as CDR guidelines had yet to be finalised. \nChinese e-commerce firm Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is planning CDR listing for as early as mid-year, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported last month, citing a person with knowledge of the matter. CHINA TRAVEL BOOM \nRiding a wave of Chinese tourism, the Shanghai-based company has been investing overseas though Sun said the focus for now would be organic growth, especially targeting Chinese travellers whose numbers are soaring along with rising incomes. \nOn Friday, Ctrip announced a tie-up with French hotel group Accor SA to boost offerings to their joint clientele. In November, Ctrip acquired Skyscanner for $1.7 billion and picked up website Trip.com, which it relaunched as the offshore version of Ctrip.com. \nSun said the company’s investment focus was threefold: technology, enhancing customer service, and product development. \nShe said Ctrip’s strongest product was international air tickets. “We are moving very quickly not only in Asia, but also in Russia, Australia, New Zealand and Europe.” \nSun said Ctrip had not seen much impact on business from trade friction between China and the United States, a popular travel destination for Chinese tourists. \n“From a commercial perspective, it’s always good to have a globalised market and globalised strategy,” she said.
