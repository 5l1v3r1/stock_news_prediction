The current research at Technion is testing fractionated molecular components from the cannabis plant against various cancer types in vitro and in preclinical models.\nThe two issued U.S. patents No. 9,044,390 and 9,186,386 cover the extraction and fractioning of bioactive cannabinoid molecules from the cannabis plant, allowing the integration of these molecules into a dosage form, such as CUREfilm™, the most advanced oral thin film on the market today.\nThe patent inventor, Gary Speier, is a registered patent attorney with Carlson Caspers and an advisor to CURE. Speier provides counsel to grow CURE’s IP portfolio on a broad range of patent-related matters such as valuations, IP due diligence, freedom-to-operate clearance reviews and opinions relating to infringement and validity, and patent procurement and patent prosecution strategies.\nAbout CURE Pharmaceutical\nCURE Pharmaceutical is a vertically integrated drug delivery and development company committed to improving drug efficacy, safety and the patient experience through its proprietary drug dosage forms and delivery systems.
