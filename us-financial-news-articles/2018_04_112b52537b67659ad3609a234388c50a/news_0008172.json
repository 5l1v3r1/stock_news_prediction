Schabir Shaikh, his former financial adviser, was found guilty and jailed in 2005 for trying to solicit bribes for Zuma from a French arms company.\nCharges against Zuma relating to the arms deal were filed but then set aside by the NPA shortly before he successfully ran for president in 2009. The charges were re-instated in 2016.\nSince his election nine years ago, his opponents have fought a lengthy legal battle to have the charges reinstated. Zuma countered with his own legal challenges.
