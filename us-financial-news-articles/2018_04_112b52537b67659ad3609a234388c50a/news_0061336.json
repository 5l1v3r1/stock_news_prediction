His colleague survived the attack.\nJuarez was just a few months from completing 20 years with Pemex, the company said in a statement, and had most recently worked combating the fuel theft that costs Pemex more than $1 billion a year.\nDrug cartels seeking to diversify income streams have preyed on Pemex, making fuel theft one of Mexico’s most pressing security issues.\nThe head of security at one of Mexico’s six state-run oil refineries was shot to death in January.
