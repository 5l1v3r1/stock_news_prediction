REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo \nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB), which coordinates financial regulation for the Group of 20 Economies (G20), said misconduct had cost banks $320 billion (£227.6 billion) in the last decade, with firms rather than individuals usually footing the bill. \nBanks have been hit by hefty fines for trying to rig the Libor interest rate benchmark and foreign currency markets, with relatively few individuals punished. \n“It is for firms and authorities to determine how best to address conduct issues in their jurisdictions,” the FSB said in its report for G20 central bankers and finance ministers meeting in Washington on Friday. \nIt sets out 19 steps that regulators and financial firms can take to tackle the causes and consequences of misconduct. \n“Rather than creating an international standard or adopting a prescriptive approach, the FSB is offering this toolkit as a set of options based on the shared experience and diversity of perspective of FSB members in dealing with misconduct issues.” \nThe FSB said holding individuals accountable for their actions could help improve standards. \n“Such an approach could also support cultural change at firms – for instance, by dispelling notions that fines are the cost of doing business,” the FSB said. \nBritain has introduced a “senior managers regime” which maps out who is responsible for which core functions at a bank or insurer, making it easier for regulators to pinpoint blame when things go wrong. \nBut it has proved controversial, with some people put off from becoming senior officials at banks. \nThe toolkit also looks at ways to avoid hiring “rolling bad apples” or people involved in misconduct who move jobs to cover their tracks. \nIt recommends improving how candidates are interviewed and making better background checks. \nIt also looks at how misconduct is “normalised” in some firms due to misplaced group loyalty and managers setting unrealistic goals.
