This will be added to the 4,870 rigs that HashChain has already purchased and committed pending its recent announcement of the acquisition of a company with 1,000 Rigs, bringing total rigs to 9,870, which is the equivalent of approximately 15 megawatts.\nBased on 770 Rigs currently operating, the Company mined 27.92 Bitcoins in 38 days of operations, equivalent of .735 Bitcoin per day and has not exchanged any Bitcoin into Fiat to date.
