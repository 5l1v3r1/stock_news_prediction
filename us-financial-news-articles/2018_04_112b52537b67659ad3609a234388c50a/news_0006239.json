REUTERS/Henry Nicholls Expected to fetch between $3.7 and 5.3 million, the 6.1 carat, dark grey-blue stone from the Golconda diamond mines of India was first given to Elisabeth Farnese, daughter of the Duke of Parma, in 1715 when she married Philip V of Spain.\nIt was passed down through more than seven generations and, as their descendants married into other European families, it traveled from Spain to France, Italy and Austria.\n“All this time, it was hidden away in a royal jewelry box. Except for close relatives, and of course the family jewelers, no one knew about its existence,” Sotheby’s said.\nThe stone will appear in Sotheby’s Geneva Jewellery sale on 15 May.\nReporting by Olive Enokido-Lineham; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T15:19:03.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
