This was the first time it had gone against me and I know Sergio had suffered that many times. So it was just his time.” \nRose is one of the favourites to win the first major of the year, which begins on Thursday, and he would not downplay his chances. \nHe has surged up to fifth in the world rankings on the back of three titles in his past 11 events and racked up a staggering run of consistency. Before Sunday’s tied-52 finish at the Houston Open, Rose had posted 13 top-10 finished in 15 starts. \nWhen asked if experiences of a year ago make him more or less likely before his career ends, he replied: “More likely, definitely. \n“Look at how the runners-up have done in recent years. Adam Scott finished runner-up and went on to win. Jordan Spieth was runner-up the year before he won. \n“When I go to Augusta I feel so good there. It hasn’t dampened my enthusiasm for being there. I really love the place.” (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T09:14:13.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
