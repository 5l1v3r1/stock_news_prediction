(\"NICE\"). Mattersight provides behavioral analytics services in the United States.\nOn April 26, 2018, Mattersight announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement with NICE. Under the terms of the agreement, NICE will launch a tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Mattersight's common stock, pursuant to which holders of Mattersight's common stock will receive $2.70 per common share in cash.\nThe investigation concerns whether the Mattersight board failed to satisfy its duties to the Company shareholders, including whether the board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the board obtained the best price possible for Mattersight shares of common stock. Nationally recognized Johnson Fistel is investigating whether the proposed deal represents adequate consideration, especially given one Wall Street analyst has a $5.50 price target on the stock.\nIf you are a shareholder of Mattersight and believe the proposed buyout price is too low or you're interested in learning more about the investigation or your legal rights and remedies, please contact lead analyst Jim Baker ( jimb@johnsonfistel.com ) at 619-814-4471 .
