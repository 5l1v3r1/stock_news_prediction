After gaining the puck deep in the offensive zone, he banked home a shot off Senators goalie Craig Anderson during the scramble for his 29th goal of the year.\nJake Guentzel doubled the lead with an eerily similar goal at 7:31 of the middle frame. Justin Schultz’s point shot was partially blocked, but Guentzel was on the spot for the loose puck and backhanded a sharp-angled offering that hit Anderson and went into the cage.\nKessel joined the offensive onslaught seven minutes into the third period by pouncing on a rebound for his 34th goal of the season and career-high 92nd point, and then Patric Hornqvist rounded out the scoring with three minutes remaining, netting his 29th tally of the season. Hornqvist has collected five goals in as many games and has nine points (6-3-9) in a seven-game point streak.\nPittsburgh’s opposition in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs is yet to be determined, with the Columbus Blue Jackets, New Jersey Devils and Philadelphia Flyers all possible to finish third in the division.\nAnderson made 19 saves for the Senators, who were blanked for the 10th time this season.\nOttawa will finish 30th in the NHL ahead of only the Buffalo Sabres, who recently secured the worst record in the league.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T10:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:04:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
