Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports America’s WBC heavyweight world champion Wilder challenged WBA Super, IBF, IBO and WBO champion Joshua to the fight with both boxers guaranteed a 50-50 money split. Hearn, however, said his team needs to be convinced the money exists.\n“It’s not a case of we sign the contract and they go and raise the money. If you’ve got it - show us it and then we can talk,” Hearn, who is in New York for a Matchroom Boxing USA card and will meet Wilder’s representatives on Friday, said.\nWilder’s promoter Shelly Finkel had earlier given Joshua until midnight on Thursday to respond to the offer.\nFILE PHOTO: Boxing - Anthony Joshua vs Joseph Parker - World Heavyweight Title Unification Fight - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 31, 2018 Anthony Joshua celebrates after winning the fight Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge “I spoke to AJ, he knows the situation but we want to know if it’s real,” Hearn added. “We want to see the money and know where it is. There is a real strong chance this fight could happen - we’re not looking to be difficult.”\nHowever, Finkel said the money was in place. “If he accepts it, it will be there. Al Haymon and I have never not delivered what we’ve offered,” he said.\nJoshua last month moved a step closer to becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world after beating New Zealand’s Joseph Parker in their title unification bout to improve his record to 21-0.\nThe 2012 Olympic champion added Parker’s WBO belt to his own collection.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:06:57.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
