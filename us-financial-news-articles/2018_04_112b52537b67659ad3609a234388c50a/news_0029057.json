(OTCQX: GRWG), (\"GrowGen\" or the \"Company\"), one of the largest specialty retail hydroponic and organic gardening store chains, today announced that it has purchased all the assets of Superior Growers Supply (SGS).

With over 20,000 sq. ft. of warehouse and retail space, SGS is a destination location, servicing growers in the state of Michigan. Headquartered in Michigan, SGS has retail stores in Lansing, South Lansing, and Livonia, with distribution facilities in the Lansing area.\nGrowGeneration Michigan\nGrowGen continues the execution of its acquisition plans to acquire the leading hydroponic stores in key markets. In 2017, Michigan generated approximately $711 million in medical marijuana sales a year and $21 million in tax revenue. If full legalization happens, that number is expected to surpass $1 billion in sales a year. Roughly 277,000 patients are registered with the state to grow their own cannabis or obtain it from 43,000 registered caregivers who can supply a limited number of people. The Michigan patient count is only 2 nd to California.\nGrowGen CEO Comments:\nCommenting on GrowGen 's purchase of Superior Growers Supply, Darren Lampert, Co-Founder and CEO, said , \"SGS, one of the original hydroponic retailers, strongly positions GrowGen in the Michigan market and will add $4 Million to our top line revenue to our consolidated financial statements. Adding the team at SGS and its iconic stores, is a major win for GrowGen's portfolio. We have a strong acquisition pipeline and look forward to continuing our rapid expansion plans in 2018.\"\nSGS CEO Comments:\nCommenting on the sale of SGS, Jeffrey Gibson, CEO and Founder said, \"In November of 1983, Superior Growers Supply (SGS) started as a mail order business operating out of a small barn. The first, and only, product available for sale was a 1000-watt metal halide light kit. Since that time SGS has become one of the leading retail hydroponic and indoor gardening supply merchants in the USA. We feel GrowGen is the company to continue our long-standing tradition of serving the growers in the Michigan market.\"\nAbout GrowGeneration Corp. :\nGrowGeneration Corp.
