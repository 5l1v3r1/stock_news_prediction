Pretax operating income dropped across most segments in this year's first quarter. On the other hand, post-tax operating income rose as it benefited from lower corporate income tax rates. Net income was affected by the same factor, as well as the inclusion of unrealized fair-value investment gains (losses) on equity securities for the first time beginning in 2018. As a consequence, year-over-year post-tax operating and net income are not fully comparable among the periods reported upon. The table following the Financial Highlights shows the impact of these factors on period-to-period comparisons.\nFinancial Highlights (a)\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nOperating revenues:\nGeneral insurance\n$\n904.8\n$\n849.0\n6.6%\nTitle insurance\n523.6\n527.8\n-0.8\nCorporate and other\n11.6\n11.9\n-2.2\nSubtotal\n1,440.1\n1,388.8\n3.7\nRFIG run-off business\n26.7\n41.1\n-35.0\nTotal\n$\n1,466.8\n$\n1,429.9\n2.6%\nPretax operating income (loss):\nGeneral insurance\n$\n83.3\n$\n93.7\n-11.1%\nTitle insurance\n29.5\n40.4\n-27.0\nCorporate and other\n6.5\n1.1\nN/M\nSubtotal\n119.4\n135.3\n-11.8\nRFIG run-off business\n10.9\n14.5\n-24.2\nTotal\n130.4\n149.8\n-13.0%\nPretax investment gains (losses):\nRealized from actual sale transactions\n15.5\n14.8\n4.7%\nUnrealized from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(152.0)\n-\nN/A\nTotal realized and unrealized investment gains (losses)\n(136.4)\n14.8\nN/M\nConsolidated pretax income (loss)\n(6.0)\n164.7\n-103.7\nIncome taxes (credits)\n(10.1)\n51.6\n-119.7\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4.0\n$\n113.1\n-96.4%\nComponents of post-tax diluted earnings per share:\nNet operating income (loss):\nGeneral insurance\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.22\n18.2%\nTitle insurance\n0.08\n0.09\n-11.1\nCorporate and other\n0.03\n0.02\n50.0\nSubtotal\n0.37\n0.33\n12.1\nRFIG run-off business\n0.03\n0.03\n-\nNet operating income (loss)\n0.40\n0.36\n11.1\nNet realized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n0.04\n0.03\n33.3\nSubtotal\n0.44\n0.39\n12.8\nNet unrealized investment gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(0.43)\n-\nN/A\nNet income (loss)\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.39\n-97.4%\nCash dividends declared per share\n$\n0.1950\n$\n0.1900\n2.6%\nEnding book value per share\n$\n16.82\n$\n17.58\n-4.3%\n(a) Unaudited / All amounts in this report are stated in millions except per share data and percentages.\nN/M = Not meaningful / N/A = Not applicable\nEffective January 1, 2018, two significant events have occurred that have a bearing on the reporting of consolidated pretax income, as well as post-tax net operating and net income. The first arises from a new rule of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") which requires the inclusion of unrealized investment gains or losses emanating from changes in the fair value of equity (but not fixed maturity) securities in the determination of pre and post-tax net income. The second emanates from a reduction of nominal Federal corporate income tax rates from 35% to 21%.\nTo enhance a comparison of reported earnings among the periods reported upon, the following table shows the resulting effective income tax rates and the inclusion of changes in fair value of equity securities in 2017 results as if the new rule applied to that year.\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nPretax operating income\n$\n130.4\n$\n149.8\n-13.0%\nIncome tax expense (effective rates 14.3% and 31.0%)(a)\n18.5\n46.4\n-59.9\nNet operating income\n111.8\n103.4\n8.1\nRealized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n15.5\n14.8\n4.7\nIncome tax expense (effective rates 21.0% and 35.0%)(a)\n3.2\n5.1\n-37.2\nNet realized investment gains (losses)\n12.2\n9.6\n27.3\nCombined pretax operating income and realized investment gains (losses)\n145.9\n164.7\n-11.4\nIncome tax expense (effective rates 15.0% and 31.3%)(a)\n21.8\n51.6\n-57.6\nCombined net operating income and realized investment gains (losses)\n124.0\n113.1\n9.7%\nUnrealized gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(152.0)\n47.9\n(b)\nIncome tax expense (effective rates 21.0% and 35.0%)(a)\n(32.0)\n16.7\n(b)\nNet unrealized gains (losses)\n(120.0)\n31.2\n(b)\nConsolidated pretax income (loss)\n(6.0)\n212.7\n(b)\nIncome tax expense (effective rates N/M and 32.1%)(a)\n(10.1)\n68.3\n(b)\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4.0\n$\n144.3\n(b)\n(a)\nEffective rates based on 2018 (21%) and 2017 (35%) nominal Federal income tax rates, respectively.\n(b)\nAmounts for 2017 include the retroactive, \"as if\" addition of equity securities unrealized gains or losses for that period.\nThe above and preceding table show both net operating and net income to highlight the effects of realized and, beginning in 2018, certain unrealized investment gains or losses on period-to-period comparisons. Management uses operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate and better explain operating performance, believing that the measure enhances an understanding of Old Republic's core business results. Net operating income, however, does not replace GAAP net income as a measure of total profitability.\nThe realization of investment gains or losses can be highly discretionary due to such factors as the timing of individual securities sales, the recording of estimated losses from write-downs of impaired securities, tax-planning and tax-rate change considerations, as well as modifications in investment management judgments regarding the direction of securities markets or the future prospects of individual investees or industry sectors. The inclusion, beginning in 2018 of market-driven changes in equity investments' valuations will likely produce, as it has most assuredly done in this year's first three months, greater period-to-period fluctuations in reported net income particularly at times of significant instability or volatility in the securities markets. This FASB change, however, has no effect on management or evaluation of the Company's operating results, nor on the determination of such critical elements as current income taxes, debt-to-equity ratios, shareholders' equity, or its insurance subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to the ORI parent company.\nGeneral Insurance Results – The table below shows the major elements affecting this segment's performance for the periods reported upon.\nGeneral Insurance Group\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet premiums earned\n$\n791.2\n$\n742.8\n6.5%\nNet investment income\n83.2\n78.8\n5.5\nOther income\n30.3\n27.3\n11.0\nOperating revenues\n904.8\n849.0\n6.6\nClaim costs\n566.1\n527.6\n7.3\nSales and general expenses\n238.3\n211.9\n12.5\nInterest and other costs\n17.0\n15.6\n8.7\nTotal operating expenses\n821.4\n755.3\n8.8\nPretax operating income (loss)(a)\n$\n83.3\n$\n93.7\n-11.1%\nClaim ratio\n71.5%\n71.0%\nExpense ratio\n26.3\n24.9\nComposite underwriting ratio\n97.8%\n95.9%\n(a)\nIn connection with the run-off mortgage guaranty (\"MI\") and consumer credit indemnity (\"CCI\") combination, $0.4 and $(4.5) of pretax operating gains (losses) for the first quarter 2018 and 2017, respectively, were retained by certain general insurance companies pursuant to various quota share and stop loss reinsurance agreements. All of these amounts, however, have been reclassified such that 100% of the CCI run-off business is reported in the RFIG run-off segment.\nWith few exceptions, earned premiums grew for most types of coverages and markets served. The aggregating effects of recent years' rate increases along with new business production are main elements in the higher premium levels. Net investment income gained from the combination of a moderately larger invested asset base and uptrend in dividend income.\nClaim costs were affected by better performance in workers compensation and commercial automobile (trucking) coverages. Poorer results for the relatively small and volatile general liability coverage and several other types of insurance, however, offset that better performance. For all coverages combined, current periods' improving claim ratios were dampened by unfavorable developments of prior years' reserves. These amounted to 2.0 and 1.4 percentage points in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The table below shows recent annual and quarterly trends in prior years' developments:\nReported Claim Ratio\nEffect of Prior Years'\n(Favorable)/‌\nUnfavorable Claim\nReserves Development\nClaim Ratio Excluding Prior\nYears' Claim Reserves\nDevelopment\n2013\n73.6%\n(0.9)%\n74.5%\n2014\n77.9\n3.9\n74.0\n2015\n74.1\n1.5\n72.6\n2016\n73.0\n0.3\n72.7\n2017\n71.8%\n0.7%\n71.1%\n1st Quarter 2017\n71.0%\n1.4%\n69.6%\n1st Quarter 2018\n71.5%\n2.0%\n69.5%\n2018's expense ratio increased nearly 6% to 26.3%. This was largely caused by different production cost structures effecting some faster growing coverages in this year's first quarter.\nQuarterly and even annual claim provisions and the trends they display may not be particularly meaningful in Old Republic's liability insurance oriented mix of business. Absent significant economic and insurance industry dislocations in the foreseeable future, it is anticipated that reported claim ratios can be expected to fall within targeted averages in the high 60 percent to low 70 percent range. The current mix of business should result in the expense ratio ranging between 23 percent and 25 percent.\nTitle Insurance Results – First quarter 2018 operating results were mostly affected by basically flat revenues, and higher claim costs and general expenses.\nTitle Insurance Group\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet premiums and fees earned\n$\n513.8\n$\n518.0\n-0.8%\nNet investment income\n9.4\n9.5\n-0.4\nOther income\n0.2\n0.2\n1.9\nOperating revenues\n523.6\n527.8\n-0.8\nClaim costs\n12.9\n11.0\n17.4\nSales and general expenses\n479.8\n474.0\n1.2\nInterest and other costs\n1.2\n2.2\n-41.8\nTotal operating expenses\n494.0\n487.3\n1.4\nPretax operating income (loss)\n$\n29.5\n$\n40.4\n-27.0%\nClaim ratio\n2.5%\n2.1%\nExpense ratio\n93.3\n91.5\nComposite underwriting ratio\n95.8%\n93.6%\nYear-over-year comparisons of revenues from title premiums and fees reflected relatively flat volume reported by independent agents, and a small decline for directly-produced business. By contrast, claim costs rose 17.4% in this year's first quarter due primarily to lower favorable development of prior years' claim reserves in the first quarter of 2018. The following table shows recent trends in reported claim ratios, and the impact on each calendar period of (favorable) or unfavorable developments of prior years' claim reserve provisions:\nReported Claim Ratio\nEffect of Prior Years'\n(Favorable)/‌\nUnfavorable Claim\nReserves Development\nClaim Ratio Excluding\nPrior Years' Claim\nReserves Development\n2013\n6.7%\n(0.2)%\n6.9%\n2014\n5.2\n(0.8)\n6.0\n2015\n4.9\n(0.6)\n5.5\n2016\n3.8\n(1.1)\n4.9\n2017\n0.9%\n(3.3)%\n4.2%\n1st Quarter 2017\n2.1%\n(2.0)%\n4.1%\n1st Quarter 2018\n2.5%\n(1.6)%\n4.1%\nThe expense ratio to premiums and fees rose to 93.3% in this year's first quarter compared to 91.5% in the same period of 2017.

All of these amounts, however, have been reclassified such that 100% of the CCI run-off business is reported in the RFIG run-off segment.\nOperating results of the run-off MI and CCI businesses were largely affected by a 39.9% drop in net earned premiums. As noted above, the reduction in MI earned premiums reflected the continuing decline in risk in force. For the CCI coverage, the much lower premiums in this year's first quarter resulted from the elimination of a major bank as a source of significant premiums and claims. MI claim costs rose disproportionately to earned premiums in both quarterly periods. The indicated claim ratios (54.8% in 2018 and 35.0% in 2017) reflect reductions of 27.6 and 34.9 percentage points, respectively, due to favorable developments of prior years' reserves.\nCorporate and Other Operations – The combination of a small life and accident insurance business and the net costs associated with operations of the parent holding company and its internal services subsidiaries usually produce highly variable results. Earnings variations posted by these elements of Old Republic's business stem from volatility inherent to the small scale of the life and accident insurance line, net investment income, and net interest charges pertaining to external and intra-system financing arrangements. The interplay of these various operating elements is summarized in the following table:\nCorporate and Other Operations\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums earned\n$\n3.9\n$\n4.6\nNet investment income\n7.7\n7.2\nOther income\n-\n-\nOperating revenues\n11.6\n11.9\nClaim costs\n3.4\n5.0\nInsurance expenses\n1.3\n3.8\nCorporate, interest and other expenses - net\n0.3\n1.8\nTotal operating expenses\n5.1\n10.8\nPretax operating income (loss)\n$\n6.5\n$\n1.1\nConsolidated Results – The above summarized operating results of Old Republic's segmented business are reflected in the following consolidation of accounts.\nORI Consolidated\nQuarters Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nNet premiums and fees earned\n$\n1,330.4\n$\n1,301.0\n2.3%\nNet investment income\n105.8\n101.2\n4.5\nOther income\n30.6\n27.6\n10.8\nOperating revenues\n1,466.8\n1,429.9\n2.6\nClaim costs\n594.0\n563.4\n5.4\nSales and general expenses\n728.0\n700.2\n4.0\nInterest and other costs\n14.4\n16.4\n-12.3\nTotal operating expenses\n1,336.4\n1,280.1\n4.4\nPretax operating income (loss)\n130.4\n149.8\n-13.0\nIncome taxes (credits)\n18.5\n46.4\n-59.9\nNet operating income (loss)\n111.8\n103.4\n8.1\nRealized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n15.5\n14.8\n4.7\nIncome tax expense (credits)\n3.2\n5.1\n-37.2\nNet realized investment gains (losses)\n12.2\n9.6\n27.3\nUnrealized investment gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(152.0)\n-\nN/A\nIncome tax expense (credits)\n(32.0)\n-\nN/A\nNet unrealized investment gains (losses)\n(120.0)\n-\nN/A\nNet realized and unrealized investment gains (losses)\n(107.7)\n9.6\nN/M\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4.0\n$\n113.1\n-96.4%\nClaim ratio\n44.6%\n43.3%\nExpense ratio\n52.1\n51.4\nComposite underwriting ratio\n96.7%\n94.7%\nConsolidated operating cash flow\n$\n130.8\n$\n146.1\n-10.5%\nConsolidated operating cash flow was additive to investable funds and operating needs in the amount of $130.8 and $146.1 for the first three months of 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Most importantly, these are intended to ensure solid funding of the insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to policyholders and other beneficiaries, as well as the long-term stability of the subsidiaries' capital accounts. To this end, the investment portfolio contains no significant insurance risk-correlated asset exposures to real estate, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations (\"CDO's\"), derivatives, hybrid securities, or illiquid private equity and hedge fund investments. Moreover, the Company does not engage in hedging or securities lending transactions, nor does it invest in securities whose values are predicated on non-regulated financial instruments exhibiting amorphous or unfunded counter-party risk attributes.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the consolidated investment portfolio reflected an allocation of approximately 75% to fixed-maturity and short-term investments, and 25% to equities. Investments in high quality, dividend-paying equity securities have been singularly emphasized since 2013.

Old Republic's business is therefore conducted with a primary focus on achieving favorable underwriting results over cycles, and on the maintenance of financial soundness in support of its insurance subsidiaries' long-term obligations to insurance beneficiaries.\nIn this light, the Company's affairs are managed for the long run and without significant regard to the arbitrary strictures of quarterly or even annual reporting periods that American industry must observe. In Old Republic's view, such short reporting time frames do not comport well with the long-term nature of much of its business. Management therefore believes that the Company's operating results and financial condition can best be evaluated by observing underwriting and overall operating performance trends over succeeding five- or preferably ten-year intervals. A ten-year period in particular can likely encompass at least one economic and/or underwriting cycle and thereby provide an appropriate time frame for such cycle to run its course, and for premium rate changes and reserved claim costs to be quantified and emerge in financial results with greater finality and effect.\nAccompanying Financial Data and Other Information:\nSummary Financial Statements and Common Stock Statistics About Old Republic Safe Harbor Statement\nFinancial Supplement:\nA financial supplement to this news release is available on the Company's website: www.oldrepublic.com\nOld Republic International Corporation\nSummary Financial Statements and Common Stock Statistics (Unaudited)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nSUMMARY BALANCE SHEETS:\n2018\n2017\n2017\nAssets:\nCash and fixed maturity securities\n$\n9,748.1\n$\n10,145.9\n$\n10,024.2\nEquity securities\n3,149.7\n3,265.5\n3,012.2\nOther invested assets\n128.1\n124.9\n131.1\nCash and invested assets\n13,026.0\n13,536.4\n13,167.5\nAccounts and premiums receivable\n1,516.1\n1,469.7\n1,461.2\nPrepaid federal income taxes\n114.3\n114.3\n114.3\nReinsurance balances recoverable\n3,401.9\n3,371.8\n3,280.6\nSundry assets\n940.3\n911.1\n881.6\nTotal\n$\n18,998.8\n$\n19,403.5\n$\n18,905.4\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity:\nPolicy liabilities\n$\n2,267.5\n$\n2,176.3\n$\n2,131.1\nClaim reserves\n9,272.4\n9,237.6\n9,231.3\nFederal income tax payable:\nCurrent\n27.2\n6.5\n42.1\nDeferred\n33.4\n100.5\n64.8\nDebt\n974.1\n1,448.7\n1,525.5\nSundry liabilities\n1,375.2\n1,700.5\n1,324.8\nShareholders' equity\n5,048.6\n4,733.3\n4,585.6\nTotal\n$\n18,998.8\n$\n19,403.5\n$\n18,905.4\nQuarters Ended\nFiscal Twelve Months Ended\nSUMMARY INCOME STATEMENTS:\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet premiums and fees earned\n$\n1,330.4\n$\n1,301.0\n$\n5,569.1\n$\n5,388.6\nNet investment income\n105.8\n101.2\n414.0\n392.0\nOther income\n30.6\n27.6\n105.2\n107.6\nNet realized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n15.5\n14.8\n212.3\n43.5\nUnrealized investment gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(152.0)\n-\n(152.0)\n-\nTotal revenues\n1,330.4\n1,444.8\n6,148.7\n5,931.7\nClaim costs\n594.0\n563.4\n2,509.4\n2,337.3\nSales and general expenses\n728.0\n700.2\n3,023.6\n2,870.2\nInterest and other costs\n14.4\n16.4\n61.0\n55.9\nTotal expenses\n1,336.4\n1,280.1\n5,594.1\n5,263.4\nPretax income (loss)\n(6.0)\n164.7\n554.6\n668.3\nIncome taxes (credits)\n(10.1)\n51.6\n103.1\n211.2\nNet income (loss)\n$\n4.0\n$\n113.1\n$\n451.5\n$\n457.1\nCOMMON STOCK STATISTICS:\nNet income (loss):\nBasic\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.43\n$\n1.69\n$\n1.75\nDiluted\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.39\n$\n1.55\n$\n1.58\nComponents of earnings per share:\nBasic, net operating income (loss)\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.40\n$\n1.22\n$\n1.65\nRealized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n0.04\n0.03\n0.92\n0.10\nUnrealized investment gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(0.43)\n-\n(0.45)\n-\nBasic net income (loss)\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.43\n$\n1.69\n$\n1.75\nDiluted, net operating income (loss)\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.36\n$\n1.13\n$\n1.49\nRealized investment gains (losses) from actual sale transactions\n0.04\n0.03\n0.82\n0.09\nUnrealized investment gains (losses) from changes in fair value of equity securities\n(0.43)\n-\n(0.40)\n-\nDiluted net income (loss)\n$\n0.01\n$\n0.39\n$\n1.55\n$\n1.58\nCash dividends on common stock\n$\n0.1950\n$\n0.1900\n$\n1.7650\n$\n0.7525\nBook value per share\n$\n16.82\n$\n17.58\nCommon shares outstanding:\nAverage basic\n278,116,902\n260,784,905\n266,567,472\n260,487,776\nAverage diluted\n279,528,034\n298,239,349\n300,224,931\n297,726,698\nActual, end of period\n300,199,982\n260,951,345\nSUMMARY STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS):\nNet income (loss) as reported\n$\n4.0\n$\n113.1\n$\n451.5\n$\n457.1\nPost-tax net unrealized gains (losses)\n(117.8)\n42.5\n(86.4)\n160.2\nOther adjustments\n(3.1)\n1.6\n(13.2)\n(2.6)\nNet adjustments\n(120.9)\n44.1\n(99.6)\n157.6\nComprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(116.8)\n$\n157.2\n$\n351.8\n$\n614.7\nAbout Old Republic\nChicago-based Old Republic International Corporation is one of the nation's 50 largest publicly held insurance organizations. Its most recent financial statements reflect consolidated assets of approximately $18.99 billion and common shareholders' equity of $5.04 billion, or $16.82 per share. Its current stock market valuation is approximately $6.41 billion, or $21.23 per share.\nThe Company is organized as an insurance holding company whose subsidiaries actively market, underwrite, and provide risk management services for a wide variety of coverages mostly in the general and title insurance fields. A long-term interest in mortgage guaranty and consumer credit indemnity coverages has devolved to a run-off operating mode in recent years.\nThe nature of Old Republic's business requires that it be managed for the long run. For the 25 years ended in 2017, the Company's total market return, with dividends reinvested, has grown at a compounded annual rate of 9.1% per share. For the same period, the total market return, with dividends reinvested, for the S&P 500 Index has grown at a 9.7% annual compound rate. During those years, Old Republic's shareholders' equity account, inclusive of cash dividends, has risen at an average annual rate of 9.2% per share, and the regular cash dividend has grown at a 8.7% annual compound rate. According to the most recent edition of Mergent's Dividend Achievers, Old Republic is one of just 96 qualifying companies, out of thousands considered, that have posted at least 25 consecutive years of annual dividend growth.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nHistorical data pertaining to the operating results, liquidity, and other performance indicators applicable to an insurance enterprise such as Old Republic are not necessarily indicative of results to be achieved in succeeding years. In addition to the factors cited below, the long-term nature of the insurance business, seasonal and annual patterns in premium production and incidence of claims, changes in yields obtained on invested assets, changes in government policies and free markets affecting inflation rates and general economic conditions, and changes in legal precedents or the application of law affecting the settlement of disputed and other claims can have a bearing on period-to-period comparisons and future operating results.\nSome of the oral or written statements made in the Company's reports, press releases, and conference calls following earnings releases, can constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Of necessity, any such forward-looking statements involve assumptions, uncertainties, and risks that may affect the Company's future performance. With regard to Old Republic's General Insurance segment, its results can be affected, in particular, by the level of market competition, which is typically a function of available capital and expected returns on such capital among competitors, the levels of interest and inflation rates, and periodic changes in claim frequency and severity patterns caused by natural disasters, weather conditions, accidents, illnesses, work-related injuries, and unanticipated external events. Title Insurance and RFIG run-off results can be affected by similar factors, and by changes in national and regional housing demand and values, the availability and cost of mortgage loans, employment trends, and default rates on mortgage loans. Life and accident insurance earnings can be affected by the levels of employment and consumer spending, variations in mortality and health trends, and changes in policy lapsation rates. At the parent holding company level, operating earnings or losses are generally reflective of the amount of debt outstanding and its cost, interest income on temporary holdings of short-term investments, and period-to-period variations in the costs of administering the Company's widespread operations.\nA more detailed listing and discussion of the risks and other factors which affect the Company's risk-taking insurance business are included in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of the Company's 2017 Form 10-K Annual Report and Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors, of the Company's recent Form 10-Q filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Items are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\nAny forward-looking statements or commentaries speak only as of their dates.
