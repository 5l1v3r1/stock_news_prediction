The index was flat on the month from February.\nExcluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.2% in March, in line with economists’ expectations. Core inflation was up 1.9% in March from a year earlier.\nInflation is now above the median of Fed officials’ projections from their March meeting, which saw it at 1.9% by the end of this year. Core inflation has now reached the median of Fed officials’ projections from their March 20-21 meeting, which saw core inflation at 1.9% by the fourth quarter.\nInflation was weak for much of 2017, a puzzle for many economists who expected a low unemployment rate would translate into stronger growth in wages and prices. Some Fed officials pointed to one-off or transitory factors , such as a sharp decline in the price of cellular-service plans last spring, which they expected would be temporary.\n“Inflation has continued to run below the [Federal Open Market Committee’s] 2% objective but we expect it to move up in coming months” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a speech April 6, when he predicted that “the 12-month change should move up notably this spring as last spring’s soft readings drop out of the 12-month calculation.”\nThe Fed’s next policy meeting is this week. The U.S. central bank has been trying for years to lift subpar inflation—seen as a sign of anemic economic activity—to the central bank’s long-run objective of 2%.\nInflation by that measure was last above 2% in February of last year. Core inflation was last at 2% in April 2012.\nAnother U.S. inflation measure, the Labor Department’s consumer-price index, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in March from the prior month, cooling from February’s 0.2% gain. The index rose 2.4% in March from a year earlier, and core prices were up 2.1% on the year.\nStill, the broad inflation trend shows signs of firming as U.S. unemployment falls and the global economy heats up, pressuring the costs of labor and globally traded goods.\nWrite to Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:27:52.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
