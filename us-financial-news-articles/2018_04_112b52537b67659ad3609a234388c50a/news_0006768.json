Along with his brothers, Souto helped grow the family business, Rowland Coffee Roasters, into a multi-million dollar company, eventually selling to J.M. Smucker Co. for $360 million in 2011. The company's best known brands include Cafe Bustelo and Cafe Pilon.\nAfter the sale, Souto was in the market for a house. \"When he couldn't find the perfect home, he decided to build one,\" Dennis Carvajal of One Sotheby's tells CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\" \"He poured his heart and soul into every inch of this place.\"\nAndy Frame Photography In the grand living room, you'll find a sky-high 24-foot ceiling adorned with a chandelier.\nBelow, priceless art from Cuba, Souto's native country, fills the room. \"When Mr. Souto designed the home, he made sure there was plenty of space to showcase his stunning art collection,\" Carvajal says.\nAndy Frame Photography Coffee lovers and wine lovers alike will fancy the home. Residents can grab some vino from the 2,500-bottle wine cellar and settle down at the glowing onyx bar.\nAcross the room, an 800-gallon fish tank lights up the space. \"It's encased in hurricane-proof, impact resistant glass,\" Carvajal says. \"I'm pretty sure Nemo would love living in here, because these fish won the lottery.\"\nAndy Frame Photography A game room showcases two more of Souto's hobbies: playing poker and smoking cigars.\nUpstairs, the master suite features its own living room, two walk-in closets and a huge terrance, complete with an outdoor kitchen.\nOutside, an air-conditioned six-car garage provides plenty of space for car enthusiasts. It currently holds Souto's cherry-red Ferrari.\nThe backyard pool backs right up to the water, where Souto's 115-foot yacht, Mambo, is parked.\nAndy Frame Photography \"After putting so much love and energy into this home, why would he sell it?\" Carvajal asks. \"Well, he's actually traveling more now and spending more time in the Caribbean on Mambo, so he's ready to let another family come in and enjoy the home.\"\nWatch new episodes of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesdays at 10P/ET. \nDon't miss: Look inside this $69 million home on the French Riviera, where the 1% of the 1% live \nLike this story?
