He scored 29 points in the first half, the most in a half by any Net since Joe Johnson also totaled 29 in the second half against the Philadelphia 76ers on Dec. 16, 2013.\nCrabbe posted his team-leading 16th game with at least 20 points and surpassed his previous career best of 34 set Feb. 7 at Detroit. He also joined Vince Carter (2008-09) as the second player in franchise history to hit at least five 3-pointers in three straight games.\nD’Angelo Russell added 21 points and 11 assists while Spencer Dinwiddie contributed 20 for Brooklyn, which swept the season series for the first time since 2004-05. The Nets shot 50 percent, made 42.9 percent (18 of 42) of 3-pointers and collected 32 assists, marking the first time they registered at least 30 assists in three straight games since the 2005-06 season.\nSean Kilpatrick, who began the season with Brooklyn, led the Bulls with 16 points. He faced the Nets for the fifth time this season after spending time with the Milwaukee Bucks and Los Angeles Clippers.\nCameron Payne added 15 and Bobby Portis contributed 14 as Chicago lost for the 10th time in 13 games.\nCrabbe scored 17 of Brooklyn’s 19 points and reached 20 points by the end of the first quarter as the Nets took a 29-26 lead. Crabbe hit five of Brooklyn’s six 3-pointers in the opening 12 minutes and reached 29 points as Brooklyn took a 62-55 halftime lead.\nCrabbe then hit his sixth 3-pointer with 58 seconds left and topped 30 points by hitting a 3-pointer for a 67-58 lead with 9:08 remaining in the third. He matched his career high by converting a layup with 6:24 remaining for a 74-67 lead and then surpassed it with his eighth 3-pointer nearly two minutes later.\nBrooklyn was up 96-90 when Crabbe returned again, and he finished off his big night by hitting a pair of free throws with 68 seconds left to ice the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:05:14.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
