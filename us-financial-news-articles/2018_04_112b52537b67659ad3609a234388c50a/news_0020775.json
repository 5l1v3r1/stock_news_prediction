The crash killed 102 people onboard, with one person escaping with serious injuries. \nBy Jared Malsin Robert Wall \nAt least 257 people were killed when an Algerian military plane crashed outside the capital Algiers on Wednesday morning, the Defense Ministry said, the world’s deadliest aviation disaster for almost four years and the nation’s worst ever. \nThe plane plowed into a field shortly after departing Boufarik military air base southwest of the capital, the ministry said. It was bound for Bechar, Algeria, near the Moroccan border, with a stop in Tindouf, the military said. \nThe ministry said the dead included members of the military, their families and 10 crew members. \nThe cause of the crash and the purpose of the flight weren’t immediately clear. Algeria’s state news agency said the plane was a Russian-made Ilyushin Il-76 transport plane. The ministry said it had convened a panel to investigate the cause. \nThe crash is the deadliest since the shootdown of a Malaysia Airlines jetliner over eastern Ukraine in 2014. The crash of that Boeing Co.
