REUTERS/ Kyle Grillot Insurers received more than 2,000 claims, including 1,415 for homes that were partially damaged and 107 for homes that were totally destroyed, said California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones during a media presentation.\nThe fast-moving mudslides, which struck in Santa Barbara County and killed 21 people, also triggered 240 claims for commercial property losses and 315 for personal and commercial auto insurance losses, Jones said.\nThe total sum of insured losses is likely to rise as insurers adjust claims, Jones said.\nHomeowner insurance typically does not cover mudslides, which insurers view as a type of “earth movement.” But insurers may sometimes cover the damages if another covered peril, such as fire, caused the mudslides.\nJones, in late January, told insurers they were obliged to cover the mudslide damages upon a finding that wildfires, which ravaged the region during the weeks before the mudslides, spurred the disaster.\nHeavy rains pounded parts of Southern California after the Thomas Fire, the largest fire in the state’s history, swept through the region in mid-December.\nPreliminary evidence suggested that the Thomas Fire burned vegetation that would otherwise have absorbed rainfall and held soils in place, Jones said in January.\nInsurers are recognizing a probable link between the fires and the mudslides and have been paying mudslide claims, Jones said.\nReporting by Suzanne Barlyn in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T21:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T22:05:58.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
