That move came a day after the Trump administration detailed its targets of Chinese imports to be subjected to tariffs. Ollom noted China's aircraft tariffs are on a size of plane that the U.S. does not export to the Asian country. Some of the agricultural product tariffs such as on beef and pork also have low trade volumes and high inventories in China. \n\"The Xi Administration's response to the Trump Tariffs, while targeting industries (manufacturing, agriculture) that purportedly are Trump supporters, is also notable in that it really is less aggressive than it appears,\" he wrote, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping . \nThe recent rise in trade tensions between China and U.S. came after Trump's tariff plan on aluminum and steel imports. \nThe administration granted several countries exemptions from the aluminum and steel tariffs last month after initially implying there would be no exemptions for any countries .
