They have 93 points, two short of the Premier League best which was also set by Chelsea in 2004-2005.\n“We wanted to win today so that we can get the record of 96 points at home when we get the trophy in front of our people next week,” City manager Pep Guardiola said.

You need things to go for you and a bit of good fortune when you play a team like Manchester City.”\nWest Ham did improve and got themselves back in the match after Cresswell curled a free kick into the bottom corner.\nThe West Ham fans’ joy was short-lived, however, as City upped the ante after the break.
