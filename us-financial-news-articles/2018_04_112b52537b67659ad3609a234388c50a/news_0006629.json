FILE PHOTO: Credit reporting company Equifax Inc. corporate offices are pictured in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., September 8, 2017. REUTERS/Tami Chappell/File Photo \nSuffolk County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Salinger in Boston, in a decision made public on Wednesday, denied a motion by Equifax to dismiss a lawsuit that Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey filed in September after the breach was disclosed. \nSalinger wrote that the lawsuit stated a plausible claim that Equifax breached its legal duties to address all reasonably foreseeable risks to its data security and to implement reasonably up-to-date fixes to its software. \nThe lawsuit alleged that Equifax knew or should have known by March 2017 that a serious security vulnerability existed in computer code that the company used in its systems but failed to patch or upgrade its software to eliminate it. \nThe company ultimately announced that a cyber security incident had occurred in September. \n“These allegations state a viable claim for violation of the data security regulations,” Salinger wrote. \nEquifax did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Healey’s office had no immediate comment. \nThe lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing Equifax related to the data breach. It also faces class action lawsuits, investigations by more than 40 state attorneys general and a probe by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
