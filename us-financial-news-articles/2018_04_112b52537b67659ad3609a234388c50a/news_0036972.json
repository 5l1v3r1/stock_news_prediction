REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4.\nBritain has blamed Russia for the attack which the authorities said was carried out using a Novichok form of nerve agent. Moscow denies the accusation and says Britain is trying to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.\nThe BBC said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which is handling a clean-up operation in Salisbury had said a “very small amount” of Novichok was used with the substance delivered in a “liquid form”.\nPolice have previously said they believed the poison had been applied to the front door of Skripal’s modest home.\nYulia Skripal, 33, was discharged from hospital a week ago while her father is no longer in a critical condition.\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:49:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
