It’s an excessive expectation. It’s unfair.”\n“It’s a little unpleasant that as we are an exception, we are examined like rats in a laboratory.”\nRACIST THREATS Costa Rica has made strides in the political participation of women, electing its first female president Laura Chinchilla in 2010.\nThe incoming government has pledged to have equal numbers of men and women in its cabinet, and women make up nearly half of the Congress, Campbell said.\nPolitical parties have been required since 2009 to ensure women make up 50 percent of candidates on electoral lists, allowing more women to be voted into power.\nCampbell wants to build on those gains by reducing the pay gap between men and women and establishing more child care centers to boost women in the workforce.\nRacism may be more of a challenge.\nIndigenous women and those of African descent - Afro-Costa Ricans who make up nearly 8 percent of the population - are often marginalized in public life, according to the Organization of American States.\nAs a congresswoman in 2015, Campbell said she received anonymous threats via email and social media after she tried to get a popular children’s story banned from the school curriculum on the grounds it perpetuated racial stereotypes.\nOne told her to “Go home to Africa”.\n“Attitude is what saves you,” she said. “Understanding that what you are fighting for, and what you are doing, is something you have the right to do.\n“It’s what has allowed me to get where I am.”\nThe election exposed divisions in Costa Rica, where some rural communities remain socially conservative.\nCampbell’s Citizens’ Action Party was one of the few to publicly support same-sex marriage, a contentious issue.\nShe plans to promote indigenous and gay rights, and tackle violence against women. But entrenched ideas about women’s place in society and machismo mean change will take time, she said.\n“There are things to be done in terms of state policy to prevent and punish violence (against women),” she said.\n“But the social and cultural relationships that exist can’t be resolved in four years.”\nReporting by Enrique Andres-Pretel, Writing by Anastasia Moloney Editing by Claire Cozens and Katy Migiro.
