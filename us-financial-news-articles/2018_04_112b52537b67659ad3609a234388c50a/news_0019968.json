Najib announced the dissolution of parliament on Friday, paving the way for a tough campaign where he faces off against rival Mahathir Mohamad, who last year questioned the merits of the Boeing deal in a blog post. \nMalaysia Airlines has been trying to transform its operations and return to profitability as it recovers from two tragedies in 2014, when flight MH370 disappeared in what remains a mystery and flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine. \nThe carrier’s new CEO, Izham Ismail, last month said the company had issued a request for information for new generation widebody planes, without specifying the number or model type, with a request for proposal expected to follow. \nThe 787 deal was signed by the previous CEO Peter Bellew. \n“They have flexibility to not convert the 787 MOU to a firm order if they decide it makes sense to go with Airbus for the full requirement,” CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. \n“It’s best if they limit their number of widebody types as their fleet is not that big to begin with and having just six or eight aircraft of a particular type is subscale.” (Reporting by Jamie Freed in SINGAPORE; additional reporting by Liz Lee and Praveen Menon in KUALA LUMPUR and Aradhana Aravindan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Himani Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T08:09:00.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
