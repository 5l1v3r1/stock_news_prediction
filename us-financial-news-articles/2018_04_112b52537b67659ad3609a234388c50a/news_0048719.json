Siem has long called for the industry to consolidate as a way of coping.\n“Siem doesn’t care about the market share, but about the value ... He wouldn’t do that (buy McDermott) if it would not create value for shareholders,” said analyst Frederik Lunde at Carnegie.\nReporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://reut.rs/2FbMVMN"], "published": "2018-04-25T15:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T16:11:45.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
