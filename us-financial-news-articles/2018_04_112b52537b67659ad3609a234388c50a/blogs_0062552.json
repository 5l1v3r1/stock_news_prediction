The government briefly shut down in January over immigration.\nA $1.3 trillion spending bill, which Trump signed last month, will keep the government funded through the end of September. A government shutdown ahead of the November mid-elections is unlikely to be supported by his fellow Republicans who are keen to keep control of the U.S. Congress.\nTrump cited the hundreds of Central American migrants traveling in a “caravan” as one of the reasons for strong border security.\n“Watch the caravan, watch how sad and terrible it is, including for those people and the crime that they inflict on themselves and that others inflict on them,” said Trump.\n“It’s a horrible dangerous journey for them and they come up because they know once they can get here they can walk right into our country.”\nMigrants, who include women and children, have said they fled their homes in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because of death threats from gangs, the murder of family members or political persecution.\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks at a Make America Great Again Rally in Washington, Michigan April 28, 2018.
