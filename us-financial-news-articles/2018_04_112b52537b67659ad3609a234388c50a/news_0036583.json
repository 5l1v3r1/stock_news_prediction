Yields and output fall significantly after that as hot and humid summer weather sets in.\nMost mills did not open this season until around the New Year in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.\nThen unseasonable rainfall shut most of the mills down for over a month.\nMany mills are now expected to remain open into May, and even June, if the weather permits.\nAzcuba, the state sugar monopoly, planned to produce 1.6 million tonnes this season after drought and the hurricane damaged the crop, but then the wet weather further dampened expectations.\n“Azcuba said the sector would not rest until it meets the plan, which has suffered a readjustment of 20 percent (320,000 tonnes),” state-run Radio Rebelde reported last week.\nProvincial media had referred to the readjustment previously, but there was no mention of the national reduction before the Radio Rebelde report.\nFor example, the eastern Las Tunas provincial newspaper, Periodic 26, said that “the decision of the country to exonerate the territory of the deficit of 60,000 tonnes ... caused by intense and prolonged rain from the end of December through mid-February, was right and just.”\nLas Tunas was expected to be the only province to produce more than 200,000 tonnes this season. The paper put the new plan at 141,000 tonnes.\nThe Cuban sugar ministry was eliminated in 2011 and Azcuba formed after output declined to 1.1 million tonnes, the lowest in more than a century and far below the eight million tonnes produced in 1990 before the collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union\nAzcuba said upon its founding that it would be producing more than 2.5 million tonnes of raw sugar annually by 2018.\nCuba consumes between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes of sugar a year and has an agreement to sell China 400,000 tonnes annually. It sells the rest on the open market.\nSugar was long Cuba’s most important industry and export, but today it ranks behind many sectors such as tourism, tobacco, nickel and pharmaceuticals.\nReporting by Marc Frank; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:46:24.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
