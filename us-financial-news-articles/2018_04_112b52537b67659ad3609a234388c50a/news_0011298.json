We are not aiming at isolating Russia,” Stoltenberg said in remarks at the University of Ottawa. \nStoltenberg said NATO was concerned by a more assertive Russia that he said had annexed Crimea, destabilised eastern Ukraine, backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and meddled in the affairs of other nations. \n“That was the reason why NATO allies and partners reacted the way they reacted after the attack in Salisbury. Because that is not a single event,” he said. “It is an attack which has taken place (against) the backdrop of a pattern of hatred which we have seen over many years from Russia.” \nMore than 100 Russian diplomats have been expelled by Western countries to punish the Kremlin over the March 4 attack in Salisbury, England. \nNATO suspended all practical military and civilian cooperation with Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea. \nStoltenberg is due to meet Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later in the day and address a joint news conference at 2.45 pm ET (1845 GMT).
