REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo Madikizela-Mandela died peacefully surrounded by her family following a long illness that kept her in and out of hospital since the start of the year, family spokesman Victor Dlamini said in a statement.\n“She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country,” he said.\n“She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one its most recognisable faces.”\nThe nature of her illness was not disclosed.\nA crowd of around 200 people soon gathered outside her Soweto home, singing and dancing. A number of national and local politicians arrived and police closed the street to traffic.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa led an outpouring of grief over her death in South Africa.\n“Today we have lost a mother, a grandmother, a friend, a comrade, a leader and an icon,” said Ramaphosa, who was expected to visit the family home later on Monday.\nRetired South African cleric and anti-apartheid campaigner Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: “Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists.”\nEnergy Minister Jeff Radebe expressed condolences on behalf of the ruling African National Congress and urged those who loved her to celebrate her.\n“As the ANC we dip our revolutionary banner in salute of the this great icon of our liberation struggle,” Radebe said.\nTIRELESS CAMPAIGNER Born on Sept. 26, 1936, in Bizana, Eastern Cape province, Madikizela-Mandela became politicised at an early age in her job as a hospital social worker.\nThe 22-year-old Winnie caught the eye of Mandela at a Soweto bus-stop in 1957, starting a whirlwind romance that led to their marriage a year later.\nAfter Nelson Mandela was jailed for life in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned tirelessly for his release and emerged as a prominent anti-apartheid figure in her own right, undergoing detention, banishment and arrest.\nShe punched the air in the clenched-fist salute of black power as she walked hand-in-hand with Mandela out of Cape Town’s Victor Vester prison on Feb. 11, 1990.\nFor husband and wife, it was a crowning moment that led four years later to the end of centuries of white domination when Mandela became South Africa’s first black president.\nBut their marriage began to fall apart in the years after his release. The couple divorced in 1996, nearly four decades after they were married. They had two children together.\nThe end of apartheid marked the start of a string of legal and political troubles for Madikizela-Mandela.\nAs evidence emerged in the dying years of apartheid of the brutality of her Soweto enforcers, the “Mandela United Football Club”, her soubriquet switched from ‘Mother’ of the nation to ‘Mugger’.\nBlamed for the killing of activist Stompie Seipei, who was found near her Soweto home with his throat cut, she was convicted in 1991 of kidnapping and assaulting the 14-year-old because he was suspected of being an informer. Her six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine.\nWriting by Tanisha Heiberg and Joe Brock; editing by John Stonestreet and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T17:26:15.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
