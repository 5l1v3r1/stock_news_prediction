Kaleo will bill their commercial insurer.\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, states have enacted laws to ease access to naloxone. Most states permit dispensing through a standing order, and at least half a dozen allow some pharmacists to prescribe naloxone on their own authority, according to Kaleo.\nIn a statement, Kaleo said it plans to eventually expand its \"Virtual Standing Order pilot program to additional states.\nFederal and state government agencies, as well as tribes who purchase directly from Kaleo, will now pay $360 for a pack of two Evzio auto-injectors.\nThe company last year caught the attention of lawmakers like U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill after it raised the price of a twin-pack to $4,500 from $690 in 2014.\nKaleo also said it will continue to donate Evzio to qualifying non-profits and first responders demonstrating need.\n(Reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T16:26:41.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
