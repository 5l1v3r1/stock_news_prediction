Despite a steadily growing fanbase, a Chinese population of 1.3 billion means there still remains a vast opportunity for the sport to tap.\nLast year the sport struck a deal to build strategic partnerships in the country with marketing agency Lagardere Sports and Entertainment.\nThe company’s chief executive told Reuters then that the growth of the Chinese middle classes could see 400 million people over the next 12 or 13 years having disposable income to spend on entertainment and lifestyle.\nSECOND RACE IN CHINA Efforts to reach out to fans are already underway, with the sport organizing a fan-festival in the heart of Shanghai last week and striking fresh television and digital broadcasting deals with state network CCTV and Tencent.\nBratches said the local joint venture would be responsible for agreeing such deals in future.\nIt could also help the country, which hasn’t yet had a Formula One driver, establish driver development schools and look at organizing a second race in China, which Liberty are keen on but remains some years away.\n“What we will be doing for the years to come in the rest of the world is developing the brand, developing the sport,” said Bratches.\n“But we think there’s opportunities in China to develop another grand prix, driver development schools, certainly digital.”\nSince taking over, Liberty Media has invested heavily in setting up marketing, research and digital capabilities at its headquarters in London that didn’t exist under former supremo Bernie Ecclestone.\nWhile Liberty are planning to open local offices in the United States and other parts of Asia, Bratches said setting up a parallel entity similar in scale to its London operation would be unique to China.\n“With the entity that we acquired, we believed that it was somewhat under-managed,” said Bratches of Liberty’s acquisition of the sport.\n“And our time being spent bringing Formula One up into the ethos of the 21st century, we wouldn’t really be spending... enough time (in China) to really merit what we think the opportunities are here.”\nEditing by Alan Baldwin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T13:59:47.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
