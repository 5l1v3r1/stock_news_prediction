Riley FBR in Boston.\n“But we did see the banks ramp up, over the last couple of days into these reports, sort of buy the rumor sell on the news is not unusual for the group.”\nAt 11:11 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 87 points, or 0.36 percent, at 24,396.05, the S&P 500 6.39 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,657.6 and the Nasdaq Composite 29.07 points, or 0.41 percent, at 7,111.18.\nUNINTERRUPTED The bank results blow the starting whistle on U.S. earnings season, with Thomson Reuters data predicting profits at S&P 500 companies increased by 18.4 percent from a year ago, their biggest rise in seven years.\nWhile the U.S. economy is performing well, geopolitical issues are weighing this year on stock markets after almost a decade of uninterrupted gains.\nSenior lawmakers said on Friday that Russia’s lower house of parliament would consider draft legislation giving the Kremlin powers to ban or restrict a list of U.S. imports, reacting to new U.S. sanctions on Russian tycoons and officials.\nBoeing fell 1.86 percent after a Russian senator said the company could be a casualty, with ongoing issues with engines for its 787 Dreamliner planes also weighing.\nThe top gainer among S&P sectors was the energy sector , up 1.1 percent as oil prices rose.\nTesla rose 1.6 percent after founder Elon Musk said the electric car maker would be profitable in the third and fourth quarters of this year and would not have to raise any money from investors.\nDropbox fell about 7 percent after brokerage Instinet gave the cloud-based storage firm a “sell”-equivalent rating.
