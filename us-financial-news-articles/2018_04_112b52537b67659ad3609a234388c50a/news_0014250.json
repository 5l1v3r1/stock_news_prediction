Rio would continue to work with them to support them, he said. \nRio Tinto will be among the biggest winners from U.S. sanctions on Rusal as the penalties further shake up the global metals trade and boost costs for U.S. consumers, industry sources say. \nRio on Tuesday also said it was the first company in the world to receive certification under the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative, an international standard certifying that aluminum has been responsibly and sustainably produced.
