CNBC got a side by side comparison of a boat with a traditional engine, and one of the Pure Outboard systems. The Pure Outboard was nearly silent.\nThe company's systems have been ordered by rowing coaches, fishing pros, water taxi operators, companies and research organizations that go out on the water in their daily work, Rebele said.\nEarly customers included: a concessionaire that rents boats to visitors to Yellowstone Lake in Yellowstone Park; Ontario Power Group, which will use a Pure Watercraft system to patrol reservoirs they own and use to generate hydro-electric power; and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) which will be using EV-powered boats for water transport in sensitive habitat.\nThe Pure Outboard systems have a top speed of 25 miles per hour when installed in a typical 16-foot fishing boat. They cost $12,000 to $18,000 depending on configuration. The higher-priced set up includes two battery packs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T20:25:17.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
