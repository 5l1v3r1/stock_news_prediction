But it declared a ceasefire in 2011 and handed over its arms a year ago.\nA local newspaper, Gara, had reported in February that ETA’s leaders would ask its members to vote on whether it should disband completely by the summer.\nThe group will announce its dissolution during the first weekend of May, ETB reported.\nReporting By Jesús Aguado, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:04:46.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
