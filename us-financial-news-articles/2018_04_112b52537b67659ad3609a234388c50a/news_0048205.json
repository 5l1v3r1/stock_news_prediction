The HCC that Warrior Met Coal produces from the Blue Creek coal seam contains very low sulfur and has strong coking properties, and is of a similar quality to coal referred to as the premium HCC produced in Australia. The premium nature of Warrior Met Coal’s HCC makes it ideally suited as a base feed coal for steel makers and results in price realizations near the quarterly Australian Premium Low-Volatility HCC index average price. Warrior Met Coal sells all of its met coal production to steel producers in Europe, South America and Asia.
