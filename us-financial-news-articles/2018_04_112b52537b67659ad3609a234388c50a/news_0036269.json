However, France and Germany have resisted further EU enlargement, with some member states worrying about Albanian economic migrants seeking asylum, organised crime, drug trafficking and a lack of cooperation between the government and opposition. \n“They want to see a country moving beyond the line of non-return, get the assurance that it will not slide back,” an EU diplomat said on condition of anonymity. \nAlbania still needed to consolidate urgently its system of property titles, which has been in disarray and a source of conflicts, even deadly ones, since the fall of communism in 1990. \nMogherini later arrived in Macedonia whose hopes of accession talks remain blocked by Athens due to the decades-long dispute. Greece believes the name “Macedonia” implies a territorial claim over its northern region, which uses the same name. \nA new Macedonian government has intensified talks with Greece to resolve the dispute and Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has expressed optimism. “The government will even more energetically lead the reform and political processes in the next two months, so that in June Macedonia receives a date to begin talks,” he said.
