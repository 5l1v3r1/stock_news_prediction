Those units–where individual stocks, indexes and exchange-traded funds are bought and sold–saw double-digit percentage revenue increases, helped by volatility in the markets so far this year.\nIn a numerical stroke of serendipity for the banks, equities trading revenue rose 38% at three separate institutions: Goldman Sachs Group , Bank of America and Citigroup The same metric at Morgan Stanley rose 27% and at JPMorgan Chase & Co. rose 26%.\n\nIn fixed income divisions, which are typically larger than equities businesses, trading performance was mixed.\n\nAt Goldman Sachs, fixed income, currencies and commodities trading revenue rose 23% off a disappointing 2017 first quarter result. At Morgan Stanley, fixed-income trading climbed 9% and at JPMorgan, it rose 8%. Trading fell 13% at Bank of America and 7% at Citigroup.\nTrading desks overall aren’t as big as they used to be. Last year , the five largest banks had about $70 billion in trading revenue. While that was an improvement from recent years, it’s still down from almost $100 billion in 2009.\n \n \nShare this: Bank Earnings Banks Trading Previous WSJ City PM: Oil Bulls in Focus as Trump Weighs In, Takeda Sweetens Proposal for Shire, Looking for a Home for Russian Aluminium", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T21:33:38.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
