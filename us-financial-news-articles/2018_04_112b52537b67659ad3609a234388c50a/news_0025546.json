Many Mexicans want to see their government take a harder line. \nAfter Trumps first year in office, only 16 percent of poll respondents in Latin America approved of Trump's performance, according to Gallup. \nSergio Montenegro, 40, who works at an insurance company in Lima, compared Trump with some populist leaders who gained power in Latin America in recent decades. \nBeing loud, always at the center of attention, constant scandals ... that's been our reality for many years,\" Montalvo said. \"The United States isn't respected as much now ... before, whatever Americans said seemed to be the right thing - the voice of reason. Now whatever they say is questioned.\" \nAsked about how confrontational Trump might be at the summit and if there was discussion about countering his low regional popularity, a U.S. official on the briefing said: \"He speaks what's on his mind. And I think he will speak to issues of shared values and shared goals within the region.\" \nA source in the Brazilian government told Reuters on condition of anonymity that a positive agenda from Washington is badly needed if the Trump administration wants to keep productive relations with the region. \nAt the summit, leaders will try to build consensus around cracking down on corruption in the region, a theme brought into focus last month by the resignation of Peru's former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, over ties to a scandal involving Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht. \nVENEZUELA \nThe White House also wants to turn up regional pressure on Venezuela's socialist president, Nicolas Maduro - disinvited from the summit - who called an election for May that his opposition and Washington have cast as a sham. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled to Colombia and other neighboring countries to escape hunger and poverty. \nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio is set to meet with Trump on Wednesday before the trip to urge more humanitarian aid for Venezuelans, tougher financial and economic sanctions on Maduro, and to \"lay the groundwork for an international cooperative effort to rebuild post-Maduro Venezuela after free, fair and open elections are held,\" an aide said. \nRubio, who is holding a hearing about the summit on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, also wants Trump to boost support in Cuba for democracy and human rights, the aide said. \nThe United States, a major buyer of Venezuelan oil, has weighed ramping up economic sanctions. A U.S. official told reporters last week that no decisions were imminent but could be made over the next several months. \nAt the summit, diplomats from countries critical of Maduro might formally condemn the election and discuss ways to help Venezuelan migrants, according to a source at Argentina's Foreign Ministry. \nSuch a statement would be \"unprecedented,\" said Ana Rose Quintana, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington. \"The statement would be the groundwork for additional sanctions later on,\" Quintana said. \n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton in Washington and Mitra Taj in Lima; Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle in Brasilia, Dave Graham in Mexico City, Julia Cobb in Bogota and Caroline Stauffer in Buenos Aires; Editing by Caren Bohan and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T00:50:59.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
