Inflation expectations have jumped since the government late last year loosened its 2018 target from the prior 8-12 percent range.\nThe economists’ lowered their median growth forecast for 2018 to 2.5 percent from 2.7 percent previously, the third straight month activity expectations have declined. A severe drought is expected to reduce soybean and corn output in Argentina, where agriculture forms the backbone of the economy.\nThe government expects the economy to grow 3 percent in 2017.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T05:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:04:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
