It hit a peak last week of $73.09, the highest since late 2014.\n\"The rally upwards was purely on geopolitical risk and if now we haven't had any further stimulus, we're seeing prices slip off a bit,\" Natixis commodities strategist Joel Hancock said.\nStill, analysts expected uncertainty over the Iran nuclear deal to continue to support prices through May 12, the deadline that U.S. President Donald Trump gave to Congress and European allies to \"fix\" the deal.\nIf Washington does not renew sanctions relief, Iran may have difficulty exporting crude.\nBullish enthusiasm over the outlook for oil prices, however, might be contained by an increase in supplies in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures.\n\"We've seen that front May-June spread in WTI swing back into contango today. And that's somewhat of a bearish...it implies a continued up trend in Cushing crude supply,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates.\n\"There's not much volatility today, as we wait for API and EIA data,\" Ritterbusch said.\nThe American Petroleum Institute publishes weekly U.S. inventory data later on Tuesday, while data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due Wednesday.\n\"If we can...move higher tomorrow that would be a constructive sign,\" said LaRose.\n\"We want to see follow through in order to be sure that this is a break out and not a fake out,\" he said.\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London; Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T23:50:43.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
