It would see Acacia pay $300 million to the government, hand over a 16 percent stake in its mines and split ‘economic benefits’ from operations.\nHowever, Acacia has said any agreement would need to be reviewed by its board and expects a detailed version of the deal within the first half of the year.\nAcacia is conducting a study this year on Bulyanhulu to find the best way to eventually re-open the mine.\n“If the settlement agreement is in place, which we certainly expect it to be, then you would look at re-opening Bulyahulu sometime in 2019 and ramping it up to full scale in 2020 and 2021,” interim CEO Peter Geleta told a conference call following the results.\nJeffries’ analyst Alan Spence said Acacia’s EBITDA figures fell slightly short of expectations but there were no surprises in the rest of the results.\n“Given the situation I think they have done a good job of managing the risk,” he said, referring to Acacia’s ability to maintain cash and bolster its balance sheet with the sale of a non-core asset in December.\nThe company’s cash balance as of March 31 was $107 million, representing a 33 percent rise from the end of December but down by more than 62 percent from a year ago.\nReporting by Zandi Shabalala; editing by Jason Neely and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:12:57.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
