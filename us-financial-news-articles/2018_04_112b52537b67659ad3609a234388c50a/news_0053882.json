FILE PHOTO: A McLaren logo is seen on a car in Monaco September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard\nMcLaren issued a statement at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Thursday, without mentioning Goss, confirming a review of technical operations was being carried out as part of a programme “to return the team to success”.\nThe BBC earlier reported that Goss, who had overall responsibility for the chassis side, had been removed from his position. Reuters confirmed the details independently.\nGoss was one of three top engineers at the team, along with aerodynamics head Peter Prodromou and chief engineering officer Matt Morris.\nMcLaren said the review “addresses a broad range of factors across the organisation.\n“More details will be given in due course. Until that time there will be no further comment,” they added.\nThe once-dominant former champions have not won a race since 2012 and finished ninth overall of 10 teams last season, the last of a failed three-year partnership with Honda.\nDuring that time it was a widely-held belief at Woking that the team had one of the best chassis in the sport and was being held back by their under-performing and unreliable Japanese engine.\nMcLaren switched to Renault power at the end of last year, the same engines that powered Red Bull to three wins in 2017, with Spain’s double world champion Fernando Alonso not alone in having high expectations.\nThe aim was to challenge Red Bull and return to the top three.\nWhile currently fourth in the championship, they are only three points ahead of Renault’s factory team and 27 behind Red Bull, who triumphed in China two weeks ago with Australian Daniel Ricciardo.\nTo rub salt in the wounds, Honda’s engine has shown notable improvement with new partners Toro Rosso.\nFrench rookie Pierre Gasly finished in fourth place for the Red Bull-owned team in Bahrain this month, a better result than anything McLaren achieved in their three years with Honda.\nAlthough Alonso has scored more points in three races (22) than in all of last year (17), McLaren’s best result so far in 2018 is a fifth place.\nAlonso, still regarded as one of the sport’s fastest drivers, has also yet to qualify in the top 10 this season.\nMcLaren announced a management shake-up earlier in April with Zak Brown appointed chief executive with overall responsibility for the team.
