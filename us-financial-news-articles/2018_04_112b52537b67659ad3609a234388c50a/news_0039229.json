It now needs only the president’s signature to come into force. \nRuling party member Abdou Mbow told Reuters the law would prevent elections from being “chaotic” by ruling out candidates with no chance of winning. \nParliamentary elections last year were marred by voting problems caused in part by the record 47 candidate lists which voters had to choose from. \nBut opposition party members say the new law is an attempt by Sall to silence opponents. \n“Macky Sall wants to impose this law on us, it’s a dictatorship,” said 40-year-old shopkeeper Baba Kane, who closed his business to join the protests on Thursday morning. \nCritics of the law say making candidates travel across the country would rule out smaller campaigns with low budgets. \n“You need a lot of money to do this, so to become president you need money,” said student Alassane Samb at the protest. \nTempers flared inside parliament and a debate on the bill was disrupted when politicians rushed to the front of the chamber, near the speaker’s chair, and began arguing furiously and pushing each other. \nLast month, former Dakar mayor and presidential contender Khalifa Sall was sentenced to five years in jail for embezzlement and falsifying documents, a penalty that Khalifa’s supporters say was politically driven.
