REUTERS/Jo Yong-Hak/Files Thursday’s Bank of Korea GDP report showed the economy expanded 1.1 percent in the first quarter, rebounding after contracting by 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter and beating the 1.0 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.\nExport volumes, particularly for memory chips and other IT products, gained 4.4 percent and added to growth.\nSamsung Electronics, South Korea’s world-leading tech exporter, posted a record quarterly profit of 11.6 trillion South Korean won ($10.75 billion) on Thursday thanks to booming sales of semiconductors used in servers.\nThe chip boom has offset soft domestic demand and the blow to tourism from diplomatic tensions with China over South Korea’s installation of a U.S. THAAD missile defence system.\nPrivate consumption, which accounts for about half of GDP, marked its slowest growth in a year, gaining a mere 0.6 percent from the previous quarter.\nThe service sector grew 0.9 percent on-quarter, but output of food and lodging services declined 0.9 percent even as South Korea hosted the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang in February-March.\n“The food and lodging sector is still suffering from fewer Chinese tourists as part of the THAAD backlash,” said Chung Kyu-il, a director general at the Bank of Korea.\n“People also went out less due to the cold wave and fine dust issues,” Chung said.\nChung said 4.1 percent growth in service sector output from ‘cultural activities’ reflects a boost from the Winter Olympics, reversing the service sector’s 1.8 percent fall in the fourth quarter.\nGiant cranes are seen at the Hanjin Shipping container terminal at Incheon New Port in Incheon, South Korea, September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/Files In annual terms, GDP rose 2.8 percent in the first quarter, on par with a 2.8 percent rise in the fourth quarter.\nGovernment spending rose 2.5 percent and posted the fastest quarterly gain in six years, thanks to higher spending on health care.\n“The expanded medical benefits boosted government spending, while surging shipments of memory chips are still supporting exports,” a Bank of Korea official said.\nPark Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank of Korea, says domestic demand will recover in the second half.\n“Exports will continue to lead growth. An increase in the minimum wage will kick in slowly and we could probably see household spending picking up in the second half,” Park said.\nEven with 17 months of uninterrupted export growth through March, policymakers are navigating the competing concerns of weak domestic consumption and household debt at about 190 percent of disposable income.\nWith youth unemployment still hovering near record levels at 11.6 percent, scarce jobs and the consequent downward pressure on wages have held back domestic demand.\nA 3.9 trillion won ($3.62 billion) government bill proposed to support firms that hire young workers has yet to be approved by the National Assembly.\nA South Korea won note is seen in this illustration photo May 31, 2017.
