REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui It was unclear why Axis, a leading gold importer, was not on the list released on Monday.\nA spokesman for the Reserve Bank of India did not have an immediate comment. An Axis Bank spokesman declined to comment.\nThe removal from the import list is a new blow for Axis, which has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in the last few months because of bad loans.\nThe move could help other leading bullion importer banks including Yes Bank ( YESB.NS ), HDFC Bank ( HDBK.NS ), Bank of Nova Scotia and Kotak Mahindra Bank ( KTKM.NS ) gain market share, said three bullion dealers at other Indian banks who asked to remain unidentified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe RBI will allow 16 banks to import bullion during the 2018/19 financial year, according to the list. Two other small private sector lenders - Karur Vysya Bank ( KARU.NS ) and South Indian Bank ( SIBK.NS ) - that were on the list last financial year did not make the latest one.\nKarur Vysya has not imported gold for the past three financial years, said a senior bank official who asked not to be identified. A spokesman for South Indian Bank also said the bank has not imported gold since 2014.\nThe latest woes add to Axis Bank’s ongoing problems including extra bad loans unearthed after an RBI audit for which it had to pay a fine.\nIt is also among companies that were ordered by the markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to conduct an internal probe into the suspected leak of financial information related to its results after a Reuters investigation.\nShares in Axis Bank ended up 0.5 percent after falling 1 percent in early trade in a Mumbai market .NSEI that rose 0.33 percent.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Additional reporting by Devidutta Tripathy and Suvashree Choudhary; Editing by Euan Rocha and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T13:40:55.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
