Bernhard Hodler, however, was appointed by the board of directors to guide the destiny of Julius Baer in the years ahead,” Sauter said in remarks prepared for the bank’s annual meeting.\nHodler said in prepared remarks that the bank should reach this year its target of reducing its cost/income ratio to 64-68 percent and would continue to seize growth opportunities.
