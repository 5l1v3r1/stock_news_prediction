The bank had 9 percent of its total assets in Russia in 2017. \n“I think this is a premature reading of the markets,” Ewald Nowotny said in an interview. “At the end of the day we do not see any direct effects on the business of Raiffeisen.” \nThe bank’s risk awareness should protect it even if the sanctions do have a broader impact on the Russian economy, Nowotny, who is also a European Central Bank policymaker, added. \nMore than 40 percent of Raiffeisen’s loan exposure in Russia is to retail clients. \nThe new round of U.S. sanctions has been a step up in severity, targeting some of Russia’s biggest tycoons at key companies such as aluminium giant Rusal and sending the rouble and many stocks exposed to the country tumbling. \nAustria’s equity index has suffered from speculation the new sanctions could disproportionately affect the country’s companies, many of which have close links to eastern Europe.
