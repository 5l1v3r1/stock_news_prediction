I’ve experienced this sort of environment first-hand, when starting the Kaplan Thaler Group over 18 years ago,” said Pillsbury. “I can’t wait to dive into the competitive markets they play in. I’m looking forward to pushing the creative product, drawing upon the agency’s unrivaled digital expertise. It’s an exciting time in Atlanta and I’m honored to be a part of this talented team. I know we will do great things together.”\nPillsbury’s experience includes rebooting Abbott’s other marquee brands: Ensure, PediaSure & Glucerna, where he built a network of agencies and supervised their creative standards and execution.\n“When I was leading the PediaSure brand at Abbott, we worked with Whitney to help reinvent our brand,” said Brent Guinn, now AMMUNITIONagency’s Chief Strategy Officer. “Whitney had an enormous impact on our brand and our efforts to grow the business. My AMMUNITIONagency colleagues and I are eager to help him apply his creativity to support our clients.”\nPillsbury also created the memorable and moving “Imagine a world without hate” social campaign for the Anti-Defamation League.
