The Board who met on April 30th, 2018, reviewed and approved the consolidated financial statement for the year closing on 31 December 2017 Audit procedures on consolidated financial statements were performed. The audited financial report is available on the Company's website.\nI. Key events of year 2017\nEuropean Medicines Agency and regulatory agencies decisions\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\nAB Science carried out a phase 2/3 study (AB10015) of masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which has met its pre-specified primary endpoint. Full efficacy and safety data have been presented at the European Network for the Cure of ALS (ENCALS) annual meeting in Ljubljana, Slovenia (18 - 20 May, 2017), and at six international conferences in 2017.\nThe primary endpoint was based on the change from baseline to week 48 in the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R).\nFor masitinib at the dose of 4.5 mg/kg/day:\nPrimary analysis on the change in ALSFRS-R score at week 48 (mLOCF methodology) was statistically significant with a P-value of 0.014. Sensitivity tests on the primary analysis consisted in two models to impute a value at week 48 for any patients who discontinued treatment before week 48. Those sensitivity analyses were also significant with a P-value of 0.015.\nAB Science filed an application for a conditional marketing authorization of masitinib in ALS at EMA in September 2016. In April 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) adopted a negative opinion for this application.\nSevere systemic mastocytosis\nCHMP adopted a negative opinion for the marketing authorization of masitinib in indolent systemic mastocytosis in September 2017.\nThe CHMP considered that there were too many uncertainties that precluded the benefit-risk assessment. These uncertainties related to i) the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) findings that were corrected too late by the Applicant, ii) the conduct of the study that excluded, from the claim and the analysis, patients with either cutaneous mastocytosis or non-severe indolent systemic mastocytosis, and iii) uncertainties regarding the long-term safety profile of masitinib for a chronic condition.\nANSM decision to suspend clinical studies in France\nThe Agence Nationale de la Sécurité des Médicaments (ANSM) requested on May 11, 2017 the suspension of the ongoing masitinib studies in France. That decision was based on previously identified deviations from Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as well as on findings from an inspection that was carried out as part of the procedure for the marketing authorization of masitinib in mastocytosis, which showed deviations in the conduct of the mastocytosis pivotal study (AB06006) and deviations related to the pharmacovigilance system.\nIn order to lift this suspension, AB Science implemented the following corrective and preventive actions:\nReorganization and strengthening of the clinical department, with the appointment of 6 new Heads of Department, having each a significant experience in clinical development. Restructuring of the pharmacovigilance system, with the outsourcing of the Serious Adverse Events (SAE) management to a qualified and experienced vendor. Conduct of external and independent audits of the quality systems (Clinical Operations, Biometry, Data Management) and clinical sites for all ongoing studies. Implementation of an upgraded Quality Management System (QMS), identified as the root cause of previous inspection findings. This new QMS has been implemented and is managed by a Quality Assurance Director recruited in October 2017. Implementation of corrective and preventive actions in all clinical departments in order to address the findings identified in previous inspections.\nAB Science is actively collaborating with ANSM in order to restart the recruitment of patients in clinical studies in France, on the basis of the corrective and preventive actions implemented by AB Science.\nClinical study results\nPrimary and secondary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis\nThe masitinib phase 3 trial for the treatment of patients with primary progressive or relapse-free secondary progressive multiple sclerosis passed the non-futility test at 2 years.\nThe ongoing phase 3 trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (AB07002) designed to assess the safety and efficacy of masitinib in patients with primary progressive or relapse-free secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The treatment period is 96 weeks. The trial is testing 2 doses of masitinib, masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day and masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day escalating to 6 mg/kg/day, versus placebo (randomization 2:1).\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is the change over 96 weeks in EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale), which is a scale used for quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time.\nBased on these results, the Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended the continuation of the study.\nThe study enrolled 656 evaluable patients as planned. The study is therefore now closed to patient enrolment.\nFinal results are expected in Q2 2019.\nSevere asthma uncontrolled by oral corticosteroids\nThe phase 3 study in severe persistent asthma uncontrolled by oral corticosteroids completed its recruitment.\nThis first phase 3 trial (AB07015) is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of masitinib in severe asthma uncontrolled by oral corticosteroids. The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of severe asthma exacerbations over the treatment period. The duration of treatment predefined by the protocol is 36 weeks. The planned recruitment is for 350 assessable patients.\nFinal results will be available by June/July 2018.\nOther events\nCapital increase through Equity Line\nOn January 13, 2017, AB Science used the Equity Line set up with Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (\"Crédit Agricole CIB\") and authorised by the Shareholders' Meeting held on 22 June 2015. AB Science proceeded with the issue of 520,091 new shares, for the price of €14.62 per share. The capital increase amount, net of commission, was €7.4 million.\nCapital increase through private placements\nAB Science successfully completed two ordinary shares private placements that resulted in gross proceeds for the Company of €34 million and to €33 million net of commission.\nA first private placement was completed on March 27, 2017, that resulted in gross proceeds for the Company of EUR 15 million. This private placement was subscribed by qualified investors and a total of 982,962 new ordinary shares were issued, through a capital increase without shareholders' preemption rights. Following an accelerated book-building process, the price of the placement was set at EUR 15.26 per new ordinary share. This price represents a 10% discount to the volume weighted average price of the last five trading days preceding the pricing date, i.e. EUR 16.95.\nA second private placement was completed on March 31, 2017, that resulted in gross proceeds for the Company of EUR 19 million. This private placement was subscribed by American and European collective investment funds investing in the pharmaceutical or biotechnological sector (including AB Science's existing shareholders) and a total of 1,241,831 new ordinary shares were issued, through a capital increase without shareholders' preemption rights. Following an accelerated book-building process, the price of the placement was set at EUR 15.30 per new ordinary share. This price represents a 10% discount to the closing stock price on March 30, 2017, i.e. EUR 17.01 and a 9.68% discount to the volume weighted average price of the last five trading days preceding the pricing date, i.e. EUR 16.94.\nOther transactions of securities\nDuring 2017:\n1,000,000 warrants were issued in December 2017 and subscribed in January 2018 by Quercegen as part of a collaboration to evaluate the clinical development of the combination of masitinib with Quercegen's compounds 39,314 share subscription warrants were allocated and subscribed in 2017 180 preference shares of nominal value of 0.01 euros were issued\nOther information\nAB Science confirms its eligibility for the PEA-SMEs in accordance with decree n°2014-283 of 4 March 2014 for the implementation of Article 70 of 2014 Finance Law n°2013-1278 of 29 December 2013, setting the PEA-PME eligibility for companies: less than 5 000 employees on one hand, a turnover lower than 1,500 million euros or total assets of less than 2,000 million, on the other hand.\nII. Recent events since the closing of the financial year\nThe recent events since the closing of the financial year are:\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nThe Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicine Agency (EMA) has adopted a negative opinion for the marketing authorization of masitinib in the treatment of adult patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.\nThe grounds for this negative opinion are:\nThe CHMP considered, based on a Good Clinical Practice inspection carried out on two of the main clinical investigation centers of the study, that the reliability of the data was not robust enough to support a registration. The CHMP did not recognize the clinical relevance of the distinction made by AB Science between patients with \"normal\" progression (accounting for 85% of patients in the study) and for whom an improvement on the primary endpoint - ALSFRS score - has been demonstrated, and those with \"rapid\" progression (accounting for 15% of patients in the study). The CHMP considered that the primary analysis of the ALSFRS score for patients who stopped the study prematurely, based on the LOCF method (last observation carried forward), could introduce a bias in the analysis of the results.\nIn order to address these grounds for refusal, AB Science will provide further analyses on each of these points as part of the re-examination procedure. The re-examination will lead the CHMP to deliver a second opinion in July 2018.\nIn the case of a conditional marketing authorization application, a confirmatory study is needed to confirm the results of this first pivotal study, even in case of positive opinion by the CHMP. AB Science will initiate in 2018 this confirmatory study in the treatment of ALS. The results of this confirmatory study are expected by the beginning of 2021.\nIDMC recommendation in primary and secondary progressive forms of multiple sclerosis\nThe Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended continuation of the phase 3 study evaluating masitinib in the treatment of primary progressive or relapse-free secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, with no Sample Size Reestimation (SSR) necessary.\nIn accordance with study protocol, an interim analysis was planned to be performed once 50% of the study population had reached the 96 weeks treatment duration period. IDMC used the conditional power (predictive probability of success) calculation based on the primary endpoint to give its recommendation regarding study continuation and SSR.\nBased on conditional power (CP) calculation using the current sample size, the IDMC recommended the continuation of the study with no reestimation of sample size meaning that according to the protocol, the predictive probability of success of the study is above 80% with the current sample size.\nAdditionally, the IDMC did not report any safety concern with masitinib in the study population.\nFinal results of the study are expected in Q2 2019.\nNo other event after the closing likely to have an impact on the financial position of the Company has occurred since closing.\nIII. 2017 and 2016 consolidated financial statements\nGlobal Profit and Loss Account - 31.12.2017 (IFRS):\n(in thousands of euros) 31.12.2017 31.12.2016 Net Revenues 1 739 1 508 Operating loss (28 404) (30 207) Net loss (27 122) (27 696) Global loss of Period (27 056) (27 724) Net income per share - in euros (0,75) (0,78) Diluted income per share - in euros (0,75) (0,78)\nOperating Results\nOperating income\n(in thousands of euros) 31.12.2017 31.12.2016 Net Revenues 1 739 1 508 Other operating revenues 0 0 Total operating income 1 739 1 508\nAs of December 31 st 2017, Operating income, consisting exclusively of sales related to the drug in veterinary medicine, amounted to 1,739 K€ against 1,508 K€ last year.

Consolidated balance sheet information\nAssets\nGiven the expected sales perspectives, development costs were expensed. Fixed assets correspond essentially to the cost of registration of the Company's patents. Registration costs of the Company's patents booked as net fixed assets increased by 3.3% as of 31 December 2017, from 1,624 K€ as of 31 December 2016 to 1,677 K€ as of 31 December 2017.\nInventories amounted to 159 K€ as of 31 December 2017 as compared to 134 K€ as of 31 December 2016.\nTrade receivable increased from 428 K€ at the end of 2016 to 449 K€ as of 31 December 2017.\nThese financial assets correspond mainly to cash instruments, the term of which is beyond 3 months.\nAs of 31 December 2017, no financial asset has a term which is beyond 3 months.\nOther current assets of the Company decreased by 6,530 K€ (9,246 K€ as of 31 December 2017, against 15,776 K€ as of 31 December 2016). This decrease is due to the 2015 research tax credit reimbursement in March 2017 (5,486 K€).\nCash amounts to 38,789 K€ as of 31 December 2017, compared to 19,780 K€ as of 31 December 2016.\nThe total cash and financial current assets amounts to 38,789 K€ as of 31 December 2017 compared to 19,780 K€ as of 31 December 2016. This cash amount does not include the 6,557 K€ corresponding to 2017 research tax credit reimbursement in 2018.\nLiabilities\nFunding used by the Company comes mainly from issue of bond loan agreements, issue of new shares with the equity line facilities (PACEO) set up with Crédit Agricole and various public aids (research tax credits, reimbursable advances and subsidies).\nThe table hereafter shows the change in the Company's equity between 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2017.\n(in thousands of euros) - IFRS norms Company Equity Equity as of 31 December 2016 (4 705) Capital increases and additional paid-in capital net of issuance costs 42 371 Total profit/loss over the period (27 056) Conversion options 0 Payments in shares 125 Equity as of 31 December 2017 10 735\nAs of 31 December 2017, the Company's net equity amounts to 10,735 K€.\nOver the last 2 years, the main variations, except for the annual profits/losses, derived from the capital increases in 2017 and 2016 respectively for 42,371 K€ and 40,899 K€.\nCurrent liabilities amount to 18,713 K€ as of 31 December 2017, compared to 20,340 K€ at the end of 2016, which represents a decrease of 8%.\nThis decrease (1,627 K€) is explained in particular by:\ndecrease in current accruals (220 K€) related to tax accrual recording; decrease in trade payable (1,146 K€); decrease in other current liabilities (259 K€).\nNon-current liabilities (21,152 K€) mainly include conditional advances for an amount of 9,331 K€ and financial instruments for 11,050 K€. They amount to 21,152 K€ as of 31 December 2017 against 22,375 K€ as of 31 December 2016, a decrease of 1,223 K€ due to financial instruments fair value variation.\nV. Foreseeable evolution of the Group's situation and future prospects\nIn 2017, AB Science implemented a transformation plan in order to ensure that clinical studies are carried out in compliance with good clinical practices. In 2018, the company continued and reinforced the implementation of these actions and intends to maintain this process of continuous improvement.\nIn 2018, AB Science continues to allocate most of its resources to the development of masitinib, the most advanced molecule of the Company.\nSeveral important results are expected in 2018 with masitinib.\n- EMA opinion in July 2018 in ALS, following the re-examination procedure.\n- Results of the interim analysis of the phase 3 study in prostate cancer in 1st line of treatment.\n- Results of the trend analysis of the phase 3 study in colorectal cancer in 3rd and 4th lines of treatment\n- Results of the trend analysis of the phase 3 study in ovarian cancer in 2nd line of treatment\n- Results of the interim analysis of the phase 3 study in pancreatic cancer\n- Results of the final analysis of the phase 3 study in severe asthma uncontrolled by oral corticosteroids\nThese results on studies that include a large sample of patients will increase the visibility on the portfolio and will lead to the identification of the indications with the greatest potential for the company.\nIn Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, since EMA opinion is evaluated in the context of a conditional marketing authorization, a confirmatory study is needed to confirm the results of this first pivotal study, even in case of positive opinion by the CHMP. AB Science will initiate in 2018 this confirmatory study in the treatment of ALS. The results of this confirmatory study are expected by the beginning of 2021.\nAB Science also intends to launch a confirmatory phase 3 study in indolent systemic mastocytosis.\nThe Company also continued to invest in drug discovery activities in order to fuel its portfolio of molecules. The Company anticipates, subject to the availability of financial resources, to begin the regulatory preclinical studies of new molecules from its own research program.\nAB Science intends to launch by the end of 2018 a phase 1/2 study in refractory acute myeloid leukemia with a new molecule developed by AB Science (AB8939).\nNext 2018 financial appointments\nFinancial communication on 1st semester 2018: August 31, 2018\nGeneral Shareholders' Meeting: June 29, 2018\nFind our complete 2017 financial report on www.ab-science.com\nAbout AB Science\nFounded in 2001, AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research, development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs), a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
