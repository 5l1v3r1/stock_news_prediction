Previous high-profile attacks have shut down factories, prompted hospitals to turn away patients and forced local emergency dispatch systems to move to manual operations.\nRansomware typically corrupts data and does not steal it. The city of Atlanta has said it does not believe private residents' information is in the hands of hackers, but they do not know for sure.\nCity officials have declined to discuss the extent of damage beyond disclosed outages that have shut down some services at municipal offices, including courts and the water department.\nNearly 6 million people live in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Georgia city itself is home to more than 450,000 people, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\nCity officials told Reuters that police files and financial documents were rendered inaccessible by unknown hackers who demanded $51,000 worth of bitcoin to provide digital keys to unlock scrambled files.\nEverything on my hard drive is gone, City Auditor Amanda Noble said in her office housed in Atlanta City Halls ornate tower.\nCity officials have not disclosed the extent to which servers for backing up information on PCs were corrupted or what kind of information they think is unrecoverable without paying the ransom.\nNoble discovered the disarray on March 22 when she turned on her computer to discover that files could not be opened after being encrypted by a powerful computer virus known as SamSam that renamed them with gibberish.\nI said, 'This is wrong,'\" she recalled.\nCity officials then quickly entered her office and told her to shut down the computer before warning the rest of the building.\nNoble is working on a personal laptop and using her smartphone to search for details of current projects mentioned in emails stored on that device.\nNot all computers were compromised. Ten of 18 machines in the auditing office were not affected, Noble said.\nOLD-SCHOOL ANALOG\nAtlanta police returned to taking written case notes and have lost access to some investigative databases, department spokesman Carlos Campos told Reuters. He declined to discuss the contents of the affected files.\n\"Our data management teams are working diligently to restore normal operations and functionalities to these systems and hope to be back online in the very near future,\" he said. By the weekend, he added, officers were returning to digital police reports.\nMeanwhile, some city employees complained they have been left in the dark, unsure when it is safe to turn on their computers.\nWe don't know anything, said one frustrated employee as she left for a lunch break on Friday.\nFEEBLE\nLike City Hall, whose 1930 neo-Gothic structure is attached to a massive modern wing, the citys computer system is a combination of old and new.\nOne of the reasons why municipalities are vulnerable is we just have so many different systems, Noble said.\nThe city published results from a recent cyber-security audit in January, and had started implementing its recommendations before the ransomware virus hit. The audit called for better record-keeping and hiring more technology workers.\nCouncilman Shook said he is worried about how much the recovery will cost the city, but that he supports funding a cyber-security overhaul to counter future attacks.\nFor now his staff are temporarily sharing one aging laptop.\nThings are very slow,\" he said. \"It was a very surreal experience to be shut down like that.\"\nMayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who took office in January, has declined to say if the city paid the ransom ahead of a March 28 deadline mentioned in an extortion note whose image was released by a local television station.\nShook, who chairs the city council's finance subcommittee, said he did not know whether the city is negotiating with the hackers, but that it appears no ransom has been paid to date.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is helping Atlanta respond, typically discourages ransomware victims from paying up.\nFBI officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman confirmed the agency is helping Atlanta respond to the attack, but declined to comment further.\nHackers typically walk away when ransoms are not paid, said Mark Weatherford, a former senior DHS cyber official.\nWeatherford, who previously served as California's chief information security officer, said the situation might have been resolved with little pain if the city had quickly made that payment.\n\"The longer it goes, the worse it gets,\" he said. This could turn out to be really bad if they never get their data back.\" (Reporting by Laila Kearney; additional reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Daniel Bases and Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:51:27.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
