Some consumers were allegedly charged double payments, the complaint said.\nLendingClub shares were down as much as 15 percent following the news.\nThe San Francisco based startup is one of the largest companies known as peer-to-peer lenders and runs a website where consumers can apply for loans that are either funded by individual investors or by institutions such as banks.\n“We support the important role that the FTC plays in encouraging appropriate standards and best practices,” a spokesman for LendingClub said in a written statement. “In this case, we believe the FTC is wrong, and are very disappointed that it was not possible to resolve this matter constructively with the agency’s current leadership.”\nLendingClub has been in recovery mode since May 2016, when it acknowledged issues including the way it had sold loans to an investor, prompting the departure of its then chief executive.
