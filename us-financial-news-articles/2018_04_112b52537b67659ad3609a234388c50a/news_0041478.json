Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City v Burnley - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - April 22, 2018 Stoke City's Stephen Ireland after the match Action Images via Reuters/Ed Sykes \nBadou Ndiaye gave Stoke the lead in the 11th minute, via a deflection off the boot of Burnley’s Kevin Long — an advantage they seemed comfortable with for the remainder of the first half. \nHowever, Burnley upped the tempo after the break and went level in the 62nd minute thanks to Ashley Barnes, his sixth goal in his last eight league games. \nNeither team could find a winner, meaning that with three games to play, Stoke are four points behind Swansea City in 19th, with the South Wales side having played two games less. Burnley stay seventh, four points behind Arsenal in sixth.

Mame Biram Diouf laid off the ball unselfishly for Ndiaye, whose strike was deflected home by Long.
