With more than 28 product candidates in clinical development, MorphoSys boasts a large and diverse pipeline, composed of both proprietary and partnered programs, in multiple therapeutic areas and across all development phases of drug candidates.\n“MorphoSys has a proven track record of applying its proprietary technology to developing innovative therapeutic candidates,” said Dr. Simon E. Moroney, D. Phil, Co-founder & Chief Executive Officer of MorphoSys. “The recent successful launch of Tremfya® by our partner Janssen was an important milestone for MorphoSys, as it was the first market introduction of a therapeutic agent made using our proprietary technology.

Our Nasdaq listing is an important part of our plan to advance the development of MOR208 in preparation for its potential commercialization in the United States.
