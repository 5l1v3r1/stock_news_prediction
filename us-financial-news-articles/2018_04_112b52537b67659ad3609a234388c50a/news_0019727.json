He was hitless in his previous 12 at-bats and hitless in his first 13 at-bats with runners in scoring position before lining a double to left.\nSchoop then added a run-scoring single in his next at-bat off Estrada with no outs in the fifth. The second baseman’s third multi-hit game of the season raised his batting average from .189 to .211.\nChris Davis and Chance Sisco contributed RBI singles, and Tim Beckham lifted a sacrifice fly for the Orioles. Baltimore went 6-for-14 with runners in scoring position after going 2-for-16 with runners in scoring position over the previous two games in the series, both Toronto wins.\nBaltimore’s Kevin Gausman (1-1) allowed three runs and six hits in six innings. He struck out seven, walked three and threw 106 pitches.\nBrad Brach pitched a scoreless ninth for his third save.\nAldemys Diaz hit his third homer of the season for Toronto, which has homered in 12 of its first 13 games this season.\nKevin Pillar and Yangervis Solarte hit RBI singles for the Blue Jays, who were unable to complete their first series sweep in Baltimore since July 2010.\nThe Blue Jays gave Josh Donaldson the night off from the starting lineup and batted Justin Smoak second for the first time in his career. Smoak went 0-for-3 with a walk and a run.\nEstrada allowed four runs and six hits in four-plus innings.\nManny Machado recorded Baltimore’s first hit with a leadoff double in the fourth, and he scored on a double by Schoop. Davis made it 2-1 with a base hit to right, and Beckham lifted a sacrifice fly later in the inning.\nSolarte made it a one-run game with a two-out base hit to left in the fifth. Baltimore loaded the bases on a bloop base hit to right field that was changed from a foul ball after a review of 4 minutes, 10 seconds initiated by the Orioles.\nOn the next pitch, Schoop blooped a single to knock out Estrada for a 4-2 lead.\nDiaz made it a one-run game again by lifting a 1-0 fastball into the left field seats with two outs in the sixth. Sisco made it 5-3 with a single up the middle in the sixth off John Axford.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:03:24.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
