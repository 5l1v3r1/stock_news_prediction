It has a strong overseas presence, including China where it plans to have 1,200 outlets by 2022. Hotel chain Premier Inn—operating 72,466 rooms in the U.K.—recently acquired 19 hotels in Germany, comprising 3,100 rooms.\n“We need more expertise in Premier Inn to focus on Germany and in Costa to concentrate on China,” said Mr. Cadbury.\nWhitbread has followed this blueprint before. It previously owned the U.K. franchise of restaurant operator TGI Friday’s Inc., David Lloyd Leisure Ltd. health clubs, a number of Marriott International Inc. hotels and a stake in Britvic PLC, a soft-drink maker. “We have a history of buying companies, growing them and selling them again,” Mr. Cadbury said.\nElliott’s management said “it is pleased that Whitbread has announced a demerger,” adding the break up should be done within six months.\nNewsletter Sign-up The company will likely take longer to complete the Costa spinoff, as the group is in the middle of a £100 million ($139.4 million) cost-saving exercise to offset higher inflation. That program is set to conclude in 2020. “It is important that we get these additional efficiencies before the demerger,” Mr. Cadbury said. The company is working with over 2,000 suppliers to reach its cost-savings target, he said.\nIt is too early to tell what impact the demerger will have on Whitbread’s finances, Mr. Cadbury said. Roughly 1,000 of the group’s employees work for both Premier Inn and Costa, and will be given a choice to transfer to the new unit, Mr. Cadbury said.\nWhitbread on Wednesday reported a pretax profit of £548.4 million for the financial year ended March 1, compared with £515.4 million the year before. Revenues rose to £3.30 billion from £3.11 billion.\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T20:11:40.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
