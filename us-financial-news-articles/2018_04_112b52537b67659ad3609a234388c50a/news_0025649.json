This would allow the transportation unit to combine assets and leave GE shareholders with stakes in multiple public companies. \nOngoing restructuring under CEO John Flannery, who took the helm in August of last year, includes plans to sell $20 billion of the company’s assets . For example, Veritas Capital plans to acquire a GE healthcare unit for $1.05 billion , but the deals announced so far are worth less than $4 billion in total . \nGE Transportation, which makes diesel freight locomotives, could be a model for how other parts of the business could be spun off or taken public rather than sold as a whole, according to people familiar with the strategy. \nSome pointed to past examples like Baker Hughes , an oil-field services company that is majority owned by GE, and the Dow-DuPont deal, which combined two firms with the idea of eventually becoming three separate companies, as possibilities for how spinoffs might look moving forward . \nThe transportation unit is worth about $7 billion, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch , but it has been hit by declining demand for locomotives and had sales of $4.2 billion last year. \nGE was the worst performing stock in the Dow in 2017 . This time last year, GE shares were trading at nearly $30, compared to just $13 on Thursday. \n“The pressure on GE to announce some sort of break-up is very high,” analyst Scott Davis of Melius Research wrote in a note to clients last month .
