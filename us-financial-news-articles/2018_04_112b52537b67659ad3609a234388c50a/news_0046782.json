Six people had been arrested in relation to the find. Two were detained in Lyon, France, one in Algeciras and three in Malaga.\nCustoms did not say when the bust was made though the shipment was last inspected by police on Sunday, according to the statement.\nThe operation followed a bust in December of 6 tonnes of cocaine also in Algeciras, the Mediterraneanâ€™s largest port and a trans-shipment hub used by firms to unload cargo and redistribute it in Europe or the Middle East.\nReporting by Paul Day, Editing by Julien Toyer and Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T13:20:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
