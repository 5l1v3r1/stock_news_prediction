(TSX Venture:BTL) (“ BTL ” or the “ Company ”) today announces it has filed its audited consolidated financial statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended 31st December 2017. These documents can be accessed from the www.btl.co website or the SEDAR website.\nBTL is a technology provider that has been developing Interbit TM , a token free, blockchain platform that will enable absolute privacy of metadata and rapid application development in a practical design framework.

On March 30, 2018, BTL’s cash position was $16,700,000.\nHighlights from 2017\nThe key and critical pilot project BTL conducted in 2017 was the adoption of Interbit by a consortium of large European energy companies to track natural gas trades from the point of inception through to trade reconciliation (see the Company’s June 5, 2017 press release). The Company also filed patents on the Interbit platform and the underlying Hypervisor architecture (see the Company’s October 17, 2017 press release). Interbit is a new generation blockchain platform with “unique chain joining capability” with the capacity to inter-connect many thousands of Interbit blockchains.\nOutlook\nThe Company’s goals for 2018 is to focus on the release of Interbit, and its subsequent third party software audit. Supported by global marketing campaigns, the Company’s existing and growing customer base and extensive partner community is expected to drive user-adoption of Interbit. In further news, Interbit will co-host Coindesk's international Building Blocks Hackathon in New York City on May 12th, as part of the 2018 Consensus show.
