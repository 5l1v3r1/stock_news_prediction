(NYSE:SAVE) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFor the first quarter 2018, Spirit reported a GAAP net loss of $44.9 million (loss of $0.66 per diluted share). Excluding special items, first quarter 2018 net income was $29.9 million ($0.44 per diluted share) 1 .\nGAAP operating margin for the first quarter 2018 was negative 5.5 percent. Excluding special items, operating margin for the first quarter 2018 was 7.3 percent 1 .\nSpirit ended the first quarter 2018 with unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $999.7 million.\n“We ran a very good operation in the first quarter 2018, despite numerous winter storms. We achieved a record high March DOT on-time performance of 85.1 percent, an increase of 10.1 percentage points year over year, contributing to a record high first quarter DOT on-time performance of 83.4 percent. I congratulate and thank the Spirit family for delivering this operational excellence. I’m also pleased to say that during the quarter, we finalized a five-year contract with our pilot union. This new contract provides our pilots increased wage rates and gives the Company the platform to further improve our operational reliability,” said Robert Fornaro, Spirit’s Chief Executive Officer.\nRevenue Performance\nFor the first quarter 2018, Spirit's total operating revenue was $704.1 million, an increase of 19.4 percent compared to the first quarter 2017, driven by a 14.4 percent increase in flight volume.\nTotal revenue per available seat mile (\"TRASM\") for the first quarter 2018 decreased 2.4 percent compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by a 1.7 percent decrease in operating yields and a 4.1 percent increase in average stage length. During the first quarter 2018, the Company's results benefited from the calendar shift of Easter by approximately 200 basis points.\nOn a per passenger flight segment basis, total revenue for the first quarter 2018 increased 1.7 percent year over year to $107.71, driven by non-ticket revenue per passenger flight segment increasing 5.9 percent to $55.29 2 , partially offset by fare revenue per passenger flight segment decreasing 2.4 percent to $52.42.\nCost Performance\nFor the first quarter 2018, total GAAP operating expense, including special items of $90.0 million 3 , increased 39.8 percent, or $211.3 million year over year to $742.9 million. The year-over-year increase in GAAP operating expense was primarily driven by special charges in connection with the new pilot agreement approved in February 2018; increased flight volume; and higher fuel rates.\nAdjusted operating expense for the first quarter 2018 increased 24.2 percent, or $127.2 million to $652.9 million 4 . The year-over-year increase in adjusted operating expense was primarily driven by increases in flight volume, salaries, wages and benefits, and fuel rates. In addition, higher rates for crew lodging and ground handling, along with greater deicing expense, drove an increase in other operating expense.\nAircraft fuel expense increased in the first quarter 2018 by 46.4 percent, or $64.9 million, compared to the same period last year, due to a 21.5 percent increase in the cost of fuel per gallon and a 20.2 percent increase in fuel gallons consumed.\nSpirit reported first quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (\"ASM\"), excluding special items and fuel (“Adjusted CASM ex-fuel”), of 5.33 cents 4 , a decrease of 5.0 percent compared to the same period last year. The decrease year over year was primarily driven by lower aircraft rent per ASM.\nLabor\nSpirit and its pilots, represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, announced the ratification of a new five-year working agreement in February 2018.\nFleet\nSpirit took delivery of five new A321ceo aircraft and one new A320ceo aircraft during the first quarter 2018, ending the quarter with 118 aircraft in its fleet.\nAircraft Agreement\nOn March 28, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with an aircraft lessor to purchase 14 A319 aircraft, which the Company was operating under lease agreements. The purchases of all 14 aircraft are scheduled throughout the second quarter of 2018, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $285.0 million, which will be reduced by the application of maintenance reserves and security deposits held by the lessor. Effective March 31, 2018, the lease agreements associated with these aircraft will be classified as capital leases on the balance sheet until the closing of each individual sale. All transactions are anticipated to be completed prior to June 30, 2018.\nRecent New Routes and Service Announcements\nColumbus, Ohio - Fort Lauderdale (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Orlando (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Las Vegas (02/15/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Fort Myers (02/15/18)*\nColumbus, Ohio - Tampa (02/15/2018)*\nRichmond - Fort Lauderdale (03/15/2018)\nRichmond - Orlando (03/15/2018)\nFort Lauderdale - Guayaquil, Ecuador (03/22/2018)\nBaltimore - Denver (03/22/2018)\nBaltimore - Montego Bay (03/22/2018)\nColumbus, Ohio - Myrtle Beach (03/22/2018)*\nColumbus, Ohio - New Orleans (03/22/2018)*\nAtlantic City - New Orleans (04/12/2018)\nFort Lauderdale - St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands (05/24/2018)\n* Indicates seasonal service\nConference Call/Webcast Detail\nSpirit will conduct a conference call to discuss these results today, April 26, 2018, at 9:30 a.m. ET.

The Company is providing a reconciliation of GAAP financial information to non-GAAP financial information as it believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors the ability to measure the performance of the Company on a consistent basis. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. Because of these limitations, determinations of the Company's operating performance excluding unrealized gains and losses or special items should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSpecial Items\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, (in thousands) 2018 2017 Operating special items include the following: Loss on disposal of assets 848 1,105 Operating special charges (1) 89,168 4,776 Total operating special items $ 90,016 $ 5,881 Non-operating special items include the following: Non-operating special charges (2) 9,201 — Total non-operating special items $ 9,201 $ — Total special items $ 99,217 $ 5,881 (1) Operating special charges for 2018 consisted of $89.2 million recognized in connection with the new pilot agreement approved in February 2018.

Operating special charges for 2017 primarily consisted of lease termination costs. (2) Non-operating special charges for the first quarter 2018 are related to the purchase of 14 A319-100 aircraft.

We calculate ROIC as Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP), divided by Total Invested Capital (non-GAAP), on a pre-tax and after-tax basis, expressed as a percentage.\nBecause a substantial portion of our aircraft fleet is held under operating leases, which do not appear on the balance sheet, a GAAP-based calculation of our total capital deployed may be considered understated (which would have the effect of overstating ROIC, if calculated solely using GAAP line items). Accordingly, we adjust our total capital, the denominator of the ROIC measurement, by capitalizing operating leases at a multiple of seven times our aircraft rent expense, a measure used commonly in the airline industry and by analysts.\nTo calculate Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP), we add back aircraft rent to GAAP operating income, consistent with the adjustment to total capital discussed above. In order to remove the effects of non-recurring gains and losses that may affect GAAP operating income, we also exclude special items from Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP). We present Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) on a pre-tax basis and present Adjusted Operating Income (non-GAAP) on an after-tax basis, using our effective tax rate for the period.\nCalculation of Return on Invested Capital, non-GAAP\n(unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended (in thousands) March 31, 2018 Operating income $ 287,686 Add operating special items (1) 96,846 Adjustment for aircraft rent 203,058 Adjusted operating income, non-GAAP 587,590 Tax (35.4%) 208,007 Adjusted operating income, after-tax, non-GAAP $ 379,583 Invested capital: Adjusted total debt (2) $ 1,707,416 Book equity 1,719,805 Less: Unrestricted cash, cash equivalents & short-term investments 999,711 Add: Capitalized aircraft operating leases (7x Aircraft Rent) 1,421,406 Total invested capital, non-GAAP $ 3,848,916 Return on invested capital (ROIC), pre-tax, non-GAAP 15.3 % Return on invested capital (ROIC), after-tax, non-GAAP 9.9 % (1) See \"Special Items\" for more details (2) Excludes the effect of temporarily capitalizing the leases associated with the purchase of 14 leased A319 aircraft.
