Last month, Somalia voted to ban DP World from the country. The port operator, owned by the UAE’s Dubai government, is developing a port in Somaliland, a semi-autonomous region in Somalia.\nIt is unclear how Somalia’s federal government could enforce the ban given Somaliland has acted as a de-facto state since 1991.\n(This version of the story fixes typo in penultimate paragraph)\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell and Noah Browning; Editing by Alison Williams and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:57:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
