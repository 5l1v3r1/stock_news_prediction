Crawford with the go-ahead run.\nThe winning pitcher was Drew Hutchison (1-0), who threw two scoreless innings. He retired Ender Inciarte on a fly ball with two runners on base to end the game.\nNeither starting pitcher figured in the decision. Philadelphia’s Nick Pivetta lasted only four innings and allowed three runs on five hits and two walks, with three strikeouts. Atlanta’s Mike Folytnewicz made it through five innings and allowed three runs, two earned, on five hits and one walk. He struck out seven and had two wild pitches.\nThe Phillies scored a run in the second inning when Rhys Hoskins banged a solo homer to left field and added another run in the third inning on a sacrifice fly from Santana.\nThe Braves tied the game with two runs in the third. Ryan Flaherty doubled home Dansby Swanson, then scored on Inciarte’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Braves took the lead with a two-out rally in the fourth. Kurt Suzuki was hit by a pitch, took second on Preston Tucker’s single and scored on Swanson’s RBI single. Suzuki left the game after the inning ended, leaving the Braves with only one healthy catcher. Tyler Flowers had to leave Thursday’s season opener after straining a left oblique and was placed on the 10-day disabled list.\nPhiladelphia evened the score in the fifth inning on Santana’s solo homer and took a 4-3 lead in the sixth on Nick Williams’ pinch-hit RBI single off reliever Jose Ramirez.\nAtlanta tied the game in the eighth inning. Freddie Freeman walked and took third on an infield grounder after the Phillies’ shift left no defender at third.\nFreeman crossed on Tucker’s RBI single. The Braves appeared to have taken when Swanson doubled to left to drive in pinch-runner Peter Bourjos.\nBut Philadelphia appealed the play at home and Bourjos was ruled out after a video review.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T12:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:30:57.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
