On its site, the Sunlight Foundation similarly noted that the “unexplained censorship” raises questions about the administration’s “commitment to public health.”\nOur new @SunWebIntegrity reports document the removal of breast cancer and LGBT health info from @HHSGov 's @womenshealth website. This censorship sows real doubt about health considerations for populations of vulnerable women throughout the country: https://t.co/G2nlCRB5Td\n— Andrew Bergman (@andmbergman) April 2, 2018\nTrump HHS spokespeople told ThinkProgress , which reported on the Sunlight Foundation’s findings, that the information wasn’t actually gone—it’s just in other parts of the HHS website. “The pages were removed on Dec. 6, 2017 because content was not mobile-friendly and very rarely used,” said HHS. “Before we update any of the information…we engage in a comprehensive audit and use analysis processes that include reviewing other federal consumer health websites to ensure we are not duplicating efforts or presenting redundant information.”\nHHS said the information could be accessible on WomensHealth.gov . But as Bustle notes , the cancer section of that website doesn’t actually have a breakout for breast cancer —only for uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancers.\nThe average American woman has a one in eight chance of developing breast cancer in her lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Those numbers are far higher in certain states, and poorer, minority women are still more likely to die of breast cancer than richer, white women, in part because of poor access to medical services (or a lack of knowledge about them).", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/womenshealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://thinkprogress.org/health-department-removes-breast-cancer-obamacare-information-womens-health-a75d9c1eb5db/", "https://twitter.com/SunWebIntegrity?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/andmbergman/status/980929893373566976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://sunlightfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AAR-4-OWH-Breast-Cancer-180329.pdf", "https://twitter.com/HHSGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://t.co/G2nlCRB5Td", "https://www.bustle.com/p/trumps-health-department-wiped-breast-cancer-info-from-its-website-didnt-plan-on-letting-you-know-8675145", "https://www.womenshealth.gov/", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/04/02/unexplained-censorship-of-womens-health-website-renews-questions-about-trump-administration-commitment-to-public-health/", "https://www.womenshealth.gov/cancer", "https://twitter.com/andmbergman/status/980929893373566976?"], "published": "2018-04-04T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T20:30:51.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
