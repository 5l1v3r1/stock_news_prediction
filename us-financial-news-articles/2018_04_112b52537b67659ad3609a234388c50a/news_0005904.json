Most were privately owned vehicles sold to dealers. \nCo-founder Christian Bertermann declined to say whether Auto1 was profitable, nor did he give any forecasts for this year, but told Reuters the company was looking to enter the few remaining European markets where it is not yet present. \n“We will continue to work on making selling and buying used vehicles easier, more transparent and more trustworthy,” Bertermann said on Wednesday.
