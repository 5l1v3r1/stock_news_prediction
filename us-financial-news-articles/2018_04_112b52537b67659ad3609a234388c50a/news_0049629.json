Lastly, thanks to our Board of Directors for helping us navigate through challenging times while we transformed our business and positioned it for an exciting future.\"\nGary Cuccio said, \"On behalf of the Board and all xG Technology employees, I want to thank George Schmitt for his years of dedication and service to the Company.
