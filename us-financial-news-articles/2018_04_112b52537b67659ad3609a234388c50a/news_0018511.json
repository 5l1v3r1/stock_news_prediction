REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo \nSpacey, 58, became embroiled in controversy last year when actor Anthony Rapp accused him of trying to seduce him in 1986 when Rapp was 14. \nSpacey later apologised for any inappropriate conduct while denying any specific memory of the behaviour in question. The film star also came under fire for using the occasion to acknowledge for the first time that he was gay, a statement gay advocates criticized as conflating issues of sexual wrongdoing with sexual orientation. \nThe fallout was swift and severe. In addition to being dropped from the sixth and final season of “House of Cards,” Spacey was erased from the movie “All the Money in the World,” and actor Christopher Plummer was brought in take over his role and reshoot all of Spacey’s scenes. \nNetflix reported a $39 million write-off on Spacey-related projects in January. \nNBC News first reported on Wednesday that a sexual assault case against Spacey had been presented to the district attorney’s office.
