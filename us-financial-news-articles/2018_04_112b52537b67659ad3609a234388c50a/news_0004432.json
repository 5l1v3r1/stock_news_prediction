Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) slipped 0.2 percent and Al Rajhi Bank fell 1.2 percent. \nDubai’s Al Mal Capital said of investors’ response to the FTSE decision: “The muted market reaction suggests that retail investors were positioned for it and were in no rush to add exposure. \n“At 17.5 times trailing twelve-month earnings, the overall market valuation is not cheap and at a small premium to its historical average,” Al Mal said, adding that it was hard to justify some current Saudi valuations, such as SABIC trading at 19 times earnings. \nHowever, Al Mal and other fund managers noted that the FTSE decision was long-term positive for Saudi Arabia, and with the planned listing of national oil giant Saudi Aramco, could give it roughly as much weight in global portfolios as mainstream emerging markets such as India and Brazil. \nExchange data released after the close showed all types of foreign investors bought a net $301 million of Saudi stocks last week, the third highest total on record. \nReal estate developer Jabal Omar dropped 2.9 percent after reporting it swung to an annual net loss of 601 million riyals ($160.2 million); it cited weak revenue from sales of residential units due to delays in obtaining marketing permits, and higher administrative and general expenses. \nPrince Alwaleed bin Talal’s investment firm Kingdom Holding gained 2.6 percent after the company proposed a cash dividend of 0.50 riyal per share for 2017, the same as in previous years, a fresh sign that the company’s operations have not so far been seriously impacted by his detention in Saudi Arabia’s corruption probe. \nPrince Alwaleed was freed in January and has insisted he is innocent of any wrongdoing, though Saudi officials said he signed an undisclosed settlement. \nThe Dubai index closed up 0.9 percent, rebounding from losses in recent weeks as funds flowed to Saudi Arabia in anticipation of its upgrade. Deyaar Development was the most heavily traded stock, rising 1.7 percent as it continued to rebound after hitting a 10-month low last week. \nIn Kuwait, the market was divided into three segments on Sunday as part of reforms designed by the exchange to boost liquidity and attract more foreign money: the premier market, the main market and the auction market. \nThe index of the premier market, home to the largest and most liquid companies, fell 1.1 percent. SAUDI ARABIA \n* The index fell 0.9 percent down to 7,801 points. DUBAI \n* The index gained 0.9 percent to 3,136 points. ABU DHABI \n* The index shed 0.04 percent to 4,584 points. QATAR \n* The index rose 1.1 percent to 8,669 points. EGYPT \n* The index gained 0.8 percent to 17,596 points. KUWAIT \n* The index fell 1.1 percent to 4,946 points. BAHRAIN \n* The index lost 1.2 percent to 1,303 points. OMAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T17:43:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
