In addition, the report Tuesday said conditions in its egg-processing facility allow for pathogens to survive and spread. \nRose Acre Farms, based in Seymour, Ind., voluntarily recalled nearly 207 million eggs on April 13 , after more than 20 people reported salmonella illnesses that have been tied to the eggs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday launched an investigation into a salmonella outbreak that has spread to nine states. \nMoneyish: These are the 12 ‘dirtiest’ fruits and veggies in your fridge \nThe FDA’s report “is based on raw observations and in some cases lack proper context,” said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for Rose Acre Farms. He said the company was preparing a formal response to the FDA and urged “everyone to wait until all the facts are presented.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T23:44:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
