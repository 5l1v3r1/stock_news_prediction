With a one firm mentality, we are able to offer full, multi-disciplinary and market solutions regardless of numbers within our office,\" states Craig Schwerdtfeger , AIA, ISG Principal, Senior Architect. \"However, we are deeply committed to the community and find the opportunity to bring in talent from other areas inside and outside of the State truly unique,\" notes Craig.\nTim will take on a visible role in ISG's Waterloo/Cedar Falls evolution as Principal, building the local civil engineering team and supporting office growth initiatives.
