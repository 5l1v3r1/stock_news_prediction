It rose 0.2 percent the previous day, ending a four-day losing streak.\nThe euro traded flat at $1.2328 after losing 0.3 percent the previous day, which ended a four-day winning run.\nThe common currency has risen 0.4 percent this week, supported by comments from European Central bank officials that reinforced expectations towards monetary policy normalisation.\nThe Swiss franc, a perceived safe-haven currency, was little changed at 0.9534 per dollar after losing 0.5 percent overnight.
