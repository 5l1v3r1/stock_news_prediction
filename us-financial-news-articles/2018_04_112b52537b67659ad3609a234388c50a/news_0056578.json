The government estimates the number at 20,000 once migrant and informal laborers leave. The island will remain open only to local residents holding government-issued identity cards.\nBy Jake Maxwell Watts\nThe last tourists on the popular Philippines tropical island of Boracay were told to pack their swimsuits and leave Thursday as a government shutdown took effect to scrub the paradise clean of sewage and curb overdevelopment.\nMore than 600 members of the security forces, including the police and coast guard, will patrol Boracay to enforce the closure ordered by President Rodrigo Duterte, who has described the island as a “cesspool.” There were no estimates on the number of remaining tourists, but arrivals have been slowing after weeks of warnings and flight cancellations.\nAround two million tourists flock to the white sandy beaches each year, but the government says uncontrolled development and pollution from sewage pipes that lead straight into the sea is destroying the environment and making it unsafe to swim.\nDamage from tourism to Southeast Asia’s tropical islands has prompted other governments to take similar action. Last month, Thailand said it would close Maya Bay on Phi Phi Leh, the setting for the Leonardo DiCaprio movie “The Beach,” for four months a year.\nA boom in Chinese visitors and proliferation of cheap flights has added to the strain of throngs of visitors from Europe, the U.S. and other places to islands that have failed to constrain illegal construction and build adequate infrastructure.
