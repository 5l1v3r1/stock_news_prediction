Wainwright & Co., LLC acted as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.\nRXi issued 1,510,604 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $3.15 per share. Additionally, in a concurrent private placement offering, RXi issued unregistered warrants to purchase a total of 1,132,953 shares of common stock, representing 75% of the shares of common stock purchased in the registered offering. Each warrant has been sold at a price of $0.125 per underlying warrant share, is exercisable at an exercise price of $3.15 per share and exercisable immediately and will expire on the earlier of five and one-half years from the issuance date and 5 years from the date a registration statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants becomes effective.\nThe net proceeds of the offering are estimated to be approximately $4.1 million, after deducting placement agent fees and estimated offering expenses. RXi plans to use the net proceeds to fund the preclinical and clinical development of its immuno-oncology program, for other research and development activities and for general working capital needs.\nThe shares of common stock (but not the warrants or the shares of common stock underlying the warrants) were offered pursuant to a \"shelf\" registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and the base prospectus contained therein (File No. 333-224031). The offering of the shares of common stock were made only by means of a written prospectus and prospectus supplement forming a part of the registration statement. The warrants described above were offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, have not been registered under the Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the warrants and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and such applicable state securities laws.\nCopies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus may be obtained on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov or by contacting H.C.

Building on the pioneering discovery of RNAi, scientists at RXi have harnessed the naturally occurring RNAi process which can be used to \"silence\" or down-regulate the expression of a specific gene that may be overexpressed in a disease condition. RXi developed a robust RNAi therapeutic platform, including sd-rxRNA compounds, that has the potential to highly selectively block the expression of any target in the genome, thus providing applicability to many therapeutic areas.
