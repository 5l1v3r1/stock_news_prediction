It's a great deal for them.\" \nChina is forecast to import a record 97 million tonnes of soybeans in 2017/18, with the meal used to feed its livestock including the world's largest pig herd. \nBRAZIL TOP SUPPLIER \nBrazil is China's top supplier with 53 percent of total purchases in 2017 followed by the United States at 34 percent and Argentina with seven percent, according to customs data. \n\"Brazil has no means to replace the entire supply of soybeans from the U.S. going to China,\" said Fabio Trigueirinho, executive director of Abiove, the oilseed crushers association. \n\"While Brazil is likely to increase soybean exports to China (if the tariffs are imposed), U.S. suppliers can take advantage in markets where Brazil's share of exports will drop.\" \nThere is also be a reluctance in Brazil to boost shipments to a country which already takes 70 percent of its exports. \n\"As producers we cannot depend on only one buyer. Suppose Brazil sells soybeans to 15 countries and decides to re-route to China. That is not the right strategy,\" said Jose Sismeiro, a soybean and corn grower in the state of Parana. \n\"What happens if the U.S. and China make amends? I think we should keep our client base as wide as possible.\" \nOther smaller exporters such as Ukraine may boost sales to China with the right price signal but cannot replace the volumes currently being shipped by the United States. \n\"Potentially Chinese buyers can more actively buy in Ukraine - theoretically up to 500,000 tonnes per season - but only if the price is attractive to sellers,\" said Yulia Garkavenko of UkrAgroConsult consultancy. \nUkraine shipped a modest 20,000 tonnes to China in 2016/17. \nU.S. farmers meanwhile will soon begin planting this year's soybean crop and appear largely unperturbed by the posturing. \nThe tariff threat caused a short-lived slide in Chicago soybean futures but prices quickly rebounded and set a five-week high on Friday. \n\"The (U.S.) President said he was not going to let ag be a casualty of this trade war,\" said Ohio farmer Jim Hefner who plans to plant more soybeans this year. \n\"He did not promise there would be no pain but I would like to take him at his word and hope for the best.\" (Additional reporting by Mark Weinraub, Karl Plume, Ana Mano, Roberto Samora, Luc Cohen, Maximilian Heath, Michael Hogan and Pavel Polityuk; Editing by Veronica Brown and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:57:46.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
