Tax cuts are making expansion through acquisitions more attractive, injecting positive momentum into the M&A market.\nClick here to access the full report: www.bglco.com/bgl_metals_insider_tax_reform_to_boost_ma .\nLiquidity remains high, with corporate balance sheets flush with cash and debt financing capacity ample to fund acquisitions. The need for acquisition-driven growth among public buyers is keeping M&A multiples for healthy companies strong.\nRecent tax legislation has incentivized corporations and other strategic buyers to \"buy\" versus \"build\". Buyers are taking advantage of today's tax savings window to tap cash flows from acquisitions sooner, and with lower after-tax return hurdles can pay more for quality assets, potentially increasing valuations.\nManufacturing has been particularly active as participants seek value-added capabilities to capture margin. AK Steel's $360 million acquisition of Precision Partners, which specializes in lightweighting and complex metal components, expands its value proposition in the automotive market, fetching a premium valuation at approximately 7x adjusted 2017 EBITDA. Park-Ohio acquired Canton Drop Forge, a maker of custom closed die forgings and components, to increase its presence in the global aerospace market. Service centers continue to pursue service line and geographic expansion. Ryerson, Olympic Steel, Russel Metals, and Samuel, Son & Co. each announced bolt-on acquisitions during the last six months.\nBGL publishes periodic Insider research publications on a variety of industries including automotive; building products and construction materials; business services; consumer and retail; environmental and industrial services; healthcare and life sciences; industrials; metals; and plastics and packaging.
