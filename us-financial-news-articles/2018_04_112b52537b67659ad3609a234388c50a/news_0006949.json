It is expected that by 2040 the production of renewable electricity will be able to guarantee, in a cost-effective way, the total annual electricity consumption of mainland Portugal,” the report said.\n“These data, besides indicating a historical milestone in the Portuguese electricity sector, demonstrate that renewable energy can be relied upon as a secure and viable source with which to completely meet the country’s electricity demands.”\nSeparately on Tuesday the government suspended subsidies for guaranteed power supplies paid to producers, worth about 20 million euros a year, most of which goes to fossil fuel plants left in stand-by mode.\nHydroelectric dams in March accounted for 55 percent of monthly consumption followed by wind power at 42 percent. Portugal, with its long Atlantic coast line, was one of the early pioneers in the mass use of wind power.\nMarch saw four times the monthly average rainfall, ending a long period of severe drought in the country, according to the Portuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute. The downpour refilled most of the dammed reservoirs to levels of over 80 percent.\nThe renewable generation reduced Portugal’s carbon dioxide emissions by 1.8 million tons and helped the country’s export balance.\nThe average daily wholesale market price fell to 39.75 euros per MWh from 43.94 euros a year earlier, when renewables were able to meet only 6 percent of the electricity demand amid the drought.\nPortugal’s electricity prices are among the highest in the European Union.
