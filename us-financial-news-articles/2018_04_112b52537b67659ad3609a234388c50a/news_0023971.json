President Donald Trump signed a bill in December that lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.\n\"This will be the first quarter corporations will benefit from the Trump administration's tax policy, which is a key reason growth jumped from 10.4% at the start of the year to above 16% by the end of January,\" Bell said.\nBut the stock market comes into the earnings season amid a spike in volatility, fueled in part by worries about rising interest rates and increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and key partners like Mexico and China.\nThe S&P 500 fell 1.2 percent in the first quarter and more than 4 percent in the past month.\n\"We are nervous that market turmoil could result in tempered Q2 guidance from corporate management teams,\" Bell said.\nCorporate earnings season kicked off Thursday, with asset manager BlackRock and Delta Air Lines reporting higher-than-expected profits. Citigroup , J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo are among the companies scheduled to report Friday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T18:30:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
