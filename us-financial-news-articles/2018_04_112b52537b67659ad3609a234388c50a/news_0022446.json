We can't have like willy-nilly proliferation of fake news, that's crazy,\" he said.\n\"You can't have more clicks on fake news than real news. That's allowing public deception to go unchecked,\" Musk told King, according to a clip of the interview published Wednesday. The full interview is set to air Thursday. \nZuckerberg himself has also indicated he is open to regulation .\n\"My position is not that there should be no regulation,\" Zuckerberg said Tuesday in Congressional testimony . \"I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people's lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not.\"\nIn March, after news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Musk deleted the Facebook pages for both Tesla and SpaceX . He deleted the social media pages because Facebook \"gives me the willies,\" he said, not as a statement.\nIt's not a political statement and I didn't do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don't like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry. \nMusk is still relatively active on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook.\nInstagram's probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don't use FB & never have, so don't think I'm some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don't advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don't care. \nMusk also reiterated his warning about about artificial intelligence to King on Tuesday: \"I do think that there should be some regulations on AI,\" he said.\nAt the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in March, Musk said the development of AI is more dangerous than nuclear warheads.\nshow chapters Elon Musk says Facebook 'gives me the willies'      5:01 PM ET Mon, 26 March 2018 | 00:56 \"I am not normally an advocate of regulation and oversight — I think one should generally err on the side of minimizing those things — but this is a case where you have a very serious danger to the public,\" said Musk.\n\"It needs to be a public body that has insight and then oversight to confirm that everyone is developing AI safely. This is extremely important. I think the danger of AI is much greater than the danger of nuclear warheads by a lot and nobody would suggest that we allow anyone to build nuclear warheads if they want. That would be insane,\" he said.\nSee also:\nElon Musk: 'Mark my words — A.I. is far more dangerous than nukes' In a tweet storm, Elon Musk says he's deleting Tesla and SpaceX Facebook accounts Elon Musk: Facebook 'gives me the willies' show chapters Elon Musk's personally responding to questions and complaints from his customers      5:04 PM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 00:54 Like this story?
