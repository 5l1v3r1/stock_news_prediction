The two firms later settled for undisclosed terms.\nSAP quickly filed a U.S. arbitration claim against a unit of Anheuser-Busch InBev over similar issues involving unlicensed indirect use of SAP software, seeking damages of up to $600 million. The sides settled in June for undisclosed terms and declined to comment further, AB InBev disclosed last month.\nAnalysts said these cases triggered widespread anxiety among SAP’s multinational customer base, many of whom rely on its software to exert financial control over operations in far-flung locations. Many feared they might be audited next.\n“You had a lot of SAP customers learning about the indirect pricing issue only after they had implemented SAP systems,” said Gartner analyst Bill Ryan, who advises corporate customers on software licensing strategies. “That created a certain amount of pushback among them.”\nThe company said the new way it negotiates and enforces licensing contracts will make pricing its software more transparent and predictable, by charging for business outcomes rather than for the number of theoretical users.\nSAP publishes general pricing tiers for its products but does not reveal the terms of individual customer deals. Pricing will be set case by case, SAP executives said.\nExisting customers retain the option to be billed according to the traditional model of user numbers, or change their license at a later date. Any contracts are subject to renegotiation between SAP and its customers.
