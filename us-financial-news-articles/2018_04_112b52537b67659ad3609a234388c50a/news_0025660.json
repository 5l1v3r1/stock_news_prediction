If it really comes to sanctions against GAZ Group, we will have to review our business relationships, but we would not call into question our commitment to the Russian market,” he added. \nGAZ Group is a manufacturer of light commercial vehicles and part-owned by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, one of a number of businessmen who have been targeted by sanctions imposed by the United States last week to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. \nRussia’s lower house of parliament is to consider draft legislation that would give the Kremlin powers to ban or restrict a list of U.S. imports, reacting to new U.S. sanctions on a group of Russian tycoons and officials.
