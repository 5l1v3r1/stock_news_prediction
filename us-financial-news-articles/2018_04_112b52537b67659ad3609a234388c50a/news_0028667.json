This compares to a distribution of fifty-five cents ($0.55) per Unit of Beneficial Interest for the same period last year.\nThe ten cents ($0.10) per Unit decrease in the current distribution, as compared to the same quarter last year, is primarily attributable to a lower volume of shipments during the fourth calendar quarter 2017, although at higher average iron ore sales prices, compared to the fourth quarter 2016, and to the Trust’s receipt of total royalty payments of $6,198,950 on January 30, 2018 from Northshore Mining Company (“Northshore”) which was lower than the total royalty payments of $9,791,421 received by the Trust from Northshore during January 2017. The Trust’s announcement today also reflects the Mesabi Trustees’ determination that Mesabi Trust presently has sufficient reserves available to make such a distribution while also maintaining an appropriate level of unallocated reserve in order for the Trust to be positioned to meet current and future expenses, and present and future liabilities (whether fixed or contingent) that may arise in connection with the current and ongoing challenges in the iron ore and steel industries generally.\nQuarterly royalty payments earned for iron ore shipments made during the calendar quarter ended March 31, 2018, if any, payable by Northshore to Mesabi Trust under the royalty agreement, are due on April 30, 2018, together with the quarterly royalty report. After receiving the quarterly royalty report, Mesabi Trust plans to file a summary of the quarterly royalty report with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Current Report on Form 8-K.\nOther Available Information\nMesabi Trust’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, which includes the audited financial statements of Mesabi Trust, was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2018. Mesabi Trust Unitholders may obtain a hard copy of the complete audited financial statements, which is included as Exhibit 13 to the Trust’s Annual Report, free of charge upon request to the Trust’s Corporate Trustee, at:\nMesabi Trust\nc/o Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, Corporate Trustee\nTrust & Securities Services — GDS\n60 Wall Street, 16th Floor\nNew York, NY 10005\n(904) 271-2520\nUnitholders can also directly access the audited financial statements of Mesabi Trust by navigating to the Mesabi Trust’s website at www.Mesabi-Trust.com and clicking on the Edgar Filings (SEC) link under the Menu to the right of the SEC Filings page by scrolling down to the desired Annual Report on Form 10-K under Exhibit 13 thereof, beginning on page F-1 of each such Report.\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to iron ore pellet production, iron ore pricing and adjustments to pricing, iron ore shipments, royalty (including bonus royalty) amounts, and other matters, which statements are intended to be made under the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Actual production, prices, price adjustments, and shipments of iron ore pellets, as well as actual royalty payments (including bonus royalties) could differ materially from current expectations due to inherent risks and uncertainties such as general adverse business and industry economic trends, uncertainties arising from war, terrorist events, natural disasters, weather conditions and other world geo/political events, volatility in global trade, higher or lower customer demand for steel and iron ore, decisions by mine operators regarding curtailments or idling production lines or entire plants, environmental compliance uncertainties, difficulties in obtaining and renewing necessary operating permits, higher imports of steel and iron ore substitutes, processing difficulties, consolidation and restructuring in the domestic steel market, indexing features in pellet purchase and sale agreements between Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. and its customers resulting in pricing adjustments to royalties payable to Mesabi Trust and other factors. Further, substantial portions of royalties earned by Mesabi Trust are based on estimated prices that are subject to interim and final adjustments, which can be positive or negative, and are dependent in part on multiple price and inflation index factors under agreements to which Mesabi Trust is not a party and that are not known until after the end of a contract year. Although the Mesabi Trustees believe that any such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Mesabi Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements made herein to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180413005603/en/\nMesabi Trust SHR Unit\nDeutsche Bank Trust Company Americas\n904-271-2520\nSource: Mesabi Trust", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180413005603/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Mesabi-Trust.com&esheet=51788667&newsitemid=20180413005603&lan=en-US&anchor=www.Mesabi-Trust.com&index=1&md5=e82859f5c9345260b6a8812329ff8a14"], "published": "2018-04-14T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T00:24:22.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
