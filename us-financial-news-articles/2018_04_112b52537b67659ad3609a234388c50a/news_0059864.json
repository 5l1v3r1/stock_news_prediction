Instead, it called on the autos-to-steel group to introduce a holding company structure, boost shareholder returns and appoint more independent board members.\nElliott proposed Hyundai Mobis Co Ltd be combined with Hyundai Motor Co to create a holding company which would also include financial subsidies such as Hyundai Capital and Hyundai Card Co Ltd.\nKim Woo-chan, a finance professor at Korea University Business School, said Hyundai was unlikely to accept the proposal on the holding company because it does not involve Hyundai Glovis Co Ltd, whose biggest shareholder is Hyundai Motor’s vice chairman and heir apparent, Chung Eui-sun.\n“Elliott’s proposal is unrealistic,” the professor said.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-Min Park Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:54:49.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
