(Photo: Ford Motor Company) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ford is recalling 350,000 vehicles for a transmission issue that could result in the car moving after the driver has placed it in park and removed the keys. Ford said it is aware of one reported accident and injury related to the issue. The recall applies to some 2018 Ford F-150 trucks and 2018 Expedition SUVs with a 10-speed automatic transmission, and some 2018 Ford F-650 and F-750 vehicles with 6-speed automatic transmissions. The recall involves about 347,425 vehicles in North America, including 292,909 in the United States, 51,742 in Canada, and 2,774 in Mexico. Ford's reference number for the recall is 18S10. There is a clip that locks the gear shift cable to the transmission in vehicles. In some of the affected vehicles, this clip is not firmly in place, which could result in the car shifting into a different gear from the one the driver has chosen. In this situation, there may be no warning light or chime to warn the driver the vehicle is not in park upon exiting the vehicle. This could mean the truck rolls away after the driver has left, if the emergency brake is not engaged. Dealers will inspect vehicles and make necessary repairs for free, Ford said. Ford issued a second recall for other another similar potential transmission problem, affecting 161 2017 and 2018 F-150, Expedition, Mustang, and Lincoln Navigator vehicles. A missing transmission roll pin could cause the vehicles to fail to shift to park when the driver selects it. The reference number for that recall is 18S09.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:15:30.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
