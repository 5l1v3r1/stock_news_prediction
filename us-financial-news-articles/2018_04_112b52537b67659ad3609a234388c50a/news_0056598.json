I am putting things right.”\nPester also said the bank’s customers would not be charged any overdraft fees for the month of April.\n“I’m very aware that many customers may have used their overdraft in April more than they would have expected to. There will be no overdraft fees or any overdraft charges for any of our customers through April,” he said.
