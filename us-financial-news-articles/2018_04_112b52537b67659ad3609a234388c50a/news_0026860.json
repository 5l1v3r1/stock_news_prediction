It is expected to receive about A$1 billion ($775 million )over six years as part of the deal, according to a report by The Australian. \nA Cricket Australia spokesman declined to comment. \nNine Entertainment, which has long held the broadcast rights, confirmed it had not been given the rights for the summer of 2018/2019, adding that it could not yet assess the impact of the contract’s loss. Its shares fell as much as 4.4 percent. \nFoxtel is jointly owned by News Corp and Australia’s Telstra Corp.
