Key results include:\nTotal revenues increased 2 percent versus the first quarter of 2017 to $5.6 billion. Product sales grew 3 percent globally. All new and recently launched products including Repatha ® (evolocumab), KYPROLIS ® (carfilzomib), Prolia ® (denosumab) and XGEVA ® (denosumab) showed double-digit growth. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) increased 16 percent to $3.25 driven by higher product sales, a lower tax rate and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. GAAP operating income increased 5 percent to $2.7 billion and GAAP operating margin increased 1.2 percentage points to 51.0 percent. Non-GAAP EPS increased 10 percent to $3.47 driven by higher product sales, a lower tax rate and lower weighted-average shares outstanding. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1 percent to $3.0 billion and non-GAAP operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points to 56.9 percent. 2018 EPS guidance revised to $11.30-$12.28 on a GAAP basis and $12.80-$13.70 on a non-GAAP basis; total revenues guidance revised to $21.9-$22.8 billion. The Company generated $2.6 billion of free cash flow in the first quarter versus $2.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Amgen's strong first-quarter performance was driven by our new and recently launched products, all of which delivered double-digit, volume-driven growth,\" said Robert A. Bradway, chairman and chief executive officer. \"We look forward to further expanding our new product portfolio with the expected U.S. launch of Aimovig TM (erenumab), our first-in-class migraine prevention therapy, in the second quarter and the European launch of AMGEVITA TM (biosimilar adalimumab) our first biosimilar, later this year.\"\n$Millions, except EPS and percentages\nQ1'18\nQ1'17\nYOY Δ\nTotal Revenues\n$ 5,554\n$ 5,464\n2%\nGAAP Operating Income\n$ 2,726\n$ 2,591\n5%\nGAAP Net Income\n$ 2,311\n$ 2,071\n12%\nGAAP Earnings Per Share\n$ 3.25\n$ 2.79\n16%\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\n$ 3,038\n$ 2,995\n1%\nNon-GAAP Net Income\n$ 2,466\n$ 2,333\n6%\nNon-GAAP EPS\n$ 3.47\n$ 3.15\n10%\nReferences in this release to \"non-GAAP\" measures, measures presented \"on a non-GAAP basis\" and to \"free cash flow\" (computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow) refer to non-GAAP financial measures.

Operating Margin improved by 1.2 percentage points to 51.0 percent.

In addition, management has presented its full year 2018 EPS and tax rate guidance in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain items related to acquisitions, restructuring and certain other items from the related GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations for these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the news release. Management has also presented Free Cash Flow (FCF), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. FCF is computed by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow, each as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to and facilitates additional analysis by investors. The Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and prospects for the future of the Company's ongoing business activities by facilitating comparisons of results of ongoing business operations among current, past and future periods. The Company believes that FCF provides a further measure of the Company's liquidity.\nThe Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth in the news release in connection with its own budgeting and financial planning internally to evaluate the performance of the business, including to allocate resources and to evaluate results relative to incentive compensation targets. The non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to, not a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Amgen\nAmgen is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering innovative human therapeutics.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed , including estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant , including those discussed below and more fully described in the Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identification of new product candidates cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to acquire other companies or products and to integrate the operations of companies we have acquired may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nAmgen Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income - GAAP\n(In millions, except per share

share acquisition.\n(d)\nThe tax effect of the adjustments between our GAAP and non-GAAP results takes into account the tax treatment and related tax rate(s) that apply to each adjustment in the applicable tax jurisdiction(s). Generally, this results in a tax impact at the U.S. marginal tax rate for certain adjustments, including the majority of amortization of intangible assets, whereas the tax impact of other adjustments, including restructuring expense, depends on whether the amounts are deductible in the respective tax jurisdictions and the applicable tax rate(s) in those jurisdictions. Due to these factors, the effective tax rates for the adjustments to our GAAP income before income taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 27.0%, compared with 29.5% for the corresponding period of the prior year.\n(e)\nThe adjustments related primarily to certain acquisition items and prior period items excluded from GAAP earnings.\nAmgen Inc .\nReconciliations of Cash Flows\n(In millions)\n(Unaudited)\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 2,727\n$ 2,385\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n14,906\n(157)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(11,692)\n(2,111)\nIncrease in cash and cash equivalents\n5,941\n117\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n3,800\n3,241\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$ 9,741\n$ 3,358\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 2,727\n$ 2,385\nCapital expenditures\n(155)\n(168)\nFree cash flow\n$ 2,572\n$ 2,217\nAmgen Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP EPS Guidance to Non-GAAP\nEPS Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nGAAP diluted EPS guidance\n$ 11.30\n-\n$ 12.28\nKnown adjustments to arrive at non-GAAP*:\nAcquisition-related expenses (a)\n1.42\nRestructuring charges\n0.03\n-\n0.11\nTax adjustments (b)\n(0.03)\nNon-GAAP diluted EPS guidance\n$ 12.80\n-\n$ 13.70\n*\nThe known adjustments are presented net of their related tax impact, which amount to approximately $0.40 per share, in the aggregate.\n(a)\nThe adjustments relate primarily to non-cash amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.\n(b)\nThe adjustments relate primarily to certain acquisition items and prior period items excluded from GAAP earnings.\nOur GAAP diluted EPS guidance does not include the effect of GAAP adjustments triggered by events that may occur subsequent to this press release such as acquisitions, asset impairments, litigation and changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration.\nReconciliation of GAAP Tax Rate Guidance to Non-GAAP\nTax Rate Guidance for the Year Ending December 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\n2018\nGAAP tax rate guidance\n12.5%\n-\n13.5%\nTax rate effect of known adjustments discussed above\n1.0%\nNon-GAAP tax rate guidance\n13.5%\n-\n14.5%\nCONTACT: Amgen, Thousand Oaks\nTrish Hawkins, 805-447-5631 (media)\nArvind Sood, 805-447-1060 (investors)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300635749.html\nSOURCE Amgen", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amgen-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300635749.html", "http://www.twitter.com/amgen", "http://www.amgen.com/"], "published": "2018-04-25T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T01:08:22.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
