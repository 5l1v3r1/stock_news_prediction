REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Buying Clarity Money, a free app that helps consumers manage their personal finances, is expected to add over 1 million customers to the financial service firmâ€™s Marcus business. Marcus offers tools to help customers save and borrow. Clarity Money will be re-branded as Marcus by Goldman Sachs over time, the company said.\nTerms were not disclosed.\nGoldman launched Marcus in October 2016 as a way to court Main Street borrowers saddled with credit card debt. It offers loans from $3,500 to $40,000 and targets credit card borrowers who can benefit from consolidating debt into a single loan with a lower interest rate.\nGS Bank, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, is making the acquisition. Clarity Money CEO Adam Dell will join Goldman Sachs as a partner.\n(This version of the story corrects in paragraph 4 to say that Marcus offers loans up to $40,000, not $30,000)\nReporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T01:19:38.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
