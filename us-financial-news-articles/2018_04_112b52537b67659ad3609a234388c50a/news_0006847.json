He has said he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter. \n“It is clear that our father was not endorsing alternatives to demolition,” the siblings said in a joint statement on Facebook. “The Committee’s statement does not accurately represent Lee Kuan Yew’s wishes.” \nThe feud over the home gripped Singapore for at least a month last year, and included accusations   siblings that he was prepared to use the organs of the state against them. The accusations were denied by the prime minister.
