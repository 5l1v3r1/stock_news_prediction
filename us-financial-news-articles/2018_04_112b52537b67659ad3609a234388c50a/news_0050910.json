She said security was a concern but it was still too early to say what impact Sunday’s attack may have on registration. \n“The beginning was unexpectedly slow but we’re satisfied and we hope the number of people will increase,” she said, adding that the commission had requested that government offices allow staff time off to register.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail \nIf the work cannot be completed by October, Afghanistan’s harsh climate, rugged terrain and poor roads mean the process would have to be put on hold over the winter months, delaying the vote until next year when presidential elections are due. \n“The upcoming elections in Afghanistan will be key for democracy in the country,” said a statement from the European Union, which is providing some 30 million euros ($37 million) to help fund the vote and which like other international partners is pressing for the elections to take place this year. \nParliament is still sitting three years after its mandate expired in 2015, and donors fear that further delays will fatally undermine the legitimacy of a political system already badly scarred by the disputed presidential election of 2014. \nA complex registration procedure, designed to reduce as much as possible the voter fraud that has marred past elections, has been set up after numerous setbacks and delays, requiring voters to register in the center where they will cast their ballot.
