Investors worried that tariffs may disrupt metal imports to China, the biggest global buyer.\nShares in WPP fell 2 percent after the advertising group said it was investigating an allegation of personal misconduct against its CEO, Martin Sorrell, who denied wrongdoing.\n“Given (Sorrell’s) high profile, the accusations are bound to attract a lot of attention and, given he is the face of WPP to many, there is likely to be a negative impact on sentiment today,” Liberum analysts said.\n“One thing this may do is intensify talk about Sir Martin’s successor at WPP, which has been an issue lurking in the background,” they added.\nWhile individual stock moves were relatively muted, shares in Morrisons were the top gainers, up 2.9 percent after favourable data from Kantar on the supermarket’s performance.\nThe data showed Morrison and peer Tesco continued to outperform rival “big four” supermarkets in the 12 weeks to March 25, with both enjoying sales growth of 2.4 percent. Shares in Tesco however declined 0.7 percent.\nAmong small-caps, Topps Tiles shares tumbled 13.3 percent to a four-month low after the flooring retailer said sales had been hit by a weaker market and bad weather.
