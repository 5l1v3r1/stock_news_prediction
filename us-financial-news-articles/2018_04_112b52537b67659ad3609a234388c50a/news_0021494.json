Yet, that was still 200 basis points lower than consensus forecasts. \nHerald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC said he now sees 12 percent upside for Asian equities in 2018, down from 15 percent at the start of the year. \n“Asia’s earnings upgrade cycle has come to a halt,” Linde said in a report, adding there was downside risk from higher interest rates and trade disruption. \nThomson Reuters data also showed the quarterly rise in Asia’s forward earnings forecasts at the end of March was the lowest in over a year. \nThese tepid growth projections come a time when trade tensions between the United States and China are escalating and causing nervousness in the region’s stock markets. \nDespite these risk factors, Asian equities’ forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 13.7, higher than its 10-year PE average of 13.2. India, Indonesia, and Philippine are the most expensive markets in the region. \n“We are expecting a PE de-rating already in parts of emerging markets on increasing trade concerns, rising U.S. rates and increasing volatility, and a possible dollar strengthening from current levels,” said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer for the Asia Pacific at Deutsche Asset Management. \nJosh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors, has been underweight the Philippines, Taiwan, and Singapore because they are relatively expensive and has more weighting in China and Vietnam where he sees markets relatively cheaper and things getting better.
