(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FCAP), the holding company for First Harrison Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $2.1 million or $0.64 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.6 million or $0.46 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net income is primarily due an increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses and a decrease in income tax expense.\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses increased $452,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same prior year period. Interest income increased $421,000 when comparing the periods due to increases in the average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets from 3.70% for the first quarter of 2017 to 3.87% for the first quarter of 2018 and in the average balance of interest-earning assets from $704.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 to $710.9 million for the first quarter of 2018. The average tax-equivalent yield increased when comparing the two periods despite being negatively impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) signed into law on December 22, 2017 as the yield would have been 3.93% for 2018 using the 34% federal corporate tax rate in effect for 2017 as opposed to the 21% rate in effect for 2018. Interest expense decreased $17,000 when comparing the periods primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities from $546.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 to $540.8 million for the first quarter of 2018. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased from 0.26% to 0.25% when comparing the same two periods. As a result of the changes in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the interest rate spread increased from 3.44% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to 3.62% for the same period in 2018.\nBased on management’s analysis of the allowance for loan losses, the provision for loan losses decreased from $211,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to $197,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Bank recognized net charge-offs of $200,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $179,000 for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest income increased $73,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $108,000 when comparing the two periods. This was partially offset by a $26,000 decrease in commission and fee income.\nNoninterest expense increased $99,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, due primarily to increases in compensation and benefits expense of $174,000 and data processing expense of $96,000 partially offset by a decrease in net losses on foreclosed real estate of $190,000.\nIncome tax expense decreased $154,000 for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the TCJA and the Bank’s investment in a tax credit entity during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. As a result of the TCJA, anticipated tax credits from the tax credit entity and an increase in nontaxable income, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 14.5% as compared to 24.9% for the same period in 2017.\nTotal assets increased $8.3 million to $767.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $759.0 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased $13.6 million from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 while investment securities and net loans receivable decreased $6.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Deposits increased $17.0 million to $681.6 million at March 31, 2018 due primarily to increases in savings accounts and both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposits. The Bank had no borrowed funds at March 31, 2018 as the $10.0 million in outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank as of December 31, 2017 were paid off. Nonperforming assets (consisting of nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due, troubled debt restructurings on accrual status, and foreclosed real estate) totaled $7.7 million at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank was considered well-capitalized under applicable federal regulatory capital guidelines.\nThe Bank currently has eighteen offices in the Indiana communities of Corydon, Edwardsville, Greenville, Floyds Knobs, Palmyra, New Albany, New Salisbury, Jeffersonville, Salem, Lanesville and Charlestown and the Kentucky communities of Shepherdsville, Mt. Washington and Lebanon Junction.\nAccess to First Harrison Bank accounts, including online banking and electronic bill payments, is available through the Bank’s website at www.firstharrison.com .
