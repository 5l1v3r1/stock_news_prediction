On the British course, runners have to tackle hay bale obstacles and are showered with water by spectators. \nHaving set a course record of one minute and 37 seconds, Hepworth and his partner Tanisha Prince from London plan to take up the chance of competing in the world finals in Finland. \n“I think a Finnish guy wins it every year so it’ll be good to go there and take them down,” said Hepworth, who claims he did no practice for the race in Dorking, south of London. \nMost of the competitors adopt the “the Estonian carry”, with the wife upside-down, their legs over their partner’s shoulders and gripping them around the waist from behind. \nSome participants take the race less seriously than others. One wore a wedding dress, a blond wig and make-up as he carried his wife, piggy-back style, dressed as a jockey. \n“I think Malcolm gets the hard part,” said his partner. “I just hang on for dear life.” Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Robin Pomeroy", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:26:29.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
