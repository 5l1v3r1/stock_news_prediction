The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued guidance banning the sale of pure or highly concentrated caffeine in powder or liquid forms as a dietary supplement in large quantities directly to consumers, calling it a significant public health threat.\n“The FDA is prepared to take steps right away to begin removing illegal products from the market,” the agency said in a statement Friday.\nA single teaspoon of powdered pure caffeine can contain about 3,200 milligrams of caffeine, equal to the amount of caffeine in about 20 to 28 cups of coffee.\nThe agency said that consumers can easily consume too much caffeine when they have access to bulk amounts in liquid and powdered forms, substituting a tablespoon for a teaspoon or mistakenly adding the clear caffeine liquid instead of another, like vinegar, in a recipe. Highly concentrated caffeine consumption has been linked to at least two deaths in otherwise healthy individuals in recent years, the agency said.\nThe FDA isn’t trying to stop dietary supplements containing caffeine, such as premeasured caffeine packets or pills, which are viewed as posing less of a health risk. The new guidance is also not aimed at prescription or over-the-counter drugs containing caffeine or conventional foods, like caffeinated sodas.\nIn 2015 and 2016, the agency issued letters to seven distributors of pure powdered caffeine, saying their products were dangerous and presented a risk of harm to consumers. Since then, the FDA said it has seen a rise of similar products being sold online.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:21:57.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
