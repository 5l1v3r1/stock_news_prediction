Sevilla's president Jose Castro (C) and sport director Ramon Rodriguez \"Monchi\" look at Sevilla's new coach Jorge Sampaoli. REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo \nBarcelona won 5-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano to lift the trophy for the fourth year in a row and Spanish media reported that Sevilla’s Italian coach Vincenzo Montella is at risk of being fired when club chiefs meet on Tuesday. \n“As president I have to apologise to all Sevilla fans,” Castro said on Monday. \n“The board will take the measures it deems necessary to try and help in these last five matches (in La Liga), we have to qualify for Europe. \n“We will see what decisions to take but it’s the moment to be calm and think about what’s best for the club.” \nSevilla are seventh in the La Liga standings with 48 points from 33 games, three behind Villarreal in sixth and a Europa League qualifying spot. \nMontella took over as coach in December after Argentine Eduardo Berizzo was sacked a week after returning to work following an operation to treat prostate cancer. \nSevilla eliminated Manchester United in the Champions League round of 16 but lost in the quarter-finals to Bayern Munich and they have suffered heavy league defeats, conceding five goals against Atletico Madrid and four against Celta Vigo. \nMidfielder Steven N’Zonzi apologised after being criticised by supporters for having a night out in Madrid after the final and for going straight to the dressing-room at full time instead of applauding the fans. \n“I want to apologise to Sevilla fans,” N’Zonzi said in a video released by the club on Sunday. “I made a mistake because I left after the game. \n“What happened is also difficult for the players. We play every three days, I live alone, I train and I go back home. I am always at home. Yesterday my family and friends were there and I left.” Reporting by Rik Sharma, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T17:24:37.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
