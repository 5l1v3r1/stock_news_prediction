The system was back up and running by 1800 GMT on Tuesday.\n“The trigger event was an incorrect link between the testing of a new software release and the live operations system,” Eurocontrol said on Wednesday. “We are confident that there was no outside interference.”\nIt said measures had been put in place to ensure it would not happen again.\nThe ETFMS system, which manages up to 36,000 flights a day, has only ever failed once before, in 2001, Eurocontrol said.\nEurocontrol had estimated that around half of Tuesday’s 29,500 flights would be affected but said on Wednesday it could not yet provide exact figures on the impact.
