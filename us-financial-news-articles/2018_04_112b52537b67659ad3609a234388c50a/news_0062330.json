At least one Venezuelan bondholder committee has hired a financial adviser, ahead of potential litigation in the face of continued breaches.\nThe latest payments would have reached some holders through U.S. custody firm DTC, the sources said on Monday.\nPDVSA used Citgo Petroleum, its refining unit in the United States, as 51 percent collateral on the 2020 bond. Venezuela may be complying with the payment in order to avoid putting the valuable asset at risk in a potential legal battle.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has blamed financial sanctions imposed by the United States for preventing international transfers. However, the sanctions do not block routine operations such as debt payments.\nEarlier this month, the government paid interest on PDVSA’s 2022 bond, which was mostly bought by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in a controversial operation last year. That transfer upset some bondholders still waiting payments.\n“With the new PDVSA 2020 payment, legal action from investors in other bonds could take place,” said a holder of other Venezuelan debt who asked not to be identified.
