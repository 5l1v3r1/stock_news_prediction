This compares to net income of $942 thousand ($0.19 per diluted share) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet operating earnings (Non-GAAP) were $1.1 million ($0.23 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $205 thousand or 21.8% from $942 thousand ($0.19 per diluted share) for the first quarter of 2017. Net operating earnings for the first quarter of 2018 exclude $205 thousand in after-tax merger-related expenses. The Company's first quarter 2018 net operating earnings (Non-GAAP) increased $366 thousand, or 46.9%, from the preceding quarter.\nRobert Shuford, Jr., President and CEO of Old Point National Bank said, \"We are very pleased with our start in 2018. We continue to see momentum in building customer relationships and new account acquisition through a focus on our internal sales management processes. Revenue growth continued to be a positive in the quarter, and we experienced notable improvement in charge-off levels and past dues. Net loan growth slowed during the quarter on some accelerated pay-downs and our first sale of a pool of consumer automobile loans, but pipelines remain strong as we move into the second quarter. Certainly adding to our positive momentum is the completion of the acquisition of Citizens National Bank (Citizens) of Windsor, Virginia on April 1, 2018, which moved our Company past the $1 billion threshold in total assets for the first time. We are excited to bring the Citizens team into the Old Point family and expect their lenders to add momentum and complement our lending strategies.\"\nHighlights of the quarter are as follows:\nNet interest income after provision for loan losses improved to $7.2 million, an increase of 12.3% over the previous quarter and 11.3% over the first quarter of 2017. Return on average assets (ROA) was 0.38% compared to (1.19%) in the prior quarter and 0.42% in the first quarter of 2017. Net operating ROA (Non-GAAP) was 0.46% compared to 0.32% and 0.43% in the fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans improved to 0.13% from 0.41% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.24% in the first quarter of 2017. Total assets increased to $993.8 million, representing growth of $11.9 million, or 1.2%, from December 31, 2017 and $71.0 million, or 7.7%, from March 31, 2017. The Company completed its acquisition of Citizens on April 1, 2018. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Citizens shareholders received 0.1041 shares of Old Point stock and $2.19 in cash for each share of Citizens stock. Systems integration is scheduled to be completed in late May. The Company's first quarter results do not include the financial assets of Citizens.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.7 million, an increase of $79 thousand, or 1.0%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $608 thousand, or 8.5%, from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in net interest income are attributable to higher average earning asset balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. The tax-equivalent net interest margin for the quarter was 3.48%, down from 3.57% in the prior quarter and 3.69% in the same period a year ago. The margin contractions were due to increased rates on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also negatively impacted the margin. The lowering of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% reduced the benefit of the Company's interest income from tax-exempt state and municipal securities.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) totaled $16.5 million as of March 31, 2018, up from $16.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $15.1 million at March 31, 2017. NPAs as a percentage of total assets were 1.66%, which compares to 1.64% at December 31, 2017 and 1.63% at March 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans increased to $14.1 million from $12.9 million at December 31, 2017 and $11.0 million at March 31, 2017. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest decreased to $2.2 million from $3.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $3.0 million at March 31, 2017. Of the loans past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2018, approximately $2.0 million were government-guaranteed student loans. Other real estate owned was $203 thousand at March 31, 2018 after one property was added during the first quarter. The Company had no other real estate owned at December 31, 2017 and $1.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) was $9.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2017 and $8.5 million at March 31, 2017. The ALLL as a percentage of loans held for investment was 1.33% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.28% at December 31, 2017 and 1.34% at March 31, 2017. Net loans charged-off during the quarter totaled $243 thousand, which compares to net charge-offs of $738 thousand and $372 thousand in the preceding quarter and first quarter of 2017, respectively. On an annualized basis, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans were 0.13% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.41% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.24% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income for the quarter was $3.4 million, down $88 thousand, or 2.6%, from the previous quarter but up $192 thousand, or 6.1% from the first quarter of 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decline resulted from lower deposit service charges and mortgage banking income, which was partially offset by increases in gains from sales of available-for-sale securities, bank-owned life insurance income, and other service charges, commissions and fees. The increase in noninterest income relative to the year ago period was largely due to higher mortgage banking income and securities gains.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. This represents a decrease of $3.2 million, or 25.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $923 thousand, or 10.6%, from the first quarter of 2017. The decline relative to the preceding quarter was principally related to a nonrecurring charge of $3.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the termination and settlement of the Company's defined benefit pension plan. Increases in merger-related expenses, salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing, and FDIC insurance expenses were responsible for the year-over-year increase in noninterest expense.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets as of March 31, 2018 were $993.8 million, an increase of $11.9 million, or 1.2%, from December 31, 2017. Net loans held for investment decreased $5.9 million during the quarter. The strong loan growth experienced over recent quarters moderated during the first quarter in part due to accelerated payoffs. Also, the Company sold an $8.8 million pool of consumer automobile loans during the quarter at approximately book value as part of a strategy to maintain a balanced loan portfolio. Cash and cash equivalents increased $29.0 million from December 31, 2017.\nTotal liabilities increased $13.3 million, or 1.5%, during the quarter. Total deposits increased $5.4 million, or 0.7%, to $789.0 million. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.6 million, or 2.5%, and savings deposits increased $4.8 million, or 1.4%, while time deposits declined by $5.0 million, or 2.4%. Overnight repurchase agreements increased $15.4 million, or 74.7%, and Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased by $2.5 million, or 3.7%, from December 31, 2017.\nTotal stockholders' equity declined 1.4% from December 31, 2017 to $95.0 million. This was the result of a $2.0 million increase in the net unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. This was driven by increases in market rates during the quarter.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures â€“ In addition to the Company's results presented in accordance with GAAP, this release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures including net operating earnings, net operating earnings per share, and net operating ROA. A schedule reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of this press release. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its internal analysis of financial and operating performance and the Company's management believes that they provide greater transparency regarding management's view of the Company's performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be read in conjunction with, and not as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP results. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nSafe Harbor Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements - Statements in this press release which use language such as \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"projects,\" \"contemplates,\" \"anticipates,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends\" and similar expressions, identify forward-looking statements.
