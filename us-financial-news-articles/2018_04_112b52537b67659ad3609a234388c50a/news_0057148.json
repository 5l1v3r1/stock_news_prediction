Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index rose nearly 0.5 percent, helped by gains at Wal-Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, and bottler and retailer Fomento Economico Mexicano, or Femsa. Femsa shares rose over 3 percent as investors looked past a drop in profits to focus on growth in its convenience stores, pharmacies and gas stations as well as news it would make more stores into pick-up points for Amazon deliveries. The shares in Walmex rose 3.5 percent after its profits exceeded analyst expectations with 17 percent growth. Shares in cement maker Cemex fell 2.5 percent after it posted a 92 percent drop in quarterly profit. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rose 1.5 percent after a heavy batch of corporate earnings. Shares of shopping mall operator Multiplan Empreendimentos Imobiliário SA rose 3.6 percent after it reported an 81 percent increase in first-quarter net profit. Miner Vale SA, lender Banco Bradesco SA , toll-road operator Ecorodovias Infraestrutura e Logística SA, wood pulp producer Klabin SA and college operator Estácio Participações SA also reacted to recently-published quarterly earnings. Emerging market currencies plummeted in recent days as concerns over a widening U.S. fiscal deficit and accelerating inflation lifted U.S. Treasury yields, dampening demand for high-risk assets. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds slipped back below 3 percent on Thursday as buyers emerged following a week-long sell-off, soothing angst among emerging-market investors. But caution remained as investors feared newfound strength in the U.S. dollar may be here to stay. The Mexican and Chilean pesos and the Brazilian real all edged back from losses, with the real firming back from a 16-month low.
