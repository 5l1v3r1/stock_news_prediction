That draft agreement, which also contains a general wage increase of 5 percent over the 2019-2021 period, is open for signatures until Friday.\nSo far, the walkouts have cost parent group Air France-KLM 220 million euros ($272 million).\n“Each further day of strikes worsens the financial situation of Air France, affects customer confidence and increases the pressure on those staff not striking,” Air France said in a statement.\nReporting by Cyril Altmeyer, writing by Victoria Bryan; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:21:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
