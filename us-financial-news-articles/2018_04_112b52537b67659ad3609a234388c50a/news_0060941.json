Segar, assistant chief executive at the MPA.\nThe IMO’s new rules will significantly cut the amount of sulphur that the world’s ships can burn in their engines.\nMiddle distillate fuels, such as marine gasoil, generally contain less sulphur than fuel oil, which has been the main fuel used in large ocean-going vessels, and are expected to be used increasingly to meet the new restrictions.\nThe use of MFMs for distillate deliveries will be made compulsory from July 1, 2019, the MPA said.\nSingapore set record sales volumes of marine fuels in 2017 for a third straight year.
