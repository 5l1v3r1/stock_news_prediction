Like NMC Health, Finablr will have its headquarters in the UAE. \n“We have the prequalification for London [for Finablr]. In case we IPO, we prefer to list in London,” he said. He declined to say when the share sale might happen or whether banks had been hired for the process. \nUAE Exchange is aiming to increase its share of the $575 billion global remittance industry to more than 10 percent by 2020, its chief executive Promoth Manghat told Reuters last year. \nManghat said on Monday that target was on track and the company had used about 40 percent of the $250-300 million it had earmarked for acquisitions and investments. \n“Finablr will accelerate that agenda of acquisitions,” said Manghat, who is also executive director at Finablr, adding that this month it had made an investment in a United States-based digital money transfer business, which he declined to name. \nAs part of Finablr’s launch, the non-UAE operations of UAE Exchange will be rebranded as Unimoni.
