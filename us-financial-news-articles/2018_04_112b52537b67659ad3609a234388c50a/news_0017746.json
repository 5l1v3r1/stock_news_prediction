It attracted 537 million financial transactions valued at 1.65 trillion Kenyan shillings ($16.35 billion) between July and September 2017, according to Kenya’s Communications Authority.\nSafaricom holds a dominant position in the telecoms market, accounting for 90 percent of revenue in both voice calls and text messages. It has 72 percent of Kenya’s total mobile phone subscribers.\nIt also dominates the mobile money business, with its pioneering M-Pesa platform controlling about 80 percent of the 28 million subscriptions in the market.\nAirtel Money has a 5.8 percent market share. Telkom relaunched its mobile financial services platform in March.\nThe cross-network transfers will help level the market, Information, Communication and Technology Minister Joe Mucheru said last month.\nThe telecommunications regulator in January ditched plans to break Safaricom into separate telecoms and financial services businesses.\n$1 = 100.9000 Kenyan shillings Reporting by Omar Mohammed; editing by Maggie Fick and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:16:46.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
