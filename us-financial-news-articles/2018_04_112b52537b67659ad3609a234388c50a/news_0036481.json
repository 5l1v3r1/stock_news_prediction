It will also engage in “water efficiency efforts,” across all of its facilities.\n“Our company has been around for 165 years , and these goals will ensure that we continue to make meaningful contributions toward building strong communities and a healthy environment for the next 165 years,” Michel Doukeris, CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in a statement.\nDoukeris says that the environmental efforts won’t impact the cost of the company’s beer, reports FOX News .
