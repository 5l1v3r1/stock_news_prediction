REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \nA group led by Senators Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Tim Kaine, a committee Democrat, proposed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that would authorise “all necessary and appropriate force” against al Qaeda, the Taliban, Islamic State and associated forces. \nDespite coming days after the U.S. bombing of Syria over chemical weapons, the proposed legislation does not authorise military action against any nation state, including Syria. \nIt also does not set an end date for military action, although it proposes a congressional review every four years. \nBoth Republican and Democratic members of Congress have long argued that they ceded too much authority over the military to both Republican and Democrat presidents - with no time limits - after the Sept. 11 attacks. \nUnder the U.S. Constitution, Congress, not the president, has the right to authorise war. But presidents have used AUMFs passed in 2001 for campaigns against al Qaeda and affiliates, and one passed in 2002 for the war in Iraq, to justify a wide range of conflicts since. \nCorker said he expected the Foreign Relations Committee to debate and possibly vote on the new AUMF as soon as next week.

To become law, it would have to pass the Senate and House and be signed into law by President Donald Trump. \nNoting that Foreign Relations has been trying to pass a new AUMF for years, Corker said it was too soon to discuss the view of the Senate’s Republican leaders. \n“I don’t really worry about much beyond having a successful vote in the committee,” he said. \nTrump national security aides have pushed back against congressional calls for a new AUMF. However, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee to be secretary of state, told senators last week it would be useful for lawmakers to weigh in on the military campaign. \nThe legislation also would require the president to report to Congress on any new military actions and allow lawmakers to vote on whether to reject them. \nIt would repeal the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs after being in effect for 120 days.
