It is not very serious”, he said.\nThe scams have become a headache for both China and Taiwan, bringing cooperation between them, but also objections from Taiwan because of the deportation of suspects from the self-ruled island to face trial on the mainland.\nReporting by Chansy Chhorn; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T09:46:58.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
