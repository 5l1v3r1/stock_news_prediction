However, top prizes in the International Tennis Federation (ITF) circuit events range between $15,000 and $25,000.\nThe report's authors also found evidence of a \"match-fixing season\" that takes place in ITF games between October and December. Ending sponsorship by gambling firms in tennis was also recommended.\nGlobal professional tennis organizations ATP, WTA, ITF and the Grand Slam Board have all agreed in principle with the findings and will put in place recommendations suggested by the report.\nThey also welcomed the report's statement that there is no evidence of \"institutional corruption\" in governing bodies.
