REUTERS/Dado Ruvic//File Photo Republicans repeatedly suggested at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that Facebook Inc ( FB.O ), Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google and Twitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) are censoring or blocking content from conservatives, a charge the companies denied.\nLawmakers from both parties agreed tech companies must remove illegal content like fraud, piracy and sex trafficking but differed on whether they should remove objectionable content.\nRepresentative Robert Goodlatte, a Republican who chairs the committee, said he was “extremely disappointed” the companies did not testify.\nGoodlatte said the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution “offers no clear protections for users when Facebook, Google, or Twitter limits their content in any way.”\nFILE PHOTO: The Google logo is pictured atop an office building in Irvine, California, U.S., August 7, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Alphabet did not respond to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment, while Facebook said it would keep talking to Congress about “Facebook’s strong commitment to being a platform for all voices and ideas.”\nGoodlatte said “while these companies may have legal, economic, and ideological reasons to manage their content like a traditional media outlet, we must nevertheless weigh as a nation whether the standards they apply endanger our free and open society and its culture of freedom of expression.”\nRepresentative Jerrold Nadler, top Democrat on the committee, said “the notion that social media companies are filtering out conservative voices is a hoax, a tired narrative of imagined victimhood.”\nNadler added “conservative commentary, including conspiracy theories of a conservative bent, regularly rank among the most far-reaching posts on Facebook and elsewhere.”\nThe hearing featured a pair of pro-Donald Trump sisters known as “Diamond and Silk.” Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican, testified about Twitter’s decision to block her from advertising a campaign video the company called “inflammatory.” Twitter reversed the decision.\n“We need to recognize that the global reach of these companies creates overwhelming pressure against free speech, and we need to do a much better job counteracting that pressure,” Blackburn said.\nRepresentative Ted Lieu, a Democrat, said the U.S. government should not follow authoritarian practices.\n“What makes America great is we get to say stuff and not have the government intervene,” Lieu said. “This is a stupid and ridiculous hearing.”\nBerin Szoka, president of TechFreedom, said “concerns about Facebook’s potential slant are best addressed through other measures, starting with transparency and user empowerment. Ultimately, the best check on Facebook’s power today is the threat of a new Facebook disrupting the company’s dominance.”\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T21:10:48.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
