(NYSE: B), a global provider of highly engineered products and differentiated industrial technologies, today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 net sales of $367 million were up 7% from $342 million in the prior year period driven by favorable foreign exchange of approximately 5%, organic sales growth (1) of 1%, and acquisition sales of 1%. Net income for the first quarter was $38.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, compared to net income of $38.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, a year ago. Net income per share was up 1% from an adjusted $0.71 last year, which excluded $0.01 of FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments in our Industrial Segment.\nA table reconciling 2017 non-GAAP adjusted results presented in this release to the Company’s GAAP results is included at the end of this press release.\n“Barnes Group began 2018 with strong first quarter performance that positions us well for the upcoming year,” said Patrick J. Dempsey, President and Chief Executive Officer of Barnes Group Inc. “With our business delivering solid operational execution and end markets that are supportive of growth, we anticipate 2018 to be a year of increased revenues, operating margin expansion and strong cash generation,” added Dempsey.\nIndustrial\nFirst quarter 2018 sales were $246.0 million, up 8% from $227.3 million in the prior year period. Organic sales decreased by 1%, while favorable foreign exchange increased sales by $18.9 million, or 8%, and acquisition revenues contributed 1%. Operating profit in the first quarter was $32.4 million, down 6% from an adjusted $34.5 million in the prior year period. Operating profit was primarily impacted by lower contribution from organic sales, inclusive of unfavorable product mix, and lower productivity. Operating margin was 13.2%, down 200 bps from last year’s adjusted 15.2%.\nAerospace\nFirst quarter 2018 sales were $120.7 million, up 5% from $114.5 million in the same period last year. Aerospace original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) sales increased 1% while aftermarket sales increased 19% from continuing growth in maintenance, repair and overhaul, and spare parts sales. Operating profit was $24.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 8% as compared to $22.4 million in the prior year period, reflecting the profit impact from higher sales volumes offset in part by scheduled price deflation as certain programs transition from development to production. Operating margin of 20.1% was up 60 bps from 19.5% a year ago, benefitting from the higher aftermarket contribution. Aerospace OEM backlog ended the first quarter 2018 at a record $733 million, up 8% compared to a year ago and up 3% sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company expects to ship approximately 50% of this backlog over the next 12 months.\nAdditional Information\nFirst quarter interest expense increased $0.5 million to $3.9 million primarily as a result of a higher average effective interest rate versus a year ago. Other expense, net for the quarter was $1.8 million, an increase of $1.2 million from the prior year period. The Company’s effective tax rate was 23.9% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 26.9% in the first quarter of 2017 and 69.6% for the full year 2017. For 2017, excluding the impact of discrete tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the effective tax rate would have been 20.2%.\nUpdated 2018 Outlook\nBarnes Group now expects 2018 total revenue growth of 5% to 6%, with organic sales growth of 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is anticipated to benefit revenues by approximately 2% for the year. Operating margin forecast remains in the range of 15.5% to 16.5%. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.03 to $3.15 per diluted share, up 5% to 9% from 2017’s adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.88. Further, the Company continues to anticipate capital expenditures of between $60 to $65 million and cash conversion of greater than 100% of net income. Based upon our forecasted geographic mix of earnings, the effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be between 25% and 25.5%.\nConference Call Information\nBarnes Group Inc. will conduct a conference call with investors to discuss first quarter 2018 results at 8:30 a.m. ET today, April 27, 2018.

This metric can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity.\nBARNES GROUP INC.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE RECONCILIATION\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited) Three months ended March 31, 2018 2017 (2)\n% Change SEGMENT RESULTS\nOperating Profit - Industrial Segment (GAAP) $ 32,378 $ 33,903 (4.5 ) FOBOHA short-term purchase accounting adjustments - 600 Operating Profit - Industrial Segment as adjusted (Non-GAAP) (1) $ 32,378 $ 34,503 (6.2 ) Operating Margin - Industrial Segment (GAAP) 13.2 % 14.9 % (170 ) bps.

The tax effects of these items, excluding the effects of U.S. tax reform which impacted tax expense directly, were calculated based on the respective tax jurisdiction of each item and range from approximately 21% to 37%. Management believes that these adjustments provide the Company and its investors with an indication of our baseline performance excluding items that are not considered to be reflective of our ongoing results. Management does not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by GAAP, and the reader should not consider it as an alternative measurement calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of the Company's performance. Accordingly, the measurements have limitations depending on their use.\n(2) Results for 2017 have been adjusted on a retrospective basis to reflect the impact of the adoption of revised guidance for the presentation of pension and other postretirement benefit costs in the first quarter of 2018.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180427005075/en/\nBarnes Group Inc.\nWilliam Pitts\nDirector, Investor Relations\n860.583.7070\nSource: Barnes Group Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.BGInc.com&esheet=51796348&newsitemid=20180427005075&lan=en-US&anchor=www.BGInc.com&index=2&md5=8b93d89a3882d57964d109e56523070b", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.BGInc.com&esheet=51796348&newsitemid=20180427005075&lan=en-US&anchor=www.BGInc.com&index=1&md5=e6e717115152bcb6dd8a80505dd7f413", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180427005075/en/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:52:47.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
