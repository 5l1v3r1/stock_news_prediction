When the officers arrived, police said, Vassell took a two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at them.

Vassell died in a hospital. \nPolice on Thursday released security camera footage that showed Vassell approaching people on the street and pointing the pipe at them as if it were a pistol. They also released partial transcripts of three 911 emergency calls. \n“There’s a guy walking around the street, he looks like he’s crazy but he’s pointing something at people that looks like a gun and he’s pulling the trigger,” one of the callers said. \nLocal media reported that Vassell was 34 years old, suffered from mental illness, and was well known in parts of Crown Heights. \nHis killing followed the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man, Stephon Clark, 22, in Sacramento, California, that has sparked more than two weeks of demonstrations.

The officers feared he had a gun, but it turned out he was holding a cellphone, Sacramento police said.
