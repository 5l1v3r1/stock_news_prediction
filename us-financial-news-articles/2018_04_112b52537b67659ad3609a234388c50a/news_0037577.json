It was important to show some character.” \nSouthampton looked to be cruising towards a win that would have lifted them up to 17th and out of the relegation places, at least temporarily, after Dusan Tadic and Jan Bednarek put them two goals ahead after an hour.

The 22-year-old Pole met James Ward-Prowse’s cross on the half-volley to leave Chelsea, who might have had Alonso sent off for a stamp on Shane Long, in a desperate position. \nBut Saints have struggled to hold on to leads this season and collapsed halfway through the second period, conceding three goals for the fourth successive league game. \nSouthampton manager Mark Hughes now faces a desperately difficult fight to keep his team in the Premier League. \n“As has been the case all year, apparently we’ve got a soft underbelly,” he said. “When the momentum shifts against us we can’t get a platform and wait until the momentum swings our way again.” \nWith five games remaining, they have been left three points below the safety zone before the rest of the weekend matches. \nSouthampton face Chelsea again in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley next weekend.
