During that time, only 2011 saw as many extreme disaster events as 2017 - including severe storms, cyclones and wildfires. \nLast year was the second-costliest year on record worldwide for natural-disaster insured losses, reinsurance broker Aon Benfield said earlier this year. \nAon counted 330 natural catastrophes in 2017. They ranged from hurricanes hitting the United States and the Caribbean to earthquakes in Mexico, floods and Typhoon Hato in China, and drought in southern Europe.
