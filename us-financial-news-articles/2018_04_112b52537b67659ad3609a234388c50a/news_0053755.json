Gottwald, released the following earnings report of the Company’s operations for the first quarter of 2018.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $60.6 million, a decrease of 5.3% compared to net income of $63.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Earnings per share declined 4.6% to $5.14 per share from $5.39 per share in the prior year period.\nSales for the petroleum additives segment for the first quarter of 2018 were $586.9 million, up 8.7% versus the same period last year. Petroleum additives operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $84.1 million, an 11.8% decrease over first quarter operating profit last year of $95.4 million. The decrease was due mainly to higher raw material and conversion costs, partially offset by changes in selling prices, and product and regional mix. During the quarter, we continued to see raw material prices increase as they have over the past several quarters. While we have made progress toward adjusting our selling prices to offset the effects of those higher costs, we have been unable to adjust often and fast enough to compensate for the pace of cost increases we have seen.\nPetroleum additives saw record shipments in the first quarter of 2018, with a slight improvement over the same period last year, which was our prior record for quarterly shipments. The increase was primarily due to increases in lubricant additives shipments partially offset by decreases in fuel additives shipments. Latin America and Asia Pacific were the main regions contributing to higher lubricant additives shipments. Europe and Asia Pacific were the primary drivers for the decrease in fuel additives shipments, partially offset by an increase in Latin America.\nDuring the quarter, we funded capital expenditures of $22.8 million and paid dividends of $20.6 million through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nThroughout the rest of 2018, we expect to see solid sales and shipments in our petroleum additives business. Margin improvement will remain our top priority throughout the rest of this year, as we are committed to reversing the effects of the margin compression we have seen over the past several quarters, primarily due to rising raw material costs. This will remain a priority until we begin to see raw material prices stabilize.\nWe are committed to providing long-term value for our shareholders and customers, and we remain focused on our long-term objectives. This is evidenced by our technology-driven initiatives and ongoing investments in our supply capability, such as our new plants in Singapore and Mexico. We believe the fundamentals of how we run our business - a long-term view, safety-first culture, customer-focused solutions, technology-driven product offerings, and world-class supply chain capability - will continue to be beneficial for all of our stakeholders.\nSincerely,\nThomas E. Gottwald\nThe Company has disclosed the non-GAAP financial measure EBITDA and the related calculation in the schedules included with this earnings release.
