COMMENTARY: A government spokesman said the retail sales strengthened visibly in the first two months of 2018, showing double-digit growth in value terms over a year earlier, thanks to favourable job and income conditions and a further pick-up in visitor arrivals. Given the difference in timing of the Lunar New Year holidays between last year and this year, analysing figures for the first two months combined would help remove the distortions and show the underlying trend. The outlook for retail sales should remain positive in the near term, underpinned by upbeat local consumer sentiment amid a full employment situation and by continued improvement in inbound tourism.
