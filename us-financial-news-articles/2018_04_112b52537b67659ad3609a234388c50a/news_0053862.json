Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool v Stoke City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 28, 2018 Stoke City's Papa Ndiaye in action as Liverpool's Mohamed Salah looks on REUTERS/Phil Noble\nBut a Liverpool side with five changes from the starting XI that beat AS Roma 5-2 in the Champions League semi-final, first leg at Anfield lacked their usual intensity and even Mo Salah fluffed a chance almost identical to one he buried in midweek.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold, who was later substituted with a dead leg, also scuffed a shot on the six-yard line while Danny Ings had a goal disallowed for s marginal offside. Slideshow (4 Images)\nDespite enjoying 72 percent possession, Liverpool only had two shots on target and it was the first time since Dec. 26 that 43-goal Salah failed to score after starting a home game.\nA dramatic finish saw Liverpool denied a penalty when Erik Pieters handled, while Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross almost snatched what would have been their first league win at Anfield.\nLiverpool captain Jordan Henderson described the incident when the ball hit Pieters’ hand as a “blatant penalty”.\n“For me it was a poor decision by the referee and linesman. They have ultimately cost us the three points,” said Henderson, who added that he should be okay for next week’s game at Roma despite receiving a kick on his calf in the first half.\nLiverpool felt particularly aggrieved over the penalty after James Milner had conceded a spot kick in similar circumstances at home to Roma but Stoke midfielder Joe Allen said the visitors would have felt hard done by if it had been given.\nKlopp said Liverpool had no new injury concerns for the Roma game. “We will be ready for Wednesday,” he said.\nWith Stoke’s relegation rivals playing later on Saturday, they are three points below the safety zone with two games left.
