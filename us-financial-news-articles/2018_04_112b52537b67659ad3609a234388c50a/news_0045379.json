(the “Company”) today announced a net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 of $59.9 million, or $0.39 per share, on revenue of $482.3 million. This compares to net income from continuing operations of $21.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, on revenue of $497.0 million and a loss from continuing operations of $89.7 million, or $0.59 per share for the first quarter of 2017, on revenue of $400.9 million.\nThe Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $8.1 million, primarily related to restructuring charges during the first quarter. The resulting adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $52.9 million, or $0.34 per share. This compares to an adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $51.2 million, or $0.33 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDavid Dunlap, President and CEO, commented, “In U.S. land markets, revenue and margins were effectively unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2017. Utilization of completion oriented products and services was challenged by periods of harsh weather and shortages of fracturing sand. Offsetting the challenging completions environment, U.S. land revenue in our drilling products and services segment grew 16%, contributing to a 19% increase in adjusted EBITDA for the segment. These highly differentiated product lines give us more leverage to the unfolding global oilfield recovery than many of our peers, and highlight our full cycle value proposition.\n“The weather and supply chain challenges experienced in the U.S. muted the impact of increased customer demand during the quarter, limiting our financial results. We are increasingly confident that current levels of demand create an environment for utilization to improve well into 2019.\n“Activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico were relatively stable during the quarter. Strengthening oil prices should ultimately drive higher utilization levels, but for the time being we believe our business is right sized for expected customer demand in the Gulf.\n“International activity declined during what has historically been a seasonally weak quarter for our production services segment. Well control activity was also lower sequentially.\n“After more than three years of declining industry activity, the challenges we face in the oilfield today are associated with growth and expansion. For the duration of the downturn, we have been gearing our organization for this moment. It is anticipated that improved commodity prices will drive further market improvement in the U.S. during 2018 and our service lines will continue to benefit from higher utilization levels. We are also prepared for Gulf of Mexico and international recovery with competitively advantaged business lines that will require minimal investment to respond to increased activity. We believe this positioning supports our goals of generating free cash flow, reducing debt levels and improving returns through the current cycle.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Geographic Breakdown\nU.S. land revenue was $331.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, unchanged as compared with revenue of $331.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 28% increase compared to revenue of $258.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gulf of Mexico revenue was $76.0 million, unchanged as compared with revenue of $76.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a 1% increase from revenue of $74.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. International revenue of $74.8 million decreased 17% as compared with $89.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 11% as compared to revenue of $67.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDrilling Products and Services Segment\nThe Drilling Products and Services segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $85.2 million, an 8% increase from fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $79.2 million and a 25% increase from first quarter 2017 revenue of $68.4 million.\nU.S. land revenue increased 16% sequentially to $40.7 million, Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 7% sequentially to $21.0 million and international revenue increased 9% sequentially to $23.5 million.\nOnshore Completion and Workover Services Segment\nThe Onshore Completion and Workover Services segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $231.5 million, a 1% decrease from fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $232.7 million, and a 13% increase from first quarter 2017 revenue of $205.0 million.\nProduction Services Segment\nThe Production Services segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $100.8 million, a 15% decrease from fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $118.2 million and a 47% increase from first quarter 2017 revenue of $68.6 million.\nU.S. land revenue decreased 5% sequentially to $52.5 million as inefficiencies caused by winter weather, and supply chain tightness persisted, resulting in lower utilization for most service lines. Gulf of Mexico revenue decreased 12% sequentially to $17.5 million due primarily to lower hydraulic workover and snubbing activity. International revenue decreased 29% sequentially to $30.8 million due to lower levels of hydraulic workover and snubbing activity and well intervention work.\nTechnical Solutions Segment\nThe Technical Solutions segment revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $64.8 million, a 3% decrease from fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $66.9 million and a 10% increase from first quarter 2017 revenue of $58.9 million.\nU.S. land revenue decreased 17% sequentially to $6.8 million. Gulf of Mexico revenue increased 10% sequentially to $37.5 million driven by increased completion tools activity. International revenue decreased 17% to $20.5 million due to lower levels of well control activity.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.
