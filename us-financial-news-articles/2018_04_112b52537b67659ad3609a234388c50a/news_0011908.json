These elements include sample size calculation, that is, determining beforehand whether the study includes enough animals to draw statistically valid conclusions; randomization of animals to treatment and control groups; and blinding, or making sure that the investigators who assess the effects of treatment don’t know which animal received the compound being tested. \nIn the new study, Strech and his team reviewed 109 IBs approved by three institutional review boards in Germany in 2010-2016, which cited 708 animal studies. Half of the studies included no more than eight animals. Less than 5 percent reported randomization, sample size outcome or blinded assessment. Only 11 percent of the studies referred to published, peer-reviewed reports of preclinical efficacy. \nThe new analysis, published in PLoS Biology, can’t answer the question of why investigators submit such poor quality data, and why reviewers accept it, Strech noted. But from his own conversations, “the feeling I got was that ethics committees and agencies don’t really look at the preclinical efficacy data.” \nRegulators focus on data about a drug’s toxicity and safety instead, he added. “They more or less trust that the funders of the clinical trial, the industry and the investigators, that they would never do a clinical study unless they were very convinced that the drug would be effective.” \nAlmost half of the studies in the analysis were funded by one of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies, Strech noted, and many included research teams from outside Germany, so this is likely to be a worldwide problem. \n“I would argue that the burden of proof is rather on those that would say that the picture is completely different in the United States or the UK or elsewhere,” he said. \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2q8JdOs PLoS Biology, online April 5, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T18:57:34.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
