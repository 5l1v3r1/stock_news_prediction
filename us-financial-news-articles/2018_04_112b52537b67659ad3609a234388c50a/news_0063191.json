The results from these statements may not actually arise as a result of various factors, including the market penetration of new products such as products with Voice User Interface; unexpected delays in the commercial launch of new products, including in the mobile and office segments; speed of decline in the cordless market; DSP Group's ability to manage costs; DSP Group’s ability to develop and produce new products at competitive costs and in a timely manner and the ability of such products to achieve broad market acceptance; and general market demand for products that incorporate DSP Group’s technology in the market. These factors and other factors which may affect future operating results or DSP Group’s stock price are discussed under “RISK FACTORS” in the Form 10-K for fiscal 2017, as well as other reports DSP Group has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and which are available on DSP Group’s website ( www.dspg.com ) under Investor Relations.
