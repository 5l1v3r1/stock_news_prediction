It did not disclose details of the other potential offer.\n“Discussions with the third parties are ongoing and there can be no certainty that a formal offer from either will be forthcoming or as to the terms of any such offer,” Fidessa said.\nShares in Fidessa were up 11.9 percent at 41 pounds by 1430 GMT. Temenos shares fell 3.4 pct to 110.5 Swiss francs ($116).\nFidessa had been due to hold both a shareholder and a creditor meeting on Thursday but said it was in its shareholders’ interest to postpone the meetings “in order to explore in more detail the possible alternative offers.”\n“The Temenos offer will not lapse as a result of this announcement or the adjournment of the meetings”, the company said.\nHowever, it is a condition of the Temenos offer that the meetings are held on or before April 27.\nELLIOTT STAKE Temenos has been looking to add Fidessa’s equities trading technology to expand its customer base in the financial services industry.\nIt made an offer of 36.467 pounds per share for Fidessa on Feb. 21.\nFidessa said one of the two potential new offers would give shareholders 38.297 pounds per share, representing a 5 percent premium to Temenos’ offer. That would value Fidessa at 1.48 billion pounds, according to a Reuters calculation.\nActivist investor Elliott Capital Advisors, which has used its stakes in takeover targets to extract a higher price from buyers, disclosed a 4.9 percent stake in Fidessa on the day of the Temenos offer.\nElliott declined to comment on its intentions when asked to do so by Reuters in February.\nAs Temenos is proposing to buy Fidessa by way of a scheme of arrangement, Fidessa needs the backing of 75 percent of its shareholders for the deal to go through.\nTemenos said earlier it would borrow up to 1.43 billion pounds to pay for the deal.\nThe enlarged company would have had revenues of more than $1.2 billion in 2017, and a core profit margin of 32.3 percent.\nReporting By Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru and John Revill in Zurich; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T23:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T02:27:53.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
