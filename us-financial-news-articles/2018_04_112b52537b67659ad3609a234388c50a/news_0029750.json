On a weekly basis, it is set for its biggest gain since Dec. 1.\nSterling also pushed towards a new post-Brexit referendum high versus the dollar, rising 0.4 percent to $1.4296. It hit its highest since the 2016 vote in late January 2018, at $1.4346.\nExpectations of a rate rise have been a major driver of sterling’s gains in recent days while the euro has suffered from from more top policymakers’ comments about its recent strength, and some lacklustre data.\nThe market is pricing in a 65-percent chance of a 25 basis point hike next month.
