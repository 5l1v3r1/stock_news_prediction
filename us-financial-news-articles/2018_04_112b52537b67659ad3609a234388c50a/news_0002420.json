Prices will not go up this heating season, I keep the promise I made,” Groysman said in a televised interview with news channel 112. “For future periods, we need to find a formula that will prevent unfair prices.” (Reporting by Natalia Zinets; writing by Matthias Williams; editing by John Stonestreet)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T16:10:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
