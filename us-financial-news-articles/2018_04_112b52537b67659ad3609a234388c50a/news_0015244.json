I feel I owe the game too much. I’ve experienced a lot of great things in cricket but some tough times as well. \n“I’ve got the experience to help these young players and that’s where our focus should be right now until the other guys come back.” \nAustralia’s next international commitment is a limited-overs tour of England in June. \nClarke later Tweeted a clarification in which he said his contact with Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland had been generally supportive in nature and the offer of help could mean “mentoring the under 14s”. \n“Let me make very clear that I have not sent any formal offer to James Sutherland to come back and play cricket,” he wrote from India, where he is working as a media pundit. \n“I sent him a message as a friend offering to help Australian cricket in ANY way I could. I won’t be batting in the nets in India in preparation for a comeback and, as I have always said, the game owes me nothing, I owe it everything.” (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury and Nick Mulvenney; Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T04:08:27.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
