All statements other than statements of historical fact could be deemed forward looking, including risks and uncertainties related to statements about our products, customers, expansion, technology and other key strategic areas, and our financial targets such as revenue, share count and IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures including gross margin, operating margin, net income (loss) per diluted share and free cash flow.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any made in this press release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nThe achievement or success of the matters covered by such involves known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the we make. You should not rely upon as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management’s beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled “Risk Factors” in our most recent Forms 20-F and 6-K (reporting our quarterly results). These documents are available on the SEC Filings section of the Investor Relations section of our website at: https://investors.atlassian.com/ .\nAbout Non-IFRS Financial Measures\nOur reported results and financial targets include certain non-IFRS financial measures, including non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share, and free cash flow. Management believes that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations, and also facilitates comparisons with peer companies, many of which use similar non-IFRS or non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their IFRS or GAAP results. Non-IFRS results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid in understanding our operating results. The non-IFRS results should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, and may be different from non-IFRS or non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nOur non-IFRS financial measures reflect adjustments based on the items below:\nNon-IFRS gross profit. Excludes expenses related to share-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nNon-IFRS operating income. Excludes expenses related to share-based compensation and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nNon-IFRS net income and non-IFRS net income per diluted share. Excludes expenses related to share- based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, the related income tax effects on these items and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\nFree cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which consists of purchases of property and equipment and acquired intangible assets.\nWe exclude expenses related to share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, the related income tax effects on these items and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets from certain of our non-IFRS financial measures as we believe this helps investors understand our operational performance. In addition, share-based compensation expense can be difficult to predict and varies from period to period and company to company due to differing valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments, as well as changes in stock price. Management believes that providing non-IFRS financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, the related income tax effects on these items and changes in our assessment regarding the realizability of our deferred tax assets allow for more meaningful comparisons between our operating results from period to period.\nManagement considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic opportunities, including investing in our business, making strategic acquisitions and strengthening our statement of financial position.\nManagement uses non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share and free cash flow:\nAs measures of operating performance, because these financial measures do not include the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations; For planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; To allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; To evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies; and In communications with our Board of Directors concerning our financial performance.\nThe tables in this press release titled “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” and “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial Targets” provide reconciliations of non-IFRS financial measures to the most recent directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS.\nWe understand that although non-IFRS gross profit, non-IFRS operating income, non-IFRS net income, non-IFRS net income per diluted share and free cash flow are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, these measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results of operations as reported under IFRS.\nAtlassian Corporation Plc Consolidated Statements of Operations (U.S. $ and shares in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, 2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues: Subscription $ 105,604 $ 63,369 $ 285,775 $ 169,626 Maintenance 81,953 67,072 238,630 193,873 Perpetual license 21,273 19,495 62,967 55,206 Other 14,893 9,973 42,795 26,900 Total revenues 223,723 159,909 630,167 445,605 Cost of revenues (1) (2) 45,240 32,895 128,494 82,356 Gross profit 178,483 127,014 501,673 363,249 Operating expenses: Research and development (1) 108,544 82,262 304,730 219,477 Marketing and sales (1) (2) 48,652 36,625 138,928 89,021 General and administrative (1) 32,167 31,190 106,476 85,581 Total operating expenses 189,363 150,077 550,134 394,079 Operating loss (10,880 ) (23,063 ) (48,461 ) (30,830 ) Other non-operating income (expense), net 740 (492 ) (418 ) (806 ) Finance income 2,001 1,040 4,824 3,803 Finance costs (8 ) (6 ) (24 ) (51 ) Loss before income tax benefit (expense) (8,147 ) (22,521 ) (44,079 ) (27,884 ) Income tax benefit (expense) (6,119 ) 5,060 (49,411 ) 6,088 Net loss $ (14,266 ) $ (17,461 ) $ (93,490 ) $ (21,796 ) Net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders: Basic $ (0.06 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.41 ) $ (0.10 ) Diluted $ (0.06 ) $ (0.08 ) $ (0.41 ) $ (0.10 ) Weighted-average shares outstanding used to compute net loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders: Basic 232,221 223,333 230,180 221,034 Diluted 232,221 223,333 230,180 221,034", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&index=2&md5=0c86287e142b2d28ca048e060fbb4fb4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fatlassian.com&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fatlassian.com&index=5&md5=6d5587a57007719375ef33d6f1fc312c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&index=1&md5=25d80da23f4531a740ccb10e763fb475", "https://investors.atlassian.com/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com%2F&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com%2F&index=6&md5=7f5096bda81bd8d6300114c3ceb43b5e", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&index=4&md5=ab8c7776f78081035080e16feff9e3e3", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&esheet=51792110&newsitemid=20180419006413&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Finvestors.atlassian.com&index=3&md5=f1b273cbcf0d60056d8bbec38229380a"], "published": "2018-04-20T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T01:16:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
