REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader /File Photo \nA surge in online trade and home delivery poses a challenge to IKEA’s classic out-of-town warehouse stores, and the company said last year it was developing full-range city-centre formats alongside better e-commerce and services. \nItems at its first French city-centre store will be displayed in a new way thanks to new digital technology and services, the budget furniture retailer said in a statement. \nIt said the store, which at 5,000 square metres (54,000 square feet) will be less than one-fifth the size of a standard IKEA store, would be in the upmarket Madeleine neighbourhood and cost 6.6 million euro ($8.2 million). \nAn IKEA Group spokeswoman said the company had not yet decided how much of the the range would be on display, and how many of the smaller items would be readily available to carry home from the store. Larger furniture at least would be for home delivery only. FILE PHOTO: IKEA Group Chief Executive Jesper Brodin poses at an IKEA pop-up kitchen showroom downtown Stockholm, Sweden, October 10, 2017.

Planned new downtown locations include London’s Greenwich borough and Copenhagen, in 2019 and 2020 respectively. \nIKEA has also started trying other, smaller city-centre formats, such as a kitchen showroom in Stockholm and a Madrid bedroom showroom and accessories store. It is also rolling out order and pickup points. \nFrance is IKEA Group’s third-biggest market with 33 stores and sales of 2.7 billion euros ($3.33 billion) in its last fiscal year. \nIKEA, the world’s biggest home furnishing brand, operates through a franchise system.
