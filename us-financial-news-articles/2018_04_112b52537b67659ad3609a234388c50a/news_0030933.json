Larger furniture at least would be for home delivery only.\nIKEA opened a first, bigger downtown store in 2014, in Hamburg, Germany. Planned new downtown locations include London’s Greenwich borough and Copenhagen, in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\nIKEA has also started trying other, smaller city-centre formats, such as a kitchen showroom in Stockholm and a Madrid bedroom showroom and accessories store. It is also rolling out order and pickup points.\nFrance is IKEA Group’s third-biggest market with 33 stores and sales of 2.7 billion euros ($3.33 billion) in its last fiscal year.\nIKEA, the world’s biggest home furnishing brand, operates through a franchise system. IKEA Group, with 363 stores, is the main franchisor to brand owner Inter IKEA.\n$1 = 0.8102 euros Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; editing by Niklas Pollard and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:20:50.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
