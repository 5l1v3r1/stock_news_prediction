The stock still trades well below the level when Thiam took over, but has been steadily recovering from a low of 9.4 francs in mid-2016.\n“Market estimates are not particularly demanding and, in our view, will be revised upwards each time the bank proves to reap fruits from all the self-help measures,” Baader Helvea analyst Tomasz Grzelak said in a note.

REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo ADVICE SOUGHT\nGains in Credit Suisse’s core business catering for the world’s wealthy came amid a spike in market volatility and a slowdown in corporate deals, as a changing geopolitical landscape has made investors cautious and hit investment banks.\nThiam said the need for advice had measurably risen among its private banking clients, who were seeking more contact with their relationship managers as the bank helped wealthy families diversify their assets.\nConfirming its 2018 targets, the bank flagged periods of heightened volatility amid geopolitical uncertainty, global trade tensions and monetary policy tightening. “Client activity levels remain sensitive to these factors, specifically within our more market dependent activities,” it said.\nSwiss rival UBS on Monday posted 1.5 billion francs in quarterly net profit as its investment bank navigated volatility better than Wall Street peers, snatching up a bigger share of corporate deals and placements within a declining market.\nCredit Suisse saw revenues fall 8 percent in its investment banking and capital markets division, but said it had a strong pipeline of prospective deals that remained “dependent on constructive market conditions”.

Thiam had flagged a slowdown in the division’s revenues since equities markets plunged in mid-February.\n($1 = 0.9811 Swiss francs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T08:43:23.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
