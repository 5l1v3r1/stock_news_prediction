Ms. Haley hadn’t been told those plans had changed — something Mr. Kudlow didn’t know until later. \nInitially, Mr. Kudlow didn’t believe he had given offense, a White House official recalled. Later, when White House Chief of Staff John Kelly showed him Ms. Haley’s terse response — “With all due respect, I don’t get confused” — Mr. Kudlow quickly called her to apologize. \nBut the dust-up became a diversion during the U.S.-Japan summit that ended on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T22:38:30.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
