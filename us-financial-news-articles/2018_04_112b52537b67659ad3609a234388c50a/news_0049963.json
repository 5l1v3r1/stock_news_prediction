He said there were no apparent injury marks on her body.\nCheema’s father and some relatives had been summoned for police questioning, he said, adding that no arrest had been made.\nThe family could not be reached for comment and no immediate comment was available from the Italian embassy.\nHundreds of women and girls are killed each year in Pakistan at the hands of family members over perceived damage to “honour” that can involve eloping, fraternizing with men or any other infraction against conservative values relating to women, rights groups say.\nParliament passed legislation against “honour killings” in 2016, introducing tough punishment and removing a loophole in the law that allowed killers to walk free if pardoned by family members.\nPolice in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, said recently the number of cases of honour killing had fallen since the law was introduced.
