A police spokeswoman said separately that there were at least three people dead.\nThe identity of the perpetrator was not yet clear, the spokesman said. Investigators were looking at the possibility that other suspects fled the scene, though they had no evidence this was the case, he added.\n“It is far too early to speak of an attack,” he said.\nPolice stands guard in a street near a place where a man drove a van into a group of people sitting outside a popular restaurant in the old city centre of Muenster, Germany, April 7, 2018.
