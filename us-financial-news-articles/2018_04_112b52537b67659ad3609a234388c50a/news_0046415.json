Bond yields move inversely to prices.\n\"We've seen a bounce in the economic activity and a bounce in the inflation numbers. Now with the Fed looking to hike at least two more times throughout the end of the year, we're seeing softening at the long end of the curve,\" said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income.\n\"Here we are scratching new highs, but I would guess somewhere between here and 3.1 percent we'll see the sell-off run out of gas.\nRising rates can be bad for stocks because at some point higher yielding investments can be more compelling investments. Higher bond yields also mean higher borrowing costs for corporations.\nThe bond market has also been worried about the idea that rising inflation could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively throughout the rest of the year.\nSymbol Yield Change %Change US 3-MO --- US 1-YR --- US 2-YR --- US 5-YR --- US 10-YR --- US 30-YR --- \"I am calling this a momentum trade because it has largely been driven by commodity prices,\" said Kevin Giddis, head of fixed income capital markets at Raymond James. \"As we have learned over the last few years, those baskets can rise and fall at any time as certain short-term factors cause spikes in prices, then settle back down into a more 'normal' trading range.\"\nThe move upward in long-term yields has also — at least briefly — stalled the steady flattening in the yield curve that's occurred over the past few months. In normal times, the yield curve slopes upward, reflecting a belief in future economic expansion.\nHowever, when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates, market sentiment suggests that the long-term outlook is worse; an inverted curve is often considered a signal of a pending economic recession.\n— CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T13:06:10.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
