It also seeks to try to quickly resolve interagency disputes. \nRepresentative Bill Shuster, who heads the House Transportation Committee, called the move allowed under a 2015 law a \"positive step forward in the fight against inefficient, bureaucratic permitting.\" \nScott Slesinger, legislative director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said local residents should have input in major projects and downplayed the memorandum. \n\"Trumps much ballyhooed infrastructure plan has been diminished to little more than an ideological attack on environmental safeguards,\" Slesinger said. \nIn August, Trump signed an executive order directing that agencies use the process for major infrastructure projects. \nTrump has vowed to end \"the painfully slow, costly and time-consuming process for getting permits and approvals to build. \nThe Republican president, who was a New York-based real state developer before taking office, has repeatedly decried the process of winning approval for highway permitting. \"It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes,\" Trump said last year. \nIn February, Trump unveiled a long-awaited infrastructure plan designed to encourage spending on improvements by states, localities and private investors, but it faces an uncertain fate in Congress. \nTrump asked Congress to authorize $200 billion over 10 years to spur a projected $1.5 trillion in road, bridge and other projects. \nThe proposal has come under fire from Democrats who said it would put a huge burden on local governments without providing enough federal dollars. \nTrump's proposal also seeks legislative approval to sweep away environmental and other regulatory hurdles to new projects. \nTrump's top infrastructure adviser D.J. Gribbin is expected to depart the White House later this week, an administration official said Monday. The administration is considering a number of potential candidates to replace him.
