If you want to attract investors, you want to do it where governance is really strong and London is known for that. And we also wanted to stay in Africa because we are a pan-African retail company,” CEO Christian Chammas told Reuters.\nAfter the completion of an acquisition later this year, Vivo will be active in 24 of 54 countries on the continent, which its management said provided a natural hedge against political turbulence, conflict and currency swings.\nThe company expects to have a free float of at least 25 percent on admission, expected in May, after which it is also expected to be able to join FTSE UK indices.\nAccording to a bookrunner, the selling shareholders will include Vitol Africa B.V and no proceeds of the listing will go to the company.\nJPMorgan ( JP.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) are leading the listing.\nAdditional reporting by Julia Payne, Editing by Sinead Cruise, David Evans and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:19:39.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
