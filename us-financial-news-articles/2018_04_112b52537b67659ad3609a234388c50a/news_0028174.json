(Nasdaq:SLS) (“SELLAS”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapies for a broad range of cancer indications, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a business update.\n“In recent months, we have made meaningful progress advancing our business objectives, maturing SELLAS Life Sciences Group Ltd. into a publicly-traded company following the business combination and progressing our pipeline of cancer immunotherapies for patients with limited treatment options,” said Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD h.c., President & Chief Executive Officer of SELLAS. “We are particularly excited about our recent financing and the positive interim results from the Phase 2b NeuVax™ + Herceptin study announced earlier this month which we believe help position SELLAS for continued success throughout the remainder of 2018. We also look forward to commencing the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of galinpepimut-S in combination with Keytruda® under our collaboration and supply agreement with Merck and our planned Phase 3 Acute Myeloid Leukemia program.”\nRecent Corporate and Pipeline Highlights\nIn April 2018, SELLAS announced positive interim data from the prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled Phase 2b independent investigator-sponsored clinical trial (IST) of trastuzumab (Herceptin®) +/-nelipepimut-S (NeuVax™) in HER 1+/2+ breast cancer patients in the adjuvant setting to prevent recurrences. In March 2018, open label Phase 2 clinical and immunological data for SELLAS’ lead product candidate, galinpepimut-S (GPS) in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) was presented at the 2018 European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) 44 th Annual Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal. Median progression-free survival (PFS) of 23.6 months was reported in the high-risk disease setting, compared to historically inferior outcomes while on an immunomodulatory drug (IMID) or proteasome inhibitor post-autologous stem cell transplant maintenance. In March 2018, SELLAS appointed Barbara Wood as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. In March 2018, SELLAS entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement to issue up to 10,700 shares of its Series A convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase 1,363,631 shares of its common stock in a private placement transaction to a select group of institutional investors, in Europe and the United States, for aggregate gross proceeds of $10.7 million. The closing of the first tranche for approximately $6.0 million took place on March 9, 2018. The closing of the second tranche for approximately $4.7 million is expected to occur by the end of April 2018 following stockholder approval. In December 2017, SELLAS Life Sciences Group Ltd. (“SELLAS Ltd.”), a privately-held Bermuda exempted company, completed a business combination (the “Merger”) with Galena Biopharma, Inc. (“Galena”). Upon completion of the Merger, Galena was renamed “SELLAS Life Sciences Group, Inc.,” began trading under a new ticker symbol “SLS” and the combined company now includes the late-stage pipelines of novel cancer immunotherapies for both hematologic and solid malignancies of SELLAS Ltd. and Galena. In October 2017, SELLAS Ltd. entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck & Co. for a combination clinical trial targeting multiple cancer types, in which GPS will be administered in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in a Phase 1/2 trial in five cancer indications, including both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.\nYear End 2017 Financial Results\nFor accounting purposes, SELLAS Ltd. is considered to have acquired Galena in the Merger; therefore, the financial statements of Galena became those of SELLAS Ltd. and the results reported are those of SELLAS Ltd.\nCash Position : As of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $2.3 million, compared to $6.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nR&D Expenses : Research and development expenses were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $5.3 million decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $2.5 million in fees due under licensing and collaboration agreements, a decrease of $1.7 million in clinical trial expense, a $1.3 million decrease in manufacturing expenses, a $1.2 million decrease in consulting fees, and $0.2 million decrease in regulatory expenses. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in stock-based compensation and a $0.9 million increase in personnel related expenses. Overall, research and development expenses were reduced in 2017 as SELLAS Ltd. explored various strategic options.\nG&A Expenses : General and administrative expenses were $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The $10.5 million increase was primarily due to $5.7 million of transaction costs related to the Merger and a $2.1 million increase in stock-based compensation from the acceleration of restricted stock units, and a $1.5 million increase in personnel related expenses due to an increase in headcount, $0.6 million increase in accounting and audit fees, and $0.6 million in outside consulting services. The $5.7 million of transactions costs consist of $2.9 million of banking fees, $1.6 million in legal fees, $1.0 million incentive fee payable through approximately $0.1 million in cash and the issuance of 119,672 shares of our common stock upon consummation, and $0.2 million in accounting and audit fees. The transaction costs incurred related to the Merger are non-recurring expenses for the year 2017.\nNon-recurring Severance Costs : Severance costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 include employee-related costs for severance of former Galena employees of $1.9 million.\nNet Loss : Net loss was $23.8 million and loss attributable to common stockholders was $24.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or a basic and diluted loss per share to common stockholders of $10.44, as compared to a net loss and loss attributable to common stockholders of $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or a basic and diluted loss per share to common stock holders of $18.66.\nAbout SELLAS Life Sciences Group\nSELLAS is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapeutics for a broad range of cancer indications.
