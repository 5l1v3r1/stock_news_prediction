Under the agreement, Spotify owns about 9 percent of Tencent Music while Tencent Holdings owns a 7.5 percent stake in Spotify.\nAs of Friday, Spotify had a market capitalisation of $28.5 billion.\nTencent Music first started discussion with banks about its planned IPO late last year. Progress was slow as the company focused on the Spotify transaction and was exploring the possibility of a Hong Kong listing as the city's exchange operator unveiled plans to encourage more tech companies to list in the city by loosening listing rules, reported IFR.\nTencent Music, however, has decided to go for a U.S. listing as Spotify is listed there and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) newly introduced rules do not allow corporate entities to benefit from weighted voting rights for now, according to IFR.\nHKEX will launch a separate consultation by July 31 this year to explore such option.
