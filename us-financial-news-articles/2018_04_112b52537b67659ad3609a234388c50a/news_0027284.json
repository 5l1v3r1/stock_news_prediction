In Mexico, leftist presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to cut the country’s economic dependence on foreign powers and to put Trump “in his place.” Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence talks during a meeting at the VIII Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru in this handout photograph released to Reuters by the Mexico Presidency, April 14, 2018.
