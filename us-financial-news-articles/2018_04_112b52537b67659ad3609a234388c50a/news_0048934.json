The discussions were really more around the governor’s actions at the PBOC (People’s Bank of China) and certain actions they’ve announced in terms of opening some of their markets, which we very much encourage and appreciate.” \nBack in commodity markets, the spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields. \nYields on 10-year Treasurys are at the highest now since early 2014 and again threatening the hugely important 3 percent bulwark. \nThe last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. It also came shortly before oil prices went on a mighty 75 percent tumble.

Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin. \nTraditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added. \n“If oil helps push the 10-year yield into new terrain for this cycle, this will play at least mildly USD positive in a change of correlation.” \nIndeed, dealers cited widening yield differentials for the dollar’s broad rally. \nThe gap with German bonds has touched the widest in almost three decades. On a spot basis shorter-term U.S. 2-year yields are testing 2.5 percent, which is the highest since 2008. \nThe greenback was last at 108.215 having broken through major resistance in the 107.90/108.00 zone, which has held solid since mid-February.
