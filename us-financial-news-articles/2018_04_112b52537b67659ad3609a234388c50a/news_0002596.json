We’re at our best when we have a better understanding of what motivates people. We use data science to build higher quality models and algorithms, and we deliver maximum results when able to collaborate with forward thinking creative partners. kyu’s portfolio companies are leaders in each of these areas. Together we can offer clients everything they need to achieve success in today’s more personalized, tech-driven marketing environment.”\nJames Brett, the CEO of J.Crew, commented: “Kepler is more than just another agency capable of using data to optimize results.
