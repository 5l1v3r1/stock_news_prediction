RUSAL UNDER SIEGE \nIn the latest sign of customers distancing themselves from Rusal, major Japanese trading houses asked Rusal to stop shipping refined aluminium and other products in light of the U.S. sanctions and are scrambling to secure metal elsewhere, industry sources said. \nRusal is encountering problems at the other end of its production cycle too, with the sanctions taking a toll on the overseas operations that supply it with the raw materials it uses to produce metal. \nRio Tinto which supplies bauxite to some of Rusal’s refineries and buys refined alumina, said it will declare force majeure on some contracts, showing the immediate impact on Rusal’s supply chain. (For an analysis, click on) \nCompleting the triple whammy of problems besieging Rusal, holders of the company’s debts are also growing restive. \nRusal’s dollar bonds slumped after the sanctions were imposed, and the company warned it could be in technical default because banks, trading platforms and clearing agents refuse to handle transactions linked to the issuer. \nRussian state-run lender Sberbank holds $4 billion in Rusal debt. The bank’s CEO, German Gref, said he had no immediate option to get rid of the Rusal debt on Sberbank’s books because there was no one to whom he could offload it. \nRusal accounted for 5.8 percent of world aluminium production last year, with output of 3.7 million tonnes. Europe accounted for 42 percent of its sales; Asia 17 percent and America 16 percent.
