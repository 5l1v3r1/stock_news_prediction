European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini arrives at a European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir \nEU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that she regretted the way the authorities under President Nicolas Maduro had called the May 20 presidential and legislative elections without a consensus on the “conditions for a credible and inclusive electoral process”. \nShe went on: “The European Union will monitor closely the electoral process and related developments on the ground and stands ready to react through appropriate measures to any decision or action that might continue to undermine democracy, the rule of law and human rights situation in the country.” \nShe added that all parties should be allowed to contest fair elections in the country. \nLast week, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told regional leaders that more must be done to isolate Maduro, and that Washington would not stand “idly by” as the country crumbles. The EU imposed some sanctions on Venezuela late last year, accusing Maduro of breaches of human rights.
