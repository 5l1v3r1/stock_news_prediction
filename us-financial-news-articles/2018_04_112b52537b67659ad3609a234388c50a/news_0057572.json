That’s my goal, my dream, something I really believe I’m capable of.\n“So if someone said ‘we’ll let you come here but you can’t do this’, that’s not an attractive option to me. At Red Bull there’s always been really good clarity and I would say fairness, since 2014, since I’ve been there.”\nBeing in a team with Hamilton would be a “good challenge”, he added.\nAsked whether he was curious to see whether the “grass was greener” elsewhere, Ricciardo said his decision would be based on facts.\n“I wouldn’t go somewhere else just for a change,” he said, recognizing also that he felt lingering loyalty to Red Bull who have said they want a decision by the August break.\n“I guess I don’t really fear not having a seat next year so I don’t feel that I need to sign something tomorrow or I will have nothing,” Ricciardo said.\n“So I guess for that reason I feel like I can see until the summer what’s happening. If nothing has happened since then...if it’s only then Red Bull, then that’s where I am.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, Editing by David Goodman and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:03:27.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
