A lot of parameters we don’t know,” Goldman Sachs analyst Hui Shan said. “The (limit on) supply is more certain. By 2021 we might be getting into economic downturn, in which case deficits may not appear.”\nThe copper market is expected to slip into a deficit this year that could rise to more than 900,000 tonnes in 2021 and 2022, according to BMO Capital Markets, as supply growth slows due to deteriorating ore grades in countries such as Chile and lack of investment in new projects.\nHowever, global copper stocks of 4.1 million tonnes, according to BMO, offer a buffer, as could scrap and substitution with aluminium.\nIn the very long term, a dearth of new projects could mean larger deficits, despite prices at levels that analysts say should incentivise new investment.\nReporting by Peter Hobson Edited by Pratima Desai and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T20:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:45:00.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
