The combined company would have more scale to compete other hotel-branded rivals, including Hilton Grand Vacations Inc and Bluegreen Vacations Corp.\nILG views Marriott’s Vacations’ offer as the best it has received so far, and is engaged in negotiations to try to clinch a deal by the end of the month, the sources said. The talks could still end without any agreement, the sources added.\nThe exact merger structure that Marriott Vacations and ILG are negotiating could not be learned.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Marriott Vacations and ILG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nILG also explored a merger with Apollo Global Management LLC’s Diamond Resorts International Inc, sources said last month. Talks between ILG and Diamond Resorts have now ended, according to the sources. (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B.
