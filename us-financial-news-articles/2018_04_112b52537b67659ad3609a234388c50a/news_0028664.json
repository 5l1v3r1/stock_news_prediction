Hill told Reuters by email that a small contingent of Marines from 1 Marine Expeditionary Force based in California had conducted a site survey in preparation for the exercise that U.S. forces will hold.\n“The site survey was conducted due to the likely participation of a Military Sealift Command support vessel in the exercise,” he said.\nVanuatu, about 2,000 km (1,200 miles) east of northern Australia, was home to a key U.S. Navy base during World War Two that helped beat back the Japanese army as it advanced through the Pacific toward Australia.\nThere is heightened interest in the wharf in Luganville town because it could be big enough to allow warships to dock at it. Its primary use is to cater for cargo vessels and ferries.\nReporting by Alison Bevege and Tom Westbrook in SYDNEY.; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T12:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T08:05:21.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
