Commissions and other agent related costs were $139.6 million. Gross margin increased 132% to $16.5 million from $7.1 million in 2016 Cash flow from operations increased 302% to $4.1 million, compared to $1.0 million in 2016. Our cash balance increased 177% to $4.7M, compared to $1.7M in 2016.\n2017 Operating and Business Highlights\nThe number of agents and brokers on the eXp Realty platform increased by 171% to 6,511 at the end of 2017, compared to 2,401 at the end of 2016. Residential transaction sides closed for 2017 increased 212% to 25,299, compared to 8,100 in 2016. Residential transaction volume closed for 2017 increased 209% to $6.1 billion, compared to $2.0 billion in 2016. Expanded to 47 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, compared to 42 U.S. states and one Canadian province at the end of 2016.\neXp World Holdings also announced that it has applied to list the company's common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market. If the company’s listing application is accepted, shares of the company’s common stock would begin trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The uplisting is subject to approval, in part, based on the company's ability to meet Nasdaq minimum listing requirements.\n\"We are pleased with the growth in revenue driven by increased agent and transaction count, and internal efficiencies,” said eXp World Holdings CEO, Chairman and Founder Glenn Sanford. “Listing on Nasdaq is an exciting next step for eXp World Holdings shareholders and investors.\"\nIn addition, the company filed an extension to delay the filing of its 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K in order to consult with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of the Chief Accountant in relation to accounting treatment for employee-based equity instruments granted prior to the company becoming public. Further disclosure can be found on Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC and posted on the company’s website. The delayed filing has no impact on eXp Realty’s agents, gross revenue, or the operations of the business and we expect to file the 2017 Annual Report by April 17, 2018. If the proposed change to the way the employee-equity instruments, prior to the company becoming public, is approved, the company’s financial statements also would be restated to use a fair value treatment instead of the previously relied upon intrinsic value treatment, and would remove the large variable swings previously included in the general and administrative expense category due to an underlying fluctuation in stock price.\nAbout eXp World Holdings\neXp World Holdings, Inc.
