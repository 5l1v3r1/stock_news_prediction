Baird in Milwaukee.\nHopes about a strong reporting season have helped divert attention from geopolitical and trade worries, which have roiled the markets in recent months.\n“We’ve seen enough pessimism build up in investors as people are trying to look for the worst ... things blowing up from a geopolitical perspective. Earnings so far have been good enough to help leave some of the pessimism that’s out there,” Delwiche said.\nAt 12:36 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.88 percent at 24,789.21. The S&P 500 rose 1 percent to 2,704.74 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.67 percent to 7,275.82.\nAt their session highs, all three indexes were above their 50-day moving averages.\nData on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in March amid a rebound in the construction of multi-family housing units. The PHLX housing index rose 1.12 percent.\nTen of 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by the technology index’s 1.9 percent gain. The consumer discretionary index rose 1.64 percent, boosted by Netflix and Amazon, which gained 3.2 percent.\nBofA Merrill Lynch’s April fund manager survey found the world’s biggest tech stocks were investors’ top pick for the third straight month despite mounting worries over regulation.\nFacebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet — collectively known as the FAANG group — rose between 1.4 percent and 9.7 percent.\nGoldman Sachs reversed course to drop 1.7 percent, mirroring other big U.S. banks, shares of which declined despite beating Wall Street’s profit expectations.\nJ&J fell 1.43 percent after the healthcare conglomerate raised its sales forecast for the year but kept its outlook for full-year profit unchanged.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.74-to-1 ratio, and on the Nasdaq, for a 2.52-to-1 ratio.
