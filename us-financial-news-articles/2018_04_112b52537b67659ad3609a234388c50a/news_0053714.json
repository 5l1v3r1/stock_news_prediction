(TSX:TIH) reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights Three months ended March 31 millions, except per share amounts 2018 2017 % change Revenues $ 676.8 $ 412.3 64 % Operating income $ 49.2 $ 37.9 30 % Net earnings $ 30.8 $ 27.0 14 % Basic earnings per share (\"EPS\") $ 0.38 $ 0.34 12 % “We are pleased with results for our first full quarter following the significant acquisition we completed late last year. While maintaining a strong commitment to serve our customers, we remain focused on the integration of our newly acquired businesses and are pleased with the progress achieved,” said Scott J. Medhurst, President and Chief Executive Officer of Toromont Industries Ltd. “Our Equipment Group teams achieved growth in revenues, which together with the strong bookings, backlogs and service work-in-process levels, point to the increased activity levels seen this year. CIMCO continued to execute very well in Canada.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\n• Consolidated results\nNet earnings increased $3.8 million or 14% in the quarter versus a year ago to $30.8 million or $0.38 EPS. The following table identifies the components of contributions to Q1 results versus a year ago:\nNet earnings % Basic EPS (a) % millions, except per share amounts Q1 '18 Q1 '17 change Q1 '18 Q1 '17 change Legacy Toromont (b) 32.1 $ 27.0 19 % 0.41 $ 0.34 19 % Toromont QM (c) 5.0 - - 0.06 - - Acquisition-related interest expense (e) (5.1 ) - - (0.06 ) - - Integration-related costs (e) (1.2 ) - - (0.02 ) - - Dilutive impact of acquisition shares (d) - - - (0.01 ) - - As reported $ 30.8 $ 27.0 14 % $ 0.38 $ 0.34 12 % (a) Separately identifies impact of shares issued at acquisition for year-over-year comparability (b) Defined as all businesses continuing from prior to the acquisition (c) Defined as all business acquired October 27, 2017 (d) EPS impact of 2.2 million shares issued on acquisition to total net earnings (e) Expenses shown net of taxes Earnings in the legacy Toromont businesses (“Legacy Toromont”) increased 19% in the first quarter versus a year ago on growth in both the Equipment Group and CIMCO. The businesses acquired in October of 2017 (“Toromont QM”) contributed $5.0 million with contributions from the mining and power systems segments. Integration-related costs included severance and other one-time-only costs and combined with interest expense on the acquisition financing, reduced net earnings by $6.3 million versus a year ago.\n• Equipment Group\nRevenues increased $253.2 million or 70% to $613.0 million versus last year. Legacy Toromont revenues increased 3% on growth in product support and rental revenues, partially offset by lower total equipment sales. Toromont QM contributed $241.4 million in the quarter, which increased 18% from revenues generated in the first quarter of 2017 at the predecessor organization on growth in new equipment and product support.\nOperating income 1 was up $10.7 million. Legacy Toromont increased $5.0 million or 14%, which represented a 110 basis points increase in operating income margin 1 . Toromont QM contributed $5.7 million, net of integration-related costs of $1.7 million.\nBookings 1 in the first quarter of $370.0 million were up 97% over last year, including $157.0 million from Toromont QM. In total, order bookings were strong across most market segments. Backlogs 1 were $437.0 million at the end of March 31, 2018, including $184.0 million at Toromont QM. Most of the orders in backlog are expected to be delivered this year.\n• CIMCO\nRevenues increased 22% to $63.9 million from a year ago mainly due to strong package sales growth in Canada. Product support revenues decreased by 3%. Operating income increased 21% to $3.4 million and was 5.4% as a percentage of revenues.\nBookings were down by 5% in the quarter to $60.0 million. In Canada, strong industrial orders were partially offset by lower recreational orders while in the US, both market segments contracted against record levels achieved last year. Backlogs of $157.0 million were at a new high for the end of a first quarter, and up from $134.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $138.0 million at this time last year. Most of the backlog is expected to be delivered this year.\n• Financial position remains strong\nToromont’s share price of $55.93 at the end of March 2018 translates to a market capitalization 1 of $4.5 billion and a total enterprise value 1 of $5.1 billion.\nToromont maintained a very strong financial position. Leverage as represented by the net debt to total capitalization 1 ratio at March 31, 2018 was 33%.\nThe Board of Directors announced a quarterly dividend of 23 cents per common share, payable July 3, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 8, 2018. The quarterly dividend was previously increased 21% to 23 cents per share effective with the dividend paid April 2, 2018.\n“We are encouraged by the long-term outlook for infrastructure investment from the federal and provincial governments. Momentum remains good in the mining sector,\" continued Mr. Medhurst. \"The sustained momentum at CIMCO reflects its strong market presence and solid reputation as a leader in the markets it serves. Though much work lies ahead, we are making inroads in expanding our U.S. presence. Across our organization, long-term product support growth trends, together with diversity of markets in the new and significantly expanded territory, a strong management group and solid financial underpinning, provide substantial opportunities for continued success.”\nQuarterly Results Materials\nThe complete first quarter report for 2018, including MD&A and unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements, is available on our website at www.toromont.com .\nQuarterly Conference Call and Webcast\nInterested parties are invited to join the quarterly conference call with investment analysts, in listen-only mode, on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. (ET).
