We accept Israel’s position.”\nOne of the nation’s top players and most marketable athletes, Folau’s contract expires at the end of the season and RA are keen to extend it beyond next year’s World Cup in Japan.\nHis New South Wales Waratahs coach Daryl Gibson said Folau was free to express his views and that team unity had not been affected.\n“We may not all agree with his belief but we support him as a team mate and his right to express that freely,” Gibson told reporters.\n“I’ve always said everyone is free to have a range of diverse opinion. That’s the beauty of being a team - we’re not all going to agree on the same thing.”\nThe Super Rugby side take on South Africa’s Lions in Sydney on Friday.
