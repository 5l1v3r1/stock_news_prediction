Bitcoin 's winning day pushed other cryptos — including ethereum, bitcoin cash, litecoin and ripple — to highs of their own. \nBitcoin rallied to $19,500 in mid-December 2017. While Bogart said he's not completely ready to call the end of the bitcoin bear market with unresolved regulatory concerns still lingering, he said \"it would be very easy for bitcoin\" to go over its December highs. \nOther digital coins, Bogart pointed out, have had ICOs, or initial coin offerings, which prompted regulatory concerns and attracted the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission . \n\"Bitcoin is in the safest place out of all the other cryptocurrencies out there,\" he said. \"Bitcoin is the only one that very cleanly falls on the safe side of the SEC.\" Kellie Ell News Associate for CNBC Playing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T03:15:34.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
