Accordingly, the financial results were deconsolidated as of December 14, 2017. The key financial information related to the Divestments for the period up to the disposal date, is quantified in the discontinued sections below. All results presented for the current period reflect these changes and the comparable periods presented have also been adjusted retrospectively.\nAdditionally, the excess of total consideration over the carrying value of the disposed entities was $342.0 million. The Company has recognized $161.5 million of gain in the fourth quarter, which represents the percentage of the cash received of the overall consideration. The remaining portion of the excess which represents the percentage of the consideration that is still receivable, is $180.4 million and recorded as deferred gain from the disposal of discontinued operations on the balance sheet. The Company will recognize these gains pro-rata as it receives cash from the purchasers in future periods.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nNet revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 23.1% year-over-year to $13.4 million from $17.5 million in the same period in 2016.\nConsumer Services revenues consist of advertising and other consumer services. Advertising revenues increased 14.2% year-over-year to $3.2 million from $2.8 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in advertising revenues was mainly due to overseas promotional business. Other services revenues decreased 17.6% year-over-year to $0.9 million from $1.1 million in the same period a year ago. The decrease in other service revenues was mainly due to lower premium consumer security revenues as a result of the Company moving away from premium subscription services to an advertising-based model.\nEnterprise Mobility revenues decreased 31.2% year-over-year to $9.4 million from $13.6 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in enterprise product revenues was mainly due to weakness in customer demand in the fourth quarter of the year compared to the same period of last year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 45.3% year-over-year to $11.4 million from $20.8 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower hardware sales within the enterprise business and lower customer acquisition cost within the consumer services segment.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.0 million from a gross loss of $3.4 million in the same period in 2016. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, was 15.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with negative gross margin of 19.2% in the same period in 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 41.5% year-over-year to $1.2 million from $2.1 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP selling and marketing expenses, which exclude share-based compensation decreased 42.9% year-over-year to $1.2 million from $2.1 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by a reduction in overall staff costs and lower overall marketing and advertising expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 135.5% year-over-year to $28.8 million from $12.2 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP general and administrative expenses, which exclude share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, increased 153.5% year-over-year to $28.7 million from $11.3 million in the same period in 2016. The year-over-year increase is primarily driven by a non-cash accounting treatment of allowance for bad debt in the quarter.\nResearch and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 98.2% year-over-year to $7.9 million from $4.0 million in the same period in 2016. Non-GAAP research and development expenses, which exclude share-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, increased 93.8% to $7.8 million from $4.0 million in the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly due to the Link Motion business and development projects.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.9 million as the result of a one-time, non-cash impairment of goodwill in the enterprise reporting unit.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased 63.5% year-over-year to $42.8 million from $117.2 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was mainly the result of less impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the period, offset by increases in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 116.1% year-over-year to $37.7 million from $17.4 million in the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly due to the increase in general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses as described above. See below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of Non-GAAP operating expenses and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nShare-based Compensation Expenses\nShare-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating cost and expenses line items, amounted to $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.1million in the corresponding period in 2016.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $40.8 million, compared with $120.5 million in the same period in 2016.\nNon-GAAP loss from operations, which excludes share-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets arising from acquisitions, and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, was $35.6 million compared to $19.8 million in the same period in 2016. See below under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a discussion of Non-GAAP loss from operations and a reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable measure calculated under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nForeign Exchange Gain/(Loss) , Interest Expenses and Other Income\nForeign exchange gain was $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with a loss of $0.6 million in the same period in 2016, which was affected by fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates. Interest expenses were $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $6.1 million in the same period a year ago. Interest expenses were primarily derived from interest expense related to convertible debts, offset by the interest income from certain term deposits. The decrease of interest expenses is mainly due to we early redeemed $ 88 million convertible debt.\nImpairment Loss\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized impairment losses of $1.4 million, primarily driven by one-time non-cash write-downs of long-term investments.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax expense was $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with income tax benefit of $3.1 million in the same period in 2016.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe Company announced in a press release on December 14, 2017 that it had completed the divestment of FL Mobile and Showself's Live Social Video Business.

Advertising revenues decreased 33.1% year-over-year to $10.4 million from $15.6 million in the same period in 2016.

Other services revenues decreased 32.4% year-over-year to $4.0 million from $5.9 million in the same period a year ago.

The increase in enterprise mobility revenues was mainly due to stronger overall hardware sales of Trustek in the year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the fiscal year 2017 decreased 12.1% year-over-year to $56.6 million from $64.4 million in the same period in 2016.
