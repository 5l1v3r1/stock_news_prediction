A strong euro can make Remy’s products less affordable for overseas consumers and hit sales made in the United States.\n“Reported 4Q’18 group reported sales of 264.9 million euros was 1.7 percent below consensus of 269.6 million euros as FX (foreign exchange) wiped out the strong organic results,” wrote Liberum analysts in a note, keeping a “sell” rating on Remy.\nFinance chief Luca Marotta reiterated on a call with analysts on Wednesday that foreign exchange movements would knock 17-18 million euros off full-year operating profit - in line with previous guidance on this aspect from back in January.\nLike its rivals, Remy Cointreau is sensitive to demand in China, where it has been marketing premium spirits, including its $3,000 a bottle top-of-the-range Louis XIII cognac.\nThe private consumption of drinks and spirits has been recovering in China, offsetting the impact from the country’s anti-corruption crackdown over the past few years which had hit sales of premium brand drinks.\nRemy shares, which rose 43 percent in 2017, are down by around 2 percent so far in 2018.\n$1 = 0.8080 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon and Pascale Denis; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:56:09.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
