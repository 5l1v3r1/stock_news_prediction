Environmentalists blame much of the forest destruction on land clearance for the crop.\nThere are more than 2 million smallholders in Malaysia and Indonesia - the two countries that dominate the world’s supply of the vegetable oil.\nThese farmers produce about 40 percent of palm oil from those two countries, but suffer low productivity and are often blamed for unsustainable farming practices like slash and burn forest clearing and peatland destruction.\nBig palm buyers like Nestle, Unilever and Procter & Gamble run small schemes that try and improve sustainability among smallholders, and conference officials backed such efforts.\n“Working with the palm oil producers is important ... to ensure that Indonesia can increase the production but without expanding into the forest,” said Christoffer Gronstad, a climate change and forest expert at the Norwegian Embassy in Indonesia.\nNorway and Indonesia signed a bilateral agreement in 2010 to tackle deforestation and boost economic development.\n(This version was refiled to fix garbled text in paragraph seven)\nReporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Jared FerriePlease credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
