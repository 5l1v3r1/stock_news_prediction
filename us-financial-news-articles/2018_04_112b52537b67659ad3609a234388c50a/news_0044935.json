Their power generation in 2017 was 2.6 trillion kilowatt-hours, 42 percent of China’s total.\nThe move comes after those regions launched electricity markets last year for monthly and quarterly prices.\nChina’s major utilities, including China Huadian Corp, China Datang Group, China State Grid Corp and the Three Gorges hydropower producer will be the biggest players in the market, the NEA statement said.\nThe NEA called for industry feedback by the end of the month but did not give a timeline for the launch. Last August it said it planned to introduce the scheme by the end of 2018.\nReporting by Muyu Xu, Josephine Mason and Meng Meng; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T14:31:17.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
