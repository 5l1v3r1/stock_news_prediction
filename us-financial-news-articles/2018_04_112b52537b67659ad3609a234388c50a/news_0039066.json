But Mr. Weidmann played down the change, suggesting he would continue to press the ECB to phase out easy money soon.\n“There’s no reason to see a turning point in growth—Germany’s economy is still booming,” said Mr. Weidmann, who also sits on the ECB’s 25-member rate-setting committee.\nECB officials are expected to decide soon whether to phase out their €2.5 trillion ($3.1 trillion) bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, as the region’s economy strengthens and unemployment falls. The bank’s next rate-setting meeting is Wednesday and Thursday in Frankfurt, but economists don’t expect any action yet.\nThe ECB’s policy deliberations are being closely watched by global investors because the bank’s key interest rate—currently minus 0.4%—affects a swath of market rates and asset prices.\nEconomic growth in the 19-nation eurozone eclipsed the U.S. over the past two years, but recent data suggest that feat is unlikely to be repeated this year.\nECB officials have differed publicly over how quickly to phase out their stimulus. One group of officials, centered around Mr. Weidmann, is keen for the ECB to take advantage of strong economic growth to phase out QE and move toward higher interest rates. But another group of officials, which includes ECB President Mario Draghi and chief economist Peter Praet, is more cautious, worried that eurozone inflation, at 1.3% in March , remains too weak.\n“While our confidence in the inflation outlook has increased, remaining uncertainties still warrant patience, persistence and prudence with regard to monetary policy,” Mr. Draghi said Friday.\nIndustrial production in the currency union unexpectedly fell by 0.8% on the month in February, marking a third straight month of declines. Other recent indicators pointing to a slowdown include surveys of purchasing managers at manufacturers and service providers, retail sales data, and barometers of confidence among households and businesses.\nSome of the weakness reflects temporary factors that shouldn’t hurt growth in the months to come, including a spell of unusually cold weather across Europe and strikes among German metal and electrical workers.\nHowever, surveys suggest businesses are experiencing shortages of some inputs and workers with particular skills, suggesting that the eurozone economy can’t grow this fast for long.\nIn Germany, where years of robust growth have reduced the unemployment rate to around 5%, some firms are facing constraints because they can’t find enough skilled workers, Mr. Weidmann said. But the economy continues to grow considerably above its potential growth rate, he said, referring to the rate at which capital and labor are used efficiently.\nMr. Draghi highlighted several risks that could upset the eurozone economy, including rising trade protectionism and volatility in financial markets and the value of the euro.\nInternational trade disputes “may have already had some negative impact on global sentiment indicators,” Mr. Draghi said. “The positive developments in the euro area are not independent of the global growth momentum.”\nWrite to Tom Fairless at tom.fairless@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T00:34:05.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
