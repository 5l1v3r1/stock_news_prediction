Britain’s business ministry is due soon to announce a review of the watchdog’s powers.\nImproving audit quality is a priority for the FRC as Britain prepares to leave the European Union next year, increasing the need for London to remain a global center for company listings as it faces more competition from continental financial hubs.\nThe FRC on Monday warned the Big Four it could fine them 10 million pounds or more for serious breaches, double its record fine to date.\nThe sector is waiting to see what action, if any the watchdog will take against the auditors of department store BHS, Co-operative bank, and technology firm Autonomy.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T09:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T10:07:14.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
