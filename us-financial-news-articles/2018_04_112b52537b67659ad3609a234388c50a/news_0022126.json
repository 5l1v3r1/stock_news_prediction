The cost of doing so is prohibitive and the solution is unsustainable because of the massive disparity between LHA (local housing allowance) rates and market rent,” one council in the Midlands said in the report. \nSleeping on the streets – or rough sleeping – has risen in England for seven consecutive years, according to government figures, with more than 1,000 homeless in London and more than 4,100 nationally, a 134 percent jump since 2010. \nBritain’s parliament last year passed the Homelessness Reduction Act, which was designed to ensure that local councils increased obligations toward homeless people. \nThe government has set an ambitious target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the mid-2020s.
