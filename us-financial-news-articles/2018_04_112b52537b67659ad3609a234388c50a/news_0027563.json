He reached base for the 11th straight game and reached base more than once for the ninth time in that span.\nJ.D. Martinez scored the tiebreaking run on a wild pitch, Mitch Moreland also had three hits and Tzu-Wei Lin added insurance with a double as the Red Sox improved to 13-2.\nThe Red Sox played without Mookie Betts (bruised left foot) but also improved to 8-1 at home. It is their best start at home since 1998.\nBoston recorded its latest win on the fifth anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombing. During the seventh-inning stretch, a moment of silence was held for the victims.\nChris Sale allowed one run and two hits in five innings for his third no-decision of the season. He struck out eight, walked two and threw 93 pitches. Heath Hembree (2-0) pitched two scoreless innings, Matt Barnes retired Manny Machado for the final out of a scoreless eighth and Craig Kimbrel fanned two in a perfect ninth for his fifth save.\nDylan Bundy (0-2) allowed three runs — one earned — on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings as Baltimore lost for the fifth time in six games.\nMachado doubled in Baltimore’s lone run in the first inning but the Orioles struck out 14 times.\nThe Orioles took a 1-0 lead when Machado roped a double down the left field line over the leaping attempt of third baseman Rafael Devers.\nBaltimore did not get another hit against Sale after Machado’s double and Boston tied the game in the fifth when Jackie Bradley Jr. stole second and easily scored on Benintendi’s triple to right field.\nThe Red Sox took a 2-1 lead before an out was recorded in the sixth and ended the frame with a 3-1 lead.\nMartinez reached on an error by third baseman Danny Valencia, took third on Moreland’s double to deep left and scored on a wild pitch. Lin knocked out Bundy with a two-strike, ground-rule double into the right field seats.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:31:35.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
