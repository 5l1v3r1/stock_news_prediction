Soccer Football - Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg - FC Barcelona vs Chelsea - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - March 14, 2018 Chelsea's Marcos Alonso looks dejected after the match REUTERS/Albert Gea \nThe 27-year-old Spaniard appeared to stand on the back of Long’s calf in the first half as Chelsea came back from two goals down to win 3-2 at St Mary’s Stadium. \nThe incident was not seen by referee Mike Dean but was caught on video and will be reviewed by an FA panel. \n“Each panel member will review the video footage independently of one another to determine whether they consider it a sending-off offence,” the FA said in a statement on Tuesday. \n“For retrospective action to be taken, and an FA charge to follow, the decision of the panel must be unanimous.” \nAlonso has until 1800 BST on Wednesday to respond and could miss Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton if the charge is upheld. \nHe could also miss Premier League games against Burnley and Swansea City.
