Methane, the main component of natural gas, is far more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide but does not stay in the air as long.\nMany companies consider the federal rule unnecessary and overly intrusive and note that companies have an economic incentive to capture the methane so they can sell it.\nA federal judge in San Francisco reinstated the rule in February, even as the Trump administration proposed a new one that would significantly weaken the original.\nCourts in Wyoming and California have issued conflicting opinions on the rule, and a bid by Congress to overturn the measure failed in the Republican-controlled Senate.\nDan Naatz, vice president of government affairs for the Independent Petroleum Association of America, cheered the latest court decision.\n\"A new rule is coming out,\" he said. \"The agency is taking comments on it now.\" Trying to enforce Obama-era rule in the meantime would only cause confusion, he added.\nBut Peter Zalzal, a lawyer for the Environmental Defense Fund, said the ruling \"effectively punishes\" law-abiding companies that have been complying with the new standards, \"while rewarding those in the oil and gas industry that are recklessly wasting a valuable public resource and squandering tax payers' hard-earned money.\"\nThe environmental group pledged to appeal the case, likely ensuring another legal round in the much-litigated case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T00:03:35.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
