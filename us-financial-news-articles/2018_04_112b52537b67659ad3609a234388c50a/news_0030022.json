Such inquiries are carried out to determine if a formal investigation of an incident is warranted. \nA Korean Air Lines spokesman said the company had yet to be informed of any preliminary investigation. \nThe airline’s chairman, Cho Yang-ho, has not commented on the incident involving his younger daughter, who has left the country on a vacation, the company said. \nThe behaviour of the rich and powerful is sensitive in a country where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates know as chaebol, particularly days after a court jailed former President Park Geun-hye for 24 years over a scandal that exposed deep ties of corruption with several chaebol. \nKorean Air Lines was not connected to the Park scandal. \nThousands of people have in recent days posted comments on a presidential office website where members of the public can lodge petitions, to demand changes at the airline. \nMany of the people who signed a few dozen petitions demanded that the airline remove the word “Korean” from its name and stop using the symbol on the Korean flag as its logo. \nMany said the daughters’ behaviour was “degrading” for the country and the company. \nA petition needs to gain more than 200,000 signatures within 30 days to prompt a mandatory response from the presidential office. \nHeather Cho was found guilty of breaking aviation law and jailed for a year over her “nut rage” incident but was freed in May 2015 after an appeal.
