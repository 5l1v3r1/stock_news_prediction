That would be a marked slowdown from 1.6 percent annualised growth in the fourth quarter. [nL4N1QQ07K] \nThe world’s third-largest economy has grown for eight straight quarters through the end of 2017, the longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy. \nMost economists believe weakness in the first quarter will be temporary, but the value of the yen and any increase in trade frictions with the United States pose risks to the outlook. \nThe survey also showed Japanese firms continued to face sharp rises in input costs, but were able to pass on some of the increases to their customers. \nReporting by Stanley White", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T04:55:24.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
