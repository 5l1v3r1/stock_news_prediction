(\"MITL\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: MITL) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by affiliates of Searchlight Capital Partners, L.P. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $11.15 in cash for each MITL share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether MITL's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $15.00 per VVC share, or $3.85 above the offer price.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MITL Board acted in the best interests of VVC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own VVC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
