They’re not bold at the moment. They are talking about it, but where are the actions?” \nA global reach allowed for more money to be pumped into development programs in areas not traditionally associated with netball, like one in Argentina to spread the game in South America. OLYMPIC AMBITIONS \nBriegal said the sport had Olympic ambitions and growing the game outside its traditional markets would help it meet the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) requirements for universality for a sport to be admitted to the program. \nThe most powerful netball nations in the world are all former Commonwealth countries. The top-12 ranked sides in the world all played at the Gold Coast. \nWhile netball at the elite international level is also predominantly a female game, the IOC’s requirement did not mean the organization had to develop equal competitions for men and women, she said. \n“Our strength is that we are predominantly a female game,” she said. “We do have a strong relationship with   Federation and the IOC because we offer a unique proposition. \n“We also provide the opportunity to even up the medals. \n“That’s the way the IOC talks to us as well. It’s not that every sport has an even amount of medals, it’s about the whole of sport across the games having that opportunity.” \nThe development of more competitive teams around the world would also help, with the performances of Uganda and Malawi, who upset world number two New Zealand in pool play, showing the strength in sub-Saharan Africa. \n“We have got the potential athletes,” she said. \n“But what we need is the ongoing investment. \n“If we had the same level of investment in Africa as they get in Australia, we’d have an African winner. \n“The competition has got closer. We used to speak about a big two (Australia and New Zealand). Now it’s a big four (including Jamaica and England). \n“And the other countries are snapping at their heels.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Amaln Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T08:56:34.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
