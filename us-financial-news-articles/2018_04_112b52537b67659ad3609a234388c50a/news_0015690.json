REUTERS/Brendan McDermid “It’s not enough to offset better expectations about the overall economy,” Warne said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 442.09 points, or 1.84 percent, to 24,421.19, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 45.57 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,658.73 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 141.90 points, or 2.04 percent, to 7,092.24.\nU.S. stocks will face a major test in coming weeks as first-quarter earnings pour in. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) will kick off the earnings season on Friday.\nAnalysts expect quarterly profits for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, which would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nFacebook Inc ( FB.O ) shares rose 3.5 percent after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg began his testimony before Congress and took questions from lawmakers.\nZuckerberg’s testimony aimed to strike a conciliatory tone in an attempt to blunt possible regulatory fallout from the privacy scandal engulfing his social network.\nSprint Corp ( S.N ) shares jumped 18.4 percent after reports that the company had restarted merger talks with T-Mobile US Inc ( TMUS.O ). T-Mobile shares rose 6.9 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.67-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 47 new highs and 30 new lows.\nAdditional reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Diptendu Lahiri; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T16:21:52.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
