Ramaphosa has promised to revive the economy and crack down on government corruption.\nThe IMF raised its 2018 forecast of gross domestic product to 1.5 percent for 2018 and 1.7 for 2019, compared to previous forecasts of 0.9 percent and 1.6 percent respectively.\nSouth Africa’s economy grew by 1.3 percent in 2017 compared with a revised 0.6 percent in 2016.\n“Business confidence is likely to gradually firm up with the change in the political leadership, but growth prospects remain weighed down by structural bottlenecks,” the international lender said in its latest World Economic Outlook published in Washington.\n“The election of new political leadership reduces some of the policy uncertainty. However, advancement of the outstanding reforms is critical for reinvigorating economic growth and making it more inclusive,” said the IMF.\nThe IMF said the reforms would improve infrastructure in transport and telecommunication sectors to spur growth.\nThe lender said South Africa’s economic growth would average 1.8 percent between 2020 and 2023, well below the country’s target of 5 percent annual expansion needed to dent soaring levels of poverty and unemployment.\nGrowth in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to rise to 3.4 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 2019, the IMF said.
