A U.S. review of Cosco Shipping Holdings Co.’s proposed $6.3 billion purchase of rival Orient Overseas International Ltd. 0316 0.91% is raising concerns about the Chinese state-run conglomerate’s control of a major container terminal at California’s Port of Long Beach . The WSJ’s Costas Paris and Joanne Chiu report that Cosco has told U.S. officials they are willing to sell or carve out the Long Beach Container Terminal, but it’s unclear whether that would satisfy the U.S. The terminal is one of the one of the few in the U.S. that is automated and can handle the new generation of bigger ships, and for Cosco it’s what one official called a “prized asset” in the deal. The company’s acquisition fits in with Beijing’s global “one belt, one road” initiative and the review signals the expansion faces clear limits.\nTechnology in the warehouse is starting to look a little more like electronics at home. Companies operating some distribution centers are turning to smartphones, user-friendly apps and even emojis as they try to simplify work routines and training —and lure younger workers who have grown up using mobile devices. WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that TechStyle Fashion Group is running activities at a Southern California warehouse through Apple Inc. AAPL -0.01% devices and Apple’s operating system. Software provider EVS says this sort of strategy “takes the chunk out of” warehouses, and can push aside the heavy handheld devices commonly called bricks. The use of user-friendly consumer tech is growing more common in various shipping operations. One benefit, says TechStyle, is that it can find new equipment at local electronics stores rather than going through industrial suppliers.\nThe U.S. and China may be taking steps to ease the trans-Pacific tensions that threaten to fracture key pillars of world-wide trade. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he may head to Beijing for trade negotiations, and China says it welcomes the move following weeks of harsh words and new tariffs that threaten to escalate into a full trade war . The WSJ’s Bob Davis and Lingling Wei write the tensions are already hitting businesses. Last week, the U.S. barred American businesses from supplying technology to ZTE Corp. , and the Chinese telecom equipment maker says the penalty threatens its survival. China now is looking hard at Qualcomm Inc.’s planned $44 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors NV. On the Pacific, bulk vessels carrying U.S. sorghum to China turned around soon after Beijing added the major American export to its list of targets for retaliatory tariffs.\nE-COMMERCE The Port of Long Beach. Photo: Bloomberg News Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -0.04% latest disclosure of salary information portrays a business that’s really three companies in one. Amazon says the median annual salary of its workers is $28,446, putting the company close to Hershey Co. and Home Depot Inc. in compensation. The WSJ’s Georgia Wells, Rachel Feintzeig and Theo Francis write that’s far below the median salaries at tech giants like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL -0.41% Google, showing how Amazon’s growing logistical apparatus separates it from its tech peers. One researcher likened Amazon to a three-way hybrid of Google, United Parcel Service Inc. and Walmart Inc. Amazon’s software development means the company’s shares trade like a tech stock, even as it bulks up its network of 175 operating and fulfillment centers. For communities welcoming Amazon expansion, the salary figures may prompt questions about exactly which Amazon business may be moving in.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ You’re not reading a number, you’re looking for an emoji. ’\n—Phoebe Rockwood of Flexport Inc., on the use of consumer-technology principles at one of its warehouses.\nNumber of the Day 11% Increase in capacity on the U.S. truckload spot market since April 1, when tougher enforcement of electronic logging devices began, according to DAT Solutions LLC .\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. tariffs on steel imports are likely to cost the American economy jobs , Federal Reserve Bank of New York economists say.
