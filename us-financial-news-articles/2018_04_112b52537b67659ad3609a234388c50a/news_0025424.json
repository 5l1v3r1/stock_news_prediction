But Brent crude futures are now trading at around $70 a barrel.\nNorway’s oil-backed Government Pension Fund Global is still the largest SWF in the world, with total assets of $1.06 trillion. This fund accounted for a fifth of the $866 billion year-on-year increase, Preqin said, adding that most of its gains came from its public equities portfolio.\nThe fund was able to double its return on its total investments in 2017, beating its own benchmark.\nChina Investment Corporation (CIC) has also experienced a significant growth in assets, with its returns largely boosted by stronger-than-expected Chinese economic growth, Preqin said.\nOn the debit side, Russia’s Reserve Fund ceased operations at the start of 2018 after Russia’s finance ministry fully spent the fund’s capital to cover budget shortfalls. The remaining capital was distributed to the National Wealth Fund.\nSWF appetite for alternative assets has continued to grow, with 76 percent of funds now investing in at least one alternative asset class, up from 74 percent in 2017. Real estate and infrastructure are the most popular, with 62 percent and 64 percent of funds having exposure to these respectively.\nSWFs now account for at least 15 percent of the global alternatives market, according to a recent report from State Street Global Advisors (SSGA).\nNorway’s finance ministry has said its SWF should not be given permission to invest in unlisted companies.\nBut others, such as Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, have become increasingly active in private markets, not least through its tech-focused joint venture with Softbank.\nReporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:58:47.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
