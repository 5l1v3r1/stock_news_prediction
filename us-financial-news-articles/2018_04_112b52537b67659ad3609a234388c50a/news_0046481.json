(NASDAQ:LBAI) (the “Company”), the parent company of Lakeland Bank (“Lakeland”), reported net income and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $15.3 million and $0.32, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $12.3 million and $0.26 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, return on average assets was 1.14%, return on average common equity was 10.60%, and return on average tangible common equity was 13.90%.\nThomas Shara, Lakeland Bancorp’s President and CEO commented, “We are pleased to announce that Lakeland continues to experience steady growth, which resulted in attaining the highest quarterly net income in our history, including an 8% increase in pre-tax income and a 23% increase in EPS compared to the first quarter of 2017. Our record results were driven in part by the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act along with an improved net interest margin and strong asset quality. As we stated in our fourth quarter press release, we intend to use a portion of the tax savings to invest in our dedicated personnel, enhance our technology offerings for our customers and, most importantly, reward our loyal shareholders with increased earnings. As a result of our strong earnings, our Board has approved a 15% increase in our dividend.”\nEarnings\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.3 million, a 24% increase compared to $12.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. EPS for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.32, a 23% increase compared to $0.26 in 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased to $42.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $39.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to the organic growth of earning assets and increases in loan and lease yields.\nThe yield on interest earning assets for the first quarter of 2018 was 4.02%, as compared to 3.78% reported in the first quarter of 2017. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the first quarter of 2018 was 0.83% compared to 0.60% for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the higher cost of deposits. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 of 3.39% increased two basis points from the prior quarter and six basis points from the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income totaled $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $8.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included a $2.5 million gain on sales of securities, a $0.4 million gain on sale of a former branch and $0.3 million in gains on sales of other real estate owned.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $27.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, which included $2.8 million in long term debt prepayment fees. Salary and employee benefit expense increased $1.4 million from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 as a result of additions to our staff to support continued growth, as well as normal merit increases.\nFinancial Condition\nIn the first quarter of 2018, total assets increased $72.2 million, to $5.48 billion as total loans and leases grew $71.4 million, or 2%, to $4.23 billion and investment securities increased $7.3 million to $805.7 million. On the funding side, total deposits grew $79.2 million, or 2%, to $4.45 billion. As of March 31, 2018, total loans and leases as a percent of total deposits was 95.1%.\nAsset Quality\nAt March 31, 2018, non-performing assets totaled $14.7 million (0.27% of total assets) compared to $18.5 million (0.35% of total assets) at March 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans and leases as a percent of total loans and leases decreased to 0.32% at March 31, 2018 from 0.45% at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $35.6 million at March 31, 2018 (0.84% of total loans and leases) compared to $31.6 million at March 31, 2017 (0.79% of total loans and leases). In the first quarter of 2018, the Company had net charge-offs of $1.1 million (0.10% of average loans and leases) compared to $0.9 million (0.09% of average loans and leases) for the same period in 2017. The first quarter of 2018 provision for loan and lease losses was $1.3 million compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital\nAt March 31, 2018, stockholders' equity was $588.6 million compared to $557.6 million at March 31, 2017, a 6% increase. Lakeland Bank remains above FDIC “well capitalized” standards, with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 10.15% at March 31, 2018.

The words “anticipates”, “projects”, “intends”, “estimates”, “expects”, “believes”, “plans”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “could”, and other similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. The Company cautions that these forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative and speak only as of the date made, and are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, all of which may change over time. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from such forward-looking statements: changes in the financial services industry and the U.S. and global capital markets, changes in economic conditions nationally, regionally and in the Company’s markets, the nature and timing of actions of the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators, the nature and timing of legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry, government intervention in the U.S. financial system, changes in levels of market interest rates, pricing pressures on loan and deposit products, credit risks of the Company’s lending and leasing activities, successful implementation, deployment and upgrades of new and existing technology, systems, services and products, customers’ acceptance of the Company’s products and services, and competition. Any statements made by the Company that are not historical facts should be considered to be forward-looking statements. The Company is not obligated to update and does not undertake to update any of its forward-looking statements made herein.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReported amounts are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). This press release also contains certain supplemental non-GAAP information that the Company’s management uses in its analysis of the Company’s financial results. Specifically, the Company provides measures based on what it believes are its operating earnings on a consistent basis, and excludes material non-routine operating items which affect the GAAP reporting of results of operations. The Company’s management believes that providing this information to analysts and investors allows them to better understand and evaluate the Company’s core financial results for the periods in question.\nThe Company also provides measurements and ratios based on tangible equity and tangible assets. These measures are utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and, therefore, the Company’s management believes that such information is useful to investors.\nThe Company also uses an efficiency ratio that is a non-GAAP financial measure. The ratio that the Company uses excludes amortization of core deposit intangibles, provision for unfunded lending commitments and, where applicable, long-term debt prepayment fees and merger related expenses. Income for the non-GAAP ratio is increased by the favorable effect of tax-exempt income and excludes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities and gain on debt extinguishment, which can vary from period to period. The Company uses this ratio because it believes the ratio provides a relevant measure to compare the operating performance period to period.\nThese disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. See accompanying non-GAAP tables.\nAbout Lakeland Bank\nLakeland Bank is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:LBAI), which has $5.5 billion in total assets.
