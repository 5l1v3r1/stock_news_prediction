POSSIBLE BANK, TAX FRAUD \n“Today, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients,” Ryan said in a statement. \n“I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,” Ryan said. \nFederal prosecutors are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, and for possible campaign law violation in connection with the Stormy Daniels payment, and perhaps other matters having to do with foreign support to Trump’s 2016 campaign, a second source familiar with the investigation said. \nThe New York Times reported on Monday evening that Mueller is investigating a $150,000 payment made in September 2015 by a Ukrainian billionaire, Viktor Pinchuk, to Trump’s charitable foundation in exchange for a 20-minute video appearance by Trump at a conference in Kiev. \nCohen solicited the Pinchuk donation, the Times reported, citing three sources it said were briefed on the matter, although it was not immediately clear if Monday’s raids sought information on that issue. \nTrump had declared his candidacy for president in June 2015. \nCohen did not immediately respond to Reuters for a request for comment on the raids. A spokesman for Mueller had no comment. \nCohen has said that he paid the $130,000 settlement money to Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, from his own pocket through a personal home equity loan. Trump, in comments to reporters on Air Force One last week, said that he did not know about the payment.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nAccording to a person familiar with the matter, FBI agents executed a search warrant at the New York offices of the law firm Squire Patton Boggs on the 23rd floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where Cohen has an office. \nThe agents went there about 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. and worked for several hours, the person said. \nA source familiar with the investigation said the raid was conducted without prior warning. \nFederal agents also raided a room at the Loews Regency Hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where Cohen has been staying while his apartment is being renovated, The New York Times reported, citing an unnamed person. \nThe FBI and U.S. Attorney’s office on Monday also sought any emails between former White House communications director Hope Hicks and Cohen about a false and misleading account that Trump helped prepare of a June 9, 2016, meeting between Trump’s son Donald Trump, Jr. and son-in-law Jared Kushner and a group of Russians who had promised “dirt” on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the first source familiar with the investigation said. \nSuch emails would not be covered by attorney-client privilege, this source said, because Cohen did not represent Hicks. \nRyan, in his statement, called the search warrants executed by the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.” \n“It resulted in the unnecessary seizure of protected attorney client communications between a lawyer and his clients,” he said. \nAttorney-client privilege is intended to encourage open communications between lawyers and their clients, so that lawyers can provide sound legal advice. \nBut the privilege is not absolute, and there is an exception for communications made to further a crime. \n“The crime-fraud exception means the privilege does not apply to communications between the client and the attorney, if they are evidence of an ongoing crime or fraud, not just a past crime or fraud,” said Christopher Slobogin, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School specializing in criminal procedure and evidence. \nA spokesman for Squire Patton Boggs said in a statement that its arrangement with Cohen is ending.

These activities do not relate to the firm and we are in full cooperation.” \nRyan said that Cohen has cooperated with authorities and turned over thousands of documents to congressional investigators for their own probes into Moscow’s alleged efforts to influence the U.S. election.
