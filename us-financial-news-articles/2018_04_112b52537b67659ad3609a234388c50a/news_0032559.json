Daniels said in an interview with ABC on Wednesday that she thought he was someone’s husband and described him as “sort of handsome.”\nTrump has largely remained quiet on the subject, although he told reporters earlier this month that he did not know about the payment to Daniels.\nAdult film star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and her security leave the Detroit Police Department 4th Precinct after picking up her temporary Dance Permit license to perform at a club in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook However, on Wednesday, in his first reference to Daniels via Twitter, he said in a post: “A sketch years later about a nonexistent man. A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!”\nAsked for comment, Avenatti referred to his own Twitter posts on Wednesday.\n“In my experience, there is nothing better in litigation than having a completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent who is prone to shooting himself in the foot. Always leads to BIGLY problems ... like new claims (i.e. defamation),” Avenatti said in one of two posts.\nThe sketch was released the day after a hearing in federal court in Manhattan, where Trump attorney Cohen fought to limit the capability of federal prosecutors to review documents seized in a raid by FBI agents on his home, office and hotel room.\nA source familiar with the raids said that the agents were looking for more information on payments to Daniels within materials related to Cohen’s business dealings. The raids are related to a separate investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Trump has repeatedly said there was no collusion.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by Bernadette Baum, Tim Ahmann and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T14:44:51.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
