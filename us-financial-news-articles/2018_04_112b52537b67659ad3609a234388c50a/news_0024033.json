Octo Telematics, which provides black boxes and data analytics services for the auto insurance industry, could not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe United States imposed major sanctions last week against Vekselberg and other oligarchs close to Russian President Vladimir Putin as punishment for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other \"malign activity\".\nOcto Telematics is controlled by Russian investment group Renova, which in turn is owned by Vekselberg. Private equity group Pamplona Capital Management is also a shareholder in Octo Telematics.\nThe Milan IPO, structured through the sale of existing shares by Octo Telematics shareholders, was expected to happen in the first half of 2018, a source told Reuters in December.\nThe company's owners were planning to sell 35-40 percent of the company to Italian and foreign institutional investors, targeting an enterprise value of 1.2 billion euros ($1.48 billion), Il Sole said.
