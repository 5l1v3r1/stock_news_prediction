We had the moral obligations, we had promised not to do it some 10 years ago, I think, upon the request of our known partners,” he said according to RIA.\nHe also said that he was convinced Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump would not allow an armed confrontation between their two countries, RIA reported.\nA Russian army commander has also said that Moscow would consider supplying S-300 missile systems to Syria following U.S.-led strikes.\nThe United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles last week in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack by government forces on a rebel-held area near the capital.\nAccording to military analysts, the S-300 surface-to-air missile system would improve Russia’s ability to control air space in Syria, where Moscow’s forces support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, and could be aimed at deterring tougher U.S. action.\nReporting by Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Christian Lowe and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Peter Graff and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T09:39:00.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
