Fourteen survivors were taken to various hospitals, with three in critical condition. \nThe bus was transporting the Humboldt Broncos ice hockey team when the accident occurred at about 5:00 p.m. on Friday near the Tisdale area, around 185 miles (300 km) north of Regina, the Canadian Press reported. \n“Our thoughts and prayers are extended to the families of our staff and athletes as well as to all who have been impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Kevin Garinger, the team’s president, said in a statement. \n“Our Broncos family is in shock as we try to come to grips with our incredible loss.” \nThe team was headed to play in Game 5 of a playoff series against the Nipawin Hawks. \nDarren Opp, president of the Nipawin Hawks, was quoted by the Globe and Mail newspaper as saying the truck, a semi-trailer, had T-boned the players’ bus. \n“It’s a horrible accident, my God,” he said. “It’s very, very bad.” An emergency vehicle blocks the road to traffic the day after a bus carrying the Humboldt Broncos junior hockey team collided with a semi-trailer near Tisdale, Saskatchewan, Canada April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Matt Smith \nThe cause of the accident could not be immediately confirmed, however, and police said nothing about the identity of the dead or condition of the truck driver. \nOn Saturday morning, the police had blocked off nearly 2 miles (3 km) of the highway between Tisdale and Nipawin and a few emergency vehicles were seen entering and leaving the scene of the accident. \nCondolences were pouring in from former hockey players, sports organizations and political leaders across the country. \n“I cannot imagine what these parents are going through, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy, in the Humboldt community and beyond,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wrote in a tweet. \nFamily and friends of the victims took to social media to express their grief with #prayersforhumboldt. \n“The Broncos bus crashed on the way to Nipawin tonight Ryan is in hospital. There were fatalities and we are heartbroken. We will be flying out tomorrow,” Michelle Straschnitzki said on Facebook regarding her son. \nEstablished in 1970, The Humboldt Broncos are a team from Humboldt, Saskatchewan, and play in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League.

Everything from weddings to funerals to gatherings to hockey games — this is where it all happens in the community. This is where we get together.” Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Denny Thomas in Toronto; Editing by Janet Lawrence and Tom Brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T12:17:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
