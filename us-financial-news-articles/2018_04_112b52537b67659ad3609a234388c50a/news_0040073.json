Vattenfall’s Finnish rival Fortum has also made several acquisitions to compete in the sector.\nState-owned Vattenfall, which already operates home, business and public charging solutions in Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands, said the business now planned to enter new markets including Britain, France and Norway.\n“From now on we expect our charging network to double in size every year in order meet a sharp increase in electric vehicle growth,” it said.\nNorway has the largest electric car penetration globally, followed by the Netherlands and Sweden. The International Energy Agency sees the global stock growing to between 9 million and 20 million by 2020, from 2 million in 2016.
