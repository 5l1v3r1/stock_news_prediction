RBS also saw its mobile banking app usage grow by 21 percent from the same period last year.\nBut the positive news is likely to be overshadowed by its ongoing legal case and an impending fine from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over the bank’s selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. It reached a settlement with the New York Attorney General in March for $500 million.\nThe Edinburgh-headquartered bank came under fire earlier this year after announcing it would close 62 branches across Scotland, and was forced to partially renege on its plans and suspend 10 branch closures in response to public anger.
