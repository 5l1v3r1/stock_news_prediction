What we want to do is make sure that people that are setting up B2B social enterprises are looking at the areas of highest market opportunity,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. GOOD FOR BUSINESS \nJohnson & Johnson uses See Detail, a social enterprise that hires autistic staff, to test software. \nThere are 700,000 autistic adults in Britain and only 16 percent of them are in employment, according to the National Autistic Society charity. \nSee Detail’s operations manager Chris Mitchell likes aspects of his job that others might complain about - the routine and the predictability, which he said helps with anxiety. \nBefore he was diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome, a form of autism, in 1998, Mitchell suffered from depression and was self harming. \nHe said he struggled with job interviews, suffering repeated rejection, and saw a value to society in employing people who might otherwise put pressure on public services and their own families. \n“Their quality of life is improved by having a job, which helps with their life in the community,” he said. \nMark Hicken, UK managing director of Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical arm Janssen, said working with social enterprises helped attract ethical investors and staff. \n\"Where they have a set of personal standards that are important to them, they want to work in an environment... where they feel they can do good and where they are a part of a culture that chimes with who they are,\" he said.
