It eventually plans to develop seven mines in western Azerbaijan, including Gedabek, with estimated gold reserves of 430 tonnes in total.\nThe company started a significant exploration programme at the end of 2016 after making a new gold discovery at Ugur, 3 km (2 miles) from its Gedabek processing facilities.\nGold bullion sales in the first quarter of 2018 totalled 14,956 ounces at an average price of $1,328 per ounce, up from 8,283 ounces sold in January-March 2017 at an average of $1,220 per ounce.\nNet debt totalled $10.4 million by 31 March, down from $18.3 million at the end of 2017.\nGold is produced at Gedabek and other Azeri mines under a production venture in which Anglo Asian holds 51 percent and the state the remainder.
