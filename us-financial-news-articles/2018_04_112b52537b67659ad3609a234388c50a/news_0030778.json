The new credit facility broadly supports the expansion of Lightstone's hospitality portfolio.\n\"Western Alliance Bank continues to be a true partner as we grow our hospitality portfolio,\" said Lightstone President Mitchell Hochberg. \"Western Alliance has an in-depth understanding of the industry, and their financing has consistently allowed us to make strategic and nimble decisions and create greater value in our investments. We've long enjoyed working with our counterparts at Western Alliance Bank and look forward to continuing a successful partnership.\"\nToday's announcement builds on a long-standing 5-year relationship between Lightstone and Western Alliance Bank, which was recently named #2 on the Forbes 2018 \"Best Banks in America\" list.\nLightstone has worked with Western Alliance Bank to finance a number of hospitality investments, including most recently an $18 million loan for a select service hotel in New Orleans, La. and a $25 million loan for a select service hotel in Needham, Mass.

In addition to its bold, modern approach, Moxy Times Square's world class eating and drinking destinations, including NYC's largest all-season hotel rooftop bar, attract packed houses of tourists and New Yorkers alike.\nLightstone's portfolio includes partnerships with Marriott, Starwood, Hilton, IHG and Hyatt. The company's national hotel development portfolio includes the 349-key Moxy Chelsea hotel set to open in Fall 2018, two additional planned NYC-based Moxy hotels, and planned Moxy properties in South Beach, Miami, as well as downtown Los Angeles and West Hollywood.\nThe newly acquired Long Island City Hilton Garden Inn was purchased for $60 million. The 183-key hotel was constructed in 2015 and is located at 29-21 41st Ave, across from large office developments and within walking distance from the recently reinvigorated Queens Plaza and surrounding transit hubs. For the immediate future, Lightstone plans to continue operation of the hotel as a Hilton Garden Inn.\nAbout Lightstone:\nLightstone, founded by David Lichtenstein, is one of the largest and most diversified privately held real estate companies in the United States.
