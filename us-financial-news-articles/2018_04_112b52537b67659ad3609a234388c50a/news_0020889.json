Iran is a dangerous and serious enemy that should not be underestimated,” Zeev Elkin, a member of the security forum, said on Army Radio before it convened.\n“I won’t get into the operational details, but we are constantly in touch with the Americans. They are our strategic partner, and our defence establishment is in constant contact with them,” Elkin said.\nTRUMP WARNING In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia that missiles “will be coming” after Moscow, Assad’s most powerful ally, said any fired at Syria would be shot down and launch sites targeted.\nThe Syrian government and Russia say the reports of a poison gas assault on a rebel enclave in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday are bogus.\n“As for the question whether an American operation will draw a (Syrian) response against Israel: theoretically, it’s possible but I’m not sure this is the most likely scenario,” Elkin said. “It’s possible Iran will attempt a response against us.”\nYaakov Amidror, a former Israeli national security adviser, said Iran has “an open issue with us” over the air base strike.\nThe same facility was targeted by Israel in an air strike in Syria in February after an Iranian drone was shot down inside Israeli territory.\nAmidror told reporters a U.S. strike in Syria could be used by Iran as a smokescreen “to do something against Israel”.\n“They have their long arm of Hezbollah, which is controlled by the Iranians,” he said. “They have militias in Syria and in Lebanon which they control and they have Iranian military forces in Syria that can be used.”\nAmos Yadlin, a former Israeli military intelligence chief, wrote on Twitter that “the Iranians will probably respond to the strike attributed to Israel, even if not immediately”.\nTehran, he said, aimed to deter Israel from continuing to strike Iranian forces in Syria.\nBut in a shopping center in an Israeli settlement in the occupied Golan Heights near the Syrian frontier on Wednesday, it was business as usual.\n“Life goes on here, no matter what - in Israel in general and in the north in particular,” said Sheila Wolensky, a Jerusalem resident visiting family in the Golan. “We always feel like we’re on the edge of the sword.”\nAdditional reporting by Rami Amichay on the Golan Heights\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T17:45:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
