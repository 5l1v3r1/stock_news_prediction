The Senate could vote to confirm her as early as Thursday.\nThe Senate is expected soon to consider Slaughter along with veteran antitrust lawyer Joe Simons, a Republican who is expected to chair the commission.\nIt is also expected to confirm Republicans Christine Wilson, a senior vice president for regulatory and international affairs at Delta Air Lines Inc, and Noah Phillips, the chief counsel for Senator John Cornyn.\nJoining Slaughter on the Democratic side, the senate is expected to confirm Rohit Chopra, a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nThe president has been slow to fill the FTC posts, leaving the agency in the hands of two Obama holdovers for more than a year into his term.\nThe FTC works with the U.S. Justice Department to enforce antitrust law and investigates companies accused of deceptive advertising. One big merger before it currently is a deal to combine industrial gases companies Praxair Inc and Linde AG.\nThe FTC is also reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the FTC over its privacy practices following allegations that Cambridge Analytica may have improperly gained access to user data for 50 million people in 2014 without the FTC or users being notified.
