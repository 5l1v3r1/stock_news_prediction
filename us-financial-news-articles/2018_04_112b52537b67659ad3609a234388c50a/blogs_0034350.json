That is the date when Facebook launched \"Tag Suggestions,\" a feature that suggests people to tag after a Facebook user uploads a photo.\nIn the U.S. court system, certification of a class is typically a major hurdle that plaintiffs in proposed class actions need to overcome before reaching a possible settlement or trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:15:00.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
