(NYSE: BMI) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales were a record $105,041,000 for the first quarter of 2018, a 3.4% increase from sales of $101,606,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Net earnings were $7,546,000 for the first quarter of 2018, a 13.8% decrease from net earnings of $8,749,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.26 for the first quarter of 2018, a 13.3% decrease from diluted earnings per share of $0.30 for the first quarter of 2017.\nOperations Review\n“Our first quarter net sales were a record for any quarter, helped by increased BEACON ® Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) revenue and the recent D-Flow ® and Carolina Meter acquisitions,” said Richard A. Meeusen, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Badger Meter. In addition, this was another strong quarter for flow instrumentation product sales, despite the planned shutdown of our Scottsdale, Arizona location and transition of those operations to our Racine, Wisconsin facility,” added Meeusen.\nHowever, domestic municipal water meter sales were flat, caused in part by a delay in several expected orders due to poor weather conditions in a number of our key markets. We expect these delayed orders to be shipped in the second and third quarters. Continued growth in international sales helped offset the slow start in the domestic market, including a sizable municipal water order received from the Middle East. In addition, price increases on many products took effect at the beginning of the year and will be fully realized over the next several quarters.\nAs a result of the lower volumes’ impact on capacity utilization costs, higher brass expenses and the Scottsdale shutdown costs, gross profit margin was 35.0%, down from 38.0% in the first quarter of 2017. Selling, engineering and administration costs were up 6.7% compared to the prior year period, largely due to inclusion of expenses from the two acquisitions made after the first quarter of 2017. As anticipated, the company benefitted from a lower effective corporate tax rate.\n“Despite the lower first quarter results, we remain optimistic about 2018, especially given the strength of our E-Series ultrasonic water meters and the ORION Cellular endpoint radios, the positive sales momentum going into the second quarter and the residual benefits we expect to see from our price increases,” added Meeusen.\nConference Call and Webcast\nBadger Meter management will hold a conference call to discuss the company’s first quarter results on Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 10:00 AM Central/11:00 AM Eastern time.\nInterested parties can listen to the call live on the Internet through the company’s website: www.badgermeter.com or by dialing 1-844-281-9843 and entering the passcode 6482009.
