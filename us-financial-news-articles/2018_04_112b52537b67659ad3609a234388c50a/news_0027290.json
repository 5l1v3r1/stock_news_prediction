It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting the central government.\nIslamic State has created a branch in Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent years mostly by recruiting among established militants. Its followers have claimed some of Pakistan’s most deadly recent attacks.\nThis month four members of a Christian family were gunned down in Quetta a day after Easter, in what police officials called a “targeted attack”.\nIn December two suicide bombers stormed a packed church in southwestern Pakistan, killing at least 10 people and wounding up to 56. Islamic State claimed both attacks.\nRome’s ancient Colosseum was lit in red for an evening in February in solidarity with persecuted Christians, particularly Asia Bibi, a Catholic woman who has been living on death row in Pakistan since 2010, when she was condemned for allegedly making derogatory remarks about Islam.\nWriting by Saad Sayeed; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T21:40:25.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
