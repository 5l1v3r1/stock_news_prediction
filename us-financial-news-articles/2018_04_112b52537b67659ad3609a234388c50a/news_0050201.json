Conditions could change very quickly as a result of circumstances that businesses have no ability to control.\"\nThe ongoing dispute between so-called Remainers and Brexiteers about this relationship took another turn last week when a majority of the U.K.'s House of Lords — the upper house of parliament — voted that the U.K. should stay in a customs union with the EU, something the government under Prime Minister Theresa May has said would not happen.\nIf Britain stays in a customs union it must agree to apply the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU and cannot negotiate free trade deals with other nations, as the government currently hopes to do once the U.K. leaves the bloc.\nUncertainty over Brexit has prompted some British companies to stall on making investment decisions but EY ITEM Club's chief economist warned against delay, saying that \"the stable, if sluggish, base case forecast\" should not be taken as \"an excuse to sit and wait.\"\n\"U.K. businesses risk missing out on global growth and also risk failing to position for the future in the U.K. if they continue to wait for the clouds surrounding the economic outlook to clear,\" Gregory said. \"Technology, shifts in consumer behaviors, and demographics are all reshaping the economic landscape, and Brexit is another uncertainty. Failing to invest now risks making the future even more challenging.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T13:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:19:04.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
