It must be held throughout the life of the mining right,” the court said.\nThe mining ministry could not be reached for comment.\nIn June Moody’s said the new rules risked deterring investment, and would likely raise costs and diminish cashflow generation.\nThe new mining minister Gwede Mantashe has set a three month deadline to finalize the latest version of an industry charter which lays out requirements for black ownership levels and other targets.\nReporting by Tanisha Heiberg and Mfuneko Toyana; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:14:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
