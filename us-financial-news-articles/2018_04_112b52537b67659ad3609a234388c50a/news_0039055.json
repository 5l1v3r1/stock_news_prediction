After a tough 2017, Alfa’s share price has risen more than 6 percent so far this year.\nPetrochemicals unit Alpek, which in January announced a financing deal for troubled client M&G Polimeros Mexico, benefited from higher polyester prices. Packaged foods unit Sigma saw higher volumes in Mexico, Alfa said on Wednesday.\nThe company is hunting for a new Chief Financial Officer after Ramon Leal left the firm in March over a fine from country’s banking regulator for insider trading.\nAlfa expects to generate total revenue of $17.4 billion this year.\nReporting by Christine Murray; Editing by Anthony Esposito and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T00:27:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
