CXM is a predictive and proactive view of automotive, with a single platform that collects aggregate data, analyzes and predicts customer needs, and then communicates those needs to the customer on behalf of a dealership.\n\"Consumer expectations are moving faster than ever, and dealerships are forced to react to that moving target, which makes our goal as a partner to not only provide dealers with an immediate ROI, but to look into the future and make sure we are arming our dealers with the tools they need to have continued success going forward,\" Johnston said. \"I am incredibly excited to continue to play a role in that mission.\"\nJohnston previously held the position of Senior Director of Product Consulting and Sales. He joined AutoAlert in 2015 as Director of Product Consultants after holding management positions at Fuzecast and VinSolutions, a Cox Automotive company.
