Andrew Cuomo on Thursday celebrated his securing of funding from New York City for subway improvements by attacking Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n“We lost eight months before the plan could become fully operational, which was a terrible loss and waste of time,” Mr. Cuomo said at an event in lower Manhattan.\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the city’s subway, last summer launched the plan to fast-track repairs and maintenance, saying the state and city should equally fund the $836 million project. Mr. Cuomo controls the MTA, and he had agreed. But Mr. de Blasio refused to do it.\nEric Phillips, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said Thursday, “Eight months ago, New York City’s money would have gone into the same hole of mismanagement that caused the subway crisis.”\nThe state budget, which was completed last weekend, forced Mr. de Blasio to pay his share of the rescue plan by empowering the state to withhold funds bound for the city and direct them to the MTA. After the budget passed, Mr. de Blasio agreed to fund the plan.\nThe MTA launched the subway rescue plan amid mounting anger from riders following a string of rush-hour delays and equipment failures, including a derailment that injured dozens of riders.\nThe subway’s sputtering performance continues to be a weak spot for Mr. Cuomo. The actress Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging him in this year’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, has made it a key campaign issue.\nMTA Chairman Joe Lhota, who spoke after Mr. Cuomo at Thursday’s event organized by the nonprofit Association for a Better New York, said the rescue plan has been successful so far, leading to a 31% decrease in major subway disruptions since June. But he said that it hasn’t reached full fruition because of the lack of city funding.\nThe plan calls for the hiring of around 2,500 workers to boost repairs and maintenance of subway tracks, signals, stations and trains.\nAn MTA spokesman said that since the plan launched, the agency has hired 950 workers. Mr. Lhota said that if the city had funded the plan earlier, he could have hired up to 900 more.\nWith city funding, Mr. Lhota said the MTA can also double its rate of repair and maintenance work.\nHe also warned that the MTA will need substantial funds, in particular to upgrade subway signal systems, in its next five-year capital spending plan, which begins in 2020. He called on the city to contribute its “fair share.”\nIn addition to the subway, the MTA runs city buses and two commuter railroads and operates nine bridges and tunnels. The city pledged $2.5 billion toward the most recent capital plan. The state contributed $8.6 billion.\nMr. Phillips, the mayor’s spokesman, said, “Instead of constantly asking New Yorkers for more money, the state and MTA should learn to do their jobs within their budget and finally seek a sustainable revenue source so riders aren’t continually victimized by their blame game.”\nThe state budget included a surcharge on taxis and for-hire vehicles in the most congested parts of Manhattan, which is expected to raise more than $400 million annually for the MTA. It fell short of securing more than $1 billion annually that would have been raised if the state had enacted a plan to charge all vehicles entering Manhattan.\nWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:53:45.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
