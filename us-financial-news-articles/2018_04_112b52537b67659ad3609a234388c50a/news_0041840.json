There are signs we could be losing momentum.” \nFoley said Carney was correct to have cautioned the market but his comments raised questions about the BoE’s forward guidance in February when it had signalled a rate rise was coming soon, and this underlined that investors should see rate moves as contingent on economic data. \nThe pound fell 0.5 percent to a day's low of $1.4008 GBP=D3 , its lowest since April 6, as broad dollar strength kept the pound under pressure in late European trading. \nOn Thursday, sterling slid close to 1 percent and the British currency is now down 1.5 percent this week, barely holding on to gains for April, which is normally a strong month for the pound. \nAgainst the euro, however, sterling recovered on Friday as the single currency suffered losses across the board. The pound rose 0.2 percent to 87.52 pence per euro GBPEUR=D3. \nA seasonal rise in capital inflows into Britain from foreign companies paying UK shareholders dividends has boosted sterling during April in recent years. \nAnalysts said some speculative money had probably bet on that pattern repeating itself, and investors were now unwinding those positions, pushing the currency lower. FURTHER DOWNSIDE RISKS \nHedge funds have amassed a $3.8 billion long bet on sterling, the biggest long position in almost four years, according to positioning data GBPNETUSD=. \n“If market expectations continue to deteriorate over higher U.K. interest rates, sterling could be exposed to further downside risks,” said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM. \nMichael Saunders, a member of the BoE’s rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee who voted for a rate rise last month, said on Friday that rate increases should be gradual and not glacial. \nEconomists, almost all of whom had predicted the BoE would act in May before Carney’s Thursday interview, believe the central bank’s vote on rates next month will now be very close. \nProgress during the next round of negotiations between Britain and the European Union over their divorce will also influence the pound.
