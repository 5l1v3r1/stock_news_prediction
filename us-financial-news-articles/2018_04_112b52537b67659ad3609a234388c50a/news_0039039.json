Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nWomen fill out applications at a job fair in Florida in January. Associated Press Good morning. Big companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. have told recruiters not to ask about compensation job candidates received in previous roles, as more employers shift away from using past wages as a guide for setting their future pay, reports the Wall Street Journal’s Kelsey Gee .\nThe move stems from a slew of new laws around the U.S. aimed at closing wage gaps in the workforce. The theory behind them is that using past salaries to benchmark future pay can perpetuate unfairly high or low wages that workers carry from job to job.\nMassachusetts and New York City passed laws in 2016 banning employers in those places from pressing job seekers to disclose their salary history. More than a dozen cities and states have followed suit .\n“These new laws have created a great opportunity for employers to do some self-reflection,” said Cheryl Pinarchick, a partner at Fisher & Phillips LLP and co-chair of the law firm’s pay equity practice. Many are thinking about whether they can justify differences in the salaries that their current workers earn, she said.\nEvery week, Ms. Pinarchick’s firm gets new requests from employers who want help with audits of their pay practices, a volume that is up 10-fold from two years ago, she said.\nAn appeals court ruled last week that businesses may be held liable for discrepancies in their workers’ pay, even if the imbalance stems from a previous employer, adding further pressure to correct pay gaps based on gender, race or other nonperformance related factors.\n“We’ve seen a lot of clients adopting the spirit of law, understanding bans on salary-history inquiries are about pay equity,” said Mollie Mantia, director of compliance for the talent arm of Automatic Data Processing Inc., a payroll management firm.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nU.S places sanctions on Syrian group. The Trump administration accused a Syrian organization of attempting to smuggle migrants to the U.S. border, imposing sanctions on the group and its leader, Nasif Barakat.

Big Silicon Valley backers of cryptocurrencies have sought a broad exemption from federal oversight they say would slow digital-coin growth, the WSJ reports. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said virtual tokens issued by startups are investments that should be regulated as securities.\nCFPB chief warns against leaks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s acting director, Mick Mulvaney, warned staff not to leak information about the bureau’s enforcement work, targeting what he has called “ideologues and activists” inside the agency. In a memo last week, Mr. Mulvaney said he supports “appropriate disciplinary and other actions” against offenders, the WSJ reports.\nFox rejected higher Comcast bid due to antitrust fears. 21st Century Fox Inc. rejected an acquisition offer for its entertainment assets from cable giant Comcast Corp. largely over antitrust concerns, a regulatory filing said, even though the bid was 16% higher on a per-share basis than what Walt Disney Co. ultimately agreed to pay, the WSJ reports.\nGOVERNANCE\nWynn Resorts adds women to board. Wynn Resorts added three women to its board as it addresses the fallout from sexual-misconduct allegations against former Chief Executive Steve Wynn.

Ernst & Young said it is investigating, the WSJ reports.\nRISK\nChinese regulator is downbeat on NXP deal.

A Kremlin spokesman said temporary nationalization by the Russian government is one option for helping the aluminum producer Rusal as it struggles with U.S. sanctions, Reuters reports. It wasn’t clear what temporary nationalization would mean, or how it would help Rusal.\nEU to pitch a trade deal to Trump. The European Union is drawing up an offer it hopes will end trade hostilities with the U.S. and avoid steel and aluminum tariffs being imposed on the bloc in two weeks’ time. The key element is a simpler, smaller version of a trade deal that was negotiated but never concluded under the Obama administration, the WSJ reports.\nRisks from China tariffs are unbalanced. China is a significant source of materials for only a small fraction of products on President Donald Trump’s proposed list of tariffs, but they could disproportionately hit some U.S. manufacturers that depend on Chinese imports by driving up costs and forcing them to raise prices, the WSJ reports.\nOPERATIONS\nIRS struggles with old computer systems.

Neil White, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and Global Internal Audit Analytics leader at Deloitte & Touche LLP, discusses how internal audit can perform with greater assurance and confidence while gaining considerable efficiencies over time by making greater use of analytics. However, the function cannot make headway on its own.
