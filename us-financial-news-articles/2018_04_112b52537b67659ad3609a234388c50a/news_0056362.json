Bryant has been sidelined since being hit in the head by a pitch Sunday by German Marquez of the Colorado Rockies.\nBryant remains under evaluation by the club.\nVictor Caratini had two of Chicago’s seven hits. Braun and Domingo Santana each had two hits for the Brewers, who had six overall.\nBoth of Anderson’s losses have come against the Cubs, although he has allowed just three runs in 13 innings in the two outings.\nThe contest was scoreless with one out in the sixth inning when Schwarber, with the count 0-1, lined a down-and-in pitch over the wall in right field.\nMilwaukee pushed a runner into scoring position in the seventh when Santana singled with two out and stole second base. Hendricks retired Jonathan Villar on a grounder on his 94th and final pitch.\nRight-hander Carl Edwards Jr. tossed a flawless top of the eighth for Chicago.\nThe Cubs had two on with one out in the eighth inning against Milwaukee reliever Jacob Barnes, but Schwarber grounded into a double play.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T11:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:06:29.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
