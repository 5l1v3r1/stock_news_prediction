(TSX:WDO) (“Wesdome” or the “Company”) today announces its gold production results for the first quarter of 2018 (“Q1”).\nMr. Duncan Middlemiss, President and CEO commented, “2018 is off to a strong start, with total gold production and sales above our budget. Grade improvements continue at the Eagle River Underground Mine, with Q1 2018 head grade of 12.0 grams per tonne (“g/t”) compared to 11.3 g/t in the previous quarter and 11.5 g/t in Q1 2017. These improvements are largely a function of stopes in all zones, 8 Zone, 7 Zone, and 300 Zone contributing more tonnes at higher grades than anticipated, and strong ore development improving production flexibility. As illustrated in the below table, we are pushing forward with our strategy to increase the ratio of underground tonnes to open pit tonnes. The Eagle River underground exploration and definition program is progressing well, with three underground drills fully manned, thereby giving encouragement to the addition of underground workplaces which could fill the mill.”\nAmounts are denominated in Canadian dollars First Quarter\n2018 2017 Variance % +/(-) Ore milled (tonnes) Eagle River 44,480 38,578 5,902 15% Mishi 32,846 36,641 (3,795 ) (10%) 77,326 75,219 2,107 3% Head grade (grams per tonne, “g/t”) Eagle River 12.0 11.5 0.5 4% Mishi 1.8 1.7 0.1 6% Gold production (ounces) Eagle River 16,398 13,588 2,810 21% Mishi 1,550 1,574 (24 ) (2%) Total Gold Production 17,949 15,162 2,787 18% Production sold (ounces) 15,430 12,320 3,110 25% Revenue from gold sales ($ millions) $ 26.2 $ 20.1 $ 6.1 30% Average realized price per ounce 2 $ 1,698 $ 1,631 $ 67 4%\nNotes:\n1. Numbers may not add due to rounding.\n2. Average realized price per ounce is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by dividing the reported revenue from gold sales by the number of ounces sold for a given period.\n“Looking ahead into Q2 and beyond, our second stope development of the high grade 303 lens above the 844 metre level is commencing, putting this high grade area into production for the second half of 2018. Additionally, the exploration program at Eagle will add a surface drill to follow up on some prospective parallel zone targets. We are continuing our compilation of the 2017 exploration drilling data at Mishi, and expect to provide an update on this asset later in the year.”\nThe Company’s 2018 production guidance stands at 62,000 – 68,000 ounces of gold.\nTECHNICAL DISCLOSURE\nThe technical and scientific disclosure in this press release has been prepared and approved by Marc-Andre Pelletier, Chief Operating Officer of Wesdome and “Qualified Person” as defined by National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”)\nABOUT WESDOME\nWesdome Gold Mines has had over 30 years of continuous gold mining operations in Canada.
