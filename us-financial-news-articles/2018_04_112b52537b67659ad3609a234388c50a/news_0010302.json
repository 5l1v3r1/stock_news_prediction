Pensions have remained the top issue since the annual survey began in 2015.\nState government credit quality overtook declining investor trust in the municipal market as the third most important issue facing the municipal bond market this year as states grapple with balancing budgets amid rising fixed costs.\nOnly 3 percent of analysts in the survey believe state and local governments are “prepared” or “very prepared” for climate change.\nPNC Managing Director Tom Kozlik said he was not surprised that state credit quality started to become a more important issue this year. Across the country, state governments are struggling as spending on Medicaid and pensions consume an increasing percentage of budgets.\nTrump campaigned on a promise to boost infrastructure spending by $1 trillion, but a White House proposal released in February offers only $200 billion in federal funding and depends on private investors and state and local governments to make up the difference.
