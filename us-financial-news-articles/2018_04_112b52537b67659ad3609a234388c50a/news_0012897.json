The United States, however, denied it had launched any air strikes against the country.\nAlthough geopolitical risks are a concern, they are being offset by solid global economic growth, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\n“If economic conditions start to dim, that’s when the market might start reacting excessively to these types of things,” Okagawa said, referring to geopolitical tensions.\nEquities, however, have some resilience now given that U.S. corporate earnings have been solid recently, he added.\nU.S. equities will meet a major test in coming weeks as first-quarter earnings pour in, with expectations that tax cuts will help Corporate America show its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years.\nThe euro slipped 0.1 percent to $1.2272, but traded above a one-month low of $1.2215 set before last week’s U.S. jobs data.\nFriday’s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report showed an increase of just 103,000 jobs in March, the smallest gain since last September. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent, which pushed the annual wage growth rate higher.
