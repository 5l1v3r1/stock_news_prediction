Bush, and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, was lauded as an inspiration both to the country and her loved ones, a woman who leavened a strong sense of decency and honor with a self-deprecating wit she employed to great effect.\n“She was candid and comforting, steadfast and straightforward, honest and loving,” said the historian and author Jon Meacham, who wrote a biography of George H.W. Bush and was one of three eulogists whom Barbara Bush herself selected before her death.\n“Barbara Bush and George Bush put country above party, the common good above political gain and service to others above the settling of scores,” he said.\nFormer Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, current first lady Melania Trump, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former first lady Michelle Obama were all on hand for the service.\nPresident Donald Trump, who clashed with the Bush family during his 2016 campaign, did not travel to Houston. The White House said this week he wanted to avoid disrupting the service with added security.\nPallbearers escort the casket of former first lady Barbara Bush after funeral services at St. Martin's Episcopal Church in Houston, Texas, U.S., April 21, 2018. David J. Phillip/Pool via Reuters In a Twitter post, Trump said his “thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family.”\nFormer President Jimmy Carter was overseas and unable to attend.\nBarbara Bush’s longtime friend, Susan Baker, the wife of former Secretary of State James Baker, described her in a eulogy as a “tough but loving enforcer” whose 73-year marriage to her husband was a real-life fairy tale.\nSlideshow (19 Images) George H.W. Bush would write a letter to his wife on each wedding anniversary, Jeb Bush said, before reading aloud one such letter from 1994, a year after his father left the White House.\n“I was very happy on that day in 1945, but I‘m even happier today,” he read, as his 93-year-old father squeezed his eyes shut and wept. “You have given me joy that few men know ... I have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world, but even that cannot hold a candle to being Barbara’s husband.”\nHours before the service, guests arrived at a different church several miles away to be bussed to the venue, walking past a throng of media.\nBush made it possible for her husband to have “the arc of his life,” said Karl Rove, who served as a chief political adviser for George W. Bush.\nAs the service ended, Bush’s grandsons bore her casket out of the church, with George W. Bush pushing his father in a wheelchair directly behind it.\nBarbara Bush will be buried on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station, next to her daughter, Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of 3. The motorcade carrying her body will traverse both George Bush Drive and Barbara Bush Drive on its way to the burial site.\nMembers of the public paid their respects on Friday, when Bush lay in repose at the church. George H.W. Bush, seated in a wheelchair in front of the casket, greeted mourners in turn with a handshake.\nReporting by Erwin Seba in Houston; Writing and additional reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Diane Craft and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T08:32:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
