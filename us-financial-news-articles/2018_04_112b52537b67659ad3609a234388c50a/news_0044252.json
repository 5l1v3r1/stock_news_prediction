She added that the system to help the homeless is greatly overburdened. \nThree out of every four of the 55,000 homeless people in the Los Angeles metro area are in a similar situation, living in a car, abandoned buildings or on the street. In contrast, only one out of every 20 of the 76,000 homeless people in New York, the nation’s largest metro area, are unsheltered, the report said. \nTwo factors have played a role in the difference between New York and Los Angeles. First, up until recently, when the state’s homeless council was formed, California did not have a single entity that was dealing with homelessness. \nIn the New York metro area, where about 85 percent of the state’s homeless live, however, New York City’s Department of Homeless Services is a well established entity with 2,000 employees and a $1 billion budget, the report said. \nThe other factor is money. New York’s homeless agency budgeted $17,000 while Los Angeles budgeted $5,000 per homeless individual in 2017, the report said. \n“The right to shelter in New York City is legally mandated and plays a central role in shaping its response to homelessness,” the report said.
