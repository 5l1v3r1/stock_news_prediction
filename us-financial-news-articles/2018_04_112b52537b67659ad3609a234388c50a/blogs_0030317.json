What many seniors and their families don't realize, however, is that there are tax deductions they can take advantage of that would give them extra money to help with long-term care expenses.\nThere are also tax-advantaged ways they can exit out of a life insurance policy they don't need anymore, which could help them solve some of the financial challenges they face.\nMore from Fixed Income Strategies:\nOn a fixed income?

If you're diagnosed as \"chronically ill,\" some long-term care expenses can be tax-deductible. Those expenses, however, need to be more than 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. So, what constitutes chronically ill? You must be diagnosed and under a certified care plan issued by a doctor or nurse that addresses your inability to perform two or more activities of daily living. Or you need to be suffering from cognitive impairments. Family members may also be entitled to tax deductions if they are financially contributing to the costs of care for a loved one and qualify as a dependent. Long-term care insurance premiums.

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax reform, the first $5,490,000 of income was exempt from the estate tax. Now that has been nearly doubled to $10 million. That means policies currently in force to protect estates valued below the new level are no longer necessary. This presents a chance for the policy owner to sell the policy and recoup some or all of their premium payments under more advantageous tax conditions.

Knowing the tax rules and how they apply to your personal situation can make a huge difference.\nIt's complicated, that's why it makes sense to check with an accountant or financial professional who can provide more details about whether you're eligible to take advantage of any of these deductions or strategies.\n— By Chris Orestis, executive vice president of GWG Life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T16:22:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
