Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final First Leg - Sevilla vs Bayern Munich - Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, Seville, Spain - April 3, 2018 Bayern Munich's Juan Bernat in action with Sevilla's Pablo Sarabia REUTERS/Jon Nazca \nPablo Sarabia had put Sevilla ahead in the 32nd minute when he got the better of Juan Bernat to control Sergio Escudero’s cross and fire home at the back post. \nHowever, five minutes later Bayern levelled when Sevilla’s Jesus Navas agonisingly deflected Franck Ribery’s cross past home goalkeeper David Soria at the near post. \nWith Sevilla tiring, five-time European champions Bayern took advantage and Thiago headed the winner with the help of a deflection off Sergio Escudero in the 68th minute.

You can’t make any mistakes, you always have to be awake.” \nExperienced Bayen coach Jupp Heynckes said his team needed a slice of fortune to help turn the tide in their favour.
