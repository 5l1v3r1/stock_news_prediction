REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo In a separate statement, Amit Sinha, chief operating officer of Paytm Mall said the company would deploy the latest investment from SoftBank and Alibaba to beef up its technology and build superior logistics among other things.\nA filing with India’s Registrar of Companies showed SoftBank units will get a 21.1 percent stake in Paytm E-Commerce after the investment which would come in four tranches.\nAlibaba.Com Singapore E-Commerce Pvt. Ltd, which currently owns 36.3 percent of the Indian e-retailer, will remain the single-largest shareholder of Paytm E-Commerce but with a relatively smaller stake of just over 30 percent after its latest investment is completed in four tranches.\nPaytm E-Commerce competes with Amazon.com Inc’s Indian unit and home-grown Flipkart. A group company of Paytm’s parent One97 Communications Ltd runs India’s biggest digital wallet services and also has a stake in a payments bank.\nSoftBank's Vision Fund took roughly a here of Flipkart last year for $2.5 billion.\nThe Japanese group is also one of the biggest investors here in another Indian e-tailer Snapdeal.\nReporting by Sankalp Phartiyal and Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T21:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T21:44:51.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
