European brands built only 30 percent in North America. \nForeign automakers operate 17 assembly plants in the United States, 12 of which are owned by Asian manufacturers. Virtually all of those are non-union plants, many of them in southern states. \nImported vehicles accounted for about 21 percent of the 17.2 million sold last year in the U.S., according to Autodata. \nThe White House initiative was still in the planning stage, with officials at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency working to craft a legal justification for the policy, the paper said. It said there were hurdles to its implementation, including opposition from some in the administration. \nThe EPA and the Commerce Department, which the newspaper said was also involved in the effort, did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Neither did representatives for Ford Motor Co, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, or for the United Auto Workers union, which represents workers at those three automakers.
