That move could attract hundreds of billions of dollars from index-tracking funds into the vast but often ill-functioning market.\nThe benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has shed 5.4% since the start of this year, compared with a 1.5% fall by the S&P 500 index and a 2.4% gain for Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average is down 2.1% for 2018.\nAnd while the Shanghai market enjoyed its best day in two months on Tuesday, with a 2% rebound, the market is still down 12% from its most recent peak on Jan. 24. Since then, its underperformance relative to global peers has deepened.\n“Although China’s nominal economic growth has looked OK so far, it’s the uncertainties about the future that have clearly weakened investors’ risk appetite,” said Zhu Chaoping, a Shanghai-based economist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\nWhile China’s economy beat expectations by expanding 6.8% in the first quarter, there are signs growth is ebbing. Chinese factories were producing fewer goods for foreign markets even before the recent trade disputes with Washington began.\nChinese stocks were already trailing their global peers last year. The difference then was that the $5.2 trillion Shanghai market was recording gains: It rose 6.6% in 2017. Investors piled into big state-run firms that dominate the index, from steel and coal producers to rice wine makers, hoping they would benefit from Beijing’s efforts to cut industrial excesses and boost consumption.\nThat enthusiasm started to wane in late January. In one example, China Shenhua Energy Co. , the country’s biggest coal miner by output, has dropped 8.8% this year after soaring 67% last year.\n“The same story of supply-side reform and consumption has been told for too long, and investors are getting a bit tired of it. That’s why a lot of them decided to cash in on these blue chips earlier this year,” said J.P. Morgan’s Mr. Zhu.\nBeijing’s campaign to cut the financial risks associated with years of debt piling up has also depressed the market. Regulators have issued many rules in the past year to discourage banks and financial institutions from using risk-laden investment products to make leveraged bets in stocks and bonds.\n“The deleveraging campaign has hit investors’ confidence a lot because there’s simply much less fresh money entering the market,” said Shen Meng, director at Chanson & Co., a Beijing-based boutique investment bank.\nDaily trading volume in Shanghai has shrunk to below 200 billion yuan ($31.7 billion) in recent days, from above 300 billion yuan in mid-January and a record 1.3 trillion yuan just before the 2015 summer market rout.\nSaber rattling between the U.S. and China over higher tariffs has also damped sentiment, investors say. Foreign investors cut their holdings of Chinese stocks for a second consecutive month in March, to 1.20 trillion yuan, down from a record 1.28 trillion yuan in January.\nAnh Lu, a Hong Kong-based equities portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said she has cut her fund’s exposure to mainland listed companies to 7% from as high as 10% in late January, before the selloff.\n“It’s sort of like buying into a tsunami of bad news,” Ms. Lu said. “Right now, the market is selling anything that has an export part of the business.”\nSome stocks are already feeling the pain. Shanghai-listed shares of Hengtong Optic-Electric Co., a Suzhou-based optic cable producer, have lost 9% in the past two weeks, reflecting investors’ concerns that companies forming part of the supply chain in the telecom sector could be the main victims of U.S.-China tensions.\nOne reason Chinese stocks have underperformed their U.S. peers as trade disputes escalated is differences in how the two markets trade, said Caroline Yu Maurer, Hong Kong-based head of Greater China equities at BNP Paribas Asset Management.\n“In China, when markets go one way, they tend to go too much in that direction,” Ms. Maurer said. “When people sell, every investor seems to want to get out before the next one.”\nThe Shanghai market’s weak showing comes less than two months before index firm MSCI Inc. includes some mainland Chinese-listed stocks in its emerging-markets index for the first time.\nThe inclusion of 222 Chinese companies means global funds with $1.6 trillion in assets that track MSCI indexes will automatically allocate money into China, a market still dominated by China’s nearly 90 million retail investors.\nWrite to Shen Hong at hong.shen@wsj.com and Steven Russolillo at steven.russolillo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T04:22:56.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
