Raising the equivalent of around 500 million euros ($616.10 million) “would be perfect” Kreivi said though none of the details have been finalised. \n“It will be a major currency but we have not decided which one yet,” she added. \nThe tenor or the lifespan of the bond is likely to be somewhere between 5 or 10 years, “it depends on the currency,” she added. \n“In euros, 7 to 10 year demand is very healthy whereas in dollar it is exactly the opposite. The better demand is in the five year area.” \nWhat will be most important is what the money the bonds raise will be used for. \nThe EIB’s experts are still working on what exactly what will qualify as being ‘sustainable’ and a framework of new metrics and improvement indicators that will differentiate the bonds from financing that already exists. \n“It is not just a label,” Kreivi said. Given some examples she added: “If you take waste water treatment it can be the cubic meters of water purified or otherwise the number of people that get clean drinking water.” \nIn terms of where the money will be spent, it is clear the Luxembourg-based bank wants to focus on parts of the world where it will make the biggest difference. \nThe EIB operates mainly in the European Union but 10 percent of its money is spent in other parts of the world, from the Middle East and Africa to Latin America and Asia. \n“We are not going for geographical screening but an impact level screening.” \nReplicating the success of its green bonds creation will also be key. It issued 4.2 billion of them last year. \nKreivi is keen to see whether green bond enthusiasts also buy into the new ones and also sees the significance of her status as ‘the mother of the green bond’ in the new push. \n“I’m a bit old for all that (birth) business, but maybe in the bond market I can still have babies.” ($1 = 0.8116 euros) (Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T15:56:43.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
