It last held a regular session in 1996.\nPolitical analysts in Gaza said a PNC meeting without wide factional representation would weaken the legitimacy of any decisions it may take.\nAdditional reporting by Ali Sawafta in Ramallah; Editing by Jeffrey Heller in Jerusalem; editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T00:25:30.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
