McDowell will be responsible for driving all aspects of MintHealth’s technology vision and product development. As CTO, his primary focus will be advancing the overall direction and development of MintHealth platform. Technology architecture, software development, user experience design, and data analytics will fall under McDowell’s purview.\n“Tyson’s combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and an entrepreneurial approach make him a strong addition to our executive team. His previous work in optimizing processes within the US healthcare system and working with every stakeholder in the value chain will be invaluable to MintHealth,” said Dr. Samir Damani, CEO and co-founder of MintHealth. “As the technical evangelist for the company, Tyson will play a key role in shaping the company’s technology strategy as we embark on its next phase of developing the MintHealth platform.”\nMcDowell joins MintHealth from Lead Wingman, a venture studio he founded to incubate early stage tech companies that aim to partner humans with AI and machine learning.
