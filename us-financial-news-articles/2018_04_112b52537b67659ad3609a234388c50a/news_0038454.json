As he told his university newspaper, The Harvard Crimson , days after TheFacebook's launch, \"The nature of the site is that each user's experience improves if they can get their friends to join it.\"\nZuckerberg told CNBC, \"[Y]ou can browse around, and see who people's friends are, and check out people's online identities, and see how people portray themselves and just find some interesting information about people.\"\nLooking back, Zuckerberg's early attempt at defining what would become the world's largest social network seems quaint.\nIt is also interesting to hear Zuckerberg casually narrate the process of users freely entering personal information upon joining a site that would eventually leverage that same data to make billions of dollars each year from advertisers looking to reach Facebook users online (Facebook reported $39.9 billion in advertising revenue in 2017) and lead to the current Cambridge Analytica scandal.\nIn fact, in his 2004 interview with The Harvard Crimson, Zuckerberg was intent on assuring early users that their personal data was safe in Facebook's hands.\n\"There are pretty intensive privacy options,\" he said, referring to users' ability to limit who can view their profiles. \"People have very good control over who can see their information.\"\nDon't Miss:\nHere's what Mark Zuckerberg says he would do if Facebook hadn't worked out\nMark Zuckerberg on starting Facebook at 19: 'I've made almost every mistake you can imagine'\nEx Facebook board member: I knew 20-year-old Mark Zuckerberg.
