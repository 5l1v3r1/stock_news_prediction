He struck out nine without issuing a walk.\nThe Padres took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the second on a double by Hunter Renfroe and a two-run homer by Christian Villanueva.\nHowever, errors by the pair on the first two hitters in the top of the next inning opened the door for the Dodgers’ decisive rally against Padres spot starter Robbie Erlin.\nChris Taylor opened the third with a routine hopper to third baseman Villanueva, who misplayed it into a two-base error. Corey Seager followed with a line drive to right that sailed over the head of Renfroe for a three-base error that enabled Taylor to score with the tying run.\nEnrique Hernandez then singled home Seager to put the Dodgers ahead 3-2. Cody Bellinger then singled ahead of Kemp’s 399-foot drive into the stands in left center. The homer was Kemp’s second of the season.\nKemp also had a hand in the Dodgers’ first run. Bellinger drew a walk to open the second and moved to third on Kemp’s single, although Kemp was thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. Bellinger then scored on a double by Grandal, who finished the game with five RBIs. The grand slam was the third of Grandal’s career.\nErlin (0-2) allowed six runs (four earned) on six hits and two walks in three innings. He was starting in place of Luis Perdomo, who is serving a five-game suspension.\nVillanueva became the fifth rookie in Padres history to hit homers in three consecutive games with his 371-foot liner to left of Ryu in the second inning.\nTony Cingrani, Josh Fields and Scott Alexander each pitched an inning for the Dodgers to close out the win. Alexander gave up an RBI single to Franchy Cordero.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:05:03.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
