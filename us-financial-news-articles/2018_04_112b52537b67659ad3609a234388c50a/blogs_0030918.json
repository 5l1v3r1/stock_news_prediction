One of them was a faux landing, and it bounced, bounced, bounced and finally the last bounce right at the end of the runway.\"\nThe NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration are investigating the blown jet engine that set off a terrifying in-flight chain of events Tuesday. Debris from the engine shattered a passenger's window, and a businesswoman was nearly sucked out of the plane through the hole. She later died.\nThe plane, a Boeing 737-700, was carrying 149 people on a flight from New York's La Guardia Airport to Dallas when it made an emergency landing in Philadelphia.\nThe pilot landing the damaged plane was Tammie Jo Shults, one the first female fighter pilots in the U.S. military, according to The Associated Press. She is being praised for her calming presence while trying to land the plane and for her \" nerves of steel .\"\nA preliminary examination of the engine showed evidence of \"metal fatigue,\" according to the NTSB. Southwest said that it is accelerating its inspections of the engine type that was involved in the accident and that they will likely be completed within 30 days. The tragedy was the airline's first on-board passenger fatality due to an accident in its history, and the first fatal U.S. commercial plane accident since 2009.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
