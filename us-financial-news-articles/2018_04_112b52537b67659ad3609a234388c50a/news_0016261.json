REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Speaking on France Info radio, Coeure said that the economy was not seeing a slowdown, but rather a largely anticipated correction after reaching multi-year highs.\n“This correction does not lead us today to revise our forecasts, I can’t speak for the future but we are going to keep following this,” he said.\nCoeure added that though future monetary policy would depend on economic indicators, policy was on a long-term path and would remain highly accommodative for a long time.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; editing by Michel Rose\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:48:01.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
