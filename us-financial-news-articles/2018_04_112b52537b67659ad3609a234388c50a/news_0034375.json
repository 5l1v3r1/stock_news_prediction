Canadian long-term interest rates were down six basis points in February in the first decline in three months, the statistics agency said.\nInvestors bought C$2.87 billion in Canadian equities, the largest purchase in five months as foreigners scooped up shares in the finance and insurance sector.\nCanadian investment in foreign securities also slowed to a net C$6.35 billion after two months of strong investment. Purchases of foreign stocks cooled to C$4.7 billion, while bond purchases moderated to C$1.58 billion.
