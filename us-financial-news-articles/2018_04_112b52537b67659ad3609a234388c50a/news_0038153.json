WFC, -0.01% , Citigroup Inc. C, -0.37% and Bank of America Corp. BAC, +0.28% —increased in the first quarter because of the lower corporate rates under the tax-overhaul law enacted in December, according to an analysis of the banks’ results by The Wall Street Journal. \nThat amount is only a modest-size chunk of the banks’ total first-quarter earnings—less than 10% of their combined net income applicable to common shareholders. But it comprises a major chunk of their year-over-year earnings growth. \nWithout the tax savings resulting from the new lower corporate tax rate, Wells Fargo’s earnings would have declined from a year ago instead of increasing, and much of the year-over-year growth at Citigroup and Bank of America would be gone. At JPMorgan, losing the tax bump would have cut its earnings growth to 28% from 35%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T21:45:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
