REUTERS/Hannah McKay \n“No decision as yet, the cabinet is meeting in full at 1530 (BST) to discuss,” he said, speaking at a Wall Street Journal event in London. \n“The situation in Syria is horrific, the use of chemical weapons is something the world has to prevent,” he said. “But also it’s a very, very delicate circumstance and we’ve got to make this judgement on a very careful, very deliberate, very well thought-through basis.” \nDavis, who in 2013 voted against taking military action against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, said that his decision then was based on a lack of clear evidence and a lack of a clear plan. \n“Those two things, I’m assured, we will get an answer to today,” he said.
