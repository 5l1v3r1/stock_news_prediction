The broker dealer and Alternative Trading System (“ATS”) will now operate as Templum Markets, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Templum. In February, Templum announced that it had entered into a purchase agreement with Liquid M Capital. The transaction was subject to regulatory approval of the change of control.\nChris Pallotta, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Templum, said, “We are excited to announce that we have obtained the required regulatory approval for Templum to purchase Liquid M Capital and for Templum Markets to commence operations as a broker-dealer and Alternative Trading System.”\n“All ATS’s are not created equal,” said Vince Molinari, Chief Executive Officer of Templum Markets. “Templum has acquired an ATS that can facilitate transactions in a variety of unregistered and private securities. The vast majority of ATSs have regulatory approvals to facilitate transactions in public securities and are incapable of facilitating trades in unregistered securities.”\nTemplum Markets’ ATS has been operating for two years and is designed to facilitate secondary liquidity, with full price display, depth of markets and an audit trail for transactions under Rule 506 of Regulation D, Regulation A, and Regulation S. Additionally, Templum Markets has obtained a private letter ruling that recognizes the platform as a Qualified Matching Service (QMS) that may facilitate transactions in partnership interests without negatively impacting the tax treatment of partnerships.\nFor those interested in learning about Security Tokens, Capital Raising and Secondary Trading please visit www.tradetemplum.com .\nAbout Templum\nTemplum is an innovative technology company focused on the development of trading system and platforms to facilitate the lawful sales of digital assets and the secondary trading of digital assets offered as securities.
