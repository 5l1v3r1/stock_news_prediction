The source, who requested anonymity because the matter is not yet public, did not know the reasons for the change. \nThe change of command comes in the middle of a privatization process at the state-run utility. It also comes amid changes in Sao Pauloâ€™s state government. \nEarlier in April, then-Governor Geraldo Alckmin resigned in order to run for president. \nCesp and the government of Sao Paulo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
