Another 16 items will be banned by the end of 2019, it said.\nChina’s crackdown on waste imports, which stood at as much as 47 million tonnes in 2015, is part of its “war on pollution” and designed to help the country upgrade its economy and move up the global supply chain.\nReporting by David Stanway and Muyu Xu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:59:16.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
