It highlighted GIC’s participation in an $818 million round for Chinese car sales platform Chehaoduo, and a $535 million round for U.S. restaurant delivery platform DoorDash.\nGIC was also involved in the third-largest deal alongside Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and other investors. They agreed to pay $5.4 billion for 55 percent of French group AccorHotel’s AccorInvest property business.\nBoth Salvi and Capape expect PIF to become more active and enter new sectors following the creation of the $93 billion Vision Fund with Softbank, which focuses on tech.\n“And whenever they enter a new sector they come like an elephant, providing record capital commitments,” said Capape.\nSoftbank and Saudi Arabia have already agreed to create the world’s biggest solar power project in Saudi.\n“There is a long-term vision for how the economy should shape up, and part of it is a more active role played by PIF ... to help reduce the dependency on oil revenues,” said Salvi.\nOther Middle Eastern funds Mubadala and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority were also active. Mubadala Petroleum, wholly-owned by Mubadala, struck a $934 million deal with Eni ( ENI.MI ) for a 10 percent stake in Egypt’s Zohr gas field.\nFollowing a merger last year with the International Petroleum Investment Co. (IPIC), Mubadala is now joining with Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) for a combined portfolio worth over $200 billion.\nThis is expected to improve Mubadala’s global clout and allow it to enter more large-scale deals.\nReporting by Claire Milhench; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T17:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T18:15:20.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
