According to Gordon, $25 had previously been a level of resistance for the shares before they broke through earlier this year. Since then, Twitter has pulled back but bounced up again from that $25 mark, which leads Gordon to believe that the recent rally from resistance is a bullish sign for the stock.\n\nAnd with implied volatility, or the price of options, so high heading into earnings, Gordon believes now is the time to sell a put spread on Twitter.\nAs a result, he's selling the April 27 weekly 30-strike puts and pairing that with the purchase of the April 27 weekly 25-strike puts, which nets him a credit of $1.36. In other words, should Twitter close above $30 on April 27 expiration, Gordon would make the $136 credit on the trade.\nBut if Twitter closed below $25 on April 27 expiration, then Gordon could lose up to $364. However, given that Twitter is already trading above $30 ahead of earnings, Gordon isn't concerned about his chances.\n\"Remember, as you sell a put spread below the market, with high implied volatility our probability of success is better than 50 percent,\" he said.\nTwitter was trading around $31.60 on Tuesday, and is up more than 32 percent year to date.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
