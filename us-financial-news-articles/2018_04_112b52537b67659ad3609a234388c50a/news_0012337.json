Target did not admit wrongdoing.\nJenna Reck, a Target spokeswoman, said the retailer no longer asks for criminal histories in job applications, but still considers convictions “important” and gathers criminal background information late in the hiring process.\n“We have a number of measures in place to ensure we’re fair and equitable in our hiring,” while “maintaining a safe and secure working and shopping environment for team members and guests,” she said.\nThe plaintiffs included Carnella Times and Erving Smith, who are black and claimed they were denied stocker jobs after background checks uncovered past convictions, and The Fortune Society, which helps former prisoners reenter society.\nThey were represented by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and the law firm Outten & Golden.
