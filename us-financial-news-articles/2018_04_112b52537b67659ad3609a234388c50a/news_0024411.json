In road cycling typically the peleton will slow if the leader has suffered mechanical difficulties. \n“There is good sportsmanship and there’s not, and I feel like that wasn’t there today,” Gaze said of Cooper’s decision to ride away. “It’s a bit of a shame really, I’ve got the utmost respect for the guy, still, even with that move. \n“That’s racing, you can’t get along with everyone.” \nCooper said that he initially had no idea why Gaze had temporarily stopped. \n“I saw him pull into the tech zone so I was aware that something had happened but I had no idea what,” he told Radio New Zealand. \n“I thought it was odd because we followed him down the last downhill and through the start-finish area and his tire looked fine. \n“I heard he had a flat or something but I thought I’m not going to sit around and ask questions why. \n“If you have a puncture in a mountain bike race it’s a personal error. That’s the part of mountain bike racing, it’s not road racing. We get back on and just crack on.” \nGaze later issued an apology for his comments and said he realised they had taken the gloss off the second 1-2 finish for the duo at the Commonwealth Games. \n“I have caught up with Anton and apologised personally,” Gaze said in a statement later. “I acted in the heat of the moment... and want to apologise for my words and my actions. \n“I am really embarrassed for how I acted and how the impact of how special of a day it was for New Zealand Cycling was tainted by my actions.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:28:25.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
