(OTC PINK: IVST). Innovest Global, Inc. is a diversified holding company that focuses on acquiring niche, high-growth businesses that are capable of generating significant annual revenue. The company’s planned subsidiaries operate across telehealth, biotech, commercial energy, business-to-business distribution, national call center and auto sales.\nThe report provides an overview of Innovest Global, Inc., its subsidiaries, financials, industry analysis and more. The content also covers the global outlook for the brain tumor and LED lighting markets.\nGrand View Research: Brain Tumor Diagnostics and Therapeutics Market Forecast to Reach $773.10 Million By 2025\nInnovest Global’s primary operating divisions are across commercial/industrial energy and biotech & health sciences. Both divisions have deep roots in high-growth markets with long term potential.\nThe brain tumor diagnostics and therapeutics market is estimated to be worth $773.10 million by 2025, according to Grand View Research . The market research firm sees the massive growth due to the “increasing incidence of various brain cancers, particularly glioblastoma.”\nAccording to Renub Research , the global LED lighting market is estimated to be worth $100 billion by the end of 2024. The market research firm sees the vast global growth primarily stemming from exponential global urbanization and greater awareness to energy efficiency systems.\nHealth and energy are two key areas of the market that will consistently see demand and growth over the long-term. Civilizations require adequate health care and energy capabilities, which are also constantly being updated and innovated. The long-term suggests strength for the brain tumor treatment and LED lighting markets, which will be highly beneficial for Innovest Global.\nInnovest Sees Q1 Revenue Beating Estimates, 50 Million Common Shares Cancelled\nOn April 16th, Innovest Global released their first quarter 2018 earnings report. The company reported total revenues greater than $708,000, gross profit of just under $330,000, and cash on hand greater than $600,000. Furthermore, the company reported total current assets of $932,096 and total current liabilities of $352,165, giving Innovest Global a strong quick ratio of 2.60, which is four times stronger than the conglomerate industry average of 0.60.\nManagement announced it has also cancelled 50 million common shares, which provides the company with the updated share structure , as of March 31st:\n- Authorized Shares: 500 Million\n- Outstanding Shares: 96.52 Million\n- Shares in Float: 11.80 Million\n“The response we are getting from business and technology owners that want to get to the next level is very encouraging,” said Innovest CEO, Dan Martin. “We are incrementally increasing the size of the organizations we are looking to acquire and seeing great progress.”\nEntering into the second quarter, Innovest Global is now generating baseline quarterly revenues of around $800,000, just from its Commercial & Industrial Energy division alone. This comes as management is scheduled to officially launch its Biotech & Health Sciences division this Spring.\nInnovest Global recently announced that it has signed a Letter of Intent to acquire a 20% stake in StemVax Therapeutics, a biotechnology company that is currently developing a brain cancer vaccine.\nThe StemVax Glioblast (SVX-GB) cancer vaccine is being designed and formulated to help restore a patient’s immune system in order to fight off existing cancer cells within the body. The vaccine is designed to fight against glioblastoma brain cancers, which is the same type of tumor that is currently affecting Arizona Senator John McCain.\nInnovest Global, Inc. was also featured on an episode of Spotlight Growth Live , a video web series that focuses on emerging growth companies.\nFor more information on Innovest Global, Inc.,\nPlease visit: http://innovestglobal.com and http://spotlightgrowth.com/index.php/2018/04/19/innovest-global-inc-otc-pink-ivst-a-high-growth-cong...\nSpotlightGrowth.com is a digital hub for micro-caps, small-caps, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and other emerging growth investors.
