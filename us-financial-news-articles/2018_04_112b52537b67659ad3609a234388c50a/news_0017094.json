Investors have also been concerned after a central bank audit last year unearthed 56.33 billion rupees more in bad loans than what the bank had originally reported for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. \nMost Indian banks have seen their bad loans surge over the past three years, leading to higher scrutiny and a crackdown by the regulators. Several other bigger lenders have also reported additional bad loans after central bank audit. \nIn Axis’s case, several run-ins with regulators in the recent past have added to the woes. \n“The market is expecting probably the worst is going to be over for Axis Bank,” said R.K. Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management. \nThe CEO change also presented the “best opportunity” for forging a combination with Axis’s smaller rival Kotak Mahindra Bank which last year was speculated to be eyeing Axis for a takeover, analysts at Nomura wrote in a note, adding they expected “limited pushback” from Axis for a merger this time. \nAxis had last year dismissed reports of a deal calling them baseless speculation. \nKotak Securities said it expected the bank to move further towards de-risking the business by increasing the share of deposits and loans to retail customers and better-rated companies. \nIt upgraded the stock to “add”, retaining a target price of 600 rupees, citing current valuations after recent underperformance. \nBy 0644 GMT, Axis Bank shares were trading 4.4 percent higher at 542 rupees, outperforming the banking sector index that gained 0.5 percent and the main Mumbai market index that was up 0.2 percent. \nThe stock is still down about 4 percent so far this year.
