He heads the Libyan National Army (LNA), a force aligned with a government based in the east which has opposed a rival, internationally backed government in the capital, Tripoli.\nThe French source declined to comment on Haftarâ€™s condition.\nConflicting reports about his health sparked a flurry of rumors and speculation in Libya, where the United Nations is leading efforts to reunify the country and prepare for elections by the end of the year.\nA Libyan source close to Haftar who asked not to be named said Haftar was expected to return to Libya over the weekend. Other Libyan sources had said that Haftar was flown to Jordan and then France earlier this week.\nReporting by John Irish; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:55:00.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
