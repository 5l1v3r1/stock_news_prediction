Mandatory Credit: Joshua S. Kelly-USA TODAY Sports DeChambeau shot seven-under 64 to surge ahead of Englishman Ian Poulter (64) and South Korean Kim Si-woo (65).\nAfter an eagle, two bogeys and three birdies on the front nine, DeChambeau stroked birdies at the 13th, 15th, 16th and 17th holes to take the lead from Poulter and Kim.\nHe then saved par on the par-four last despite his second shot landing in a greenside bunker to end the day at 10-under 132.\nOvernight leader Rory Sabbatini (70) of South Africa, former FedExCup champion Brandt Snedeker (64) and fellow Americans Chesson Hadley (68) and Luke List (64) were tied for fourth at eight-under 134 at Harbour Town on Hilton Head Island\nWorld number 21 Matt Kuchar (70) was making a run at the leaders when a double bogey at the 17th sent him in a tailspin that left him tied for 13th at 136.\nPoulter, whose Houston win earlier this month earned him a berth in last week’s U.S. Masters, where he shared 44th place, went out with the early starters and made seven birdies in a bogey-free trip around the course.\nThe world number 31, playing in his sixth PGA Tour event in as many weeks, said he is feeling more upbeat than he was a year ago when he entered the final round at Harbour Town three shots off the lead before a 73 left him in a share of 11th place.\n“Confidence is definitely there from a perspective of feeling like I can be more aggressive right now,” said Poulter.\n“The (Houston) win helps a lot. I can free myself up in my mind. I can start attacking pins and just play free golf. And when you’re in that position, sometimes the game feels easy when sometimes it isn’t.”\nKim began his round on the back nine and after a birdie at his fourth hole got tripped up with a triple-bogey at the par-three 14th after he sent his tee shot into a greenside bunker.\nBut the two-times PGA Tour winner responded immediately with three consecutive birdies and added another five on his final nine holes, including at the last.\nWorld number one Dustin Johnson, fresh off a 10th-place finish at the Masters on Sunday, was six shots off the pace after mixing three birdies with a bogey for a two-under 69 and 138 total.\nReporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto and Gene Cherry in Raleigh, North Carolina; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T02:47:18.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
