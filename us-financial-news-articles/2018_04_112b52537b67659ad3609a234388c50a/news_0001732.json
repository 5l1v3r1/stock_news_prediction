Greece has agreed with its lenders to wrap up the process by June but Xenofos said that “the most realistic scenario is around the end of the year.” \n“All this effort must be intensified on the investors’ side, the involved parties and ministries and us ... so that we can manage and complete all these issues which are an operational nightmare,” he said. \nA 17 percent stake in power utility Public Power Corp. (PPC) and minority stakes in Athens and Thessaloniki water utilities EYDAP and ΕΥΑΤΗ <TWSr.ΑΤ> will be tendered in the second half of the year, he said.
