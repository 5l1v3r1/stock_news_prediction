A man watches a screen in downtown Toronto after the TMX Group, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, said it was shutting down all markets for the rest of the day after experiencing issues with trading on all its exchange platforms in Toronto, Ontario, Canada April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Helgren\n“We have identified the issue and are working to rectify,” the TMX Group ( X.TO ) said in a statement. “Due to the timing and nature of the issue, TMX has decided to shut down trading on all markets for the remainder of the day.
