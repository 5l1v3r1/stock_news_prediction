Consumer packaged-goods companies say higher transportation costs are weighing on their earnings as they scramble to get goods to stores and distribution centers, and some see their concerns persisting through the rest of the yea r. WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes that freight costs were up 20% year-over-year at Coca-Cola Co.’s North American division in the first quarter, as unusually strong demand from manufacturers and retailers outstripped the supply of available trucks. That’s making it harder and more expensive for companies like Hasbro Inc. HAS -1.64% and Nestlé SA NSRGY 1.18% to keep toys, household chemicals and other products moving. The rising costs to start the year come as analysts forecast contract rates for truck transportation could grow nearly 10% this year, costs companies will eventually pass on to consumers.\nThe last-mile for delivery of online purchases may not have to end at the home . Amazon.com Inc. is starting to bring packages right to the car, using a deal with General Motors Co. and Volvo Cars to give its couriers access to potentially millions of vehicles in 37 U.S. markets. The WSJ’s Laura Stevens and Mike Colias report the program expands Amazon’s bid to get consumers comfortable with different kinds of delivery services , including having couriers bring packages into homes. There have been ongoing efforts to make e-commerce fulfillment more mobile, including another in-car test Amazon worked on in Germany with Deutsche Post AG’s DHL and Audi. It’s unclear whether there will be widespread demand for in-car delivery. But the program fits with Amazon’s broader effort to blend its logistics services with its growing lineup of virtual-assistant devices.\nAmerican suppliers to ZTE Corp. are bracing for big revenue losses from the U.S. moves against the Chinese telecommunications giant. Big tech firms like semiconductor behemoth Qualcomm Inc. and niche companies such as Acacia Communications Inc., a Massachusetts-based maker of fiber-optic networking components, are among U.S. companies affected as national-security and trade issues flare up between the U.S. and China. The WSJ’s Jay Green reports that U.S. chip makers sold about $1.5 billion worth of products last year to ZTE, an example of the extensive supply chains that are a foundation of electronics manufacturing. U.S. companies including GSI Technology Inc. and Skyworks Solutions Inc. have heavy exposure, along with tech mainstays like Cisco Systems Inc. Acacia notes ZTE accounted for 30% of its revenue last year, providing a lesson on the hazards of heavy reliance on big customers.\nECONOMY & TRADE Photo: Bloomberg News Some big U.S. manufacturers may be casting a shadow over the recovery in the industrial sector. Caterpillar Inc. executives say a strong first quarter could be a “high-water mark” for the year, and 3M Co. says rising costs for transportation and raw materials are raising concerns at the company. The WSJ’s Andrew Tangel reports that both companies plan to raise prices to offset the hit to profits from higher expenses, a sign of the growing pressures across the economy as rapidly growing demand adds strains to some supply chains. Caterpillar’s outlook comes after the construction and farming equipment manufacturer saw a 31% surge in first-quarter sales, as dealers across North America boosted inventories to meet growing demand for construction equipment. The manufacturer says its sales outlook remains bright, but the company doesn’t expect its cost increases to slow down either.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Like other CPG companies, we face significant freight headwinds in North America this year. ’\n—Kathy Waller, chief financial officer at Coca-Cola Co.\nNumber of the Day 1.1% Decline from February to March in the American Trucking Associations’ truck tonnage index.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. consumer confidence rose this month after dipping earlier this spring .
