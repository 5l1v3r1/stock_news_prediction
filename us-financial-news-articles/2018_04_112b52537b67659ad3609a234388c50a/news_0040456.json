Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland had the fewest successful asylum cases in 2017 on a per capita basis.\nSyrians and Eritreans were most likely to get asylum in the EU in 2017, with more than nine in 10 cases being approved, while migrants from Albania and Kosovo were the least likely.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T12:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:11:33.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
