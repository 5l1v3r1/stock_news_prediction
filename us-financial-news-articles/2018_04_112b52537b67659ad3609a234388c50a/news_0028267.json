It could have a role in budget surveillance of the member states and could play a coordinating role in the orderly restructuring of sovereign debt.\nIn a potential race for Draghi’s job, Weidmann is likely to face criticism that he often sides with the minority on the rate-setting Governing Council, having opposed key stimulus measures that kick-started European growth.\nReporting by Balazs Koranyi; Additional reporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:52:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
