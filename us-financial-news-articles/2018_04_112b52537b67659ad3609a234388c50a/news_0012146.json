Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 537,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.1 million barrels drop.\nOil has also received support from a turnaround in the U.S. stock market and a Reuters survey showing OPEC oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output.\nShanghai September crude futures were untraded due to a public holiday in China, after falling 0.8 percent on Wednesday. Shanghai trading will resume on Monday.
