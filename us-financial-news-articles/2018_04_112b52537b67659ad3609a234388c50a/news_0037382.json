For the first half of the fiscal year, CAD bookings grew double-digits, far outpacing market growth, PLM bookings grew at market, ThingWorx continued to set the standard for Industrial Innovation Platforms, and interest in our augmented reality (AR) solutions accelerated.”\nAdditional second quarter operating and financial highlights are set forth below. Information about our bookings and other reporting measures is provided beginning on page four. For additional details, please refer to the prepared remarks and financial data tables that have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.ptc.com .\nQ2’18 license and subscription bookings were $99 million, up 4% year over year, despite one large Q2 forecasted deal that did not close until the beginning of Q3. On a year-to-date basis, bookings were $203 million, up 10% year over year, and the subscription mix was 72%. Q2’18 GAAP software revenue was $262 million and non-GAAP software revenue was $263 million, an increase of 12% year over year in each case, despite a 700 basis point increase in the subscription mix compared to the same period last year. Approximately 91% of second quarter software revenue came from recurring revenue streams, up from 88% in the same period last year. Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $961 million, an increase of 15% year over year and the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Total deferred revenue – billed and unbilled - increased $382 million or 43% year-over-year and increased $94 million or 8% sequentially to $1.26 billion. Billed deferred revenue increased 1% year-over year and 15% sequentially, to $498 million. Billed deferred revenue can fluctuate quarterly based upon the contractual billings dates in our recurring revenue contracts, as well as the timing of our fiscal reporting periods. Q2’18 ended on March 31st this year, as opposed to April 1st for Q2’17. Recurring revenue billings on April 1, 2018 were approximately $79 million, so had Q2’18 ended on April 1, billed deferred revenue would have grown approximately 17% year over year. GAAP professional services gross margin in the second quarter was 17% compared to 14% in the same period last year; non-GAAP professional services gross margin was 21% compared to 18% in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was 7%, compared to 3% in the same period last year; non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, compared to 16% in the same period last year. Operating cash flows in the second quarter were $111 million compared to $76 million in the same period last year and free cash flow was $106 million compared to $69 million in the same period last year, an increase of 54%; second quarter operating cash flows and free cash flow include cash payments of approximately $1 million related to our October 2015 restructuring plan, compared to $13 million in the same period last year. Total cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of the end of the second quarter were $355 million and total debt, net of deferred issuance costs, was $643 million. During the quarter, we repaid approximately $100 million of debt. As part of our previously announced share repurchase program, we plan to enter into a $100 million accelerated stock repurchase agreement on April 20, 2018, and expect that the repurchase will be completed by the end of our fiscal Q3 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Business Outlook\nFor the third quarter and fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, the company expects:\nIn millions except per share amounts Operating Measures (1) Q3’18\nLow\nQ3’18\nHigh\nFY’18\nLow\nFY’18\nHigh\nSubscription ACV $ 44 $ 48 $ 182 $ 190 License and Subscription Bookings $ 105 $ 115 $ 455 $ 475 Subscription % of Bookings 83% 83% 80% 80% (1) An explanation of the metrics included in this table is provided below.\nFinancial Measures Q3’18\nLow\nQ3’18\nHigh\nFY’18\nLow\nFY’18\nHigh\nSubscription Revenue $ 128 $ 130 $ 475 $ 480 Support Revenue 120 120 507 507 Perpetual License Revenue 17 20 92 97 Total Software Revenue 265 270 1,074 1,084 Professional Services Revenue 45 45 176 176 Total Revenue $ 310 $ 315 $ 1,250 $ 1,260 Operating Expense (GAAP) $ 208 $ 211 $ 824 $ 834 Operating Expense (Non-GAAP) 184 187 729 739 Operating Margin (GAAP) 5% 7% 7% 7% Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) 16% 17% 17% 18% Tax Rate (GAAP) 15% 15% 5% 5% Tax Rate (Non-GAAP) 11% 9% 11% 9% Shares Outstanding (GAAP) 118 118 118 118 Shares Outstanding (Non-GAAP) 118 118 118 118 EPS (GAAP) $ 0.04 $ 0.07 $ 0.31 $ 0.38 EPS (Non-GAAP) $ 0.30 $ 0.34 $ 1.31 $ 1.41 Free Cash Flow $ 210 $ 220 Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 214 $ 224 The third quarter and fiscal 2018 non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS guidance exclude the estimated items outlined in the table below, as well as any tax effects and discrete tax items (which are not known nor reflected).\nIn millions\nQ3’18\nFY’18\nEffect of acquisition accounting on fair value of acquired deferred revenue $ 0 $ 1 Restructuring charges - (1) Headquarters relocation charges (1) 2 5 Intangible asset amortization expense 15 58 Stock-based compensation expense 17 71 Total Estimated Pre-Tax GAAP adjustments $ 34 $ 134 (1) Represents accelerated depreciation expense recorded in anticipation of exiting our current headquarters facility. In 2019, we will be moving into a new worldwide headquarters in the Boston Seaport District and we will be vacating our current headquarters space. Because our current headquarters lease will not expire until November 2022, we are seeking to sublease that space. If we are unable to sublease our current headquarters space for an amount at least equal to our rent obligations under the current headquarters lease, we will bear overlapping rent obligations for those premises and will be required to record a charge related to any rent shortfall. A charge for such shortfall will be recorded in the earlier of the period that we cease using the space (which will likely occur in the second quarter of our fiscal 2019) or the period we exit the lease contract. Additionally, we will incur other costs associated with the move which will be recorded as incurred.\nPTC’s Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Results Conference Call, Prepared Remarks and Data Tables\nPrepared remarks and financial data tables have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website at ptc.com .

The archived webcast will also be available on PTC’s Investor Relations website .\nBookings Metrics\nWe offer both perpetual and subscription licensing options to our customers, as well as monthly software rentals for certain products. Given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license (revenue is recognized at the time of sale) and a subscription (revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term), we use bookings for internal planning, forecasting and reporting of new license and cloud services transactions. In order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses, we define subscription bookings as the subscription annualized contract value (subscription ACV) of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2. We arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering a number of variables including pricing, support, length of term, and renewal rates. We define subscription ACV as the total value of a new subscription booking divided by the term of the contract (in days) multiplied by 365. If the term of the subscription contract is less than a year, the ACV is equal to the total contract value.\nLicense and subscription bookings equal subscription bookings (as described above) plus perpetual license bookings plus any monthly software rental bookings during the period. Total ACV equals subscription ACV (as described above) plus the annualized value of incremental monthly software rental bookings during the period. Because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses, it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales were perpetual licenses, nor does the annualized value of monthly software rental bookings represent the value of any such booking.\nTotal Deferred Revenue\nTotal Deferred Revenue consists of Billed Deferred Revenue and Unbilled Deferred Revenue. We define Unbilled Deferred Revenue as contractually committed orders for license, subscription and support with a customer for which the associated revenue has not been recognized and the customer has not been invoiced. We do not record Unbilled Deferred Revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet until we invoice the customer. Billed Deferred Revenue primarily relates to software agreements invoiced to customers for which the revenue has not yet been recognized.\nSoftware Revenue\nAny reference to “total recurring software revenue” or “recurring software revenue” means the sum of subscription revenue and support revenue. Any reference to “total software revenue” or “software revenue” means the sum of subscription revenue, support revenue and perpetual license revenue. “Subscription revenue” includes cloud services revenue.\nNavigate Allocation\nRevenue and bookings for Navigate, a ThingWorx-based IoT solution for PLM are allocated 50% to Solutions and 50% to IoT.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR)\nTo help investors understand and assess the success of our subscription transition, we provide an Annualized Recurring Revenue operating measure. Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given quarter is calculated by dividing the portion of non-GAAP software revenue attributable to subscription and support for the quarter by the number of days in the quarter and multiplying by 365. (A related metric is Subscription ARR, which is calculated by dividing the portion of non-GAAP revenue attributable to subscription for the quarter by the number of days in the quarter and multiplying by 365.) ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract expiration and renewal rates, and does not include revenue reported as perpetual license or professional services revenue in our consolidated statement of income. Subscription and support revenue and ARR disclosed in a quarter can be impacted by multiple factors, including but not limited to (1) the timing of the start of a contract or a renewal, including the impact of on-time renewals, support win-backs, and support conversions, which may vary by quarter, (2) the ramping of committed monthly payments under a subscription agreement over time, and (3) multiple other contractual factors with the customer including other elements sold with the subscription or support contract. These factors can result in variability in disclosed ARR.\nConstant Currency Change Metric\nYear-over-year changes in revenue and bookings on a constant currency basis compare reported results excluding the effect of any hedging converted into U.S. dollars based on the corresponding prior year’s foreign currency exchange rates to reported results for the comparable prior year period.\nImportant Information about Non-GAAP References\nPTC provides non-GAAP supplemental information to its financial results. We use these non-GAAP measures, and we believe that they assist our investors, to make period-to-period comparisons of our operational performance because they provide a view of our operating results without items that are not, in our view, indicative of our operating results. We believe that these non-GAAP measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business, and we use the measures to establish budgets and operational goals, communicated internally and externally, for managing our business and evaluating our performance. We believe that providing non-GAAP measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to the results of peer companies. In addition, compensation of our executives is based in part on the performance of our business based on these non-GAAP measures. However, non-GAAP information should not be construed as an alternative to GAAP information as the items excluded from the non-GAAP measures often have a material impact on PTC’s financial results and such items often recur. Management uses, and investors should consider, non-GAAP measures in conjunction with our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the effect of the following items: fair value of acquired deferred revenue, fair value adjustment to deferred services cost, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges included in general and administrative costs, restructuring charges, headquarters relocation charges, and income tax adjustments. Additional information about the items we exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we exclude them can be found in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” beginning on page 33 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP results is provided within this press release.\nPTC also provides information on “free cash flow” and “adjusted free cash flow” to enable investors to assess our ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financings and to evaluate our performance against our announced long term goal of returning approximately 40% of our free cash flow to shareholders via stock repurchases. Free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures; adjusted free cash flow is free cash flow excluding restructuring payments and certain identified non-ordinary course payments. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are not measures of cash available for discretionary expenditures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nStatements in this press release that are not historic facts, including statements about our third quarter and full fiscal 2018 targets, and other future financial and growth expectations and targets and anticipated tax rates, and our plans to repurchase $100 million of our common stock in an accelerated repurchase transaction in the third quarter, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks include: the macroeconomic and/or global manufacturing climates may deteriorate; customers may not purchase our solutions or convert to subscription when or at the rates we expect; our businesses, including our Internet of Things (IoT) business, may not expand and/or generate the revenue we expect; foreign currency exchange rates may vary from our expectations and thereby affect our reported revenue and expense; the mix of revenue between license & subscription solutions, support and professional services could be different than we expect, which could impact our EPS results; our transition to subscription-only licensing in the Americas and Western Europe could adversely affect sales and revenue; sales of our solutions as subscriptions may not have the longer-term effect on revenue and earnings that we expect; we may be unable to expand our partner ecosystem as we expect and our partners may not generate the revenue we expect; we may be unable to improve performance in Japan when or as we expect; we may be unable to generate sufficient operating cash flow to return 40% of free cash flow to shareholders and other uses of cash or our credit facility limits or other matters could preclude share repurchases. In addition, our assumptions concerning our future GAAP and non-GAAP effective income tax rates are based on estimates and other factors that could change, including the geographic mix of our revenue, expenses and profits. Other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected are detailed from time to time in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nPTC and the PTC logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of PTC Inc. or its subsidiaries in the United States and in other countries.\nAbout PTC (NASDAQ: PTC)\nPTC helps companies around the world reinvent the way they design, manufacture, operate, and service things in and for a smart, connected world.

Income tax adjustments reflect the tax effects of non-GAAP adjustments which are calculated by applying the applicable tax rate by jurisdiction to the non-GAAP adjustments listed above. We have recorded the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our Q1'18 GAAP earnings, resulting in a non-cash benefit of approximately $7 million. We have excluded this benefit from our non-GAAP results.\nPTC Inc.
