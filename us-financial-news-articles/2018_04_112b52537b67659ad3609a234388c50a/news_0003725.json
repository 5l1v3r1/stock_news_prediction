Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Scotland vs France - BT Murrayfield, Edinburgh, Britain - February 11, 2018 France’s Maxime Machenaud in action REUTERS/Russell Cheyne \nRacing, who quickly trailed 9-0, prevailed thanks to tries by Leone Nakarawa, Marc Andreu and Boris Palu with Maxime Machenaud adding three penalties and two conversions. \nThree-times runners-up Clermont replied with four penalties by Morgan Parra and Peter Betham’s try. \nRacing will face Munster in Bordeaux on the weekend of April 21/22 for a place in the final. \nClermont opened a 9-0 lead thanks to three penalties by Parra, but Nakarawa reduced the arrears when he dived over after unsettling the hosts’ defence with a fine dummy pass. \nMachenaud converted and put the visitors ahead with a penalty just after the half hour. \nBut Racing lost focus and were immediately punished. \nParra found space in the Racing defence and set up Betham with a long pass for the wing to touch down in the corner. \nMachenaud and Parra traded penalties early in the second half. \nMachenaud then found Dan Carter for the New Zealander’s offload to be collected out wide by Andreu, who scored a try. \nJust after the reset, Carter slalomed through the Clermont defence, found Teddy Thomas who then set up Palu for Racing’s third try as the hosts looked hapless. \nThey thought they could threaten a comeback, but their hopes were dashed when Remi Grosso’s try was disallowed for an accidental offside.
