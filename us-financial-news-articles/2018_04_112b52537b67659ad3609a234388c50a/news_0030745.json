The LME said last October that on April 18, 2018, it would delist two brands from Nornickel for delivery against its futures contracts.\n“It’s a misreading of the headline that the (Nornickel) brand is being delisted (today), that decision was taken six months ago, it’s nothing to do with the sanctions but when you (spark) a technical rally these things run free,” said Oliver Nugent, commodities strategist at ING.\nALUMINIUM: Aluminium ended up 5.5 percent at $2,537 a tonne, having hit its highest in nearly seven years at $2,537.50 after global miner Rio Tinto flagged possible downward adjustments to its 2018 aluminium output following the U.S. sanctions on Rusal.\nConcerns over the impact of the April 6 sanctions on Rusal have pushed up aluminium some 25 percent so far.\nALUMINA: Prices of alumina, the raw material for making aluminium, have surged after Rio Tinto last week declared force majeure because of the sanctions on Rusal.\n“A source at a smelter ... (is) saying ‘phones have been ringing off the hook with people looking for extra metal. They are looking for any extra tonnes, even just a few hundred’,” said broker SP Angel.\nGoldman Sachs said in a note prices could spike to $2,800-3,000 a tonne but would not stay there. “On a more persistent basis we revise up our 3/6/12-month price forecasts to 2,500/2,300/2,000/t (previously $2,200/1,900/1,950/t).”\nNICKEL TECHNICALS: “A weekly close above the horizontal resistance barrier around $14,580/T by the end of this week should be considered bullish, confirming the next stage in the sustainable rising trend,” said ING in a note.\nINDONESIA EXPORTS: Indonesia exported 8,637,595 tonnes of nickel ore up to March 31, 2018 since its ore export policy was revised in January 2017.\nOTHER METALS: Copper ended up 2.1 percent at $7,022 a tonne, zinc closed up 3.5 percent at $3,265, lead closed up 1.2 percent at $2,377 while tin ended flat at $21,475.\nAdditional reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr., editing by David Evans and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:26:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
