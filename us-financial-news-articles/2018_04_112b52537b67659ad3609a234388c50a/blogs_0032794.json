Eletropaulo had agreed to sell the stake to Neoenergia as long as other investors do not bid higher than the 25.51 reais, according to the filings. \nIf it succeeds in acquiring the minority stake, Neoenergia said it would acquire the rest of Eletropaulo's shares, at a total cost of 5.7 billion reais ($1.7 billion). \nEletropaulo said in the filing its board was analyzing Enel's offer with its financial advisers.
