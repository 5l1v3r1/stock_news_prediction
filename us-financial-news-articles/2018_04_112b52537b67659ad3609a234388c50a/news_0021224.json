In 2016, rapper 50 Cent visited a hostel's bar, shot some pool and checked out the sun terrace in another commercial for the company. Last May, comedian Phil Wang took the firm's \"Speak the World\" translator within its app to Indonesia to see if his jokes would make people laugh once they'd been translated. Hostelworld claims that worrying about a language barrier stops 10 percent of U.K. adults from going on vacation.\nHostelworld is an online booking company that lists 36,000 hostels around the world and made a net revenue of 86.7 million euros ($107.3 million) in 2017, an increase of 10 percent on the previous year. It listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2015.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsYIDBbtE_A"], "published": "2018-04-11T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T17:38:00.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
