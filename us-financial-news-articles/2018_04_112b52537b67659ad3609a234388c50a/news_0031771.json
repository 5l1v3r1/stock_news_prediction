ABB stock has lost 15 percent this year to trade around 22 francs.\nSpiesshofer has quit some businesses to improve power grids’ performance, selling high-voltage cables and exiting the engineering, procurement and construction business last year.\n“ABB has evolved significantly as we have strengthened and streamlined the business and we are making good progress against our strategic goals,” a company spokesman said. “Management and board are fully aligned.”\nSweden’s Investor AB, ABB’s largest shareholder, supports the strategy. “We believe the key focus for ABB is to execute on the transformation of Power Grids, continue to invest for the future and strengthen customer focus and cost efficiency,” it said.\nFidelity, whose Swiss fund has ABB as a top-10 holding, questioned the structure, adding 2018 could see limited growth and struggling profitability, fund manager Andrea Fornoni said.\n“From the outside, there are some areas like power grids that don’t really fit for many reasons — end markets, growth drivers or margin profile,” he told Reuters.\n“I don’t think this is something that necessarily needs to be done over the next six months but over time a stronger view should be taken on this.”\nThursday’s results are unlikely to provide much respite, with power grids’ revenues and profitability slipping, a Reuters poll shows.\nChrister Gardells, managing partner at Cevian who wanted to split up ABB, has said he was disappointed with ABB’s performance since the 2016 decision.\n“The decision the board made a year and a half ago regarding the structure of ABB seems to have been wrong,” he told Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri this month.\nABB shares have risen 1 percent since the decision while the Stoxx European industrial sector index has gained 17 percent.\n“We want to see proof that the synergies and the advantage they [ABB] argue are there in keeping the structure intact are materialised in higher growth and profitability than for competitors,” said John Hernander, portfolio manager at ABB shareholder Nordea.\nAdditional reporting by Johannes Hellstrom in Stockholm; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T15:29:25.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
