The cash proceeds at closing were $300 million. Proceeds from the sale will be used to accelerate the drilling program of Unit’s upstream subsidiary, Unit Petroleum Company; make additional capital investments in the jointly owned Superior; to reduce corporate debt; and for general corporate purposes.\nLarry Pinkston, CEO and President, said: “This strategic transaction is beneficial to Unit on multiple fronts. It highlights the current value of Superior, provides growth opportunities for all three business segments, reduces corporate debt, and improves overall liquidity.”\nUnit Corporation is a Tulsa-based, publicly held energy company engaged through its subsidiaries in oil and gas exploration, production, contract drilling and natural gas gathering and processing.
