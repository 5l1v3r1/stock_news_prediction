For the first time, some Americans on Medicaid will be required to work and the Department of Housing and Urban Development is reportedly exploring a similar approach for those who live in subsidized housing. \nMeanwhile, proponents of existing welfare programs suggest that stricter requirements would have disproportionate repercussions for the most vulnerable. They suggest that the proposed changes make a number of inaccurate assumptions about recipients, including that they don’t want to work and that having a job will instantly solve their financial issues. \nAlong with work requirements, the agencies are instructed to follow nine “Principles of Economic Mobility” to guide their proposed changes, including giving states more flexibility, encouraging private sector involvement, and promoting marriage as a means to escape poverty.
