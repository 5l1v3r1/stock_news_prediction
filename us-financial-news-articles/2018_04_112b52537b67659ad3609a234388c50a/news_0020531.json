Together, with the entire OSE team, we will actively pursue the development of new immunotherapies to meet the patients’ unmet medical needs. I salute the outstanding expertise of our researchers and clinicians able to anticipate and identify targets of major interest and turn them into first-in-class immunotherapies.”\nThe management team around Alexis Peyroles has recently been strengthened with the additions of Bérangère Vasseur, MD, Chief Medical Officer Immuno-Oncology (broad experience in oncology development while at Roche and at several biotechnology companies) and Emilienne Soma, PharmD, Ph.D., Director of Pharmaceutical Program Development (experience in R&D management and in alliances in several biotechnology companies) who have recently joined the company.

They will support the development of the Company's product portfolio, including both a product close to market with orphan status designation (Tedopi®) and breakthrough clinical innovations conducted in partnership (in 2018 with Boehringer Ingelheim for OSE-172, end of 2016 with Servier for OSE-127 and in 2016 with Janssen Biotech for FR104).\nAlexis Peyroles’ appointment as Chief Executive Officer supports the Company's strategic growth steps, serving in the best interest of patients, employees, shareholders and other stakeholders.\nABOUT OSE Immunotherapeutics\nOSE Immunotherapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on the development of innovative immunotherapies for immune activation and regulation in the fields of immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases. Neoepitopes innovation (Tedopi®) is today in Phase 3 in advanced lung cancers (NSCLC) after checkpoint inhibitors failure (anti PD-1 and anti PD-L1). A global license and collaboration agreement was signed in April 2018 with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop checkpoint inhibitor OSE-172 (anti-SIRPa monoclonal antibody), for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. An option to license was exercised in July 2016 by Janssen Biotech to continue clinical development of FR104 (an anti CD28 mAb) in auto-immune diseases after positive phase 1 results. A 2-step license option was signed in 2016 with Servier Laboratories to develop OSE-127 (monoclonal antibody targeting the CD127 receptor, the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor) to develop the product up to the completion of a phase 2 clinical trial planned in autoimmune bowel disease and Sjogren disease. The company has several scientific and technological platforms: neoepitopes, agonist or antagonist monoclonal antibodies, ideally positioned to fight cancer and autoimmune diseases. Its first-in-class clinical portfolio offers a diversified risk profile.\nClick and follow us on Twitter and Linkedln\nhttps://twitter.com/OSEIMMUNO\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/10929673\nContacts\nOSE Immunotherapeutics\nSylvie Détry\nSylvie.detry@ose-immuno.com\n+33 143 297 857\nFrench Media: FP2COM\nFlorence Portejoie\nfportejoie@fp2com.fr\n+33 607 768 283 U.S. Media: LifeSci Public Relations\nMatt Middleman, M.D.\nmatt@lifescipublicrelations.com\n+1 646 627 8384\nU.S. and European Investors\nChris Maggos\nchris@lifesciadvisors.com\n+41 79 367 6254 Forward-looking statements\nThis press release contains express or implied information and statements that might be deemed forward-looking information and statements in respect of OSE Immunotherapeutics.
