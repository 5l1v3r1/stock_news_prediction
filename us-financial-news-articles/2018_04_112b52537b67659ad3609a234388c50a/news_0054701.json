We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Schroepfer wrote.\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg apologized to U.S. senators for issues that have beset Facebook, including shortcomings over data protection.\nBut the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect any specific promises to support any congressional regulation of the world's largest social media network and other U.S. internet companies.\nSchroepfer, who was appearing before the British media committee on Thursday, said it was clear Facebook had not done enough to ensure its tools from \"potentially being used for harm\" or take a broad enough view of its responsibility.\n\"That was a mistake,\" he wrote.
