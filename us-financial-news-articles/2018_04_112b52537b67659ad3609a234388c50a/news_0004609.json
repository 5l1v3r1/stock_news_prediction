We have invested in scalability preparedness for our platforms, including transition to the best-in-class Amazon Web Services platform and qualification onto Sprint’s network for data communications, enabling IGEN to immediately onboard new assets at large scales. We expect to leverage these investments throughout 2018 as we accelerate adoption of our platform across multiple current and new channels and expand our base of recurring subscriber revenue. Additionally, we are pursuing multiple strategic initiatives to rapidly enhance our subscriber scale, total assets tracked, and total addressable market opportunities in the high-growth IoT consumer automotive industry.
