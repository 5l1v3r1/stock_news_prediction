Neal then beat goalie Jonathan Quick from the right circle with a wrister between the pads, snapping a 1-1 tie.\nWilliam Karlsson tacked on insurance 21 seconds later with his first goal of the playoffs. Reilly Smith teed him up from behind the net, and Karlsson poked a wrister past Quick’s stick side.\nThat turned out to be valuable when Anze Kopitar deflected a point shot by Fantenberg at 17:56 to draw the Kings within a goal. However, Los Angeles couldn’t pot the equalizer, enabling the Golden Knights to take a chokehold in an increasingly chippy series.\nMarc-Andre Fleury withstood a barrage in net for Vegas, making 37 saves, including 16 in the third period.\nThe Golden Knights can advance to the second round with a win in Game 4 on Tuesday night at Los Angeles’ Staples Center.\nAfter beating Fleury just once in 1-0 and 2-1 defeats in Las Vegas, the Kings were able to crack the code at 13:14 of the first period. Alex Iafallo roofed a wrister from the left post off Kopitar’s feed for his first goal. The play was originally ruled no goal but was overturned upon review.\nLos Angeles nursed that lead into the third period, but three missed power-play opportunities following Iafallo’s marker loomed large.\nThe Golden Knights responded with the tying goal at 6:10 of the third. Cody Eakin hit the post on a point-blank wrister but got a second chance and made no mistake from the right circle.\nThat set the stage for Neal and Karlsson to bring Vegas to the brink of eliminating the Kings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:27:52.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
