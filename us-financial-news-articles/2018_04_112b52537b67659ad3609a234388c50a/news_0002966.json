In light of ongoing discussions with Westmoreland's creditors in connection with the Company's capital structure review, Westmoreland will not host a conference call for investors this quarter.\n2017 Results and Highlights:\nFourth Quarter:\nRevenues of $363.8 million from 12.8 million tons sold\nNet income applicable to common shareholders of $35.1 million, or $1.87 per share\nAdjusted EBITDA of $86.0 million\nCash flow provided by operating activities of $93.0 million;\nFree cash flow of $83 million;\nFull Year:\nRevenues of $1.4 billion from 49.7 million tons sold\nNet loss applicable to common shareholders of $71.3 million, or $3.82 per share\nAdjusted EBITDA of $269.3 million\nCash flow provided by operating activities of $114.2 million\nFree cash flow of $129.6 million\n\"Cash flow generated by our business exceeded expectations in 2017 as we benefited from our safe and efficient operations and meeting our customer requirements under the long-term sales contracts,\" said Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Hutchinson. \"As we previously noted, we are working diligently to improve our capital structure so it better matches our cash flow profile.\"\nGary Kohn, Westmoreland's Chief Financial Officer, stated, \"Together with our financial and legal advisers we are designing an improved capital structure for Westmoreland Coal and all of our subsidiaries. Our aim is to create a capital structure that better aligns with our cash flow and allows for an improved balance sheet. During the restructuring process, we have remained focused on safety and on providing our customers with the level of service they have come to expect from Westmoreland.\"\nSafety\nWestmoreland’s safety metrics for the year ended December 31, 2017 are shown below:\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Reportable Rate Lost Time Rate U.S. Surface Operations 1.45 0.89 U.S. National Surface Average 1.35 0.78 Percentage 107 % 114 % U.S. Underground Operations 1.55 0.97 U.S. National Underground Average 4.86 3.78 Percentage 32 % 26 % Canadian Operations 1.49 0.41 Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity\nWestmoreland finished the year with $103.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from $60.1 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had an undrawn $50 million revolving credit facility, of which $28.7 million, net of letters of credit and borrowing base restrictions, was available for borrowing.\nFree cash flow generated in 2017 was $129.6 million, which was the result of strong operations, favorable year-end working capital, and a net $13.4 million of released bond collateral. Bond collateral returns were previously included in cash from investing activities, but are now included on several lines of cash from operating activities on the cash flow statement. As a result, bond collateral return is included in free cash flow generation. Capital expenditures totaled $35.0 million, and net cash from loan and lease receivables was $50.5 million. Included in cash flow provided by operations were cash uses for interest expense of $98.1 million and for asset retirement obligations of $43.4 million.\nGross debt plus capital lease obligations at December 31, 2017 totaled $1.1 billion, down $70.7 million from year end 2016. Outstanding gross indebtedness, cash on hand and net debt as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nGross Debt Cash on Hand Net Debt (in millions) Parent $ 692.8 $ 47.2 $ 645.6 San Juan 56.6 19.3 37.3 WMLP 326.5 36.7 289.8 Consolidated $ 1,075.9 $ 103.2 $ 972.7 Consolidated and Segment Results\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter was $86.0 million, down 4% from the record high quarterly Adjusted EBITDA of $89.1 million in the same period of the prior year. Full year consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $269.3 million, which included an incremental $37.1 million from the early Capital Power repayment of loan and lease receivables, was down slightly from the previous year.\nThe Coal - U.S. segment fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was up 18% to $43.9 million. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was up 2% to $129.3 million. These improvements were driven by high-margin reclamation work at the Jewett mine and performance from the San Juan mine. Also reflected in the year-over-year comparisons are the 2016 coal supply contract expirations at the Jewett and Beulah mines.\nThe Coal - Canada segment fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was down 41% to $18.9 million. Full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA was up 2% to $90.0 million. The year-over-year fourth quarter comparison was negatively impacted by the accelerated Capital Power receipt in the first quarter of 2017 due to the loss of financing income after the payment was made. Results in the Coal - Canada segment were also affected by the now-resolved dragline issues at the Estevan mine and the cost overruns due to operational issues at the Coal Valley mine earlier in the year.\nThe Coal - WMLP segment had fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $15.8 million, a 25% decrease from the prior year, and full year Adjusted EBITDA of $68.7 million, a 13% decrease. Operations at the Coal - WMLP segment were negatively impacted by ongoing Ohio open-market pressures and the Kemmerer pit flooding in the first half of 2017.\nThe Power segment Adjusted EBITDA of $14.4 million in the fourth quarter and $11.3 million for the full year 2017 benefited from the acceleration of non-cash deferred revenue associated with the exit of the power supply contracts at ROVA.\nCorporate Update\nWestmoreland expects to file its annual report on Form 10-K today containing an audit opinion with an explanatory paragraph referring to Westmoreland's conclusion that substantial doubt exists regarding its ability to continue as a going concern. Delivery of financial statements with such an audit opinion constitutes a breach of certain covenants under the revolver and the San Juan term loan. If accelerated, default under the revolver can cause a cross-default to the Westmoreland term loan and senior notes. Westmoreland has obtained waivers from the specific lender groups with respect to the potential event of default, as well as certain other matters. The waivers provide Westmoreland with additional time to continue negotiations with lenders regarding changes to the capital structure. Substantially all of Westmoreland's debt is now classified as current as of December 31, 2017.\nWestmoreland has suspended the search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer until the conclusion of the capital structure negotiations.\nNotes\nWestmoreland presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow, that Westmoreland believes provide meaningful supplemental information and provide meaningful comparability to prior periods. Reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are presented in the accompanying tables.\nAbout Westmoreland Coal Company\nWestmoreland Coal Company is the oldest independent coal company in the United States.

calculates and reconciles to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (including a breakdown by segment), and free cash flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are included in this news release because they are key metrics used by management to assess Westmoreland’s operating performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Westmoreland believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are useful to an investor in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because these measures:\nare used widely by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such terms, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors;\nare used by rating agencies, lenders and other parties to evaluate creditworthiness; and\nhelp investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of Westmoreland’s operations from period to period by removing the effect of the Company’s capital structure and asset base from the Company’s operating results.\nNeither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, nor free cash flow are measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The items excluded from EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are significant in assessing Westmoreland’s operating results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nOther companies in Westmoreland’s industry and in other industries may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow differently from the way that Westmoreland does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of its business. Westmoreland compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow only as supplemental data.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA (earnings before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expense) and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures that do not reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital and major maintenance expenditures or contractual commitments; do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements necessary to pay income taxes; do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; and do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on certain of the Company’s debt obligations. In addition, although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Westmoreland considers Adjusted EBITDA to be useful because it reflects operating performance before the effects of certain non-cash items and other items that it believes are not indicative of core operations. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Adjusted EBITDA by Segment Coal - U.S. $ 43,904 $ 37,347 $ 129,325 $ 126,563 Coal - Canada 18,855 32,181 90,031 88,423 Coal - WMLP 15,805 21,044 68,701 79,303 Power 14,350 5,854 11,274 3,626 Heritage (3,187 ) (3,083 ) (14,242 ) (13,409 ) Corporate (3,764 ) (4,228 ) (15,757 ) (12,651 ) Total $ 85,963 $ 89,115 $ 269,332 $ 271,855\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss Net income (loss) $ 33,989 $ (7,777 ) $ (73,135 ) $ (28,872 ) Income tax (benefit) expense (4,484 ) 1,601 (5,890 ) (48,059 ) Interest income (1,159 ) (1,914 ) (4,101 ) (7,435 ) Interest expense 29,269 31,150 118,657 121,819 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 6,923 72,170 121,054 185,267 Accretion of asset retirement obligation 11,337 10,193 45,132 40,423 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities (1) (89 ) (158 ) (890 ) (810 ) EBITDA $ 75,786 $ 105,265 $ 200,827 $ 262,333 Advisory fees (2) 2,649 — 5,423 — (Gain) loss on foreign exchange (283 ) (816 ) 3,108 715 Loss on impairment 5,872 — 5,872 — Acquisition-related costs (3) — — — 568 Customer payments received under loan and lease receivables (4) — 5,095 50,489 13,064 Derivative loss (gain) 4,642 (26,219 ) (1,929 ) (24,055 ) (Gain) loss on sale/disposal of assets and other adjustments (2,057 ) 4,131 2,342 11,646 Share-based compensation (646 ) 1,659 3,200 7,584 Adjusted EBITDA $ 85,963 $ 89,115 $ 269,332 $ 271,855", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T18:55:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
