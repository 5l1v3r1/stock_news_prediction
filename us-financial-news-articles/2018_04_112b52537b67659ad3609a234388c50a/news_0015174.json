Lynch , Mica Rosenberg 4 Min Read \nWASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions ramped up calls on Friday to criminally prosecute immigrants who cross illegally into the United States, adding to a barrage of statements on immigration by the administration of President Donald Trump this week.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nPointing to an upswing in border crossings to levels seen during former President Barack Obama’s tenure, Sessions said he was ordering U.S. attorneys offices near the Southwest border to prioritise bringing cases against first-time offenders. \nOnce border crossers are charged with illegal entry and deported, they can be charged with a felony carrying significant jail time if they are caught crossing illegally again. \nTrump signed a memorandum on Friday ordering the end of the policy known as “catch and release,” in which illegal immigrants are released from detention while awaiting a court hearing on their status. \nEnding “catch and release” was one of Trump’s central promises during the 2016 campaign, but immigration authorities have faced a shortage of space to house people who have been detained. \nAmong the measures outlined in the memo, Trump directed the departments of Defence and Homeland Security to produce a list of military facilities that could be used to detain illegal immigrants. \nEarlier this week Trump pledged to deploy the National Guard to assist with border operations because he has not been able to secure funding to fulfil a central campaign promise of building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \nDefence Secretary Jim Mattis signed a memo on Friday authorizing the deployment of up to 4,000 National Guard troops. The memo said the troops “will not perform law enforcement activities or interact with migrants.” \nAbout 150 National Guard members from Arizona will deploy to the border next week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said on Twitter. The Texas National Guard said it was preparing to send about 250 troops to the border within three days.
