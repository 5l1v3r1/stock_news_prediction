On Monday, he struck out eight and walked one.\nAaron Judge and Gregorius slugged their fourth homers as New York opened an 11-0 lead in the first five innings. Gregorius added a solo shot in the seventh.\nGary Sanchez had three hits and three RBIs. Judge, Gregorius, Miguel Andujar, Brett Gardner and Tyler Austin had two hits each for the Yankees, who played for the first time since Friday.\nMarlins starter Caleb Smith, who pitched for the Yankees last season, fought wildness in taking the loss. Smith (0-2) gave up five hits, five runs and five walks in 2 1/3 innings.\nMiami’s Miguel Rojas had two hits and moved his hitting streak to a career-high nine games.\nThe Marlins have lost 10 of their past 12 games.\nThe game marked the first interleague meeting between the teams since the Yankees acquired 2017 National League MVP Giancarlo Stanton for four-time All-Star Starlin Castro on Dec. 11.\nStanton and Castro were both held hitless Monday.\nSmith ran into trouble in the first inning, allowing the first three Yankees hitters to reach base before Sanchez’s infield hit — his first single this season — drove in Gardner. Austin later drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk on a full count for a 2-0 lead.\nJudge’s solo home run to right in the second was his 60th in 194 career games. That made Judge the fastest player ever to reach 60 homers, beating Mark McGwire’s record. The blast also extended his hitting streak to 12 games.\nAaron Hicks ripped a two-run double in the third for a 5-0 lead, and Gregorius popped a two-run homer in the fourth.\nAndujar and Judge had run-scoring hits before Sanchez’s two-run single for an 11-0 lead after five.\nMiami’s Justin Bour had an RBI groundout in the eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T10:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:39:34.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
