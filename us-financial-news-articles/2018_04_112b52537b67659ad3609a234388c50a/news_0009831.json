A lawyer for Casado did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nBenjamin Brafman, a U.S. lawyer for Zarrab, confirmed in an email that the unidentified lawyer was Turkish and had been assisting Zarrab in jail, and that “none of his U.S. attorneys were involved or even aware” of their transaction.\nZarrab, 34, a dual national of Iran and Turkey, was a star government witness in the recent Manhattan trial of Mehmet Hakan Atilla, a former deputy general manager at Turkey’s state-controlled Halkbank.\nAtilla, 47, was convicted in January of helping Iran evade U.S. sanctions. He is facing an April 11 sentencing, and prosecutors are seeking a prison term of around 20 years.\nFederal prosecutors accused Casado of taking between $45,000 and $50,000 in bribes from “Inmate-1,” typically through the unidentified lawyer.\nIn exchange, Casado would smuggle contraband, including alcohol and cellphones, as well as food, Vitamin C and over-the-counter pain medication into the jail for Inmate-1, prosecutors said.\nWhile Inmate-1 was not identified by name, court papers said he has pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran and money laundering, matching Zarrab’s plea, and to bribery in connection with his dealings with Casado.\nInmate-1 gave prosecutors information in the hope of obtaining leniency at sentencing, the papers showed.\nThe cases against Zarrab and Atilla have strained diplomatic ties between the United States and Turkey, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has called it a politically motivated attack on his government.\nCasado, 35, of the Bronx, was charged with five criminal counts, including bribery and fraud. He faces up to 20 years in prison on the most serious charges.
