REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \n“The law was clear and it is vital that carriers and infrastructure companies alike never duck their responsibilities,” said Christopher Killion, acting deputy chief of the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau. \n“Companies must abide by the law as it stands whenever they are building infrastructure, operating wireless facilities, or taking other actions under FCC jurisdiction.” \nSprint takes “compliance obligations seriously and will ensure that facilities are constructed only after appropriate permitting and review are completed,” the company said. \nThe FCC also settled with privately held Mobilitie LLC, a telecommunications infrastructure company, for $1.6 million. \nSprint, a mobile voice and data service provider, contracted with Mobilitie to deploy wireless network equipment, the FCC said. \nIn 2017, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau began investigating whether the two companies met requirements before constructing wireless infrastructure facilities. \nUnder the rules then in effect, deploying wireless infrastructure facilities, such as communications \ntowers and structures for small cell systems, required environmental and historic preservation reviews prior to construction. \nThe rules required some facilities to register with the FCC prior to construction. \nBoth companies agreed to improve their environmental and historic preservation review compliance procedures. \nMobilitie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
