We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Schroepfer wrote.\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg apologised to U.S. senators for issues that have beset Facebook, including shortcomings with data protection.\nBut the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect calls for any specific promises to support possible congressional regulation of the world's largest social media network and other U.S. internet companies.\nSchroepfer was filling in for Zuckerberg in front of British lawmakers on Thursday after the Facebook chief declined to appear himself, a decision the parliamentary committee chairman had described as astonishing.\nFacebook has said that the personal information of about 87 million users might have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.\nBritish lawmakers have also raised concern over the use of social media in Britain's referendum vote in 2016 to leave the European Union.\nSchroepfer said it was clear Facebook had not done enough to ensure its tools could \"potentially being used for harm\" or take a broad enough view of its responsibility.\nAs many as one million British Facebook users may have had their data harvested because they were connected to U.S. users targeted in data passed to Cambridge Analytica, Schroepfer said.\nFacebook attracts 40 million monthly active users in Britain, he wrote, representing about 60 percent of the entire population.\nSchroepfer told the committee his company would crack down on manipulative political advertising techniques ahead of local elections in Britain in 2019.\nSteps would include vetting who paid for political ads and allowing users to view all advertising from different campaigns, not just ones targeted at them in their own news feed.\n\"This is not an issue of revenue for us,\" he said. \"Political advertising is a very small, low single-digit percentage of our overall advertising, so the decisions here have nothing to do with money or revenue.\" (Writing by Michael Holden Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Mark Heinrich)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T13:58:30.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
