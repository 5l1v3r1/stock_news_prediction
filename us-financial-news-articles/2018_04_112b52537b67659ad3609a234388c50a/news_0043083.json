The move comes after the South American country reached a $1 billion repurchase deal with HSBC in late March. \nThe government has said it plans to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion this year through repurchase deals. Finance Minister Luis Caputo has said Argentina does not plan to sell new debt in the international markets in 2018 after raising $9 billion through dollar bonds in January.
