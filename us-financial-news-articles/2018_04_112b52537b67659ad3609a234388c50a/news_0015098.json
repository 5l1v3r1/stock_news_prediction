REUTERS/Toby Melville “We hope for a constructive response from the British side and are counting on such a meeting in the very nearest future,” the agency cited a spokesman for the Russian embassy saying.\nThe Foreign Office confirmed it had received the request for ambassador Alexander Yakovenko to meet Johnson, but called the request a diversionary tactic.\n“We will be responding in due course,” it said in a statement.\nRelations between Russia and Britain have plunged to their lowest for decades since former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found slumped unconscious on a bench in Salisbury last month.\nBoth were found to be suffering from the effects of a nerve agent but are now recovering in hospital.\nBritain blamed Russia for the poisoning and asked it to explain what happened but Russia denies any involvement and has suggested Britain itself carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria.\nBoth have subsequently accused each other of trying to deceive the world with an array of claims, counter-claims and threats.\nAt a session of the executive of the global chemical weapons watchdog earlier this week, Russia called for a joint inquiry into the poisoning of the Skripals but lost a vote on the motion.\nThe two then swapped insults at the United Nations Security Council on Thursday where Russia warned Britain it was “playing with fire” by accusing Moscow.\nSaturday’s Foreign Office statement said: “It’s over three weeks since we asked Russia to engage constructively and answer a number of questions relating to the attempted assassinations of Mr Skripal and his daughter.\n“Now, after failing in their attempts in the UN and international chemical weapons watchdog this week and with the victims’ condition improving, they seem to be pursuing a different diversionary tactic.”\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Stephen Addison; editing by Jason Neely and Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T15:13:48.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
