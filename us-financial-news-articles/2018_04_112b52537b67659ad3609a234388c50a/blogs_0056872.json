Photo: El Tiempo/GDA/ZUMA PRESS\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it lifted sanctions on a Colombian soccer team after the nation’s government oversaw a forced sale, severing the team’s ties to organized crime.\nA Columbian regulatory agency supervised the sale and corporate restructuring of Envigado Futbol Club SA, also known as Envigado FC, to ensure that the former owner, and an organized crime group to whom he was linked, didn’t benefit from the sale, Treasury said. The sale was recently completed, Treasury said.\n“This delisting demonstrates that Treasury sanctions to combat drug cartels can effectively disrupt their ingrained financial investments and hinder their long-term plans to launder money through the sports industry,” said Sigal Mandelker, the undersecretary of Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\nGiven that Envigado FC is no longer on the U.S. sanctions list, it is once again allowed to conduct transactions with Americans and its U.S. assets are unblocked. Representatives for the team couldn’t be reached. Its website is under construction.\nThe U.S. added Envigado FC to its sanctions list in November 2014, saying the team’s owner, Juan Pablo Upegui Gallego, used his position to steer the team’s finances for the benefit of the crime group, called La Oficina de Envigado, for many years.\nTreasury first targeted La Oficina in June 2014, saying at the time the group had its roots in the 1980s and 1990s, when its founding members provided services for the leaders of the Medellin Cartel, including its leader Pablo Escobar. Mr. Upegui is a key associate of the group, Treasury had alleged when targeting the team. He wasn’t removed on Thursday from the sanctions list, according to the Treasury’s update notice.\nLast year, Treasury provided guidance on how to get off the sanctions list. Lawyers for companies and individuals on the list had complained for years about the process, saying it was difficult and capricious.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
