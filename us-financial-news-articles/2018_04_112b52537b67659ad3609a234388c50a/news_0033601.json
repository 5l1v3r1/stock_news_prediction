Existing contracts were not affected, it added. \nIn December, Mexico banned the Odebrecht unit from bidding for federal public contracts for four years after the Public Administration Ministry (SFP) said it had sanctioned the firm for an “incorrect charge” with state oil company Pemex. \nThe latest decision related to suspected corruption involving Pemex, the government said, without giving details. An SFP spokesman could not be reached for comment. \nOdebrecht has spent the past few years at the center of one of the largest corruption scandals in Latin America, and has admitted paying bribes from Peru to Panama. \nEcuador jailed its vice president over the scandal, and the company has paid billions of dollars in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland. Last month, Peru’s president resigned after a probe targeted his connections to Odebrecht. \nOdebrecht has admitted to U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors that it paid $10.5 million in bribes in Mexico.
