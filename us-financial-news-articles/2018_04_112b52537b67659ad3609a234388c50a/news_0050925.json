He urged Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell to consider new \"rescissions\" legislation with spending cuts sought by fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives.\n\"Nobody saw the text of the bill within 24 hours, because the process in Congress is broken,\" Short told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" program.\n\"We would ask the Senate to have patience and look at the package that gets sent up,\" Short said. \"In many cases, what I think you'll see us putting forward are dollars that have been left over in programs for years, that are not being utilized.\"\nSome Republicans want a recissions bill that would cut up to $60 billion in non-military spending, funds that were crucial to winning Democratic support.\nBut reopening the bipartisan deal could divide Republicans during a midterm election year in which they are vulnerable to a Democratic surge. The party is already struggling against unexpected turbulence over House Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire.\nA rescissions vote could also raise the prospect of another embarrassing Republican failure in the 100-seat Senate, which the party controls by only a 51-49 margin.\nRepublican Senator Susan Collins said on Sunday that she would not support a bill that unwinds the bipartisan deal.\n\"No, I will not,\" Collins said in a separate interview on the same NBC program. \"I would advise the president to focus on the coming year's appropriations and not try to relitigate.\"\nThe Senate was unable to repeal former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act last year, due to opposition from Republican lawmakers including Collins.\nHouse Majority leader Kevin McCarthy, whom Ryan has endorsed as his replacement, wants to use a rescissions bill to implement big spending cuts.\nBut McConnell warned last week against rescinding the deal: \"You can't make an agreement one month and say: 'OK, we really didn't mean it.\"\nThe six-month spending package increased military spending by $60 billion and provided $1.6 billion toward Trump's border wall with Mexico.\nThough the White House helped to negotiate the budget measure, Trump has called it a ridiculous situation and said he only signed it into law to bolster defense spending.
