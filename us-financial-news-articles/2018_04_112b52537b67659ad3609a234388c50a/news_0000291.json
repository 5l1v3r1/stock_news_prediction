(the “Company” or “RavenQuest”) – (CSE:RQB)(OTCQB:RVVQF)(Frankfurt:1IT) is pleased to announce that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Western AgriPharma Limited (“WAL”) pursuant to the acquisition of 100% of WAL’s outstanding shares.\nWestern AgriPharma Limited is a late stage applicant with Health Canada in the development of a 125,000 square foot facility, purpose-built for the production of cannabis in Port Mellon, on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast.\n“The Western AgriPharma facility would be RavenQuest’s first 100% owned, purpose-built, large scale facility to incorporate our entire suite of proprietary grow technologies,” said George Robinson, CEO of RavenQuest. “Using our proprietary grow methodologies, 125,000 square feet is more like two or three times that footprint, when you factor in what our Orbital Gardening can produce in grams-per-square-foot,” he continued. “This MOU is the culmination of what began as a simple services contract which has evolved into a potentially transformative addition to our expanding portfolio of licensed facilities. It truly illustrates the power of our services division to generate deal flow for our investment division. We believe we can continue to execute on this strategy, moving forward.”\n“BC’s Sunshine Coast is located a short ferry ride away from Greater Vancouver, one of Canada’s largest cannabis markets, with over 2.5 million residents,” said Robinson. “With our significant presence in the Alberta and Ontario markets, adding a British Columbia facility is a perfect complement and a natural strategic fit,” he continued.\nKevin Smith, President & CEO of WAL, commented on the MOU, stating “RavenQuest has been a class-A partner from the start of our relationship. We have always had tremendous confidence in RavenQuest’s industry-leading expertise. That confidence has grown even more over time. We are very excited about the prospect of joining of a truly unique, top-tier cannabis company with unlimited potential.”\nCompletion of any transaction with WAL is subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to, completion of due diligence, negotiation of definitive agreements in respect of such a transaction, and the receipt of any required regulatory approvals. A transaction cannot be completed until these conditions are satisfied, and there can be no assurance that such a transaction will be completed at all. Readers are cautioned that the memorandum of understanding entered into with WAL does not set forth the terms of a potential transaction nor have such terms been negotiated or finalized.\nAbout RavenQuest BioMed Inc.\nRavenQuest BioMed Inc. is a diversified publicly traded cannabis company with divisions focused upon cannabis production, management services & consulting and specialized research & development.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of\nRAVENQUEST BIOMED INC.\n“George Robinson”\nChief Executive Officer\nFor further information, please contact:\nMathieu McDonald, Corporate Communications – 604-484-1230\nNeither Canadian Stock Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Canadian Stock Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release, which has been prepared by management.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nAll statements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are \"forward-looking information\" with respect to the Company within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements with respect to the development of a licensed cannabis production facility and anticipated production from such a facility.
