I think that's going to change,\" he said in an interview with CNBC's David Faber on \" Squawk on the Street \" Tuesday. \"Normally when you get to this part of the cycle, where the disparity in valuations between growth stocks and value stocks is as wide as it is today, accompanied by rising interest rates, normally there's a shift where value comes in favor.\"\nRobbins said tax reform will benefit value stocks as the lower rates will enable firms to invest more in their businesses. He also cited the repatriation of overseas profits as a tail wind for companies. \n\"A lot of that money is coming across to the U.S. to make acquisitions,\" he said. \"I'm optimistic about the opportunity set I see over the next couple of years.\" \nRobbins also revealed Tuesday that his firm is one of the largest investors in Open Text , a maker of enterprise software based in Canada. \nThe activist investor appeared from the sidelines of 13D Monitor's Annual Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York City.\nRobbins is founder and chief executive officer of Blue Harbour Group L.P. Previously he was a partner at major private equity firms such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and General Atlantic.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T21:27:23.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
