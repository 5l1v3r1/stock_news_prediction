The coalition argues that Google, YouTube’s parent company, violated the 1998 Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which says companies have to get a parent’s consent before collecting data on users under the age of 13.\nYouTube’s terms of use say users have to be 13 or older to create an account. They have also released a YouTube Kids app to allow children to interact with age-appropriate content. However, even that kid-safe zone has come under fire recently, as some videos have been inappropriately included in the service. YouTube is reportedly considering a new iteration of the app that would have no algorithm. Instead, all accessible content would be reviewed by a real person.\nThe complaint to the FTC is only the latest in a series of data and advertising scandals that have forced social networks and their users to examine the policies and implications of sharing online.\nA Google spokesperson told CNN: “Protecting kids and families has always been a top priority for us. We will read the complaint thoroughly and evaluate if there are things we can do to improve.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T11:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T19:16:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
