Turkish courts have ordered their detention on suspicion of illegal entry and attempted military espionage. \n“A month later and we don’t even have charges by the Turkish judiciary against the two Greek soldiers, something which I think is crossing the line,” Tzanakopoulos told Real FM, an Athens radio station. \nGreece and Turkey have a host of historical grievances, from ethnically divided Cyprus to mineral and airspace rights in the Aegean Sea. \nWhile there has been no clear suggestion that the cases involving the two sides’ soldiers are connected, there has been plenty of speculation. Tzanakopoulos said, however, that the two matters were “totally unsimilar”. \nGreek courts have now rejected three times Turkey’s demands that the eight Turkish soldiers be extradited. \n“The rule of law prevails in Greece, which has a Prime Minister who respects and is familiar with Greek judicial practise, and not a Sultan who can make promises on their (judicial) rulings,” a statement from Tsipras’s office said on Sunday.
