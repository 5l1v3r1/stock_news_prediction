In the biggest political crisis in a decade, tens of thousands of his opponents have marched through the capital Yerevan, blocking streets and staging sit-ins.\nThe protests, though peaceful so far, threaten to destabilise a key Russian ally in a volatile region riven by a long low level conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and would, if successful, be a rare example of people power delivering reform in the former Soviet Union.\nCritics accuse Sarksyan of ruling the South Caucasus nation of around 3 million people for too long, of being too close to Russia which has military bases inside Armenia, and of doing too little to root out corruption.\nSarksyan says his country needs him and that his party enjoys large-scale popular support.\nUnder a revised constitution approved in a 2015 referendum, most state powers shifted to the prime minister while the presidency has become a largely ceremonial post.\nPolice said in a statement that opposition politician Nikol Pashinyan and two other lawmakers had been “forcibly removed” from a protest. A Reuters reporter witnessed the “red berets”, as Armenian special police forces are known, grab one lawmaker by his hands and feet and carry him behind the police cordon.\nThe public prosecution service confirmed that three opposition leaders had been detained on suspicion of organising an illegal protest.\nAlmost 200 people have been taken to police stations by law enforcement officers, the Interfax news agency cited police representatives as saying. Seven people had been taken to hospital, the Ministry of Health said in a statement.\nAccording to the law, the detainees must either be released within 72 hours, or a criminal case can be opened against them.\nOpposition leader Pashinyan had earlier held talks with Sarksyan, who walked out of the meeting within minutes after accusing his opponents of trying to “blackmail” the authorities.\nA policeman holds the face of a participant as people protest against the appointment of ex-president Serzh Sarksyan as the new prime minister and demand an early parliamentary election in Yerevan, Armenia April 21, 2018.

REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure “This is not talks, not a dialogue, it’s just an ultimatum, blackmail of the state, of the legitimate authorities,” Sarksyan had said.\nNOISY PROTESTS Demonstrators continued to march in large numbers in the capital, blowing vuvuzelas and sounding car horns, despite earlier attempts by police to break up the march with batons and shields.\nThe police called on protesters to stop the situation from escalating, the Interfax news agency said, quoting an official statement.\n“If these demands are not fulfilled, the police has the right to take demonstrators into custody and to use force,” Interfax cited the statement as saying.\nIn a statement, the EU’s foreign policy arm called for more dialogue and a peaceful resolution.\n“All those who have been detained while exercising their fundamental right of assembly in accordance with the law must be released immediately,” it said.\n“It is of utmost importance that all parties involved show restraint and act responsibly.”\nParliament voted last Tuesday to allow Sarksyan to become prime minister, angering opposition leaders.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “I am telling you: you have no understanding of the situation in the country. The situation is different to the one you knew 15-20 days ago,” Pashinyan had told Sarksyan on Sunday.\n“The situation in Armenia has changed, you don’t have the power of which you are told. In Armenia, the power has passed to the people,” he said.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Maria Kiselyova/Polina Ivanova/Andrew Osborn; Editing by Keith Weir/David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T11:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T12:20:36.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
