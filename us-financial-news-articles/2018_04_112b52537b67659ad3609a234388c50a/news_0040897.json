If this change proves to be persistent, the key rate level envisaged by neutral monetary policy will be higher,” the central bank’s analysts said in a monthly report on economic trends.\nThe central bank has previously said it plans to lower its key rate to a “neutral” range of between 6-7 percent this year, down from a current level of 7.25 percent.\nThe analysts said inflationary risks had increased in April, in part because of geo-political tensions and a sharp weakening of the rouble, but inflation was only seen rising towards the central bank’s target of 4 percent in the second half of the year.
