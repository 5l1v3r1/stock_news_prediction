Paris sees in next year’s departure of Britain, the only state for which English is the official EU language, a chance for change.\nFrench officials speak of Brexit being a “catalyst” for a shift in the Brussels linguistic power balance, and President Emmanuel Macron - a fluent English speaker - has vowed to promote French, calling the rise of English “paradoxical” at a time when Britain is leaving the EU.\n(This story corrects paragraphs 2 and 3 to show meeting he left was not itself about the budget.)\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:18:08.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
