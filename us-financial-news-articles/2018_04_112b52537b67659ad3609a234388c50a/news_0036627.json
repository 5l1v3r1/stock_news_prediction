May was on stage as he spoke, having delivered her own speech just before. \nNamed after a ship that brought migrants from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean islands in 1948, the Windrush generation enjoyed a special status, but that has been eroded over the years by successive immigration reforms. “NATIONAL DISGRACE” \nAfter an outcry caused by coverage in British media of people who had lost jobs or been denied healthcare because of unwarranted doubts over their rights, the government set up a dedicated team at the interior ministry to solve cases.
