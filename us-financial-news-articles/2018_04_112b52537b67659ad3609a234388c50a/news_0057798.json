According to data from Astec Analytics, 7.7 percent of outstanding shares were out on loan as of the close of trading on April 25, a sign of investors holding short positions.\nUnderlying revenue in the networks division rose 8.5 percent to 153 million euros at constant exchange rates, helped in part by the SES-15 satellite entering into service. The mobility business was the stand-out performer in the division, with underlying revenue up 30.4 percent at 37.4 million euros, driven by strong demand from aeronautical service providers in North America.\nUnderlying revenue in the company’s core video business fell 3.6 percent at constant exchange rates, a smaller-than-expected fall helped by stability in the revenue of media service MX1 with new business in Europe offsetting non-renewals.\nThe company, which sees an “encouraging commercial pipeline” for its SES-9 and SES-10 satellites, said its financial outlook remained unchanged.\nReporting by Nolwenn Brossier in Gdynia, additional reporting by Alan Charlish; editing by Jason Neely and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:26:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
