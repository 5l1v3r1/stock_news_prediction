In general retail, they said “investors should buy online over offline, Europe over UK and brands over retailers”. \nDeutsche Bank shifted to a more positive view on general retail, arguing the strengthening of the pound would boost the European sector, which makes a quarter of its sales in Britain. \nInvestors favoured defensive stocks such as utilities, tobacco companies and telecoms, sought after in volatile markets due to their solid cash-flow and dividends. \nUnited Utilities, SSE and Centrica gained 1.3 to 2.3 percent. British American Tobacco was up 0.6 percent, while BT shares rose 1 percent. \nBecoming the latest investment house to be relatively more positive on British stocks, UBS closed its overweight in euro zone equities relative to UK equities on Friday. \n“Year-to-date euro zone equities have outperformed their UK counterparts by more than 4 percentage points, and we no longer see the catalysts for further outperformance,” wrote UBS Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele. \nOn Thursday Citi had upgraded UK equities to “overweight”, saying recent underperformance and cheap valuations made the market attractive.
