REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz The 15-member council met on Saturday, at Russia’s request, the fifth time it has met on Syria since a suspected deadly toxic gas attack in the Syrian town of Douma a week ago. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles overnight in retaliation, targeting Syria’s chemical weapons program.\n“Why didn’t you wait for the outcome of the investigation you called for?” Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said after the vote. He accused the United States, France and Britain of “demonstrating a blatant disregard for international law.”\n“I hope hot heads will cool down and that will be it,” he told reporters.\nInternational investigators from the global chemical weapons watchdog are in Syria and were due to start their inquiry on Saturday into the suspected toxic gas attack. Russia and Syria have said there was no evidence of a chemical weapons attack.\nThe United States, France and Britain defended their military action as legal during the Security Council meeting.\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres listens to members of the United Nations Security Council after voting against a Russian resolution condemning 'aggression' against Syria by the U.S. and its allies during an emergency meeting on Syria at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz “We are confident that we have crippled Syria’s chemical weapons program. We are prepared to sustain this pressure, if the Syrian regime is foolish enough to test our will,” U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said.\n“If the Syrian regime uses this poison gas again, the United States is locked and loaded,” Haley said.\nDuring an address to the Security Council, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all states “to show restraint in these dangerous circumstances and to avoid any acts that could escalate matters and worsen the suffering of the Syrian people.”\nEight countries voted against the Russian-drafted text on Saturday, while Peru, Kazakhstan, Ethiopia and Equatorial Guinea abstained. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.\nBashar Jaafari, permanent Representative of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United Nations, Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya and Sacha Llorenty, Permanent Representative of Bolivia to the United Nations talk at the end of the emergency United Nations Security Council meeting on Syria at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., April 14, 2018.

Russia vetoed a U.S. text, while two Russian-drafted resolutions failed to get a minimum nine votes to pass.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Jason Neely and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T21:51:21.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
