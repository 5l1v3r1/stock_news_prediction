Given that Brazil is a key exporter of soya beans, it could see its exports to China increasing.\nBrazilian election will bring volatility Brazil will elect a new government in October, at a time when several scandals have affected the image of many politicians. One of the main contenders, Lula da Silva, is currently in jail o corruption charges, although he denies any wrongdoing.\nGuardia told CNBC that the vote will bring some uncertainty, but the country remains committed to reforming its economy.\n\"This (election) can bring more volatility to the markets but my message is that Brazil is very well prepared to deal with this scenario,\" he said. \"We have strong international reserves, inflation under control and we are moving in the right direction with the right policies.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:48:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
