Barca, who drew 2-2 with Celta Vigo on Tuesday and are still unbeaten in the league, will clinch the title if they win their next league game away to Deportivo La Coruna on April 29. \n“We need to analyse what has happened and take steps to improve in our final few games because recently we have suffered a lot away from home,” said Atletico coach Diego Simeone, whose side have lost three of their last four away games in all competitions. \n“We had a bad first half and although we improved we couldn’t manage to score and Real Sociedad finished the game stronger than us and we have to congratulate them on the victory.” Reporting by Richard Martin, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T23:38:12.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
