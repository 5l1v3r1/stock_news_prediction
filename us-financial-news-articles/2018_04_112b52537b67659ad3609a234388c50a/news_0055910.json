Michael is a businessman. He’s got a business. He also practices law,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News. “And they’re looking at something having to do with his business. I have nothing to do with his business.”\nAsked how much legal work Cohen did for him, Trump said, “As a percentage of my overall legal work, a tiny, tiny little fraction.”\nTrump said Cohen represented him in the “crazy” Stormy Daniels case. She is an adult-film star who says she had a one-night stand with Trump in 2006. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels or any knowledge of a $130,000 payment made by Cohen to Daniels before the 2016 U.S. election.\nReporting by Doina Chiacu and Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T15:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:33:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
