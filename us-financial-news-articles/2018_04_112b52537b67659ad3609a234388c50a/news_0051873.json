Regional currencies and bonds hit multi-week lows and equities have weakened in the past few days as the U.S. 10-year yield reached four-year highs and the dollar firmed. Poland's 10-year government bond yield dropped four basis points to 3.078 percent on Thursday and its Romanian peer was bid lower by 4 basis points. Hungarian yields dropped 1-2 basis points ahead of the government's bi-weekly auctions, with 10-year papers trading at 2.55 percent. The Hungarian central bank's first comments since Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government party Fidesz got re-elected on April 8 confirmed that no change is expected in ultra-loose monetary policy, one Budapest-based fixed income trader said. Deputy Governor Marton Nagy told Reuters that the bank was relaxed about domestic inflation trends and was unlikely to start tightening up its easy monetary policy before the ECB begins raising rates. \"It is more likely that the NBH will take any steps only after the ECB moves,\" he said. The trader said the government was likely to sell bonds at the auction at the current or even lower yield levels after a rise in yields driven by U.S. Treasuries. \"Foreigners have no reason to sell. Short-term yields are near zero... and they lengthen their portfolio maturity if they can,\" the trader said. The ECB is unlikely to stir markets, although any remarks showing worry over a recent slowdown in European economies could weaken the euro against the dollar, market participants said. Central Europe's main currencies eased in tandem with the dollar's global gains in the past days, but the real cause of their weakening was the rise in U.S. debt yields, one Budapest-based currency dealer said. \"A further rise in dollar yields could weaken the forint further, but as I can see that does not continue,\" the dealer said. The forint was flat at 313.25 against the euro at 0808 GMT, still near the seven-week lows it set at 313.55 on Wednesday. The Czech crown and the zloty rebounded and gained about 0.1 percent. Remarks from the ECB concerning recent poor economic data \"could push EURUSD down and stronger dollar might still weigh on the zloty,\" Bank Zachodni WBK analysts said in a note. Regional equity indices mostly firmed. Bucharest's index, which has been buoyed by lucrative dividends, hit a new 10-year high. Czech broadcaster CME's shares gained more than 4 percent after it announced a new financing deal and a rise in core profits.
