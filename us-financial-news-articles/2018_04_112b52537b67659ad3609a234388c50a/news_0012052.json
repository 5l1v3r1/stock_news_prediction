Malik Monk added 21 points off the Charlotte bench.\nMarvin Williams’s 18 points, Nic Batum’s 11 points, Willy Hernangomez’s 11 points and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s 10 points weren’t enough to allow the Hornets to keep up.\nCharlotte guard Kemba Walker had his second outing with fewer than 10 points since becoming the franchise’s all-time leading scorer last week. He scored nine points on 4-of-11 shooting from the floor.\nChicago has reached a three-game winning streak only four times this season.\nThe Bulls made 15 of 34 attempts from 3-point range. They committed only eight turnovers compared to 20 for the Hornets.\nThe matchup between two teams out of playoff contention included some riveting moments. Chicago led 88-79 with 11 minutes remaining, but the Hornets pulled even less than 2 1/2 minutes later.\nCharlotte pulled within two points or one point of the lead six times in the final seven minutes.\nThe Bulls surged late in the second quarter for a 53-47 halftime lead.\nChicago closed the half on a 13-4 run, hitting three 3-pointers. Holiday and Portis sank long-range shots in the final minute.\nMarkkanen scored 18 first-half points on 6-for-10 shooting from the field.\nCharlotte was hurt by 11 first-half turnovers.\nBulls coach Fred Hoiberg was back on the bench just two days after missing a game because of illness.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:18:19.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
