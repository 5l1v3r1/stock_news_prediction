REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo\nGiving foreign financial firms a controlling stake in their China securities joint ventures is a key part of China’s pledge to ease foreign ownership curbs, especially in the country’s trillion-dollar financial sector.\nBut draft rules released for consultation last month by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) could have the opposite effect and stymie broadening participation, people with knowledge of the matter warned.\nUnder the proposed rules, controlling shareholders must have a net asset value (NAV) of at least 100 billion yuan ($16 billion), and non-financial Chinese investors would be limited to a one-third shareholding.\nIf the NAV rule applied to the Western banks’ local units, as opposed to the global entity, most international banks would be ruled out.

They said the final rules, expected to be announced by end June, could change to reflect their concerns.\nCSRC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nChina surprised bankers and lobbyists in November when it said foreign investment banks could raise stakes to 51 percent in their securities joint ventures, which offer underwriting and trading services, from a 49 percent cap.\nBanks including Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSG.S ) run joint ventures with varying degrees of operational control but all have pushed for majority ownership. In 2016, a lack of control was a factor in JPMorgan’s ( JPM.N ) decision to sell out of its joint venture.\n($1 = 6.3125 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee and Engen Tham; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Stephen Coates", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T09:50:01.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
