Most were stabbings. \nPrime Minister Theresa May - a former interior minister - has attracted criticism over the escalating crime wave, with the opposition Labour party blaming cuts in police numbers and probation services, which have been part of the Conservative government’s long-running austerity policies. \nThe Conservatives are set for their worst local election performance in London in decades, according to a YouGov poll in February ahead of the vote on May 3. \nBut the Mayor of London, Labour’s Sadiq Khan, has also faced calls to do more. The devolved London Assembly has asked him to appear at an urgent meeting next Wednesday to discuss the issue. \nLondon police chief Cressida Dick said that the recent rise in knife crime made her angry, but that London remained a safe city. \n“I am not happy about that, it is too much, but it is not this enormous epidemic that people are talking about,” Dick told the Evening Standard newspaper. \nVictims of Thursday’s stabbings included a 13 year old boy and three 15-year-old boys, two of whom were injured in the same incident. All the boys were in a stable condition, and across all the incidents there were no reported deaths.
