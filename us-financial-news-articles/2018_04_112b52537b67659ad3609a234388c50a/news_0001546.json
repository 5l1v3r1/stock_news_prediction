There were 17 abstentions among members of the organisation’s 41-member council, only 38 of whose members were present and eligible to vote on Wednesday. \nRussia’s ambassador to the OPCW, Aleksander Shulgin, confirmed that the vote had been lost. RUSSIA CALL TO SECURITY COUNCIL \nSeparately on Wednesday Russia requested a public meeting of the United Nations Security Council on April 5 to discuss the British accusations against Moscow, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nHe repeated that Russia had had nothing to do with the attack on the Skripals, which he said looked like “a terrorist attack.” \nBritain’s remarks were “a dirty flow of complete lies ... outright Russia-phobia,” he said. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday the OPCW should draw a line under a case that has triggered the worst crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War. \nScientists at the Porton Down biological and chemical weapons laboratory in England have concluded that the toxin was among a category of Soviet-era nerve agents called Novichok, though could not yet determine whether it was made in Russia. TAKING SAMPLES \nThe OPCW, which oversees the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, has taken samples from the site of the Salisbury attack and is expected to provide results from testing at two designated laboratories next week. \nShulgin said earlier that if Moscow was prevented from taking part in the testing of the Salisbury toxin samples, it would reject the outcome of the OPCW research. \nRussia’s request to open a parallel, joint Russian-British inquiry has been portrayed by Western powers as an attempt to undermine the investigation by OPCW scientists. \nThe EU said it was very concerned Moscow was considering rejecting the OPCW findings.

This is completely unacceptable,” an EU statement read to the council session said. \nSkripal, 66, a former Russian military intelligence officer who betrayed scores of Russian agents to Britain and was exchanged in a Russia-West spy swap, remains in a critical but stable condition. His daughter, Yulia, 33, has shown signs of improvement.
