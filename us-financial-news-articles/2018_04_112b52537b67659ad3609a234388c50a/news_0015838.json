That figure will rise to 30 percent with the expanded measures, the magazine said, without saying how many products they would affect.\nEdeka declined to comment on the letter on Friday. A spokesman for Nestle referred to comments the company’s Chief Executive Mark Schneider made to a newspaper last week, while declining to provide further information.\nSchneider had told Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview that Nestle was still negotiating with Agecore to end the spat and hoped to find a sensible solution.\n“This aggressive approach coordinated across Europe (of withdrawing products from supermarket shelves to enforce price reductions) is new, particularly in Switzerland,” Schneider said.
