REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo \nThe 500-kilogram British bomb was found during building work in central Berlin, and all buildings within an 800 metre radius will be evacuated from 9 am local time (0700 GMT), police said on Twitter. \nThe evacuation area includes the Natural History Museum. \nPolice spokesman Martin Halweg said it was not yet clear how long the evacuation would last or whether Tegel airport would be affected. \n“We have a defusal on this scale around once or twice a year in Berlin,” he said. \nOf the bomb itself, police said on Twitter: “It is safe - there is no immediate danger.” \nMore than seven decades after the end of World War Two, Germany still discovers more than 2,000 tonnes of live bombs and munitions every year. \nLast year some 60,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Frankfurt after a massive bomb dropped by Britain’s Royal Air Force was unearthed.
