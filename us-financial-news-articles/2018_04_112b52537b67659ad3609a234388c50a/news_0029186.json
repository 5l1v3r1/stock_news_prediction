The study found that 57% of the 5,855 Android apps analyzed could be at risk of illegally monitoring children’s behavior online. The federal law, 1998’s Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), mandates privacy and consent requirements for website operators catering to children under 13. \nThe study further found that 92% of the 1,280 Android apps that utilize Facebook’s application programming interface (API) are potentially in violation of COPPA. The report comes at a time when Facebook is under heavy scrutiny for its use and storage of users’ personal information and data.
