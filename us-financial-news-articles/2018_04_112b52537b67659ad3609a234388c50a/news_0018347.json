Most of the agreements are for at least three years. \nHydropothecary would be the biggest supplier, with a five-year agreement and agreed sales of 100,000 kg in the first three years. The province plans to open 20 government-run stores upon legalization. \nCanada’s senate is set for a final vote on legalizing marijuana on June 7, with sales expected to start in the fall. Provinces, including Quebec and Ontario, plan to open government-run stores, while others such as Alberta and Saskatchewan will allow private ones. British Columbia plans to have both.
