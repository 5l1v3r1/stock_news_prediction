In the meantime, it has been made clear that they don’t believe breaking up the group makes sense,” he said.\nWPP will on Monday publish first quarter results - its first set of numbers since Sorrell quit.\nReporting by James Davey; Editing by Andrew Heavens and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T19:06:15.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
