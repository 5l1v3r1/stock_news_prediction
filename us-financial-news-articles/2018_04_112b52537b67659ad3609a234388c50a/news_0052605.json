High dollar liquidity in the market (is) reducing demand,” said a trader from a commercial bank.\nZAMBIA The kwacha is expected to remain range-bound in the coming week due to rising dollar demand from importers even as supply from from companies settling month end dues increases.\nAt 1115 GMT on Thursday, commercial banks Quote: d the currency of Africa’s second-largest copper producer at 9.7000 per dollar, down from 9.5700 where it closed a week ago.\n“We could still see the kwacha continue on its losing path – even breaking into 9.700. The market, however, could swing in the other direction if supply improves,” the local unit of South Africa’s First National Bank (FNB) said in a note.
