This year it has raised 1.3 billion crowns in a share sale to ease its balance sheet.\nRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has often predicted Norwegian’s demise while others are still unsure whether long-haul can work without high paying business-class passengers up front.\n“Norwegian is in need of execution and capital, frankly, and maybe IAG can give that so it definitely on the face of it makes strategic sense for IAG,” Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said.\nOne industry source who has advised on major European airline deals in the past said Walsh would be unlikely to make a quick move, but would be more interested in the long-haul operation and the Norwegian brand.\nWith Norwegian’s large level of debt, Walsh may move to split up the airline in order to derisk it, such as seeking a buyer for the short-haul operations.\n“The ideal outcome here is that Willie buys it and carves it up and O’Leary buys the short-haul business off them,” he said.\nRyanair declined to comment when asked whether it was interested in Norwegian.\nJOSTLING The move on Norwegian continues a wave of consolidation that began last year, with Alitalia entering insolvency and the failures of Britain’s Monarch and Germany’s Air Berlin.\nAirline CEOs have repeatedly said more consolidation will come, whether via takeovers or failures, and easyJet and Lufthansa are currently jostling for Alitalia.\nThe assets of collapsed Monarch and Air Berlin, such as take-off and landing slots, planes and crews were keenly fought over last year by Lufthansa and easyJet, as well as IAG and Ryanair.\nHowever, a bidding battle is not expected for Norwegian, because of its shaky finances and because it may be hard to buy without paying a premium given that founder and CEO Bjorn Kjos controls almost 24 percent of the shares.\nThe airline failures last year already helped to ease pressure on ticket prices and the adviser said IAG buying Norwegian would be good for other airlines in Europe because it would remove a rival that was growing at a loss.\n“If Norwegian was part of IAG it would curb the growth rate that they are on because they are not making any money the way they are growing,” he said.
