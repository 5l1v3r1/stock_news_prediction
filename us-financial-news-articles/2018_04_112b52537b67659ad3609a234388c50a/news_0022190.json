Then, she was protesting common industry rules that force consumers to settle disputes with financial companies in arbitration rather than court. Smith was testifying about Equifax's massive data breach affecting more than 145 million people.\nZuckerberg is on Capitol Hill this week to answer questions about the data leak affecting 67 million Facebook users. Werner told CNBC in a direct message on Twitter that her costume was definitely drawing attention on the Hill, where a police officer told her to remove her headscarf.\nShe tweeted before and during the hearing.\nTweet \n\nTweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T23:26:49.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
