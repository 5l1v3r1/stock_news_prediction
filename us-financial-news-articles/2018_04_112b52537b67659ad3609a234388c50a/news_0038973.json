Last week, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, signed a package of bills that included a ban on bump stocks. A far-reaching school safety bill signed last month by Florida Gov. Rick Scott, also a Republican, included a bump stocks ban and was immediately met with a lawsuit by the National Rifle Association.\nAssociated Press Business Writer Matt Ott in Washington contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T22:57:38.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
