It evacuated its staff to the South Sudanese capital Juba.\nIn mid April, rebels said they had freed seven aid workers detained for nearly three weeks in Central Equatoria on accusations of spying for the government.\nAn aid worker was also killed when gunmen shot at his agency vehicle near the northern town of Bentiu.\nBoth rebels and government forces stand accused of targeting humanitarian workers and sometimes blocking access to relief and hijacking food and other aid.\nLam Paul Gabriel, rebel SPLA-IO deputy spokesman, said he had received reports of aid workers’ disappearance and his forces were investigating with their commander in the ground.\n“I am not denying or accepting that we are the ones responsible for this but we are investigating because that is our territory, but we should not ruled out the presence of other armed forces,” he said.\nHe said there were also a separate armed group called NASA, as well as government troops present in the area.\n“So until we get that report from the ground commander, we will not be able to confirm,” he said.\nReporting by Denis Dumo; Writing by George Obulutsa; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:02:02.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
