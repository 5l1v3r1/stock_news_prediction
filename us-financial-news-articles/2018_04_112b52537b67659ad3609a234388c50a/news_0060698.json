(NYSE: ATV) (\"Acorn\" or the \"Company\") consummated a share sale and purchase agreement with Hong Kong Red Star Macalline Universal Home Furnishings Limited (\"Red Star\") on April 27, 2018, in exchange for cash payment of approximately RMB360 million (US$57 million), subject to a post-closing working capital adjustment. The contract is subject to an approximately 12% purchase price holdback, which will be paid, netting out tax payables, after certain post-closing requirements are completed.\nPursuant to the terms of the share sale and purchase agreement, Red Star acquired 100% of the shares in our wholly-owned Hong Kong subsidiary Bright Rainbow Investments Limited, which owns Shanghai HJX Digital Technology Co., Ltd, which owns the land use rights to a plot of land in the Qingpu district of Shanghai with a total area of 76,799 square meters, along with the warehouse on that land plot.\nThe Company expects the net cash received from the transaction to be approximately RMB336 million (US$53 million) before taking into account the working capital adjustment. The Company expects to record an after-tax gain on the sale of approximately RMB232 million (US$36 million) related to the transaction. As of December 31, 2017 the carrying value of the property owned by Shanghai HJX Digital Technology Co., Ltd was approximately RMB107 million (US$17 million).\nCommenting on the transaction, Mr. Jacob A. Fisch, President and CEO of Acorn, said, \"This transaction is an important one for Acorn, as we continue to liquidate non-core assets, improve liquidity and strengthen our financial position. Following this transaction, we believe there is still significant untapped value on our balance sheet and in our brands. As we look to the future, we are seeking new business opportunities to increase our top line, exploring potential transactions to build scale, and considering other methods to maximize value for our shareholders.\"\nMr. Robert W. Roche, Executive Chairman of Acorn noted, \"This disposition of another non-core asset demonstrates our focus on creating additional liquidity and cash flow, and unlocking value on our balance sheet. Creating this liquidity provides us greater financial flexibility as we work on expanding our core business and pursuing other growth, including potential transformational, opportunities in the future.\"\nExplanatory Note\nTo implement the sale and purchase transaction, China DRTV, Inc., a company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (\"Seller\"), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acorn International, Inc.
