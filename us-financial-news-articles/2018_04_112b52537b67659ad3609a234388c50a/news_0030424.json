VW didn’t return calls seeking comment.\nGerman magazine Automobilwoche reported earlier on Saturday that Diess wants to become chairman of Audi, without citing the source of the information.\nThe supervisory board of Audi, the biggest profit engine at VW group, has traditionally been led by the VW group CEO.
