Soybean exporter Archer Daniels Midland Co was down 1.2 percent while another agribusiness Bunge Ltd fell 1 percent.\n“So the fear of this ‘dispute’ turning into an all-out ‘war’ is once again on the front burner,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.\nInvestors in U.S. technology companies were rattled since that sector has the biggest revenue exposure to China. Universal Display was down 3.7 percent. Apple Inc fell 1.6 percent.\nCar maker General Motors Co was down 1.8 percent while Ford Motor Co was off 2 percent and Tesla Inc fell 4.3 percent.\nChemical provider Chemours Co shed 2.9 percent while DowDuPont Inc dropped 3 percent.
