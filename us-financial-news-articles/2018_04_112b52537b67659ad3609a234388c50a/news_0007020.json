He later completed commercial lending and bank management education programs offered by both the Virginia Bankers Association and the American Bankers Association.\n“David has been with the Access National team from the start of his tremendous career journey, making him one of our ‘homegrown’ success stories here,” Mark Moore, President at Access National Bank, said.\nTalebian consistently ranks among the Bank’s top producers annually, with a portfolio comprising of commercial and industrial (C&I) financing, commercial real estate loans, and professional services for businesses typically with $5 million to $200 million in revenue.\nIn his role, Talebian will continue to serve in a leadership capacity with his team of commercial lenders. In addition, he will remain a primary player in corporate and leveraged finance sectors, medical services, government contracting sectors, and asset-based lending.\nHe will also support a wide range of essential corporate banking verticals for the Bank, and serve as a member of the Bank’s Executive Loan Committee.\n“David’s contributions and leadership have been impactful toward the growth and success of our company,” Moore said. “We are looking forward to his ongoing leadership to propel us to greater heights.”\nAccess National Bank was founded in 1999 by professional bankers and business people. It is an independent, nationally-chartered bank based in Reston, Virginia that serves the Greater Washington DC Metropolitan area.
