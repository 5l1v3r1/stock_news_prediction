Taxpayers should continue filing their tax returns as they normally would,” the statement said.\n“We are still assessing the underlying issue. All indications point to this being a hardware-related issue, not other factors,” the IRS said.\nAt this time of year, many people file their taxes through tax software programs, such as Turbo Tax, and the IRS said “these online payment options remain available for taxpayers through their software providers during this period.”\nDemocratic U.S. Representative Richard Neal, who called tax day “a stressful time for millions of Americans,” said the IRS should not penalize people who have been hampered in filing their returns because of the computer glitch.\nThe IRS said taxpayers could still request an extension, as President Donald Trump did. The White House said on Tuesday that Trump, because of the complexity of his tax returns, would file his by Oct. 15.
