Obviously, we would like to do it as fast as possible,” he added.\nSeadrill is already cooperating with Schlumberger in India to offer integrated services and may expand this to other locations and partners, although the company has no immediate consolidation plans.\n“Equally, we are in discussions with all major oil service companies, and if there are opportunities that makes sense for both of us, we will certainly entertain that,” Dibowitz said.
