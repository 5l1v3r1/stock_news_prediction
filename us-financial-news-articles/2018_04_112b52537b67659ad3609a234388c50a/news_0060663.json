When Modi took office in 2014, there were some 18,452 villages without electricity.\nBut just because all villages are connected to the grid does not mean all Indians have access to power.\nThe government considers a village electrified if it has basic electrical infrastructure and 10 percent of its households and public places including schools, local administrative offices and health centers have power.\nSome people, however, said on Twitter their villages had yet to be electrified despite the government’s claim.\n“No. Not every village yet,” said Twitter user Dilip Gupta, identifying his village in a district of Uttar Pradesh in the north. “Over the course of years my native place has been expecting electricity every year, but it hasn’t arrived yet.”\nThe World Bank said in a report last year that globally 1.06 billion people had no electricity, with India and Nigeria topping the list of most power-deficient countries.\nReporting by Swati BhatEditing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T18:30:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
