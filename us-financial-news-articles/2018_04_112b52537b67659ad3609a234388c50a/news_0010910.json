REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.25 percent. The index has spent the week swinging wildly in and out of negative territory amid the back-and-forth of the U.S.-China trade dispute. \nAustralian stocks slipped 0.35 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.15 percent. \nThe S&P 500 E-mini futures were down 1.2 percent , pointing to a lower start for Wall Street later in the session. \nThe Dow and the S&P 500 posted gains for a third day in a row on Thursday, the longest stretch of gains in about a month, as investor fears of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China abated, turning the focus to upcoming earnings. \nTrade tensions, however, returned to the fore after Trump said late on Thursday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, fuelling the trade dispute between the world’s two economic superpowers. \nTrump said in a statement the extra tariffs were being considered “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. trade measures.

It was up 0.8 percent on the week. \nThe dollar had risen to a one-month peak versus the yen, bolstered by Wall Street’s bounce on Thursday when the United States appeared to signal a willingness to resolve the trade dispute.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe yen, a perceived safe-haven currency, is often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. \nThe dollar dipped 0.15 percent to 0.9621 Swiss franc, another safe-haven currency. \nThe euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2248 . \nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.1 percent at 90.359. The index has risen 0.4 percent this week. \nTreasury debt prices gained and yields declined as investors sought the safety of government bonds. \nThe 10-year Treasury note yield fell 2 basis points to 2.811 percent, pulling back from Thursday’s nine-day high of 2.838 percent. \nCrude oil prices fell as risk aversion gripped the broader markets. \nU.S. crude slipped 0.6 percent to $63.14 a barrel and Brent was down 0.55 percent at $67.94 a barrel. Oil had gained on Thursday, helped by higher equities and Saudi Arabia’s unexpected hike in crude prices. \nBeyond the trade turmoil, financial markets are focused on Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls report, which could determine the pace of future Federal Reserve interest rate rises and consequently the dollar outlook. \nThe U.S. March employment report is expected to show non-farm payroll growth of 193,000 jobs versus 313,000 in the prior month, according to the latest Thomson Reuters poll of economists. The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 4.0 percent from 4.1 percent in February.
