They account for 95 percent of its total exports and 60 percent of the state budget.\nOuyahia also confirmed he will not run in next year’s presidential election as speculation grows that veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, 81, will seek a fifth term.\nBouteflika, in office sine 1999, has largely disappeared from public view since a stroke in 2013.\n“We can only be proud if the president decides to run,” Ouyahia said.\nIn a possible sign that authorities are paving the way for a fifth term, Ouyahia — leader of the pro-government National Rally for Democracy (RND) party — said a campaign will be launched to showcase the president’s achievements.\n“It is important ... to show where the $1,000 billion (in energy revenues) were spent during four terms,” Ouyahia said.\nBouteflika can also count on the support of the ruling party FLN, and thousands of former fighters who have accepted a partial amnesty offer to lay down arms ending civil war with Islamists in the 1990s.
