File photo: A worker uses the tapping process to separate nickel ore from other elements at a nickel processing plant in Sorowako, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. REUTERS/Yusuf Ahmad \nWith Russian aluminium producer Rusal imploding in the wake of U.S. sanctions against its oligarch owner Oleg Deripaska, attention is now turning to the status of another Russian industrial powerhouse, Norilsk Nickel. \nDeripaska is a 27.8 percent shareholder in Norilsk, while the oligarch behind the world’s number two nickel producer, Vladimir Potanin, is himself on a U.S. Treasury Department list of Russians deemed to be close to the Kremlin. \nFears that Norilsk might follow Rusal down the U.S. sanctions path have sent London nickel prices on an extraordinary rollercoaster ride. \nBut this was a market primed for an explosive breakout, with all sorts of technical drivers kicking in once it started rallying. \nRight now there is no imminent danger of Norilsk being pulled into the Rusal sanctions and the speculative froth is already blowing off an overheated market. \nBut nickel’s shake, rattle and roll is a sign of changing times. \nIndustrial metal markets have spent the past decade tracking the shifting policies of just one country, China. \nThe eruption of U.S. policy risk and global geopolitical risk injects something completely new and different into market calculations. \nAs nickel shows, pricing this changed landscape is still very much a chaotic work in progress. COLLATERAL DAMAGE \nThere is no compelling evidence that the U.S. sanctions on Deripaska and his aluminium empire are going to affect Norilsk. \nDeripaska’s stake is below the 50 percent threshold over which sanctions can leap from targeted entity to secondary entity. \nIt is also worth remembering that Deripaska’s relations with Potanin are distinctly frosty. The two oligarchs have been locked in an acrimonious stand-off ever since Deripaska scooped up his holding in Norilsk during the global financial crisis. \nAnd while Potanin does appear on the Treasury’s “Putin List”, released in January this year, so do 209 other Russians. \nOnly seven were designated in the April 6 sanctions and the U.S. government has signalled it is not planning any imminent new sanctions. \nNorilsk is also a different beast from Rusal. As well as looming large in global nickel production terms, it is also big supplier of copper and cobalt. \nMost importantly, however, it is the world’s No.1 supplier of palladium to automotive manufacturers who use the metal in catalytic converters. \nThat includes U.S. auto companies. North American and Latin American customers accounted for $807 million, or 34 percent, of Norilsk’s palladium sales in 2016. \nHitting Norilsk with the sort of draconian sanctions unleashed on Rusal risks massive collateral damage. The United States has only one major palladium mine, Stillwater in Montana, which would be unable to full any sanctions-induced supply gap. \nThe Rusal sanctions, by contrast, dovetail with the U.S. administration’s aluminium tariffs, aimed at encouraging the restart of idled production capacity. \nGraphic on LME nickel price and volumes: tmsnrt.rs/2J9n0Yi A PRIMED MARKET \nSuch details have been lost in the speculative heat of the past couple of days. \nFanning the flames further were rumours that the London Metal Exchange (LME) was delisting Norilsk brands. \nHowever, unlike the emergency suspension of Rusal brands, this is old news, originally announced in August 2016. \nThe brands are being removed because Norilsk has decommissioned the plant that produced them. Most of the Russian metal in LME warehouses has long since set sail for China. \nNone of which seemed to matter as the LME nickel price exploded to a three-year high of $16,690 a tonne on Thursday, registering its widest intraday range since 2011 in the process. \nThis, though, was a market primed for a bull breakout. Sanctions fever just gave it the impetus to do so. \nOn the back of production cuts from Brazil’s Vale, the world’s largest producer, exchange stocks have been sliding and LME nickel this week started to nudge up against the February high of $14,420, a red-flag target for technical players. \nUnsurprisingly, when that level was breached on Wednesday, speculative buyers surged into the market, evidenced by massive volumes. \nSo too did Chinese speculators. Volumes on the Shanghai Future Exchange’s (ShFE) nickel contract hit a record 2.693 million contracts on Thursday. \nShFE moved quickly to douse the fires with an increase to the intraday margin, a tried and tested way of dispersing the speculative crowds, Chinese style. \nMeanwhile, exacerbating the ferocity of the move on the London market was hedging against shorts in the options market. \nThe wild rally sent the nickel price crashing through layers of call option positions. These confer the right to buy, which is nice for the buyer in such a fast-moving rally but a major hedging headache for the seller. \nSome 50,000 tonnes of call option positions, spread across the front three months and concentrated on the $15,000 strike, were put into play in the space of 24 hours. Those short of the options were forced to buy the underlying nickel contract, adding to the frenzy. \nAnd they were forced to sell it all back when the market went into sharp reverse yesterday afternoon. \nNickel has this morning touched a low of $14,530, close to where it started the week. \nThe speculative bubble has burst as the market realises that Norilsk is in the clear for now. EXPANDED RISK HORIZONS \nThe emphasis, howevber, is on those last two words. \nWhile Norilsk’s Potanin isn’t facing imminent sanctions, it is no longer inconceivable that he won’t at some stage if U.S.-Russian relations deteriorate further. \nThis is the true psychological shock of the sanctions against Rusal. \nNo one saw them coming because no one could conceive of such a large international supplier of aluminium being locked out of the U.S. dollar system. \nAnd now we all can, as each day bring fresh news of Rusal’s own collapsing supply chain. \nFor at least a decade industrial metal markets have only bothered tracking one country’s policy. \nChina has so dominated the landscape that the markets have increasingly focused almost exclusively on policymaking in Beijing with the prism set to pick up shifts in economic, industrial and, increasingly, environmental thinking. \nU.S. sanctions on Russia require an expansion of risk horizons and, quite possibly, a repricing of Russian risk on certain specific commodities. Such as nickel. \nThis week’s wild gyrations suggest the process has only just started. \nThe opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.
