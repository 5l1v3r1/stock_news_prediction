But under his tenure the German lender has struggled to make a profit, reporting its third consecutive annual loss in 2017.\nInvestors have punished Deutsche Bank with shares down over 27 percent in the last year.\nDeutsche Bank has been weighing a few options for a new CEO, even approaching Goldman Sachs international chief Richard Gnodde to ask if he would be interested in taking the helm, CNBC reported last month .\nSewing is currently the German lender's co-deputy chief executive officer and co-head of the private and commercial bank. He has been on the management board of the bank since January 2015.\nThe 47-year-old has worked at Deutsche Bank since 1989 in areas including audit and risk. He has worked in Frankfurt, London, Singapore, Tokyo and Toronto.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T15:54:06.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
