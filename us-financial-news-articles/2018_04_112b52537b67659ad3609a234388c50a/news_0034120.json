It’s the matter of markets finally having attention drawn away from the political (news).”\nAnalysts expect profit at the S&P 500 companies to rise 18.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 8:31 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 216 points, or 0.88 percent, S&P 500 e-minis were up 16.25 points, or 0.61 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 42.5 points, or 0.63 percent.\nUnitedHealth rose 2.3 percent after the largest U.S. health insurer raised its earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates.\nJ&J rose 0.75 percent after reporting a better-than-expected profit and raising its full-year sales forecast, helped by growing demand for its cancer drugs.\nThe earnings season has helped take away some focus from geopolitical and trade concerns, which have roiled the markets in the recent months.\nStill, U.S.-China trade issues continue to simmer. China moved to slap a hefty temporary deposit on imports of U.S. sorghum in a preliminary antidumping ruling.\nShares of Archer Daniel, a top seller of U.S. sorghum into China, was down 0.9 percent.\nA U.S.-led attack on Syria over the weekend has so far not prompted any military retaliation from Russia, easing fears over the conflict escalating.
