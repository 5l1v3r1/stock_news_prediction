(NASDAQ:AQMS) (“Aqua Metals” or the “Company”), which is commercializing an electrochemical lead recycling technology called AquaRefining™, today announced executive management changes under its previously announced succession plan and notable enhancements to the structure of its Corporate Governance.\nExecutive Management Succession\nThe Board has named Company co-founder and current COO Selwyn Mould as interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately, replacing founder Stephen Clarke who resigned as CEO of the Company as part of a previously announced succession plan. Mr. Clarke has also resigned as Chairman of the Board and Director. Mr. Mould has assumed the interim CEO position pending completion of the permanent CEO search currently underway. During this time, he will continue in his role as COO.\nAs Interim CEO, Mr. Mould brings 35 years of experience in manufacturing, supply chain and technology development. As COO, he leads the Company’s operations including its AquaRefinery operation. Prior to Aqua Metals, Mr. Mould served as Head of Supply Chain for Lotus Cars and Head of Logistics for Pilkington Building Products Europe.\n“I’m excited and honored to lead Aqua Metals in the next phase of the Company’s operations,” Mr. Mould said. “As a team, our top priority is scaling operations at our plant in McCarran, NV. Completing the commercialization of the Company’s revolutionary technology has been my focus for the past four years and will continue to be as I lead the Company during this period.”\nMr. Mould continued, “We thank Steve for his exceptional vision and tireless commitment to the Company. He built a solid foundation that ensures the Company will be well-positioned for future growth. Steve has agreed to remain involved in the company as a consultant and we value his continuing input and recommendations. We wish him well in the future.”\nBoard Enhancements\nThe Nominating Governance Committee has recommended, and the full board has agreed, to separate the roles of CEO and Board Chairman. The Company believes this will create significant improvements in corporate governance and organizational leadership. Independent Director Vincent L. DiVito has been elected by the Board to be non-executive Chairman. Mr. DiVito is the owner and chief executive officer of a financial and management consulting firm and has had over 25 years in senior financial and executive management positions. Most recently at a global life science and specialty chemical company. Mr. DiVito has served on four U.S. listed company boards and is a National Association of Corporate Directors Board Leadership Fellow.\nIn addition, Aqua Metals Board of Directors has elected Eric Prouty, an experienced sustainability-focused analyst and successful business development consultant, as an independent director. In addition to his valuable public company board experience, including as a director of Hudson Technologies (NASDAQ:HDSN), Mr. Prouty has significant experience as an equity research analyst covering the sustainability sector, including at Canaccord Genuity, Adams Harkness and Robertson Stephens. Mr. Prouty adds a strong investor focus to the Board, and his background and analytical skills will be extremely valuable as we pursue the commercialization opportunities of the AquaRefining™ technology.\nAs previously announced, the Company has nominated Thomas Murphy, Vincent DiVito, Eric Prouty, Mark Slade and Mark Stevenson, for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. The Company believes this slate of five director nominees is an exceptionally qualified team of leaders that brings extensive relevant experience and industry contacts to lead the Company through the next pivotal phase of growth and development.\nThe Board recommends that shareholders vote FOR each of its five (5) director nominees named in the GOLD proxy card. Shareholders may receive solicitation materials, including a white proxy card, from Kanen Wealth Management (“Kanen”) seeking their proxy. The Aqua Metals Board has not approved or nominated, and does NOT endorse, any of Kanen’s insurgent director nominees. We strongly urge shareholders not to return any white proxy card sent by Kanen.\nIf you have already voted using a white proxy card sent to you by Kanen, you can revoke that proxy by voting FOR your Board’s nominees named in the Company’s proxy statement by using the GOLD proxy card. Only the latest-dated and validly executed proxy that you submit will count at the Annual Meeting.\nAbout Aqua Metals\nAqua Metals, Inc.
