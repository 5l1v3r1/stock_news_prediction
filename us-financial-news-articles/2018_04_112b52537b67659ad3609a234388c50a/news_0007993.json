TEMPLATE OUT Sinan Narin, 46, of McLean, Virginia, and Eyup Yildirim, 51, of Manchester, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a street brawl outside the Turkish ambassador’s residence that included members of Erdogan’s security detail. Narin and Yildirim are both U.S. citizens. \nThe May 2017 melee was condemned by U.S. and Washington city officials and strained relations between Turkey and the United States. \nNarin and Yildirim were sentenced to 12 months and a day in jail, with credit for time served after they were arrested in June, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office said in an email. \nThey also will undergo three years of supervised release once their sentences are completed. \nNarin and Yildirim pleaded guilty in December to one count of felony assault for attacking anti-Erdogan protesters during the president’s visit. \nYildirim kicked a 61-year-old protester in the head and face, causing the man to suffer a concussion and memory loss, according to the sentencing memorandum, while Narin kicked a woman who had fallen, briefly knocking her out. \nFederal prosecutors have dismissed charges against 11 of 15 members of Erdogan’s security team who were indicted over the brawl. Assault charges are pending against two Canadian citizens. \nTurkey blamed the melee on demonstrators linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party, while Washington’s police chief referred to it as a “brutal attack” on peaceful protesters. \nTurkey has been waging a war for decades against the banned party, also known as the PKK, in the country’s mainly Kurdish southeast. \nReporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:44:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
