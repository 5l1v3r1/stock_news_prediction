In such patients, TRK genes abnormally attach to other genes, triggering accelerated cancer cell growth. \nWall Street analysts expect U.S. approval for larotrectinib this year and forecast annual sales of $500 million to $1 billion. \nThe deal will result in a sequencing-based companion diagnostic with a pan-cancer indication, the companies said. \nA companion diagnostic is a medical device that provides information essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. \nUp to 5,000 U.S. patients a year are diagnosed with the TRK defect. Comprehensive genetic testing can detect TRK fusion and more specific tests are being developed.
