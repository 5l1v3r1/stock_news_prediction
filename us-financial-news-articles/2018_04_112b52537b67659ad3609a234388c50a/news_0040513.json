WTI is set for its second weekly gain, climbing more than 1 percent this week, while Brent is also poised to rise for a second week, adding around 1.5 percent.\nTraders said Friday's dips were the result of profit-taking following Thursday's multi-year highs.\nOil prices have been buoyed by a gradually tightening market.\nLed by top exporter Saudi Arabia, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has been withholding production since 2017 to draw down a global supply overhang that had depressed crude prices between 2014 and 2016.\n\"Commercial inventories in the OECD are now essentially at their 5-year average, and drawdowns likely accelerate as refineries emerge from maintenance ahead of peak seasonal demand,\" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.\n\"OECD commercial inventories could fall back to ... a level not seen since the oil price collapse that began in 3Q14. On a day of forward demand basis, we believe cover could drop below 57 days later this year, a level last seen in 2011,\" it added.\nThe tighter oil market is feeding into refined products.\n\"Signs of tightness are emerging in product markets as stocks saw the largest week-on-week draw since October, 2016 ... The U.S. led the draws but was also aided by draws in Singapore,\" said U.S. bank Morgan Stanley.\nThis tightness is also a result of healthy oil demand.\n\"Global oil demand data so far in 2018 has come in line with our optimistic expectations, with 1Q18 likely to post the strongest year-on-year growth since 4Q10 at 2.55 million barrels per day,\" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note published late on Thursday.\nBeyond OPEC's supply management, crude prices have also been supported by an expectation that the United States will re-introduce sanctions on OPEC-member Iran.\n\"The first key geopolitical issue is the expiration of the current U.S. waiver of key sanctions against Iran,\" said Standard Chartered Bank in a note this week, referring to a deadline on May 12 when U.S. President Donald Trump will decide whether or not to re-impose sanctions.\nOne factor that could start weighing on prices is rising U.S. production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which has jumped by a quarter since the middle of 2016 to 10.54 million barrels per day (bpd), making the United States the world's second-biggest producer of crude oil behind only Russia, which pumps almost 11 million bpd.
