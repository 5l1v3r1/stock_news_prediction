REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/File Photo\nWashington this month imposed sanctions on billionaire Oleg Deripaska and several companies in which he is a large shareholder, including Rusal, in response to what the United States called Russia’s “malign activities.”\nTwo sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that Rusal would soon appoint a fully independent board that in turn would install a new management team in the hope that the United States would remove the firm from its sanctions list.\n“Rusal is in touch with U.S. authorities and hopes the measure will be enough for them to be removed from the sanctions list,” one of the sources said.\nRusal declined to comment.\nBy adding Deripaska’s businesses to its Specially Designated Nationals blacklist – the first time Washington had done so with a publicly listed Russian firm - the United States effectively choked off their access to the international financial system.\nRusal, the largest part of Deripaska’s empire and the world’s biggest aluminum producer outside China, has seen customers stop buying its aluminum and creditors scramble to offload debt.\nHong Kong-listed Rusal lost almost 60 percent of its share value after the imposition of sanctions, while aluminum and alumina prices soared, hitting businesses around the world, including in the United States.\nEarlier this week, the United States moved to ease some of the measures against Rusal, saying it did not want to hit “the hardworking people who depend on Rusal” and that it could remove Rusal from the list if Deripaska ceded control. DERIPASKA STAKE\nThe two sources added that Rusal hoped Deripaska could keep his stake in the firm at the current 48 percent under any arrangement with U.S. authorities.\n“Forty-eight percent is not a controlling stake of 50 percent, which under the U.S. rules triggers the sanctions,” one of the sources said.\nThe changes in the board of directors and management team are being discussed with other shareholders, another source said. Rusal’s other shareholder, Viktor Vekselberg, was also put on the sanctions list.\nHowever, if this option does not work out, Rusal will be forced to focus exclusively on the domestic market and sell part of its production to a state stockpile, the source said.\n“Up to 2 million tonnes will be processed internally and meet the needs of the military-industrial complex,” the source said.\n“In this case, Rusal would leave the global market, and of course no one wants this to happen,” the source added.\nRusal declined to comment.\nAccording to the first source, Rusal is not shipping aluminum to customers around the world who are now awaiting guidance from U.S. authorities.\n“Rusal needs clarity from OFAC before it can resume those shipments,” the source said, referring to the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury, which enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals.\nAluminium prices in London fell on the news of the potential board reshuffle and were down 1.6 percent to $2,239 per tonne by 1325 GMT.
