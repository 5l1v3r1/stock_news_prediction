The company, however, said property transaction volumes in China were expected to be subdued this year on the back of government-imposed cooling measures.\nRevenue from its offshore and marine division, which builds offshore drilling rigs and support vessels, fell 31 percent to S$332 million. Still, orders have been slowly picking up after slumping for two years on lower oil prices and an oversupply of rigs.\nKeppel said its order book stood at S$4.3 billion at end-March versus S$3.9 billion at end-2017, excluding orders from Sete Brasil Participacoes SA, a Brazilian client that filed for bankruptcy protection.\nDeals signed during the quarter included one with Awilco Drilling for a mid-water harsh environment rig worth $425 million, which is due for completion in 2021.\nKeppel was seeing increasing confidence in its offshore and marine business, underpinned by rising oil prices, Chief Executive Loh Chin Hua said.\n“While there are pockets of opportunities in niche markets, it may take some time before we can see sustained recovery across the board,” Loh said, adding the offshore and marine business was considering an expansion into renewable energy.\nSmaller competitor Sembcorp Marine reports its results next week.\n$1 = 1.3095 Singapore dollars Reporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:22:26.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
