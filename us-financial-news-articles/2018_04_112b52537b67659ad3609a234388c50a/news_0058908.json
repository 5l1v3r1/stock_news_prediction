It was previously at a 6-week high of 0.655 percent on Tuesday.\nGerman Bund yields are set for this biggest weekly fall in four weeks, according to Reuters data.\nLater on Friday, the European Commission’s business and consumer confidence data is due, while the U.S. government will offer its initial snapshot of first quarter U.S. gross domestic product, which analysts polled by Reuters say likely grew at a 2.0 percent annualised pace. This was slower than the 2.9 percent rate set in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nECB policymakers Yves Mersch and Sabine Lautenschlaeger are due to give speeches at a conference.\nBank of England Governor Mark Carney and Chief Economist Andy Haldane are also due to speak in London.\nAlso on Friday, Italy plans to sell BTP bonds maturing in 2023 and 2028 for up to 5.75 billion. It will also auction up to 3.5 billion euros in CCTeu bonds due in 2025.\nReporting by Fanny Potkin, additional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr"], "published": "2018-04-27T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:40:01.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
