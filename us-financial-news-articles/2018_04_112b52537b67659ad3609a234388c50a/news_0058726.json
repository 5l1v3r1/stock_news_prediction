We still believe in a rate hike and see sterling supported in the next few weeks.”\nThe pound fell 0.2 percent to $1.3948 as the dollar gained across most major currencies.\nSterling remains more than four cents off its post-Brexit vote highs of $1.4377 hit last week.\nAgainst the euro, which some analysts say is currently a better gauge of demand for pounds given there has been considerable dollar-specific news this week, sterling gained 0.1 percent to 87.425 pence per euro.
