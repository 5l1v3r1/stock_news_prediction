Also erased from memory was last year’s DUI arrest that produced a droopy-eyed booking photo. \nAnd the fact that Woods began his round 18 shots behind overnight leader Patrick Reed was also not enough to spoil the party for the former world number one’s supporters. \nInstead, patrons were focused only on jockeying for position with hopes of getting up close with Woods. \n“For some reason when you are front row in front of Tiger Woods... you don’t even want to look at him because you are so scared,” Patrick Keim, a 22-year-old student from Auburn, Alabama, told Reuters as Woods made a par putt at the par-three sixth hole. \n“The intimidation and the intensity is undeniable.” \nEver the competitor, Woods was still intent on making a move up the scoreboard and did post his lowest score of the week — a three-under 69. \nWhile not able to consistently produce the type of shots he once conjured on command, Woods twice triggered loud roars of old when he nearly aced the par-three fourth and then again at the par-five 15th when his second shot stopped 29 feet from the pin before he converted the eagle putt. \nThe way Woods, a 79-times winner on the PGA Tour, tamed what was one of the most difficult holes all week is why some of his supporters feel the greatest golfer of his generation is far from done. \n“It’s positive what he’s doing,” Ryan Godsey, a 41-year-old teacher from Greenville, South Carolina, said as Woods made birdie at the par-three fourth. “He will win again, it’s just a matter of time.” (Reporting by Frank Pingue, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T02:57:16.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
