(\"FitLife\") (OTC:PINK – FTLF), an international provider of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health-conscious consumers marketed under the brand names NDS Nutrition Products™ (\"NDS\") ( www.ndsnutrition.com ), PMD ® ( www.pmdsports.com ), SirenLabs ® ( www.sirenlabs.com ), CoreActive ® ( www.coreactivenutrition.com ), Metis Nutrition™ ( www.metisnutrition.com ), iSatori™ ( www.isatori.com ), Energize ( www.tryenergize.com ), and BioGenetic Laboratories, ( www.biogeneticlabs.com ), announces results for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights for the full year ended December 31, 2017 include:\nTotal revenue declined $7.5 million, or 29.7%, to $17.8 million from $25.3 million Core FitLife revenue decreased 25.0% to $13.7 million from $18.3 million iSatori revenue decreased 41.9% to $4.1 million from $7.1 million The Company wrote off all remaining goodwill and intangible assets totaling $5.9 million related to the iSatori acquisition and established $1.1 million of reserves for potential sales returns primarily related to iSatori products Inclusive of the write offs and establishment of reserves, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.8 million as compared to net income of $0.4 million for the prior year Cash provided by operating activities was $0.7 million as compared to $0.0 million for the prior year Total cash at year end was $1.3 million, which was essentially equivalent to the prior year The Company entered into a merchant agreement with BBVA Compass Bank in December 2017, which enabled the Company to pay off all amounts owed US Bank in January 2018, leaving the Company debt-free\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue was $17.9 million versus $25.3 million in 2016. Core FitLife revenue for 2017 was $13.7 million compared to $18.3 million a year ago. The decline was primarily attributable several trends and developments with our largest customer including reduced foot traffic and lower overall store count which in turn disrupted inventory replenishment and purchasing patterns. Revenue for the iSatori division for 2017 was $4.1 million versus $7.1 million for the prior year. The decline at iSatori was primarily attributable to fewer new product introductions as well as the restructuring of its largest third-party distributor.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.8 million as compared to net income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Results from operations during the year ended December 31, 2017 included $8.7 million in charges that management believes are non-recurring including, but not limited to, impairment of $5.9 million of intangible assets, establishment of more than $1 million in sales return reserves and fulfillment of a margin support agreement during the year with our largest customer. Reconciling for such items believed by management to be non-cash and/or non-recurring, comparable adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was negative $0.4 million as compared to positive $1.2 million for the comparable period last year.\n“This last year posed a series of significant challenges to our business, and we are obviously very disappointed in our 2017 year-end financial results. That said, there are a number of noteworthy trends and developments that, we believe, will positively impact the business going forward as we strive to return to profitability and create shareholder value in 2018 and beyond,” said Dayton Judd, Interim CEO of FitLife Brands. “We are already beginning to see benefits from the improving financial condition of our largest customer, and look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with them in support of our mutual best interests. We remain committed to providing innovative, exclusive products to GNC franchisees. We are also exploring opportunities for growth in new channels. Moreover, our new relationship with BBVA Compass Bank has provided both stability and improved access to capital. Subsequent to year-end, the Company successfully employed its new facility with BBVA to repay all outstanding obligations to US Bank, leaving the Company debt-free,” concluded Mr. Judd.\nAbout FitLife Brands\nFitLife Brands is a marketer and manufacturer of innovative and proprietary nutritional supplements for health-conscious consumers.
