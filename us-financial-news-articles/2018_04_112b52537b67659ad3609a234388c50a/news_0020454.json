The situation around them looks more and more like a forceful detention or imprisonment.” A sign towards Salisbury District Hospital is seen after Yulia Skripal was discharged, in Salisbury, Britain, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nYulia Skripal was discharged from a hospital in the English city of Salisbury on Monday, where, she said, she was treated “ with obvious clinical expertise and with such kindness”. \nSkripal said she was not yet strong enough to give a media interview and she said comments made by her cousin to Russian media were not her’s nor those of her father. \n“I thank my cousin Viktoria for her concern for us, but ask that she does not visit me or try to contact me for the time being,” the statement quoted her as saying. \nThe Skripals were in a critical condition for weeks after the March 4 attack before their health improved. \nSergei Skripal, who was recruited by Britain’s MI6, was arrested for treason in Moscow in 2004. He ended up in Britain after being swapped in 2010 for Russian spies caught in the United States. \nBritain accused Russia of being behind the nerve agent attack and Western governments including the United States expelled more than 100 Russian diplomats. Russia has denied any involvement in the poisoning and retaliated in kind.
