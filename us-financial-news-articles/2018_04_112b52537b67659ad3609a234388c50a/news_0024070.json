U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani (not pictured) at the White House in Washington D.C., U.S. April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria \n“Never said when an attack on Syria would take place,” Trump wrote on Twitter. \nTrump had vowed to take swift and decisive action against Syria since reports of a suspected poison gas attack that killed dozens of people. Damascus has denied responsibility for the incident that has widened a rift between the West and Moscow, which backs Syria’s government. \nOn Wednesday, even though Trump had previously said he would not “broadcast” his moves in Syria, he said in a post on Twitter that missiles “will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’” \nHowever, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis struck a more cautious tone later on Wednesday, saying that Washington was still assessing intelligence on the suspected toxic gas attack.
