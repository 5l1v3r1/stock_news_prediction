CEO Walt Bettinger said, “Our contemporary full-service model continues to build stronger client relationships and drive record growth, even during times of market uncertainty. In the first quarter, investors experienced sharp market swings after nine consecutive quarters of positive S&P 500 ® returns. Amidst the volatility, client interactions surged as we offered the insight and assistance they expect – call volumes and web logins from both our retail and independent advisor clients were up nearly 20% and 50% from their respective quarterly averages. Engagement remained strong during the quarter, with trading activity rising nearly 40% year-over-year to a new all-time high and clients continuing to be net buyers of securities. New accounts totaled 443,000 company-wide – the highest quarterly level in 18 years. In addition, households new to our Retail business rose 42% versus the first quarter of 2017. Excluding planned mutual fund clearing outflows of $84.4 billion, our clients entrusted us with record quarterly core net new assets of $65.6 billion, implying an annualized growth rate of 7.8% – a level not seen since 2008. This strength in asset gathering spanned our largest businesses, as Advisor Services and Retail both set new records, with inflows up 27% and 64%, respectively, from last year. Our outstanding organic growth helped to partially offset market declines, and we ended the quarter serving $3.31 trillion in client assets, up 13% from last year, across 11.0 million active brokerage accounts, 1.2 million banking accounts, and 1.6 million retirement plan participants.”\nMr. Bettinger continued, “Operating ‘through clients’ eyes’ remains central to serving our current clients and fueling growth. Every day we ask ourselves how we can better support our clients, improve the value we offer, and make it simpler and easier to do business with us. We were recently honored as the ‘Highest in Investor Satisfaction with Full Service Brokerage Firms’ by J.D. Power* for the third consecutive year, demonstrating the importance of our broad capabilities, which include an extensive array of advice solutions. Total assets receiving ongoing advice continued growing faster than client assets overall, totaling $1.72 trillion at March 31 st . The first quarter marked three years since the launch of Schwab Intelligent Portfolios ® and one year since the introduction of Schwab Intelligent Advisory ® – which, combined with Institutional Intelligent Portfolios ® , reached $30.6 billion in total digital advisory solution assets at quarter-end, up 92% year-over-year. Also this quarter, we passed an important milestone for Schwab ETF OneSource ™ . Launched five years ago, this program, which offers Schwab clients online commission-free ETFs, has more than doubled in scope to 254 ETFs spanning 69 Morningstar categories and now has over $130 billion in assets. Additionally, we initiated a ‘Sweep Tower’ for uninvested cash, offering eligible clients extended FDIC insurance of up to $500,000**. This enhancement broadens Schwab’s range of cash solutions for our clients, which provide smart features, competitive yields, and transparency that helps investors make informed decisions. In early April, we improved our futures trading capabilities, which now include contingent orders, trade calculators, education, and research, all at a lower per contract cost of $1.50. We are better positioned than ever to attract and serve a growing share of U.S. investable wealth by offering a ‘no trade-offs’ combination of quality service, advice, and innovative products at a great value – all while leveraging our scale to operate efficiently and profitably.”\nCFO Peter Crawford commented, “We’ve achieved another quarter of record financial performance, driven in part by sustained business momentum, higher interest rates, and lower corporate taxes. Net interest revenue grew 26% to a record $1.3 billion due to larger client cash sweep balances as well as the impact of the Fed’s 2017 and March 2018 rate hikes – our net interest margin expanded to 2.12%, up from 1.87% a year earlier. Asset management and administration fees increased 3% to $851 million due to growing balances in advised solutions, equity and bond funds, and ETFs, partially offset by lower money market fund revenue as a result of bulk transfers and 2017 fee cuts. Our clients’ record trading activity boosted Trading revenue 5% to $201 million, more than offsetting the commission pricing reductions announced in February of last year. On the expense front, our 13% first quarter spending increase reflected strong client metrics and activity, as well as recent market volatility. Compensation was 10% higher in the first quarter due to hiring to serve our expanding investor base and growth-related incentives. Professional services rose by 17%, largely from third-party fees tied to higher balances in our asset management business, and from our project spending. Lastly, Other expense grew by 44% mainly due to a $15 million charge associated with unsecured client margin losses in volatility-related products during early February. While these factors contributed to outlays that were a bit above our initial expectations, the expense scenario we shared at our Winter Business Update incorporated slightly elevated quarterly comparisons during the first half of 2018. Altogether, we achieved a 240 basis point gap between revenue and expense growth, which resulted in a 41.8% pre-tax profit margin; combined with a lower tax rate of 21.9%, we delivered record net income of $783 million, up 39% from a year ago.”\nMr. Crawford concluded, “During the first quarter, we actively utilized available capital to further our client cash strategy. As part of this process, we transferred approximately $25 billion from sweep money market funds to bank sweep and paid off $15 billion in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The net effect of these moves and client activity lifted our consolidated balance sheet assets to $248 billion at quarter-end. We still anticipate crossing the $250 billion threshold in the first half of 2018. In keeping with the deployment of capital to support bulk transfers, our preliminary Tier 1 Leverage Ratio at quarter-end declined to 7.5%, remaining above our operating objective of 6.75%-7%. Our solid capital position enables Schwab to continue driving profitable growth while building long-term stockholder value – our first quarter return on equity reached 18%, the highest since 2009.”\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2018, the Business Highlights section of the earnings release has been discontinued; selected balances are now located at: www.aboutschwab.com/investor-relations/ .\nSupporting schedules are either attached or located at: www.aboutschwab.com/investor-relations/financial-reports .\n*Disclaimer: Charles Schwab received the highest numerical score in the J.D.
