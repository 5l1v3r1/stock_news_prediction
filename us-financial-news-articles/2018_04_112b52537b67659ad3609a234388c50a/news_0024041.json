The first three months are available for 99 cents a month as part of a promotion to get customers to sign up for the service. \nHulu and Spotify started partnering on bundles back in September when they offered a subscription option to students. However, that bundle was available for $4.99 a month . \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nThe new bundle is a nice savings on the individual plans you’d need to pay for each service. Spotify Premium costs $9.99 per month and Hulu goes for $7.99 per month. Even at $12.99 for the bundle, customers are able to save $5 per month. \nThe move could be a boon for those who often stream content and want access to both video and audio. And it could be a shot over the bow of Netflix and Apple Music, which compete with the services and don’t have a similar bundle option. \nBut before you sign up, there are some caveats. The service is currently only available to Spotify Premium subscribers. Those who have an existing Hulu subscription can also take advantage of the service if they switch billing to Spotify.
