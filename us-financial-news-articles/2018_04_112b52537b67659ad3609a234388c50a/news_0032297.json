They will not have a day or night’s rest until we lay our hands on them,” he said.\nPalestinians see Israel’s independence as their “Nakba” or “Catastrophe”, when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced amid violence culminating in war between newly created Israel and its Arab neighbors in May 1948.\nWriting by Ori Lewis; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T22:10:56.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
