Another five activists were jailed for seven to 12 years.\nTheir sentences prompted responses by representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and the European Delegations among other rights groups.\nBut Vietnam’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang said “there is no such thing as people being arrested for freely expressing opinion” in Vietnam.\nFacebook had not immediately response to a request for comment on the letter to Zuckerberg. Vietnam’s ministry of foreign affairs did not immediately responded.
