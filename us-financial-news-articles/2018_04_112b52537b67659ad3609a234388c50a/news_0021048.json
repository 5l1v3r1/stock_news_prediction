German banks would be the biggest contributors with 12.5 billion euros. \nSuch a scheme, long championed by the ECB, is also seen as a variable in the calculus to choose Mario Draghi’s successor as the President of the central bank. \nSome analysts say Germany’s opposition to a joint insurance could work against the election of Jens Weidmann, the head of the Bundesbank and widely seen as the front-runner in the presidential race. \nDenmark, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden have also said euro zone banks must first reduce exposure to risks before the EDIS project can start.
