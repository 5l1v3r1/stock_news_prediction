Kenya’s reigning Olympic champion Eluid Kipchoge by comparison ran only two.\n“I love to run races,” said Kawauchi.\n“Races gives me the opportunity to travel and in a more practical sense, because I train by myself if I didn’t put in a lot of races I wouldn’t be able to put in the same quality.”\nKawauchi has not fared so well at the major events, however, finishing 18th at the 2011 and 2013 IAAF World Championships and ninth at London last year. He has never been selected for the Japanese Olympic team.\nAfter failing to record a qualifying time for the 2012 London Games at the Tokyo Marathon, Kawauchi shaved his head to apologise.\n“I felt that I had to give everyone who supported me a sign of my remorse,” Nikkan Sports Quote: d him as saying at the time.\n“It is better that my shame be exposed for everyone to see.”\nKawauchi’s personal best of 2:08:14, recorded in Seoul in 2013, would have been enough to win gold at a rainy Rio Games but it is more than five minutes outside the world record. He has only once run under 2:10:00 since July 2016.\nIn an interview with SpotsNavi last year, Kawauchi, who holds the record for the most sub-2.20 marathons, said that being able to fit in only one training session a day had actually helped him.\n“When you consider that runners belonging to teams are doing 12km a day on average in their morning runs, my monthly mileage is going to be at least 360km less since I don’t do them,” he said.\n“I’m pretty sure the human body has a mileage limit.”\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T15:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:26:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
