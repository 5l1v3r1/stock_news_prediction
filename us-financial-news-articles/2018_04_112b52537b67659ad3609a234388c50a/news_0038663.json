Tennis - ATP - Monte Carlo Masters - Monte-Carlo Country Club, Monte Carlo, Monaco - April 20, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal celebrates winning his quarter final match against Austria's Dominic Thiem REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThiem, who had beaten Nadal twice on clay previously, was considered as the Spaniard’s toughest opponent heading into the tournament but he crumbled in the Monaco sunshine. \nThe world number one won nine straight games before Thiem even got on the scoreboard, drawing sympathetic cheers from the crowd. \nThe 31-year-old brought up match point with a blistering forehand winner and wrapped up the contest when Thiem fired a backhand into the net, his 25th unforced error. \nIt was a ruthless display from the 10-times champion, who will next face Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov for a place in the final. Nadal has to win the tournament to stop his rival Roger Federer regaining the top ranking.
