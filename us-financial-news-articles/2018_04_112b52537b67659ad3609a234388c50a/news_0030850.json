The PolarityTE platform technology begins with a small piece of the patient’s own, or autologous, healthy tissue, rather than artificially manipulated individual cells. From this small piece of healthy autologous tissue, the company creates an easily deployable, dynamic and self-propagating product designed to enhance and stimulate the patient’s own cells to regenerate the target tissues. Rather than manufacturing with synthetic and foreign materials within artificially engineered environments, PolarityTE manufactures with the patient’s own tissue and uses the patient’s own body to support the regenerative process to create the same tissue from which it was derived. PolarityTE’s innovative method is intended to promote and accelerate growth of the patient’s tissues to undergo a form of effective regenerative healing.\nSafe Harbor\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
