The monument is a 5,000-square-mile area off New England and is the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Commerce Department is arguing the president clearly has the authority under the federal Antiquities Act to establish national monuments. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.\nMarine national monuments are underwater areas designed to protect unique or vulnerable ecosystems. Fishing groups say it takes too large of an area away from fishermen who harvest valuable species such as lobsters and crabs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T00:36:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
