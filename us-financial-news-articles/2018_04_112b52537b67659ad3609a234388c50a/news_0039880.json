It lets the media and public know what Rugby Australia has done internally. They are also re-emphasising the values that Rugby Australia has.\n“You don’t want to bring more crisis to an organisation so they should just continue to monitor Folau’s behaviour and speech... and then move on.”\nOne of the other issues around the furore, however, concerned Folau’s right to free speech, how that impacted on RA and whether he could be disciplined for it.\nVictoria University of Wellington’s Professor of Law Gordon Anderson, who specialises in employment law in New Zealand, said legally disciplining or dismissing someone for expressing their thoughts was “tricky”.\n“It’s not a fully tested area of law... there haven’t been too many cases about free speech. It’s a tricky area,” he said.\n“At the moment I would have thought it’s an embarrassment but not much more.”\nAnderson said the New Zealand courts had upheld dismissals of workers if they were found to have brought the organisation into disrepute, or harmed it commercially.\nThe fact that no-one was suggesting Folau’s views were held by the organisation meant it was unlikely the rugby body had been brought into disrepute, he said.
