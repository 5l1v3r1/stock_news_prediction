Warren) and top two rebounders (Tyson Chandler and Alex Len).\nBut the Warriors, playing once again without injured Stephen Curry, rallied within 59-58 at halftime and then led 71-69 with 6:46 remaining in the third quarter before their explosion.\nCook (seven points), Durant (five) and Green (five) did all the scoring during the back-breaking run, which put the Suns in an 88-71 hole with 2:18 to go in the third.\nCook, Durant and Green all finished with three 3-pointers, while Klay Thompson and Nick Young buried two apiece, as Golden State made 13 of 28 (46.4 percent) from beyond the arc.\nThompson totaled 23 points, Cook 19 and Green 13 for the Warriors (56-21), who are battling Toronto (55-21) and Boston (53-23) for the second-best record in the league behind Houston (62-15).\nGreen dished out a game-high 12 assists to complete a double-double on a night when Steve Kerr recorded his 263rd win, tying him with Eddie Gottlieb for third place on the Warriors’ all-time list behind Don Nelson (422) and Al Attles (394).\nDragan Bender had a double-double for the Suns with 14 points and a game-high-tying 11 rebounds, while Tyler Ulis had a team-high eight assists to complement 12 points.\nDanuel House added a career-best 16 points for the Suns, who lost for the 14th straight time to the Warriors overall and 13th time in a row in Oakland.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:44:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
