It also said Hawaii authorities should not have allowed a single employee to send an alert without requiring confirmation from a second person.\nThe report found that Hawaii conducted far more drills than typical and did not have a plan to respond and correct a false alert. It also blamed deficiencies in Hawaii’s training.\nThe top two civilian officials of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency resigned in January after the incident and a warning-system officer who admitted to mistakenly issuing the alert was fired. Hawaii has made numerous changes in an effort to prevent future incidents and named a new emergency management agency administrator last month.\nA Hawaii investigation in January found the system for activating a missile alert and conducting emergency drills was deeply flawed, lacking sufficient clarity, fail-safe controls or even a pre-programmed way of issuing a false alarm notice to the public. Hawaii’s emergency management agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the FCC report Tuesday.\nThe FCC report recommended that all states require two employees to approve an emergency alert and have procedures in place to quickly address false alerts.
