Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt! \nHe reiterated his confidence in Pruitt in remarks to reporters on Thursday. \nThe Journal's report comes amid a series of controversies surrounding Pruitt's conduct as a public official. Among them are questions about a apartment Pruitt rented in Washington from the wife of an energy lobbyist last year, for which he paid $50 a night. \nAn EPA watchdog initially cleared Pruitt of any wrongdoing, but later said it was missing certain facts in its initial determination . \nThe New York Times also reported on Thursday that multiple EPA officials were demoted or reassigned after questioning Pruitt's spending conduct.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:31:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
