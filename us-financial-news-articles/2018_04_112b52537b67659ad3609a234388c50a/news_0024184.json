In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships. The Company considers FFO a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the Company's operating performance without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides a meaningful indication of its performance. The Company also considers FFO an appropriate performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, FFO does not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding Operating Partnership units for the periods presented.\nThe Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted FFO because it believes that adjusting FFO to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO:\n- Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent impact from a ground lease.\n- Gain on insurance settlements: The Company excludes the gain on insurance settlements because the Company believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Business interruption proceeds: The Company includes business interruption proceeds because the Company believes that including these proceeds reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Other: The Company excludes other expenses, which include hotel acquisition and disposition costs, management/franchise contract transition costs, interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities, capital lease adjustment, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles and estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs, because the Company believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\nThe Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.\nAny differences are a result of rounding.\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust Reconciliation of Outlook of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) (Unaudited) Three months ending March 31, 2018\nLow High Net income (loss) $ 22 $ 24 Adjustments: Interest expense and income tax expense 9 9 Depreciation and amortization 25 25 EBITDA $ 56 $ 58 Non-cash ground rent 1 1 Gain on insurance settlements (5) (5) Business interruption proceeds 3 3 Other 2 2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 57 $ 59 To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") - The Company believes that EBITDA provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate its operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization).\nThe Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that adjusting EBITDA to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts EBITDA for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA:\n- Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent impact from a ground lease.\n- Gain on insurance settlements: The Company excludes the gain on insurance settlements because the Company believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Business interruption proceeds: The Company includes business interruption proceeds because the Company believes that including these proceeds reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Other: The Company excludes other expenses, which include hotel acquisition and disposition costs, management/franchise contract transition costs, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles and estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs, because the Company believes that including these non-cash adjustments in EBITDA does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\nThe Company’s presentation of EBITDA, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.\nAny differences are a result of rounding.\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust Same-Property Inclusion Reference Table Hotels Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Sir Francis Drake X X X X InterContinental Buckhead Atlanta X X X X Hotel Monaco Washington DC X X X X The Grand Hotel Minneapolis X X X X Skamania Lodge X X X X Le Méridien Delfina Santa Monica X X X X Sofitel Philadelphia X X X X Argonaut Hotel X X X X The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter X X X X Hotel Monaco Seattle X X X X Mondrian Los Angeles X X X X W Boston X X X X Hotel Zetta San Francisco X X X X Hotel Vintage Seattle X X X X Hotel Vintage Portland X X X X W Los Angeles - West Beverly Hills X X X X Hotel Zelos San Francisco X X X X Embassy Suites San Diego Bay - Downtown X X X X Hotel Modera X X X X Hotel Zephyr Fisherman's Wharf X X X X Hotel Zeppelin San Francisco X X X X The Nines, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Portland X X X X Hotel Colonnade Coral Gables, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel X X X X Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills X X X X Union Station Hotel Nashville, Autograph Collection X X X X Revere Hotel Boston Common X X X X LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club X X Hotel Zoe Fisherman's Wharf X X X X Notes:\nA property marked with an \"X\" in a specific quarter denotes that the same-property operating results of that property are included in the Same-Property information provided elsewhere in this news release.\nThe Company’s first quarter Same-Property RevPAR Growth and Same-Property EBITDA include all of the hotels the Company owned as of March 31, 2018.
