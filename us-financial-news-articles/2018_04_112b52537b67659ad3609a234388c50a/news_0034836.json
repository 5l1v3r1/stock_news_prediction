In an initial review, the company said it identified about $1.4 million of expenses that should have been accrued.\nThe complaint, the company said, alleged there may have been up to $5 million in other expenses that weren’t properly recorded in the quarter. The audit committee of PPG’s board is investigating the matter, the company said, adding that it is unable to predict the timing or outcome of the inquiry.\nPPG’s first-quarter earnings release, which was set to occur before the U.S. stock-market opened, was delayed Thursday morning as the company dealt with the sudden development, a person familiar with the matter said.\nShares fell 1.5% to $111.51 in morning trading.\nPPG said Thursday it had started an “extensive review” of its cost structure after losing a customer. PPG said in February that Lowe’s Co s. would discontinue the sale of its Olympic branded paints and stains later this year. In a separate announcement Thursday, the company said it has expanded a partnership with Home Depot Inc. for its Olympic stains to be sold in nearly 2,000 U.S. Home Depot locations.\nPPG also said it saw further increases in raw-material prices and higher logistics costs across its businesses.\nRevenue in all rose 8.6% to $3.79 billion.\nThe company reported a first-quarter profit of $353 million, or $1.40 a share, compared with $334 million, or $1.29 a share, a year before.\n—Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:22:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
