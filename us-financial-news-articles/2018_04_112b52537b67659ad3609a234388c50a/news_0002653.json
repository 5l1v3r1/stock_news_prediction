Lawyers for Huber and Worrall declined to comment. Lawyers for Blaszczak and Olan could not immediately be reached. \nProsecutors said in an indictment that Blaszczak previously worked at CMS and kept up a relationship with Worrall after he left. They said Worrallâ€™s illegal tips to Blaszczak included advance notice about rules cutting reimbursement rates for radiation cancer treatment and dialysis, allowing Deerfield to profit by trading in companies affected by the rules. \nThe companies involved included radiation oncology companies Accuray Inc and Varian Medical Systems, and dialysis companies DaVita Healthcare Partners Inc, NxStage Medical Inc and Fresenius Medical Care, a unit of Fresenius Medical Care AG of Germany, according to the indictment. \nProsecutors said the scheme ran from about 2009 to 2014. \nIn a related civil case the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the scheme yielded $3.9 million in profits and at least $193,000 in consulting fees for companies where Blaszczak worked. \nBlaszczak is also charged with passing confidential information to another hedge fund, Visium Asset Management, which shut down in 2016 after several of its employees were accused of fraud. The charges do not involve the other three defendants. \nDeerfield agreed in August to pay $4.6 million to the SEC to settle claims related to the criminal case. It did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
