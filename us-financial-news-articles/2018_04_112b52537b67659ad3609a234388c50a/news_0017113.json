Qatar Electricity and Water Co was up 1.1 percent after gaining 3.5 percent in the previous session and Industries Qatar was 1.4 percent higher while Qatar Islamic Bank rose 0.4 percent. \nThe three companies said on Sunday that they were hiking their foreign ownership ceilings to 49 percent from 25 percent, starting on Monday. Qatar National Bank (QNB), the region’s biggest bank by assets, lost 0.4 in the first hours of trade. \nThe Saudi stock index edged down 0.3 percent in the first hour. Most shares in the energy and petrochemical sectors fell - PetroRabigh lost 0.3 percent and Saudi Kayan fell 1.1 percent in heavy trade. \nNational Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia’s biggest lender, helped to offset losses with a 0.2 percent rise. \nHowever, Rajhi Bank one of the lenders that attracted heavy interest after the Saudi market was upgraded to emerging market status, fell back 0.8 percent. Bank Aljazira also fell 1.8 percent in heavy trade. \nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Dubai market was helped by the real estate sector but was held back by Emirates NBD, Dubai’s largest lender, which fell 0.5 percent. The Dubai index edged up 0.1 percent as giant developer Emaar Properties gained 1.3 percent. \nAbu Dhabi’s index edged up 0.5 percent. Dana Gas was flat in early trade after falls on Monday and Sunday, after it said it had received a new injunction from the English High Court restricting its ability to pay dividends or increase its debt. \nDana said it would challenge the order, which was the result of its dispute with creditors over whether it must redeem $700 million of Islamic bonds. \nAldar Properties was down 0.5 percent for the second day in a row but Abu Dhabi National Energy company gained 2.2 percent.
