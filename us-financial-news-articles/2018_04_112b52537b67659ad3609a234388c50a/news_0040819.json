The acquisition of Yuil’s stake will strengthen SC Lowy’s position in Korea and is in line with its strategy of building a strong local presence with a long term commitment wherever it does business.\nAfter the successful transformation of Choeun Savings Bank, SC Lowy and Yuil will continue to work together on other deals in Korea and rest of Asia.\nAbout SC Lowy\nSC Lowy is an international banking and finance group specialised in fixed income.
