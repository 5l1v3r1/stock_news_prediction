REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nThe European Commission and Britain’s finance ministry said they had asked the two central banks to convene a working group on “risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services”.\nThe two central banks are the main banking supervisors in Britain and the euro zone.\n“The European Commission and (Britain’s) HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis,” they added.
