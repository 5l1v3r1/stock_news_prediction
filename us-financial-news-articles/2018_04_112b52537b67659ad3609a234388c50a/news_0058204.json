The woman was pushed by one of the queue jumpers, according to Chinese media, prompting her son to come to her defence before both were asked to leave by store staff.\nBalenciaga issued a first apology on Thursday, but it did not identify the customers to whom it offered the apology as Chinese, prompting scorn among some Chinese social media users. The hashtag #BoycottBalenciagaDiscriminatesChinese spread across social media service Weibo, drawing millions of page views.\nReporting by Ryan Woo; Additional reporting by Stella Qiu and Lusha Zhang in BEIJING; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T13:04:11.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
