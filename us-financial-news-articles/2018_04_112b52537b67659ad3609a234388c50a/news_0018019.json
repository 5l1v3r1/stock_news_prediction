The Wizards will play the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in the opening round of the postseason.\nHezonja made four key foul shots in the final minutes as the Magic held off Washington, which took the lead a few times in the fourth quarter before Orlando took over down the stretch.\nFree throws might were a key difference in the game. The Magic made 22 of 27 while the Wizards hit only 16 of 27.\nOrlando (25-57) already had been eliminated from postseason contention.\nWashington was missing some key players as coach Scott Brooks said before the game that John Wall would sit and that a mild calf strain would sideline Otto Porter Jr. Tomas Satoransky (13 points) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (nine points) started in their place.\nJodie Meeks led Washington with 18 points, while Markieff Morris had 15 and Bradley Beal added 13.\nThe Magic started fast, with Aaron Gordon scoring 11 points as Orlando took a 21-12 lead in the first quarter. However, Washington rallied and cut the deficit to 26-23 after one.\nThe Wizards took a one-point lead twice in the second quarter, both times on jumpers from Mike Scott, the last one giving them a 35-34 edge. However, Orlando took charge after that, scoring nine in a row and eventually pushing its halftime lead to 55-45.\nArron Afflalo scored all 12 of his points in the second quarter for Orlando.\nThe Magic held the lead throughout the third quarter, but the Wizards worked their way back and got consecutive 3-pointers from Meeks that sliced the difference to 76-75 after three.\nThe Magic’s Marreese Speights was ejected in the third quarter after throwing an elbow to the head of Marcin Gortat as the two were walking downcourt.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:45:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
