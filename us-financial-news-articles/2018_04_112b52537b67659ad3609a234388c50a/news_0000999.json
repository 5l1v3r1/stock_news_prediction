He is investigating whether Facebook accurately discloses how people’s personal information is used. \n“There is no excuse for this irresponsible handling of user data,” Hawley said in a statement. “Missourians need to know that they can trust the companies and platforms that have access to as much user information as Facebook does.” \nIn a statement, Facebook said, “We look forward to responding to Attorney General Hawley’s questions when we receive the details of his request.” \nHawley’s inquiry comes amid withering public and political backlash against Facebook for its role in allowing Cambridge Analytica to access information about its users and to possibly influence the 2016 presidential election campaign. Massachusetts’ attorney general has already said she would investigate Facebook over the matter while a coalition of 37 state attorneys has sent Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a letter urging him disclose more information about his company’s data collection and security practices.
