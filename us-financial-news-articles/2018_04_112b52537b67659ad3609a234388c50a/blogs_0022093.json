Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of a monthly USDA crop report due later on Tuesday expect Argentine soy output of 42.66 million tonnes, which would be the smallest in six years. \nSoybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rallied to open Tuesday's U.S. trading session following the USDA announcement.
