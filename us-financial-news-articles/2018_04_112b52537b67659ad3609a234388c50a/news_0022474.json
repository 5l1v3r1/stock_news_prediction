Long-serving prime minister Robert Fico resigned in mid-March, handing power to a deputy Peter Pellegrini.\nThe AKO poll, conducted April 4-7, showed the largest opposition party SaS gaining, with 17.1 percent, up from 16.2 percent in the last poll in February. The country’s next election is scheduled for 2020.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:03:26.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
