There was no immediate comment from the government or police.\nSupporters of Marc Ravalomanana, a former leader of the Indian Ocean island nation, say the new electoral laws are designed to prevent him running in the election. The opposition is also contending provisions on campaign financing and access to media in the laws.\nRavalomanana, who was deposed in a 2009 coup, has teamed up with the man who succeeded him, Andy Rajoelina, to oppose the laws pushed by President Hery Rajaonarimampianina.\nHundreds of protesters gathered in the centre of the capital early on Saturday to protest against the laws which were enacted by parliament earlier this month, before police fired dozens of teargas canisters at the crowd.\nOne opposition lawmaker accused the government of attacking opposition MPs while carrying out their work and demanded the president’s resignation.\n“Hery Rajaonarimampianina has to resign, he attacks members of Parliament which are in the line of their duty,” said Paul Bert Rahasimanana who represents a constituency in the capital.\n“We just wanted to do some report on the adoption of electoral laws and he sends us forces of repression.”\nPolice later retreated from the scene outside the mayor’s office, leaving about 1,000 opposition supporters protesting peacefully.\n“We are here because we need freedom of speech and because we do not agree with the authoritarian government,” said Fafah Rasoanirina, a 24-year old protester.\nThe opposition says the law requires a presidential candidate to produce a report on all previous judicial convictions, which could be a disadvantage for their candidate. Ravalomanana was convicted by a court when he was in exile after the 2009 coup for a range of offences.\nHe has already said he will run in the election due before the end of this year though the precise date has yet to be set.\nWriting by Duncan Miriri, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T12:00:21.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
