Thank you everyone for all your support,” his mother Kate James wrote.\nMedical experts in Britain had agreed that more treatment for Alfie would be futile, but his parents wanted to take him to Rome, where the Vatican’s Bambino Gesu hospital had offered to care for him.\nA British court rejected an appeal by the parents on Wednesday to take their son to Italy.\nThe case has provoked strong feelings over whether judges, doctors or parents have the right to decide on a child’s life. Alfie’s parents have been backed by Pope Francis and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda.
