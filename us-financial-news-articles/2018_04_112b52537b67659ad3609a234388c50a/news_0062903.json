The two others judges did not say how they would rule.\nThe court did not say when it would publish a decision.\n“Based on the oral arguments today, we are even more confident the Federal Circuit will affirm the PTAB’s judgment and recognize the contribution of Broad, MIT and Harvard in developing this transformative technology,” Broad said in a statement.\nBerkeley said in a statement that “based on the questioning today, we are optimistic that the court has serious doubts about several aspects of the PTAB’s decision.”\nIn 2012, researchers at Berkeley and Vienna jointly applied for the first CRISPR patent.\nA team at Broad applied for a patent months later, opting for a fast-track review process. It became the first to obtain a CRISPR patent in 2014, and has since obtained additional patents.\nIn 2015, Berkeley and Vienna petitioned PTAB to launch a so-called interference proceeding, claiming the Broad patents covered the same invention as their earlier application.\nBroad countered that its patent represented the real breakthrough because it described the use of CRISPR in so-called eukaryotic cells, which include plant and animal cells.\nPTAB said in a February 2017 decision that there was “no interference” between Berkeley and Vienna’s application and Broad’s patents, meaning both can be granted.\nThat decision has created confusion over which institutions are entitled to royalties for commercial applications of CRISPR in the biotechnology and agriculture industries.\nDonald Verrilli, a lawyer for Berkeley, said at Monday’s hearing that Broad simply used conventional techniques to build upon on Berkeley’s research in obvious ways.\nRaymond Nimrod, a lawyer for Broad, said statements by Berkeley’s own researchers contradict that argument.
