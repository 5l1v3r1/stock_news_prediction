This was at the very beginning after this information [of the attack] appeared. Therefore allegations of this towards Russia are groundless,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nPeskov also said that U.S.-led air strikes carried out in Syria over the weekend were the “latest violation of international law” and said they were an act of aggression.
