Earlier investors also backed the round, as did newcomer Amadeus Capital.\nFounded by Ankiti Bose and Dhruv Kapoor, Zilingo’s revenue grew by 10 times over the last 12 months and it now counts 10,000 independent merchants on its platform.\n“We think the market is showing us the right signs in terms of adoption and retention, so it’s good to double down,” Bose said in a statement released by Burda.\nBased in Singapore, Zilingo also sells in Indonesia and Thailand and ships to four more countries.
