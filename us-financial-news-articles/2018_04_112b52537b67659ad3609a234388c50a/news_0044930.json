(the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:EBTC), parent of Enterprise Bank, announced net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $6.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million, or 22%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.58 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 21%, as compared to $0.48 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nAs previously announced on April 17, 2018, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.145 per share to be paid on June 1, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2018. The 2018 dividend rate represents a 7.4% increase over the 2017 dividend rate.\nChief Executive Officer Jack Clancy commented, \"The increase in our 2018 first quarter earnings as compared to 2017 is largely attributable to our growth over the last twelve months and the positive impact of lower tax rates in 2018 from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Total assets, loans, and customer deposits have increased 10%, 11%, and 8%, respectively, as compared to March 31, 2017. The collective efforts and contributions of our dedicated Enterprise team, including active community involvement, relationship building and a customer-focused mindset, and ongoing enhancements to our state-of-the-art product and service offerings continue to drive this growth.\"\nMr. Clancy added, \"Strategically, our focus remains on organic growth and continually planning for and investing in our future. We expect the relocation of our Leominster, MA branch to be completed later this spring. This branch, along with our new Windham, NH branch and our recently relocated branch in Salem, NH, are in prime locations and will provide improved, state-of-the-art experiences in these communities to better serve our customers.\"\nFounder and Chairman of the Board George Duncan commented, \"This past quarter represents the start of our 30 th year in business. As we reflect on this incredible journey, we are profoundly grateful to our shareholders, customers and team members who have helped to turn our vision for a new kind of independent, innovative bank - one that would value the entrepreneurial spirit and stimulate the economy by helping to create new businesses, meaningful jobs, vibrant communities and a dynamic work environment for our team members - into our Enterprise Bank of today.”\nResults of Operations\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $26.0 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 14%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was due primarily to loan growth. Average loan balances (including loans held for sale) increased $226.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the 2017 respective period average. Net interest margin was 3.95% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.90% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the provisions to the allowance for loan losses amounted to $1.6 million and $125 thousand, respectively. The 2018 provision was due primarily to an increase in specific reserves in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe primary factor in the increase in the provision for loan losses compared to the prior year was an increase in the balance of the allowance for loan losses allocated to impaired and classified loans of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a decrease of $390 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in 2018 was primarily due to credit deterioration of two impaired commercial relationships for which management determined that the additional provisions were necessary, based on a review of their individual business circumstances.\nPartially offsetting these additional reserves were generally stabilized credit quality metrics and underlying collateral values, and the level of loan growth, as indicated by the following factors:\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $9 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net recoveries of $216 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans amounted to 0.46% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.45% at March 31, 2017.\nThe ratio of adversely classified loans (substandard, doubtful, loss) to total loans amounted to 1.19% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.55% at March 31, 2017.\nLoan growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $20.3 million, compared to $42.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio was 1.51% at March 31, 2018, 1.45% at December 31, 2017 and 1.53% at March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 amounted to $3.8 million, a decrease of $343 thousand, or 8%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease compared to the prior year period was due primarily to decreases in net gains on sales of investment securities, partially offset by increases in investment advisory fees and deposit and interchange fees.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, non-interest expense amounted to $19.4 million, which is relatively consistent with non-interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The provision for income taxes amounted to $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $70 thousand, or 4%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to lower tax benefits from equity compensation in the current year ($195 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $667 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017) and higher taxable income levels, largely offset by the positive impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\").\nKey Financial Highlights\nTotal assets amounted to $2.83 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.82 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $17.4 million.\nTotal loans amounted to $2.29 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.27 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $20.3 million.\nCustomer deposits (total deposits excluding brokered deposits) were $2.39 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.29 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $92.0 million, or 4%. Brokered deposits were $185.5 million at March 31, 2018 and $147.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nInvestment assets under management amounted to $846.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $845.0 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $1.9 million.\nTotal assets under management amounted to $3.77 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.75 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $19.0 million.\nEnterprise Bancorp, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation that conducts substantially all of its operations through Enterprise Bank and Trust Company, commonly referred to as Enterprise Bank, and has reported 114 consecutive profitable quarters.
