An expanding population and growing economic activity are more than offset by energy efficiency and conservation measures taken by consumers, companies and local governments. \nOther U.S. utility deals announced in the last 12 months include San Diego-based Sempra Energy’s ( SRE.N ) $9.45 billion acquisition of Oncor of Texas, and Canada’s Hydro One Ltd ( H.TO ) buying Spokane, Washington-based Avista Corp ( AVA.N ) for C$6.7 billion ($5.3 billion). \nHeadquartered in Evansville, Indiana, Vectren provides gas and electricity to more than 1 million customers in nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about a fifth of Ohio. \nBased in Houston, CenterPoint serves more than 5 million metered customers, primarily in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. It has a market capitalization of $11.5 billion.
