It was the seventh consecutive week that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 83.1 percent of volumes last week, up from 81.7 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 292 tonnes from 483 tonnes in same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 276 tonnes last week from 170 tonnes in same week last year.
