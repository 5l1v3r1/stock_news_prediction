In the first quarter, China shipped 3.6 million tonnes of gasoline, or about 312,000 bpd, and some 43 percent above the 216,000 bpd exported in the same period of 2017.\nDiesel exports were 2.4 million tonnes in March, equivalent to about 580,000 bpd, with shipments around 392,000 bpd in the first quarter, a gain of some 12 percent on the year-ago period.\nTaking all oil products together shows that China’s exports in the first quarter were 1.27 million bpd, up almost 20 percent on 1.06 million bpd shipped in the same period last year.\nLooking at crude import numbers along with the product exports shows that of the additional 600,000 bpd of crude oil imported in the first quarter, about 210,000 bpd was exported as additional refined fuels.\nIt appears that this rising supply of oil products from China has weighed somewhat on regional prices, especially in gasoline, which has witnessed the biggest increase in exports from China.\nThe profit margin, or crack, on producing a barrel of 92-RON gasoline from Brent crude in Singapore GL92-SIN-CRK, the regional benchmark, slumped to the lowest in 20 months on April 19, hitting $5.42 a barrel.\nIt has since recovered somewhat to $6.50 a barrel as of Monday, but it’s still almost 60 percent below the recent peak of $16.34, reached in August last year.\nDiesel has fared better, with the profit margin in Singapore for a barrel of gasoil, the term for diesel before retail additives are added, ending at $14.80 on Monday.\nThis is slightly higher than the $14.27 a barrel at the end of last year, and also up from the low so far this year of $13.17, reached in early March.\nGET USED TO CHINA EXPORTS The difference between the gasoline and diesel markets this year is that the region has had to absorb a sharp increase in Chinese gasoline exports, but not so much of diesel.\nAnd now, product prices are still high enough to prompt Chinese refiners to export refined fuels.\nThe ability of China’s refiners to export fuels has been aided by the higher crude import quotas granted this year to smaller, independent refiners, by the authorities in Beijing.\nThere may be some temporary relief for the region’s other exporters of refined fuels, such as Singapore, South Korea, Japan and India, as some Chinese plants enter scheduled maintenance.\nThis should lower the processing rate at Chinese refineries, which hit a record 12.13 million bpd in March, above the previous high of 12.03 million bpd in November 2017.\nWhat is becoming increasingly clear, though, is that China is emerging as a major player in the markets for refined fuels in Asia, especially since the authorities seem ready to allow refiners to import more crude and export surplus products.\nEditing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://reut.rs/2KaruiW"], "published": "2018-04-24T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:58:55.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
