(NYSE: CIVI) today announced that it has expanded its Adult Day Health (“ADH”) services with the acquisition of two centers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nThe centers, Aging Well Adult Day Health Center and Living Well Adult Day Health Center, provide person-centered day services to elders, including medication management and nutritional and nursing support. The two centers, located in the central Massachusetts communities of Marlborough and West Boylston since 2008 and 2010, respectively, generated revenues of approximately $8 million for the 12-month period prior to acquisition, serve a total of more than 600 elders and employ 100 people.\n“The Aging Well and Living Well centers are great additions to our existing ADH programs in Massachusetts,” said Bruce Nardella, president and CEO of Civitas Solutions. “Both centers have a strong reputation for quality service, and we are thrilled to welcome their management and caregivers, as well as the individuals they support, to Civitas.”\nThe addition of these centers expands Civitas’ ADH footprint in central Massachusetts from one to three centers. With the 2016 acquisition of Renaissance Adult Day Health in Worcester, Civitas first gained entry into the ADH market in New England’s second largest city and the central region of the state.\nCivitas entered the $6.9 billion ADH market in 2014 through the acquisition of the Mass Adult Day Health Alliance. Including the Aging Well and Living Well centers, Civitas now operates 28 centers, serving approximately 5,000 elders, in the states of Maryland, Massachusetts and New Jersey with combined annual revenues of nearly $80 million.\n“Overall, I am pleased with the progress we have made toward our goal of establishing our Company as the leading provider of ADH services,” said Nardella. “During the past three and a half years, our team has learned a lot about the ADH market, and we look forward to continuing our expansion of this relatively new service line, in new and existing markets. We remain very excited about the future of our ADH business and its potential to meaningfully contribute to our mission, growth and development in the years ahead.”\nAbout Civitas\nCivitas Solutions, Inc. is the leading national provider of home- and community-based health and human services to must-serve individuals with intellectual, developmental, physical or behavioral disabilities and other special needs. Since our founding in 1980, we have evolved from a single residential program to a diversified national network offering an array of quality services in 36 states.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403006623/en/\nCivitas Solutions, Inc.\nDwight Robson, 617-790-4800\nChief Public Strategy and Marketing Officer\ndwight.robson@civitas-solutions.com\nSource: Civitas Solutions, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403006623/en/"], "published": "2018-04-04T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T03:25:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
