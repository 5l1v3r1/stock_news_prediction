Al Hassan’s duty counsel told the court his client believed the circumstances of his detention were “harming his dignity and his privacy”.\nAl Hassan was a member of Ansar Dine, one of several Islamist militant groups that have waged an insurgency against the Malian government since 2012.\nTimbuktu is known for monuments dating to its 14th century golden age and was once a major trading hub and centre of Sufi Islam - a branch of the religion seen as idolatrous by some Muslim militant groups.\nAfter seizing Timbuktu, Ansar Dine introduced its version of sharia law that Al Hassan is accused of helping to enforce, including forced marriages for some women and girls and the destruction of Sufi monuments.\nUnder ICC rules, Al Hassan has not yet formally been charged. The next step in his case is a confirmation of charges hearing that has been tentatively set for Sept. 24.\nHe was handed over to ICC custody in The Hague on March 31, almost a year after his arrest in northern Mali.\nMali fell into turmoil when Islamist fighters and Tuareg-led rebels seized control of the country’s north six years ago.\nFrance poured hundreds of troops into its former West African colony to repel the insurgents in 2013, but attacks have been spreading further south towards the capital Bamako despite a U.N. peacekeeping mission.\nReporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Editing by Anthony Deutsch and Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T13:10:23.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
