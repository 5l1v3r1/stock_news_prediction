In March, the world’s last male northern white rhino died in Kenya. FILE PHOTO: A wild elephant grazes on the side of the road near Meru National Park, Kenya, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Baz Ratner/File Photo \nBut other research casts doubt on a continued shrinking of mammals, partly because of conservation efforts to stave off threats to wildlife such as climate change, loss of forest habitats and pollution and expanding cities. \nThomas Brooks, chief scientist of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) who was not involved in the study, said the projection of ever smaller mammals was “doom and gloom.” \n“Happily I don’t think it’s very likely,” he told Reuters, saying that other research suggests that large animals such as elephants are more likely to benefit in protected areas than smaller ones. \nAnd a Red List of threatened species, maintained by the IUCN, also lists some wild mammals roughly the size of a cow - such as the African buffalo or the brown bear - as unendangered. \nThe Science study also excludes marine mammals such as the blue whale, the largest creature that has ever existed. It is endangered on the Red List but the populations are rising after a moratorium on hunts.
