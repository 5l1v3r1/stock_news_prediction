But talks between the company, which makes Duncan Hines bake mixes and Vlasic pickles, and ConAgra Brands , which sells Peter Pan peanut butter and Pam non-stick cooking spray, broke down.\nSome investors have said privately earlier this year they would like Pinnacle to revisit a possible merger and said that Conagra could still be a potential suitor.\nJana is known on Wall Street as a one of the industry's most respected activist investors often preferring to work away from the limelight and steering clear of proxy contests that many celebrity activists embrace.\nEarlier this year, Bloomin' Brands , which owns Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill, added a new independent director amid prodding from Jana.\nOne year ago, Jana took a stake in Whole Foods Market and vowed to shake up the board to help improve the grocer's under-performance. But the company sold itself to Amazon instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T12:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T13:08:16.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
