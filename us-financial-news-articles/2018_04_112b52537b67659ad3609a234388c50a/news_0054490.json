By the close on March 27, the stock had lost about 17 percent. But since then, Facebook has gained 13.6 percent, including the 8 percent jump on the open Thursday.\nCramer, host of \" Mad Money ,\" had previously called out Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg for being notably silent for days after reports on March 17 that Cambridge Analytica had harvested the data from some 87 million users of the social network without their permission.\nZuckerberg and Sandberg eventually went on an apology tour, and Zuckerberg also testified about the matter on Capitol Hill.\nThe data were used to target ads promoting Donald Trump 's 2016 candidacy, according to The New York Times and The Observer. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing.\nHowever, Cramer noted at the time that much of the outrage could blow over soon. People could get bored of protesting Facebook \"and want to see how their friends are doing,\" he had said.\nDuring Wednesday's earnings conference call, Zuckerberg said the company is investing \"heavily\" on safety and security, and even more in \"building the experiences that bring people together on Facebook in the first place.\"\nâ€”CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.
