Some U.S. media had said Washington was confident Assad had also used sarin on April 7.\nMattis, however, suggested the evidence of sarin was so far inconclusive.\n“We are very confident that chlorine was used. We are not ruling out sarin right now,” Mattis said.\nThe Pentagon said one of the targets was a scientific research center located in the greater Damascus area, which it described as a Syrian center for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weaponry.\nThe second target was a chemical weapons storage facility west of the city of Homs.\n“We assess that this was the primary location of Syrian sarin and precursor production equipment,” Dunford said.\nThe third target, which was also near Homs, contained both a chemical weapons equipment storage facility and a command post.\nU.S. officials said there was no indication so far that Syrian air defenses struck attacking Western aircraft or ships.\nThey characterized this year’s strikes as more significant than the one waged last year, saying double the number of weapons were used this time.\n“We were very precise and proportionate,” Mattis said. “But at the same time, it was a heavy strike.”\nLast year, 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from the guided missile destroyers USS Porter and the USS Ross struck Syria’s Shayrat air base.\nThe targets of that strike included Syrian aircraft, aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage facilities, ammunition supply bunkers, air defence systems and radar.\nAt the time, the Pentagon claimed that a fifth of Syria’s operational aircraft were either damaged or destroyed.\nAlthough Syria’s military had moved aircraft and other military assets in the days preceding Friday’s strike, Dunford said he did not believe it had moved chemical weapons materials.
