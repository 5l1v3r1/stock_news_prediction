We continue to have confidence in the performance and potential of our DNAbilize platform technology to produce exciting drug candidates to help patients with high unmet medical need.”\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nReported Pre-Specified Interim Results from Phase 2 Study of Prexigebersen in Combination with LDAC to Treat AML. Of the 17 evaluable patients, four patients achieved complete responses, one patient achieved a leukemia free, one patient had significantly reduced bone marrow blasts and three patients achieved stable disease. In total, 47% of the evaluable patients showed some form of response to the combination treatment, including four patients with complete remission (23%) and four patients with stable disease. Published Data in The Lancet Haematology. In March 2018, the Company announced that data from its Phase 1/1b study of prexigebersen (BP1001) as a treatment for hematological malignancies was published in The Lancet Haematology in an article titled, “Liposomal Grb2 antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (BP1001) in patients with refractory or relapsed haematological malignancies: a single-centre, open-label, dose-escalation, phase 1/1b trial.”\nAnnounced Third Drug Candidate, BP1003, for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer. In November 2017, Bio-Path announced its third drug candidate, BP1003, entered into preclinical development for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. BP1003 targets the Stat3 protein and is currently being studied in patient-derived tumor models. Previous ex vivo tumor studies have shown BP1003 to successfully penetrate pancreatic tumors and enhance the efficacy of standard frontline treatments. Bio-Path expects to initiate IND-enabling studies for BP1003 in 2018.\nUpcoming Events\nPresentation at the 2018 AACR Annual Meeting . Bio-Path will present preclinical animal model data at the upcoming AACR Annual Meeting on Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at the Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics Session, Section 36, from 8:00 a.m. – 12:00 p.m. ET in Chicago. The abstract (#5786) is titled: “Grabbing GRB2: The use of liposome-incorporated Grb2 antisense oligonucleotides as a novel therapy in gynecologic malignancies.”\nFinancial Results for the Full Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $8.1 million, or $0.80 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $6.8 million, or $0.73 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the deemed dividend related to the warrant conversion in 2017. The per share amounts above have been adjusted to give effect to the 1-for-10 reverse stock split that occurred on February 8, 2018.\nResearch and development expenses were $5.5 million for both the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased to $3.5 million, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased legal and audit fees.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $6.0 million, compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.0 million compared to $8.1 million for the comparable period in 2016.
