Lee come to an end.\nLee, vice chairman of Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), walked out a free man in February after an appeals court suspended his sentence. The case is currently assigned to the Supreme Court, after it was appealed again.\nSamsung C&T shares closed up 4 percent while SDI shares closed down almost 3 percent, versus a 0.3 percent rise in the wider market .KS11 .\nReporting by Joyce Lee and Ju-min Park; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:00:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
