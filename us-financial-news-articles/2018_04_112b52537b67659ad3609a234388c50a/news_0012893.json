(NasdaqGS: ACHC), if they purchased the Company’s securities between February 23, 2017 and October 24, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), including an August 22, 2017 public offering. This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee.\nWhat You May Do\nIf you purchased securities of Acadia and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-achc/ to learn more. If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by May 14, 2018 .\nAbout the Lawsuit\nAcadia and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.\nOn October 24, 2017, the Company disclosed negative financial results for 3Q 2017 including a reduction to its guidance for fiscal year 2017 and a significant cut to EBITDA relating to its U.K. facilities purportedly driven by “lower census and higher operating costs.”\nOn this news, the price of Acadia’s shares plummeted 26% to close at $32.68 per share.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include the former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
