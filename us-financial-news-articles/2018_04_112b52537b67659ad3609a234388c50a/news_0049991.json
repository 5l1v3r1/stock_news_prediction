Tsatsarov said he believed they lacked a legal basis as the offences in question did not appear to be crimes in Bulgaria.\nA total of 11 people have been indicted in the case, including two AW-Tronics managers, Miami residents of Iranian origin.\nThey, along with the company’s export compliance officer, pleaded guilty last October to conspiracy to defraud the United States and illegally export aviation parts and equipment to Syrian Arab Airlines. They were sentenced to up to two years in prison.\nReporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T15:28:28.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
