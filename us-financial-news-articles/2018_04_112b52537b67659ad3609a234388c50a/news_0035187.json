She is now enjoying international support for her action in Syria and against Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.\nStill, she has had to tread carefully in parliament, where she now relies on a small Northern Irish party to get enough votes to pass legislation, and has worked hard to offer lawmakers, angry about being sidelined, time to discuss the Syrian action.\nIan Blackford, the leader of the opposition Scottish National Party in Westminster, was one of many who asked May why she had not recalled parliament for a vote, breaking with a convention dating back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n“The prime minister leads a minority government,” he said. “It was perfectly possible for the house to have been recalled in advance, why was this not done?”\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends a press conference in 10 Downing Street, London, April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Pool PRAISE While some Conservatives also expressed their regret that she had bypassed parliament, May also enjoyed praise from others - one calling her a “real prime minister” by moving swiftly to support the joint air strikes.\nInstead, it was the opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn who drew jeers and shouts when he suggested that May had simply followed the orders of U.S. President Donald Trump - something the British leader denied.\n“We have not done this because President Trump asked us to, we have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do, and we are not alone,” May said to cheers.\nBut she avoided answering questions on whether parliament would be consulted on any further strikes and ignored demands by Corbyn for a War Powers Act to limit the government’s power to launch military action.\nBritain has said there are no plans for future strikes against Syria. Foreign minister Boris Johnson, in Luxembourg, again said the strikes were not aimed at regime change in Syria, but rather designed to send a message.\nMay will be mindful of how military action can backfire. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s legacy was tainted by his decision to join the war against Iraq, especially after an inquiry concluded that the decision was based on flawed intelligence, while her predecessor, David Cameron, was damaged after losing a vote for strikes against Syria in 2013.\nOpinion polls suggest that most Britons do not support military action, with one by Survation taken after the strikes were launched showing 40 percent of the 2,060 people asked opposed the action. Some 36 percent supported the strikes.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends a press conference in 10 Downing Street, London, April 14, 2018.

If not, she’s the one that will take the blame.”\nadditional reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; Editing by Kevin Liffey, Gareth Jones and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T07:39:43.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
