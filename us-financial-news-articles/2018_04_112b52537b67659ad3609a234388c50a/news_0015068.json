The cars have been written off by insurers as total losses, and WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that companies that picked them up at auctions have been packing them up for transport to wholesalers and operators looking to salvage parts. They’re bound more often for container ships rather than traditional maritime car carriers because the vehicles can’t be driven onto ships, and Maersk Line says it’s generally more efficient to stuff anywhere from two to five in a 40-foot container. That gives them vehicles a new life in overseas markets where demand for used vehicles has been growing. With some 600,000 cars reportedly heavily damaged by Harvey, there’s some scale to the business, and there are signs the market may last: Weather forecasters are predicting another busy hurricane year in the Atlantic.\nThe potential cost of the U.S.-China trade showdown is rising exponentially. President Donald Trump says he is considering is imposing tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports from China, the WSJ’s Bob Davis reports, a major escalation in the trans-Pacific trade tensions . At the same time, Mr. Trump says he will act “to protect our farmers and agricultural interests,” suggesting some support of support for exporters who have already seen commodity prices slide on China’s threatened retaliation. Beijing today said it would “not hesitate to pay any price” to defend its interests if the U.S. follows through on the new trade threats. The latest volleys raise ominous prospects for broader global trade. Both countries already are signaling they will look to other markets for goods as tariffs change pricing calculations. But price supports to help U.S. farmers could also draw protests from other countries, turning the U.S.-China melee into a global affair.\nAmerican auto makers are undertaking a historic shift in sales that is pushing their supply chains in different directions. Detroit’s Big Three are moving away from passenger cars and scaling up production of more-profitable sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks as those vehicles claim a bigger share of the U.S. market. The WSJ’s Mike Colias and Christina Rogers report that small cars have fallen out of favor amid low gasoline prices and efficiency improvements in SUVs, and large sedans now are on the chopping block. General Motors Co. expects to end production of the Chevrolet Sonic subcompact as early as this year. GM’s Detroit-area automobile plants have already pulled back production, idling assembly lines and laying off workers. By contrast, plants in Arlington, Texas, Wentzville, Mo., and Fort Wayne, Ind., that produce SUVs and pickups are humming, taking in parts and pushing out finished vehicles around the clock.\nECONOMY & TRADE Flooding in Rose City, Texas, following Hurricane Harvey. Photo: Bloomberg News Uncertainty in U.S. trade policies is reaching the Middle East. Dozens of small- and medium-size American companies that bet on doing business with Iran over the past decade are growing increasingly concerned about their investments. The WSJ’s Benoit Faucon and Asa Fitch report that President Trump’s ongoing criticism of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and the recent appointments of two staunch opponents of the agreement to the cabinet have American exporters more anxious than ever. Companies like ImEx Gulf, a Plano, Texas-based exporter of food supplements for livestock, started shipping to Iran under special exemptions created long before the nuclear pact that pulled back international sanctions. And some companies that were looking to get into Iran after 2015 now say shipping insurance costs are rising with the growing uncertainty, a signal to many that the risks are too great to take on.\nChina’s latest e-commerce experiment is eight stories tall and looks uncannily like a parking garage . Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is testing car sales through a structure that’s effectively an automobile vending machine, an automated service center tied to Alibaba’s online marketplace that delivers Ford Motor Co. vehicles with little if any contact with sales people. The WSJ’s Liza Lin reports the car vending machine is one of many projects China’s internet giants are experimenting with to bring the principles of e-commerce into corners of the physical retail world. Just as Amazon.com Inc. is testing unstaffed convenience stores, Chinese e-commerce companies are taking stakes in malls and supermarkets and digitizing the operations as they seek growth beyond their core online retail business. The car-vending idea has foundered in the U.S., but China’s retail climate is considered more adventurous and Alibaba is already wants other car makers to take the ride.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ There’s a market for these cars somewhere. I just wouldn’t want my wife driving one of them. ’\n—Eric Widmer of Alliance Inspection Management, on vehicles damaged in Hurricane Harvey shipped to overseas markets.\nNumber of the Day 0.9% Average operating margin of the world’s top 15 container shipping lines in the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 5% in the third quarter, according to Alphaliner.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. imports increased 9.1% in the first two months of the year while exports climbed 5.9%.
