But Ferrari, it appeared, hoped Raikkonen would trip Bottas up and create an opportunity for Vettel to regain the lead.\nThey eventually brought him in on lap 27, after Bottas and Vettel overtook him without a change in positions.\n“I don’t know,” said Raikkonen when asked if he had fallen victim to Ferrari strategy in the first stint.\n“On the last lap with the Mercedes it was Seb who benefited for me but then we had the Safety Car.”\nThe safety car bunched the pack up and allowed Raikkonen to make up the time he had lost staying out.\nVettel’s race, meanwhile, unraveled after Verstappen collided with him and punted him into a spin.\nDespite being pre-race favorite to chalk up a third win in a row, Vettel finished only eighth, behind even McLaren’s Fernando Alonso.\nRaikkonen, on the other hand, almost snatched second from Bottas but was unable to get past.\n“A little bit of luck with the safety car,” he said later.\n“But I’ll take what I got, because at one point it didn’t look good at all.”\nEditing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:26:26.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
