This has contributed to a sharp decline in Asian refining margins as refiners grapple with China’s excess as feedstock prices for crude oil surge.\nSukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta, said overall gasoline supplies in Asia were high, especially with China shipping out record volumes.\n(For a graphic of China diesel, gasoline exports click reut.rs/2KeFXKv )\nONLY STATE-OWNED FIRMS\nJust like last year, the quotas will only go to state-owned firms, the traders said.\nChina has so far issued 20 million tonnes of fuel export quotas for 2018, which means the government will set the rest of the year’s quotas at 23 million tonnes, they said, declining to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak to media.\nThe new quotas are expected in early May, said one trader briefed on the policy.\nThe Ministry of Commerce, responsible for issuing the quotas, did not respond to a request for comment.\nApart from the changes in the way quotas are released, traders also expect Beijing to further cut the portion of quotas given under a tolling scheme in favor of general trade.\nUnder the general trade category, refiners get tax refunds after exports are completed or get a tax waiver on fuel exports, a policy that Beijing granted in 2016.\nUnder the tolling or processing rules, refiners are exempt from import taxes on crude oil that is bought from overseas for the purpose of producing fuels for export.\nOil products exported under the tolling rules are also exempt from export taxes, but have fixed volumes and time slots to export. Both crude imports and fuel exports in this arrangement are done under tight scrutiny by Chinese customs.\n(For a graphic on Asian refinery profits click reut.rs/2JclKE3 )\nReporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Jessica Jaganathan, Henning Gloystein and Li Peng Seng in SINGAPORE; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell, Tom Hogue and Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://reut.rs/2KeFXKv", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://reut.rs/2JclKE3", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/"], "published": "2018-04-25T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T12:46:33.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
