Soccer Football - Serie A - Juventus v Napoli - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - April 22, 2018 Napoli fans celebrate after the match REUTERS/Massimo Pinca \nItalian media estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 supporters were waiting outside the building when the teamâ€™s flight arrived in the middle of the night following the match in Turin. \nPhotographs and video footage showed the team bus edging its way through the crowd as fans chanted, waved banners and let off fireworks. \nFans also lit fireworks across the city as the final whistle went and celebrated in public squares after defender Kalidou Koulibaly had headed in the winning goal in the last minute of the game against Juve. \nNapoli are chasing their third Serie A title, having won the previous two in 1987 and 1990 with a team inspired by former Argentina forward Diego Maradona. \nThey still trail Juventus, who have won Serie A for the last six years, by one point with four games to play.
