That was the smallest job growth since September and followed a 326,000 surge in February. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the economy adding 193,000 jobs last month\nBut wage growth edged up last month, with average hourly earnings rising eight cents or 0.3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February.\nIn morning trading, the dollar was slightly down versus the yen at 107.36 yen, while the euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.2225 (Reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T15:59:58.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
