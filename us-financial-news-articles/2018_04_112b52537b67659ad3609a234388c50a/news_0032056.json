The manager reportedly asked the men to make a purchase or leave, and the men declined, saying they were waiting until their friend arrived to buy a beverage. \nThe police officers also reportedly asked the men to leave several times before finally making the arrest, the Inquirer reported. Their friend arrived as the men were being led out of the building in handcuffs. \nStarbucks didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune . A company spokeswoman told the Inquirer the manager had parted ways with the company as the review was pending, correcting a previous description of the separation as “mutual.” \nStarbucks CEO Kevin Johnson formally apologized to the men this weekend , and said that what happened to the two was “reprehensible.” He says he hopes to meet with the men personally to apologize for the incident. Two hours in, still roughly 40 protesters here at Starbucks. Some demonstrators have left, but also new faces are arriving, like the person carrying this sign pic.twitter.com/57ckFP1CFa \n— Cassie Owens (@cassieowens) April 16, 2018 \nProtesters gathered at the Philadelphia store Monday morning, many with signs asking for the manager responsible for the incident to be fired. Another protest is scheduled to occur at the store at 4 p.m. ET. \nNo charges were filed against the men.
