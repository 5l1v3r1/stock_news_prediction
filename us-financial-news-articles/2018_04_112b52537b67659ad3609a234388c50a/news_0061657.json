REUTERS/Toby Melville/Illustration\nBringing together Britain’s second- and third-largest supermarket groups could generate the savings and buying power to help them better compete with fast-growing German discounters and growth at Tesco after its purchase of wholesaler Booker.\nThe cash and shares deal could also provide a potential exit route for Walmart, as Asda, which it bought in 1999 for 6.7 billion pounds, has been struggling to grow over the last five years as discounters Aldi and Lidl attract its price-conscious customers.\nSainsbury’s shares jumped as much as 21 percent to 327.1 pence in early Monday trading, their highest since July 2014, while shares in rivals Tesco and No. 4 Morrisons fell.\nWalmart will receive 3 billion pounds ($4.1 billion) in cash and a 42 percent stake in the combined business’ equity, valuing Asda at about 7.3 billion pounds.\nSainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe will retain that position in the merged company, which will keep the Sainsbury’s and Asda brands. Related Coverage Sainsbury's says Asda merger could result in some store sell-offs\nAnalysts said the deal was a bet that recent changes in the retail industry - including the rise in online shopping, hard discounters and Tesco’s purchase of Booker - would ease any opposition from competition regulators.\nBernstein’s Bruno Monteyne said that if regulators included discounters - which sell a much smaller range of products - in their assessment of major competitors for the new group, it might only have to sell about 8 percent of stores.\nBut if they do not include discounters, disposals might have to reach 15 percent of stores, which could undermine the deal.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Sainsbury’s Coupe said divestments were possible, but there were no plans to close shops and so customers would be unaffected.

GERMAN DISCOUNTERS\nThe deal comes as Britain’s big four grocers continue to lose share to Aldi and Lidl and are also having to deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the relentless march of Amazon.\nAnd it follows Tesco strengthening its position with the completion of a 4 billion pound takeover of wholesaler Booker two months ago.\nThe surprise decision by Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority to unconditionally clear the Tesco/Booker deal may have encouraged Sainsbury’s and Asda to believe they could get a transaction through, albeit with some store disposals.
