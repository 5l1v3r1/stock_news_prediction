Seattle has won two of the first three games of the four-game series and four of its last five overall.\nThe Indians have alternated losses with wins in their last five games.\nThe Mariners took the lead before recording an out against Carlos Carrasco as Dee Gordon led off with a single and scored on Jean Segura’s two-run home run. Nelson Cruz homered with one out to extend the lead to 3-0.\nThe Mariners finished Carrasco’s day after Robinson Cano lofted a sacrifice fly immediately before Cruz laced an RBI single in the third inning. Seattle piled on against Zach McAllister in the fourth, when Segura had a two-run single, Cano delivered an RBI double and Kyle Seager hit a two-run homer.\nRyon Healy hit his first homer with the Mariners, a two-run shot, in the ninth.\nCruz finished with four hits and was a triple shy of the cycle. Segura had three hits, four RBIs and a stolen base while Gordon scored three runs and stole a base.\nThe early flurry was more than enough for Mike Leake (3-2), who bounced back from one of the worst starts of his career and earned the win after allowing four runs on six hits and one walk while striking out six over six innings. Leake gave up eight runs on 12 hits over just 3 1/3 innings against the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.\nTyler Naquin had an RBI single in the second and Yonder Alonso hit a two-run homer in the fourth before delivering a sacrifice fly in the sixth for the Indians. Alonso and Michael Brantley each finished with two hits.\nCarrasco (4-1) allowed five runs (four earned) on five hits and one walk while striking out four over three innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T17:44:02.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
