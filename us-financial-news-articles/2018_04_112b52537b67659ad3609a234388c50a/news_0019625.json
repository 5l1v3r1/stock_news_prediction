FREEMIUM MODEL \nThe company was a pioneer of the now widely used ‘freemium’ business model, distributing its antivirus products for free over the internet, then charging customers for premium features. \nIt counted 435 million users at the end of last year, including 290 million consumer PC users and 145 million mobile users, and a turnover of $780 million. It acquired AVG, a Czech rival, two years ago to significantly expand its user base. \nAs well as antivirus software, it also supplies privacy protection and other internet utility software, targeting both consumers and small- and medium-sized businesses. \nIn a fragmented market, Avast competes with brands including Czech-based ESET, Malwarebytes and McAfee, both of Silicon Valley, Romania’s Bitdefender, Britain’s Sophos and Kaspersky Lab of Russia. \nAvast’s public offer follows the successful listing of two other high profile “freemium” companies in the United States. \nDropbox, which started as a free service to share and store photos, went public last month and music-streaming Spotify had the largest ever direct listing earlier in April. \nMorgan Stanley and UBS have been appointed joint global co-ordinators and lead bookrunners for Avast’s IPO. \nIt is 46 percent owned by its founders, Czech entrepreneurs Pavel Baudiš and Eduard Kučera. CVC Capital Partners has a 29 percent stake, with Summit Partners holding 7 percent.
