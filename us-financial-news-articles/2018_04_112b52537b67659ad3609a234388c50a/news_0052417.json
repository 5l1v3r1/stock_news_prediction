German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen and French Minister of the Armed Forces Florence Parly stand next to Eurofighter as they visit the ILA Air Show in Berlin, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\nGerman Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and her French counterpart Florence Parly stood side by side at the ILA Berlin Air Show and hailed the ambitious Franco-German weapons push as “historic” and a key step for European autonomy.\n“This is a historic agreement,” Parly told a throng of journalists, military officials and industry executives. “It shows that Europe is more than a sum of medium-sized powers, and can take its fate into its own hands and ensure its autonomy.”\nThe ministers signed a letter of intent to explore joint development of a maritime warfare aircraft for use from 2035, a document outlining the high-level common requirements for a new fighter jet, and a concept of operations for a joint training and operation of a fleet of C-130J transport planes.

It also remains unclear whether the countries will develop a new maritime aircraft, or build on an existing design.
