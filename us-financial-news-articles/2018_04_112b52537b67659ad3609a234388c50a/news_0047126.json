It’s a perfect storm for greater water insecurity,” he said.\nIndia is entangled in water disputes with its eastern and western neighbors - Bangladesh and Pakistan - which accuse it of monopolizing water flows moving downstream toward them.\nTo the north and northeast, however, India fears a loss of water to upstream China, which plans a series of dams over the Tsangpo river, called the Brahmaputra as it flows into eastern India.\nWATER LOSSES While India’s trans-boundary rivers are governed by treaties on how water should be shared, disputes are increasing as water shortages stoke tensions.\nApart from in Bhutan and Nepal, South Asia’s per capita water availability is already below the world average. The region could face widespread water scarcity - less than 1,000 cubic meters available per person - by 2025, Kugelman said.\nAlmost 600 million people in India are at high risk of being unable to continue relying on surface water - including in the country’s northwest and south, where much of the country’s staple wheat and rice are grown, according to the World Resources Institute.\nWater supply in India may fall 50 percent below demand by 2030, the Asian Development Bank has forecast.\n“Large parts of India have already been living with ‘Day Zero’ for a while now,” said Mridula Ramesh, author of an upcoming book on climate change.\n“Much of it is because of bad management. Most cities lose between a third and a fifth of their water from pilferage or leakage through antiquated pipes, and we don’t treat and reuse wastewater enough,” she said.\nBengaluru, Karachi and Kabul are among the 10 cities in the world that are “on the verge of an imminent water crisis”, according to a report last month by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a research and advocacy group based in New Delhi.\nBengaluru, once known as the “city of lakes”, now relies heavily on groundwater, which is not being naturally replenished and cannot sustain the growing population, said Sushmita Sengupta at CSE.\n“‘Day Zeros’ are inevitable unless cities push for judicious use of water - including rainwater harvesting and reuse of waste water, as well as more efficient irrigation, and regulation of tubewells,” she said.\nMIGRATION? India is one of the largest consumers of groundwater in the world, with worsening shortages attributed in part to subsidies that help farmers run electric irrigation pumps cheaply for longer than needed, and to a lack of limits on extracting water or digging wells.\nSome states are taking steps to manage water better. Karnataka and Maharashtra require industries to use treated urban wastewater, with Gujarat and other states also planning similar measures.\nBut regulating water use is a politically sensitive issue - one few policymakers are keen to address, Kugelman said. That’s the case even as thousands of farmers migrate out of parched rural areas or commit suicide as their crops wilt, he said..\nWater scarcity is expected to force 50 to 70 million people in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and China from their homes by 2050, according to research by the Strategic Foresight Group in Mumbai.\n“With greater migration to the cities, there will be increased social disruptions and greater stress on water resources in urban areas,” Kugelman predicted.\n“These will, in turn, increase tensions between states and countries over water. Even treaties can’t help then.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Laurie Goering.
