The report said the ban on Chinese investment in U.S. technology could be permanent. \nTrump said last week he has asked the United States Trade Representative to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs against China. Last month, the U.S. slapped tariffs on up to $60 billion in annual Chinese imports. \nTrade tensions between the U.S. and China have increased recently, as the Trump administration takes a more protectionist stance toward trade matters.
