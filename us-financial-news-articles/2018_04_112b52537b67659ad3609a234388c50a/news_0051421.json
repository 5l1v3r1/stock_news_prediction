(NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products company offering a portfolio of leading brands providing superior value to consumers every day, announced today that Executive Chairman David M. Maura has been named Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Maura succeeds Andreas Rouvé, who has stepped down as CEO and a Director.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a new three-year, $1 billion common stock repurchase program. The common stock repurchase authorization is effective immediately and replaces an existing three-year program, which had a remaining available authorization of $93 million. Purchases under the program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time at management’s discretion. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nIn addition, the Company announced that it will organize globally around two divisions focused on consumer products and home improvement. Randal D. Lewis has been named to the position of President of a new Consumer Products group while Philip S. Szuba will continue to lead the Hardware & Home Improvement (HHI) division. The Consumer Products group will be comprised of the Pet Supplies, Home & Garden and Auto Care businesses while the Hardware & Home Improvement division will be comprised of the security, plumbing and builders’ hardware businesses. Lewis had been President, Pet, Home & Garden at Spectrum Brands. Both Lewis and Szuba will report directly to Maura. As part of this reorganization, Guy J. Andrysick, President, Global Auto Care, has left the Company.\n“We believe that our recent results do not reflect Spectrum Brands’ long-term potential,” said Maura. “The planned sale of our Global Batteries & Lighting and Small Appliances & Personal Care businesses will create a higher-growth, higher-margin and more focused portfolio, and our pending transaction with HRG Group will bring us independence, increased trading liquidity and significant tax attributes. The rest of our management team and I will focus on delivering on the many opportunities in our continuing businesses, including Hardware & Home Improvement, and a new, more efficient and focused Consumer Products group, which brings together three businesses sharing similar manufacturing and distribution capabilities under Randy’s leadership. We intend to drive growth and increased cash flow through improved operational execution, innovation and new product development as well as strategic investments in organic growth initiatives and value-enhancing bolt-on acquisitions.”\nMaura continued, “The Board’s approval of a new $1 billion share repurchase program underscores our confidence in the business and long-term outlook.”\nMaura concluded, “On behalf of the Board, I thank Andreas for his contributions as CEO and in previous positions he has held since joining our Company as Chief Financial Officer of the European Battery division in 2002. We wish Andreas and Guy the best in their future endeavors.”\nBiographical Information\nMaura, 45, has served as Executive Chairman of Spectrum Brands since January 2016.
