The output gap was estimated at about minus 2.0 percent in fiscal year 2016/17 (July-June), but the gap was expected to close in 2018/19.\n“The forecast gradual recovery of GDP is premised on favourable external scenario, strong private and public investments, improved agricultural productivity, and the absence of significant macroeconomic imbalances,” he said.\n“There are nonetheless downside risks to this outlook, as indicators of aggregate demand including fiscal absorption and private sector credit growth remain weak.” (Reporting by Elias Biryabarema, Writing by George Obulutsa, editing by Larry King)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:53:37.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
