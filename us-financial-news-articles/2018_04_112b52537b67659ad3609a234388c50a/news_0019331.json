The Colombian peso, already near a three-year high, rose 1.47 percent to 2731.45 to the dollar as oil prices climbed after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to fire missiles at Syria in response to a suspected chemical attack. Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it intercepted missiles over its capital, Riyadh, as Yemen's Houthis have stepped up missile attacks on the kingdom, bolstering the oil rally. Colombia's stock market mirrored the gains with the IGBC index rising 1.48 percent. Amid otherwise flat regional markets, Brazil's Bovespa index rose 0.78 percent after the country's Supreme Court put off consideration of a petition that could potentially free former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was jailed on Saturday on a corruption conviction. Lula leads opinion polls for the October presidential election but is seen by markets as potentially derailing the country's austerity efforts. Planemaker Embraer SA rose sharply for a second day, gaining 4.20 percent, on a report that it was closer to a tie-up with Boeing cO after presenting the government with a proposed business model. Kroton Educacional SA gained more than 3 percent following its first acquisition in the basic education segment. Meanwhile, ordinary shares in Eletrobras fell 2.21 percent on a newspaper report that an auction of six of its power distributors would not go ahead on May 21, a move seen as a prerequisite for the company's privatization.
