U.S. President Donald Trump called for the tariffs to protect U.S. metal makers from cheap imports. \nMarch aluminium exports were 22.2 percent higher than February’s 370,000 tonnes, customs said. Steel exports were up 16.6 percent from 4.85 million tonnes in February. \nChinese aluminium shipments dipped in February but had been buoyant since November due to a favourable arbitrage to the London Metal Exchange price, encouraging producers and fabricators to seek better margins abroad. \nProlonged environmental restrictions in some major Chinese steelmaking hubs have curbed steel supplies after mills were ordered to shut some production to reduce emissions. \nTraders and analysts expect more cities to impose restrictive environmental policies as part of Beijing’s campaign to curb air pollution, which may further rein in steel output and support domestic steel prices. \n“Prices for steel products in March were much higher than last year, which also dampened the incentives for exports,” said Xu Bo, an analyst at Haitong Futures. \nAverage spot prices for rebar last month were 3,905 yuan ($620.62) a tonne, compared to 3,743 yuan a tonne in 2017, according to data from consultancy Wind. \n“The impact of Trump’s 25 percent tariff is limited since the policy was not fully implemented until late March,” Xu said. \nFor more details, see ($1 = 6.2921 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Tom Daly and Muyu Xu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger) ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T11:36:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
