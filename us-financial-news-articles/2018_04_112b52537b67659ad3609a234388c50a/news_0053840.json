PMEX/COOPEX members declined to speak on the record but some said on condition of anonymity that they welcomed the report’s recommendations.\n“We are in favour of that. We are at 200,000 tonnes currently (of international contracts) but if the government can raise this to 400,000 tonnes, it will allow us to boost local players,” the director of one company said.\n“Certain (small exporters) do excellent work ... and show that small local operators can be reliable if they have the chance,” the manager of another company said.\nIvory Coast, which accounts for about 40 percent of global cocoa supply, expects total production for the 2017/18 season of around 2 million tonnes, similar to last season’s record output.
