WAGE -0.11% on Thursday replaced some of its top leaders—including its chief executive officer—and said it needed to restate financial results from the past two years after an audit found “material weaknesses” in reporting.\nThe California company, which administers employee-benefits programs such as health-savings accounts and benefits programs for transit and parking, said Joseph L. Jackson had stepped down as CEO, Colm M. Callan had resigned as chief financial officer and Kimberly L. Wilford had resigned as senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary.\nAll resignations were effective Thursday, according to a securities filing, though Mr. Jackson will remain with WageWorks as executive chairman.\nChief Operating Officer Edgar O. Montes has been promoted to chief executive and has joined the company’s board, which was expanded to eight directors, WageWorks said.\nMr. Callan and Ms. Wilford will stay on for three months to help with the transition, the company said. If they stay on through the end of the transition period, they would receive cash lump-sump payments of $180,000 and $160,000, respectively.\nWageWorks, which last month missed a deadline to file its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, had already announced it would need to amend financial results for the 2016 and 2017 fiscal years. On Thursday, WageWorks said that after an investigation from the board’s audit committee, it expects to lower its 2016 profit by about $3.5 million to $5.5 million and revenue by $6.5 million to $9.5 million.\nShares in WageWorks, which have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year, fell 4.6% to $43 in after-hours trading.\nThe review, which also looked at “whether there was an open flow of information and appropriate tone at the top for an effective control environment,” found material weaknesses in financial reporting as of Dec. 31.\nThe accounting and internal-control review continues, WageWorks said, adding that additional adjustments to previously reported financial results may be required.\nWrite to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:03:19.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
