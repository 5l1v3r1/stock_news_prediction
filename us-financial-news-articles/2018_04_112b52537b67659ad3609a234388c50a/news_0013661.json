REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain/File Photo \nProsecutor Fatou Bensouda said in the filing that doubt over jurisidiction arises because Bangladesh is a member of the court but Myanmar is not. \nBensouda argued that, given the cross-border nature of the crime of deportation, a ruling in favor of ICC jurisdiction would be in line with established principles of criminal law.
