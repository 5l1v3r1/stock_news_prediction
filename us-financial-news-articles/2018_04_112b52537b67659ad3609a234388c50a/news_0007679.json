REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo \nMueller, in private negotiations in early March about a possible presidential interview, described Trump as a subject of his investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, said the Post, which cited three unnamed people familiar with the discussions. \nTrump attorney Jay Sekulow and his former attorney John Dowd did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe Post said Mueller also told Trump’s lawyers that he was preparing a report about the Republican president’s actions while in office and potential obstruction of justice. \n“Mueller reiterated the need to interview Trump — both to understand whether he had any corrupt intent to thwart the Russia investigation and to complete this portion of his probe,” the newspaper said. \nIt said Trump and some in his inner circle interpreted Mueller’s words as assurance that his risk of criminal jeopardy was low, while other advisers cautioned that Mueller was baiting Trump into an interview that could put him in greater legal danger. \nMueller is also investigating potential collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia as well as whether Trump has committed obstruction of justice by trying to thwart the Russia probe. \nTrump has denied any collusion with Russia and has called the Mueller investigation a witch hunt.
