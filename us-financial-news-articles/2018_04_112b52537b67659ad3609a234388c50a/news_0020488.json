If they are thinking of doing anything other, I would encourage them not to do it.” \nFairfax media reported earlier on Wednesday that the Cameroon team had told Queensland Police five male athletes, two boxers and three weightlifters, had gone missing from the Athletes’ Village. \nNo one was available to comment at the Cameroon team on Wednesday. \nQueensland Police told Reuters it was a “matter for the Cameroon Commonwealth Games Association to address” until such point that the athletes overstayed their visas. \nThat one of the Cameroon boxers, Christian Ndzie Tsoye, had failed to turn up for his men’s 91kg quarter-final bout on Tuesday particularly saddened Commonwealth Games Federation chief David Grevemberg. \n“I think it’s disappointing that athletes that have come didn’t compete as they were scheduled to compete,” he said. \n“(But) I think it’s important to remember that these athletes are guests and within their visas they have the right to travel freely, but this is obviously an issue that Team Cameroon is monitoring very closely.” \nIllegal immigration is a highly contentious political issue in Australia and Peter Dutton, the country’s home affairs minister, issued a warning to athletes in January that they would be deported if they overstayed. \n“It happens at every Games and it’s not a surprise,” Beattie added. \n“There are mechanisms in place and they haven’t breached their visas. If there is a breach then Peter Dutton and his department will deal with it. \n“I don’t to be too blase about it but there are mechanisms to deal with it and it will be dealt with in the right way by that department. \n“We’re organising a sporting event, if there are breaches of visas, they will deal with it.” Additional reporting by Tom Westbrook in Sydney, editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T07:05:41.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
