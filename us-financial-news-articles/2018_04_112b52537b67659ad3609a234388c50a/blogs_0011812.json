The agency also estimated quarterly U.S. stocks of both commodities at historic highs, which the market largely shrugged off. \n* Fears of a trade war with China, a top agricultural products buyer, kept markets on edge after Beijing announced higher tariffs on a long list of U.S. goods, including pork and ethanol. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar fell on Monday, dropping versus the yen for a third straight session, as China imposed extra tariffs on U.S. products, escalating a dispute between two of the world's biggest economies. \n* Oil prices inched up on Tuesday as rising Russian output and expectations of a reduction in Saudi Arabian crude prices were offset by a potential slowdown in U.S. production. \n* Wall Street shares plunged on Monday as investors fled technology stocks amid resurgent trade war worries, with key indexes trading below their 200-day moving averages and the S&P 500 closing below that pivotal technical level for the first time since Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016. \nDATA AHEAD (GMT) \n0600 Germany Retail sales Feb 0750 France Markit manufacturing PMI Mar 0755 Germany Markit/BME manufacturing PMI Mar 0800 Euro zone Markit manufacturing PMI final Mar 1345 U.S. ISM-New York index \nGrains prices at 0105 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 449.50 3.25 +0.73% -0.33% 473.22 42 CBOT corn 388.00 0.75 +0.19% +0.06% 381.72 72 CBOT soy 1041.25 5.75 +0.56% -0.34% 1044.00 58 CBOT rice 12.31 $0.00 +0.00% -1.08% $12.34 50 WTI crude 63.17 $0.16 +0.25% -2.73% $62.76 46 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.230 $0.000 +0.02% -0.15% USD/AUD 0.7669 0.001 +0.09% -0.12% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
