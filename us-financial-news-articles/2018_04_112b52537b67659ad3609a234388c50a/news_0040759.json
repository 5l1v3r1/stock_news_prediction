China has been ramping up military displays in the area over the last week.\nOn Wednesday, the navy carried out live-fire drills in the Taiwan Strait in what state media said was a direct response to \"provocations\" by Taiwan.\nTaiwan, which is claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory, accused China of saber rattling\", and carried out its own live-fire exercises on Tuesday on two Taiwan islands close to China.\nOn Thursday, Chinese bombers flew around Taiwan in what the air force called a \"sacred mission\".\nTaiwan's China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council said China's exercises, including the flight by the bombers, amounted to \"military intimidation\".\nTaiwan is one of China's most sensitive issues and a potential flashpoint. China has ramped up military exercises around the island over the past year.\nThe Chinese manoeuvers come at a time of heightened tension between Beijing and Taipei and follow strong warnings by Chinese President Xi Jinping last month against Taiwan separatism.\nXi presided over the navy's largest-ever military display this month in the\nSouth China Sea, which involved 76 fighter jets and a flotilla of 48 warships and submarines.\nChina's military activities and growing assertiveness has worried its neighbors as well as the United States, whose Pacific command called China a \"disruptive force\" in January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T14:02:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
