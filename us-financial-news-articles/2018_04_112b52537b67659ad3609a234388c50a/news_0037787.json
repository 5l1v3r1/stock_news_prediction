China has devalued their currency in the past,” Mnuchin said. “He’s watching it.”\nHe said the Twitter post was not related to Trump’s view on the strength of the dollar.\nTrump said on Twitter on Monday: “Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!”\nThe tweet referred to what Trump sees as unfair trading advantages: If a country’s currency is artificially low, its exports are more competitive. Higher U.S. interest rates would generally increase the value of the dollar, making U.S. exports more expensive.\nSince Trump took office in January 2017, the dollar has weakened substantially against most currencies, including the Chinese yuan and, until the United States imposed sanctions on Russia in the last few weeks, the ruble.\nSpeaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying noted that what Trump said seemed to contradict the U.S. Treasury’s report last week that refrained from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators.\n“So it seems like the information being released by the U.S. side is a bit chaotic,” she told a daily news briefing.
