(Nasdaq:DTEA) today provided the following statement addressing the most recent public announcement by Rainy Day Investments Ltd. (RDI), a holder of 46% of the outstanding shares of DAVIDsTEA, and Mr. Herschel Segal, RDI’s president and a former member of the Board of Directors of the company:\nDAVIDsTEA’s board and management are focused on the company’s future and are committed to creating value for all the company’s shareholders.\nMr. Segal co-founded the company and has been on the board since our initial public offering until he resigned on March 5, 2018. Mr. Segal’s assertion that his proposed control of the board would bring a new, objective vision for the company is disingenuous. The operational and financial challenges Mr. Segal highlights in his recent press release all occurred under his watch.\nBy proposing a dissident slate of seven director nominees to replace the entire board, Mr. Segal is now proposing to effectively control the board without having paid a premium to other shareholders.\nThe DAVIDsTEA Board is open to continued discussions with all shareholders. In particular, it is the Board’s hope that discussions with Mr. Segal can continue in a constructive and professional manner, avoiding the unnecessary distraction and cost of a public proxy contest.\nOn March 28, three significant DAVIDsTEA shareholders (Porchlight Equity Management, LLC, (12.8%), TDM Asset Management PTY LTD. (12.2%), and Edgepoint Wealth Management, Inc. (11.5%)) sent a letter to the DAVIDsTEA Board expressing their concern over RDI’s proposed slate of director nominees and other recent RDI announcements. A copy of this letter is available online at:\nhttp://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC.Enhanced/SecCapsule.aspx?c=253953&fid=15556644\nThe DAVIDsTEA Board will continue to consider the interests of all the company’s shareholders as it evaluates its options in advance of the company’s annual meeting in mid-June. The company will provide more information in a management information circular and shareholders are not required to take any action at this time.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements.
