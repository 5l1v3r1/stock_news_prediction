Shares of American aircraft-maker Boeing (ba) were down 5% in premarket trading.\nThose charges would apply to around $50 billion of U.S. imports, according to the Ministry of Commerce in China. The move follows the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on several Chinese imports following alleged infringements of intellectual property in China.\n“China’s response was tougher than what the market was expecting — investors didn’t foresee the country levying additional tariffs on sensitive and important products such as soybeans and airplanes,” Gao Qi, a Singapore-based strategist at Scotiabank told Bloomberg. “Investors believe a trade war will hurt both countries and their economies eventually.”\nThe expected opening plunge follows a 389 point gain yesterday, though the market is off more than 800 points in the past month.
