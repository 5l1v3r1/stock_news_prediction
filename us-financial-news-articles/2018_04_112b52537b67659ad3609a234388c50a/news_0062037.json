REUTERS/Mike Blake\nThe lawsuit, filed last week in Nevada state court, charges that Jorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director at the Wynn Las Vegas salon, made “false and defamatory” statements to the Wall Street Journal and ABC News, according to the report.\nReuters was not able to reach Nielsen for comment.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Nielsen said he was unaware of the lawsuit and had declined to further comment.\nThe sexual misconduct allegations against Wynn surfaced in a January Wall Street Journal article. Nielsen was one of the sources the newspaper identified by name.\nReuters has not independently verified the allegations against Wynn.\nWynn, 76, has denied the accusations as “preposterous.” The billionaire divested himself of his entire 11.8 percent stake in Wynn Resorts in March.
