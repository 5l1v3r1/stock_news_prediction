After Smith walked the bases loaded, Franco connected on a 2-2 slider and ripped it into left for the two-run advantage. Smith labored on the mound and threw 34 pitches in the first.\nIn the third, the Phillies went ahead 3-0 when Herrera singled to center, scoring Scott Kingery.\nSmith walked six batters through the first three innings, allowing the Phillies to jump out to a 3-0 lead.\nPivetta pitched out of trouble in the fourth, striking out Cameron Maybin with runners on second and third and two outs.\nPivetta was terrific in 5 2/3 innings, as he allowed only four hits while striking out nine and walking none.\nThe Marlins’ offense was relatively silent with just four hits through the first seven innings.\nFranco blasted a two-run home run to left in the seventh for a 5-0 Phillies’ lead. Franco’s homer landed 395 feet away from home plate against Jarlin Garcia for his third hit of the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:09:58.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
