REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh According to the agreement, Jaish al-Islam fighters will leave Douma for the northern city of Jarablus, near the borders with Turkey, within 48 hours, the source added.\nThere was no immediate comment from Jaish al-Islam, which control the city.\nThe rebel group has more than 3,500 prisoners and hostages in its prisons in Douma, Rami Abdulrahman, the director of the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, told Reuters. Five prisoners were released on Wednesday, after earlier departures by Jaish al-Islam fighters.\nRussian news agency RIA, citing a security source, said Jaish al-Islam rebels will leave Douma in two batches in the coming hours.\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has regained control of nearly all of eastern Ghouta in a Russian-backed military campaign that began in February, leaving just Douma in rebel hands. Tens of thousands of people are estimated to be sheltering in the battered city.\nAfter a lull of a few days, government forces began bombarding Douma again on Friday.\nOn Saturday evening, Jaish al-Islam accused the Syrian government of carrying out a chemical attack on Douma that a medical relief organisation and rescue workers say killed dozens of people. The government has denied carrying out any such attack.\nThe offensive in Ghouta has been one of the deadliest of the seven-year-long war, killing more than 1,600 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\nThe conquest of Douma would further strengthen Assad’s political and ground position, as it recaptures the biggest rebel enclave near Damascus.\nThe rebel groups controlling the eastern Ghouta area had shelled the capital’s neighbourhoods almost daily in the past few months, inflicting casualties and damages.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme in Beirut and Polina Ivanova in Moscow; Editing by Tom Perry, Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T14:27:41.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
