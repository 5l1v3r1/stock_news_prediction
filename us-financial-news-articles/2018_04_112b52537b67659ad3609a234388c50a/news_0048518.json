Soccer Football - Champions League - AS Roma Training - Trigoria Training Ground, Rome, Italy - April 23, 2018 General view during training REUTERS/Tony Gentile \nThe Italian said he is well aware of the Merseyside club’s ability to hit teams with swift balls over the top for their attacking trio to exploit but wants his side to keep a tight, compressed formation. \n“We aren’t going to sit deep. They have to do well to force us deep. The decisive thing will be for us to stay compact,” said Di Francesco, a former Roma midfielder in his first season as coach of the club. \nMuch attention in the build-up to the game has inevitably focused on Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah who moved to Anfield from Roma in June. However, Di Francesco said it would be a mistake for him or his team to over-focus on the Egyptian. \n“We can’t focus on a single player. Liverpool are not just Salah, the front-three combine really well together and that’s not an insignificant factor,” he said referring to Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. \n“So we haven’t prepared this game with one player in mind. When preparing the game, of course we have to be aware of their strongest players, but we’re not targeting a single one,” he added.

The beauty of English stadiums is amazing. In Italy we’re not used to having the fans right behind us in this way. Liverpool will have the fans on their side, but our away fans will support us. \n“We need to play as a team more than ever. Liverpool are different to Barcelona in terms of pace and we need to play well to win and have even more of a team-mentality. We want to make the most of Liverpool’s possible weaknesses,” he said.
