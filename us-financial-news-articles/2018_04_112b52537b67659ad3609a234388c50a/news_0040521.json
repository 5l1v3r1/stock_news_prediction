REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo \nThe New York Times, citing six people, reported on Friday that the Justice Department had opened an investigation about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe Department and AT&T declined to comment on the report and Verizon could not be immediately reached for comment. \nThe person briefed on the matter said the Obama administration had investigated similar claims in 2016 but did not take any action. \nThe Times said the Justice Department sent demands to AT&T, Verizon and the GSMA, an industry standards-setting group, on efforts to thwart a technology called eSIM. The technology allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card. \nThe GSMA declined to comment.
