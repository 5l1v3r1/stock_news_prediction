The U.S. Climate Prediction Center will issue its outlook for 2018 in late May, according to Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n“Long-term statistics show that, on average, the more active the overall Atlantic basin hurricane season is, the greater the probability of U.S. hurricane landfall,” wrote authors Philip Klotzbach and Michael Bell in their forecast.\nA summary of the three forecasts is in the table below.\nAn average Atlantic hurricane season produces 12 named storms of which six become hurricanes, three of them major.\nLast year, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida and Puerto Rico, respectively.\nHarvey inundated Houston and forced the partial or complete shutdown of 14 oil refineries including the largest and second largest in the United States.\nPuerto Rico continues to recover from Maria, which knocked out power for hundreds of thousands of residents.\nAccording to the Colorado State forecast, there is a 39 percent probability a major hurricane will strike the East Coast and a 38 percent probability such a storm will make landfall between the Florida panhandle and Brownsville, Texas.\nBoth the AccuWeather and Colorado State forecasts point to a weakening La Nina pattern in the Pacific Ocean. La Nina is the name for a pattern of cold ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean.\nThe two forecasts do not expect an El Nino pattern will form if the La Nina ends. The El Nino is the name for a pattern of warm ocean temperatures in the central Pacific, which produces high winds across the southern United States, often breaking apart tropical storms.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:49:18.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
