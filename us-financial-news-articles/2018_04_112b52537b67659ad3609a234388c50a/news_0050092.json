Its license for the field expires in 2022. \nAuction winners are expected to be announced in December, he added. \nThe Erawan and Bongkot fields have combined output of 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of gas, government data shows. \nBidders in the Erawan field must invest at least $4 billion and bidders for Bongkot must invest $2 billion, said the Director-General of the Department of Mineral Fuels, Veerasak Pungrassamee. \nPTT Exploration and Production(PTTEP), the upstream arm of state-owned PTT, operates the Bongkot field under a license that expires in 2023. \nPTTEP plans to bid jointly for Bongkot with France’s Total, it said in a statement. \nPTTEP currently holds a 66.6 percent stake in the Bongkot field after it purchased Royal Dutch Shell’s 22 percent for $750 million in January. Total holds a 33.3 percent stake. \nPTTEP also plans to increase its 5 percent stake in the Erawan field.
