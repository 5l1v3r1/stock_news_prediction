REUTERS/Eason Lam/File Photo TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast.\n“Apple represents nearly 20 percent of TSMC’s revenue so the outlook potentially points to weaker-than-anticipated iPhone demand,” Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters.\nOthers, some asking not to be Quote: d, said baldly that the warning was “exactly” about Apple.\nMizuho Securities USA said in a client note that its checks continue to point to soft demand for iPhone X, the Cupertino-based firm’s tenth anniversary phone released last November, in addition to a steady fall in iPhone 8 and 8 Plus orders.\nApple’s shares were last down 2.5 percent and were the biggest drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index.\nShares of Apple suppliers including Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ), Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), Qorvo Inc ( QRVO.O ), Skyworks Solutions Inc ( SWKS.O ) and Broadcom Inc ( AVGO.O ) fell by 2 percent to 5 percent.\n“Until the new iPhones in the Fall start driving the production food chain in Q3, mobile’s going to be weak,” Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said.\nTSMC, also a supplier to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp ( NVDA.O ), said it expects growth this year of 5 percent for the global semiconductor industry, weaker than an earlier forecast of 5-7 percent.\nData provider TrendForce had earlier estimated 2018 global smartphone production at around 1.5 billion units, 2.8 percent up on 2017 but down from a previously expected 5 percent.\nTSMC on Thursday estimated 8 percent growth for contract chipmakers, compared with its previous forecast of 9-10 percent.\nU.S.-listed shares of TSMC ( TSM.N ) were down 6 percent, while other chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc ( AMAT.O ) and Lam Research Corp ( LRCX.O ) fell about 5 percent and ASML Holding NV ( ASML.O ) lost 3.6 percent.\nAnother big industry bellwether, chip equipment maker Lam Research, said on Wednesday its shipments missed consensus estimates for the first time in five years.\nChipmakers Analog Devices Inc ( ADI.O ), Micron Technology ( MU.O ) and Xilinx Inc ( XLNX.O ) were also down by 3 percent to 4 percent.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Patrick Graham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T19:13:54.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
