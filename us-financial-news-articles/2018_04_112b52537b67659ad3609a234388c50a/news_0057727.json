REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett\nWaterstones said on Thursday that Elliott would become its new owner, providing all the financing for the transaction, with its previous backer Lynwood Investments retaining a minority stake. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nThe chief executive of Waterstones said the Elliott deal represented a “happy outcome” for the book shop chain.\n“We enter new ownership looking forward with great optimism to the next chapter in the development of Waterstones,” CEO James Daunt said in a statement.\nElliott has been very busy in Britain over the course of this year.\nMost notably, coffee shop and hotels group Whitbread ( WTB.L ) said on Wednesday that it would spin-off its Costa Coffee business into a separate company just weeks after Elliott became its biggest shareholder.\nThe investor also pressed British engineering company GKN ( GKN.L ) to engage in takeover talks with suitor Melrose ( MRON.L ).\nIn January, Elliott revealed it had bought a 2.8 percent stake in takeover target Sky ( SKYB.L ), the UK pay TV company, and has 5.1 percent of British software company Micro Focus ( MCRO.L ), a company struggling after its sales plunged and its CEO left.\nWaterstones, which had sales of over 400 million pounds ($556 million) in its last financial year, has returned to profitability over the last two years after almost collapsing in 2011 when it was hit by a combination of high debt and declining book sales in the face of competition from electronic readers.\nThe deal is expected to be completed in May.\n($1 = 0.7193 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T12:09:24.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
