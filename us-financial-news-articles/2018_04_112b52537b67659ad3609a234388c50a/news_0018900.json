The Penguins killed off the penalty and maintained their five-goal lead.\nSoon after, Crosby notched his second goal and the Penguins took complete control with a 6-0 advantage at 7:41.\nCrosby then notched a hat trick — the third of his playoff career — to make it 7-0 Pittsburgh at 10:42.\nThe Flyers applied some early pressure in the second with shots on goal by Claude Giroux and Ivan Provorov. Murray stopped both shots and the good defensive play soon translated into a 4-0 Pittsburgh lead when Guentzel connected on the power play.\nAfter Crosby scored for a 5-0 Penguins lead at 9:01, the Flyers pulled Elliott and replaced him with Mrazek. Crosby’s goal was dazzling as he deflected the puck out of mid air and redirected it past Elliott.\nThe Penguins dominated through the entire first period as they scored three goals on 15 shots.\nRust struck initially at 2:38 for a 1-0 lead and Hagelin gave them a 2-0 advantage at 10:07.\nMalkin pushed the Penguins ahead 3-0 with a spectacular goal at 14:09 as he skated through three Flyers and flipped a backhand shot past Elliott.\nOn the next rush, Konecny broke free and fired a shot just wide.\nThe Flyers scuffled through most of the first, going 0-for-2 on the power play while Elliott looked quite shaky in net.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:12:43.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
