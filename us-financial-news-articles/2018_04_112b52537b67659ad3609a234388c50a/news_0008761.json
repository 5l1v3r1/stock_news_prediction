This has been telegraphed for days and weeks,” Ross said.\nU.S. President Donald Trump earlier Wednesday stood by his administration’s actions, tweeting: “We are not in a trade war with China.”\nRoss echoed those sentiments, telling CNBC that China’s response was “relatively proportionate to the tariffs that we put on based on the intellectual property.”\nHe added that he also expected other countries to start “coalescing against China” over its trade practices.
