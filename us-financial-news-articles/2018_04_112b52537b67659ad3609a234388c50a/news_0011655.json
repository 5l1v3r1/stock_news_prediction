Putin said there were about 20 countries where such substances were made.\nPutin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters that Britain’s theory on who poisoned Skripal “will not be confirmed anyway.” Moscow has denied being behind the attack on Skripal and his daughter in the southern English city of Salisbury.
