The group seized large swathes of Syria and Iraq but has gradually lost its territory since the United States and its allies started a military offensive in 2014.\nSome of the harshest critics of a potential withdrawal from Syria come from Trump’s own Republican party, which blasted President Barack Obama when he withdrew U.S. from Iraq in 2011. Iraqi forces began to unravel and eventually collapsed in the face of Islamic State’s advance into the country in 2014.\n“We learned that the Iraqi forces weren’t capable of providing security inside the country and that gave the enemy an opportunity to resurge, that is where really ISIS had the space to grow,” U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the hearing.\nU.S. airstrikes, troops and U.S.-backed Syrian militias have dealt heavy blows to Islamic State in Syria but the group still holds pockets of territory and is widely expected to revert to guerrilla tactics if the last remnants of its once self-styled “caliphate” are captured.\nMattis said he expected a “re-energized” effort against Islamic State militants in eastern Syria in the coming days.\n“You’ll see a re-energized effort against the middle Euphrates River Valley in the days ahead and against the rest of the geographic caliphate,” Mattis added.\nReporting by Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart; Editing by James Dalgleish and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:26:16.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
