Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, speaks at the launch of their local election campaign, in London, April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nCorbyn was speaking before Prime Minister Theresa May was due to hold a cabinet meeting to discuss Britain’s response to a suspected chemical attack by Syrian government forces on the town of Douma. \n“Parliament must be consulted on this,” Corbyn said in an interview with Sky News. \n“There has to be a proper process of consultation,” he added. “The cabinet on its own should not be making this decision.” \nMay’s Conservatives do not have a majority in parliament’s House of Commons and depend on allies from the small Northern Irish DUP party to win votes. Corbyn leads Labour, the main opposition party.
