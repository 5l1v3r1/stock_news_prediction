He denies any connection with the abortive putsch. \nThe Appeals Chamber of Bosnia’s state court last month ruled against the extradition of Humeyra Gokcen on the grounds that she had requested asylum in Bosnia before Turkey had asked for her extradition. The ruling was not made public. \nIn the decision obtained by Reuters, the court also said that allegations that Gokcen was a member of a terrorist organization could not be sustained because the FETO organization has not been verified as such by resolutions of the United Nations or the Council of Europe. \nThe court did not provide more details on the case nor did it comment on whether there were other such requests for deportation. \nBut a source close to the matter confirmed to Reuters on Monday that Turkey has requested the extradition of several more people who have arrived in Bosnia after the coup attempt, over links to the schools believed to be financed by the Gulen network. \nEven though Bosnia has taken no concrete steps against these schools, some Turkish teachers have left the country under political pressure since the failed coup. \nLast month, during his visit to Sarajevo, Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that more action should be taken against Gulen’s followers there, “especially in the sectors of education and business”. \nAt its peak, the Gulen movement operated schools in 160 countries, from Afghanistan to the United States. Since the coup attempt, Turkey has pressured allies to shut down Gulen-run establishments.
