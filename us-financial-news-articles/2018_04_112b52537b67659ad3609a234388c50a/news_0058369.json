That occurred after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi presented a relatively confident outlook for the euro zone economy, boosting the euro. A weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies.\n* LONG POSITION: The speculative long position in LME aluminium was estimated to have retreated to 21 percent of open interest by Tuesday’s close, from 26 percent a day earlier, Alastair Munro at broker Marex Spectron said in a note.\n* ALUMINIUM PREMIUM: The U.S aluminium premium on Comex was at 21.4 cents per pound ($472 a tonne), down from a three-year high of 22.1 cents hit on April 11.\n* PRICES: LME copper fell 0.6 percent to close at $6,965 a tonne, lead added 1.3 percent to $2,336, nickel rose 0.4 percent to $14,200 and tin was up 0.7 percent at $21,400.\n* For the top stories in metals and other news, click or\nAdditional reporting by Tom Daly in Beijing Editing by Dale Hudson and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T17:56:42.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
