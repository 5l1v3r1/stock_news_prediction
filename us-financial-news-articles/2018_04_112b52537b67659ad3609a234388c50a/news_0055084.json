Our first quarter operating margin only declined approximately one percentage point in spite of a greater than 20 percent increase in the cost of fuel. The transition to an all-Airbus fleet has been and continues to be a substantial one-time effort. We look forward to its completion.\n“In addition, we are seeing a very positive impact from the transition to our new revenue management system. The year-over-year scheduled service load factor in March rose for the first time since 2011 without a sacrifice in March yields. Last but absolutely not least, we have continued to see a material improvement in our operations. According to the latest DOT statistics, in January our cancellation rate was the second lowest in the industry, which demonstrates our operational integrity and commitment to safety and reliability.
