Soccer Football - Premier League - AFC Bournemouth vs Tottenham Hotspur - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - March 11, 2018 Bournemouth's Junior Stanislas celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Ian Walton \nStanislas, 28, was forced off just before the half-time in the 2-2 draw with Watford in the Premier League last weekend with a knee injury. \n“Junior Stanislas is out for the season,” Howe told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s league visit of Crystal Palace. \n“He picked up a serious knee injury against Watford, so we’re looking at pre-season or the start of the season to get him back, we’re not sure yet. \n“He’s a big miss for us. The medical team worried about his cruciate but it’s an anterior injury - the better of the two evils. He’s had an operation and we’re happy at how that has gone.” Soccer Football - Premier League - Watford vs AFC Bournemouth - Vicarage Road, Watford, Britain - March 31, 2018 Bournemouth's Junior Stanislas is helped off the pitch by medical staff after sustaining an injury REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nHowe confirmed fullback Adam Smith has not recovered from his knee injury in time for the Palace match, while captain Simon Francis has returned to training from a hamstring injury and could feature in the squad this weekend. \nBournemouth are currently 10th and are just three points short of the 40-point mark, a total seen as a traditional marker for survival that would guarantee a fourth consecutive season in the top division. \n“Until it’s mathematically certain, we’re in a battle to stay in the division and I want my players to play with confidence and freedom,” Howe added. \n“It’s a huge game for us, a home game and we have got tough games coming up.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T12:53:30.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
