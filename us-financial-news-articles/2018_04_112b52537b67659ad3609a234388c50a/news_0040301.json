Queues to enter the Sistine Chapel are frequently long, with up to 20,000 people a day attempting to visit in the high tourist season in the European summer. \nBalich’s show will run until March. The Venetian artist said he was considering whether to use the format for other landmark monuments such as the Egyptian pyramids or the Great Wall of China.
