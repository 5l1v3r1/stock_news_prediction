(the “Company” or “OSI Systems”) (NASDAQ: OSIS) today announced financial results for the third quarter and nine months .\nDeepak Chopra, OSI Systems’ Chairman and CEO, stated, “Overall, we are pleased with our performance this quarter. Our Security and Optoelectronics and Manufacturing divisions delivered strong results, which were offset to some degree by softness in our Healthcare division. Our solid year-to-date performance coupled with our backlog and pipeline of opportunities position us well for a strong finish to fiscal 2018. During the quarter, we repurchased about $60 million of OSI Systems common stock through our stock buyback program.”\nThe Company reported record revenues of $267.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 9% from the $245.1 million reported for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $2.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.0 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.5 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $16.6 million, or $0.85 per diluted share.\nDuring the quarter , the Company's book-to-bill ratio was 1.4. As of March 31, 2018, the Company's backlog was approximately $938 million, compared with $738 million as of June 30, 2017. Operating cash flow during the quarter was $31.1 million, and capital expenditures were $4.4 million. For the comparable period in the prior year, operating cash flow was $33.9 million, and capital expenditures were $7.7 million. Operating cash flow for the nine months was $115.8 million, and capital expenditures were $36.4 million, as compared to $52.2 million and $12.0 million, respectively, for the comparable nine months in the prior year.\nFor the nine months , revenues increased 13% to $802.0 million compared with the same period a year ago. Net loss in this nine-month period of fiscal 2018 was $34.2 million, or $1.82 per diluted share, compared with net income of $19.5 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Non-GAAP net income for the nine months was $51.2 million, or $2.63 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $38.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, for the comparable period in the prior year.\nCommenting on the performance of each of the Company’s divisions, Mr. Chopra stated, “Our Security division achieved record third fiscal quarter revenues of $170 million, up 18% compared to a year ago. This included $17.6 million of revenues generated by our recently-acquired explosive trace detection business. We saw strong Security bookings of approximately $270 million, $130 million of which was from our new two-year contract to continue screening services in Mexico.”\nMr. Chopra continued, “Our Healthcare division faced some headwinds this quarter, and year-over-year revenues were down approximately $6 million. Excluding $1.9 million of revenues in Q3 of fiscal 2017 attributable to a non-core business divested in February 2017, Healthcare division sales were down 8% in the fiscal 2018 third quarter as compared to sales in the same prior-year period. ”\nMr. Chopra concluded, “Our Optoelectronics and Manufacturing division performed well in the quarter as year-over-year sales grew 14% with solid growth in operating income. We saw benefits to this division’s performance as increased demand from our Security division as well as a product line acquisition that was completed this quarter contributed to the growth. Overall, we are pleased with the strong consistent performance of this division.”\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017, the Company recognized a charge of $56 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, and this charge is reflected in the results for the nine months . The charge included management’s estimate of the tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final impacts of the Tax Act may differ materially from the amounts estimated due to, among other things, changes in interpretation of the Tax Act, any legislative action that may be taken to address questions arising due to the Tax Act, and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act. The Company currently anticipates finalizing and recording any resulting adjustments by the end of the 2018 calendar year.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nThe Company is raising its fiscal 2018 sales guidance to $1,065 million – $1,095 million, which would represent growth of 11% – 14% compared to the prior fiscal year. The Company is also increasing its non-GAAP earnings guidance to $3.50 – $3.69 per diluted share for fiscal 2018. Actual sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share could vary from this guidance.\nThe Company’s fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on a non-GAAP basis only. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate compilation of reconciling items and certain information is not available. This is due to the inherent difficulty, high variability, complexity and low visibility of forecasting the timing and/or amount of various items that would be excluded from GAAP diluted EPS, including, for example, acquisition costs and other non-recurring items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control, and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis earnings release includes a presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income (loss) by segment, and non-GAAP operating margin, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of these non-GAAP figures for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 is provided to allow for the comparison of the underlying performance of the Company, net of impairment, restructuring and other charges (including certain legal costs), amortization of intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, non-cash interest expense related to convertible debt, gain from the disposition of a business, and their associated tax effects, and the impact from discrete income tax items including charges resulting from the Tax Act. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide (i) additional insight into the ongoing operations of the Company, (ii) meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s results (excluding amounts management does not view as reflective of ongoing operating results) for purposes of planning, forecasting and assessing the performance of the business, (iii) a meaningful comparison of results of current periods against results of past periods, and (iv) financial results that are comparable to those of peer companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be assessed in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\nReconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial information are provided in the accompanying tables. The financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from those financial results should be carefully evaluated.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast beginning at 1:30 pm PT (4:30 pm ET) today to discuss its results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
