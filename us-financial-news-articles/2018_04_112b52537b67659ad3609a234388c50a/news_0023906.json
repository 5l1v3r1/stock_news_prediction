Equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded $4.5 billion in withdrawals during the week ended April 4, according to the trade group. Debt funds took in $3 billion. During the week, investors puzzled over how the U.S.-China trade conflict would affect markets. U.S. stocks gained on Tuesday following a promise by Chinese President Xi Jinping to open the country's economy further, but struggled to extend those gains the next day as U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack. \"It's hard to tell what to watch because it seems like it's changing so regularly. First it's trade, then it's geopolitics, and it used to be tax cuts,\" said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers LP, referring to the U.S. tax cut enacted in late 2017. \"It doesn't seem like the markets can settle on a narrative at this point.\" The S&P 500 has recorded 29 days of declines in 68 full trading sessions in 2018, with its return falling just under 1 percent in price terms for the year. Day-to-day swings in price and sentiment have sent investors to the refuge of international stocks. Funds focused on domestic companies posted a third straight week of withdrawals, with $6 billion cashed out, ICI said. Funds invested in shares outside the United States attracted $1.5 billion, adding a 70th straight week to their successful fundraising streak.
