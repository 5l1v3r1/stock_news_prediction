Now, the Chinese will add a 25% tariff on 106 items that target products the country imports from the U.S. most often. \nThe list includes soybeans, automobiles, chemicals, and aircraft — some of the largest trade categories between the two nations. \nThe Dow Futures were down 365 points when the market opened , in a drop driven by all 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. \nThe company’s (ba) shares were down nearly 3% as of 11 a.m. EST, but the ultimate scope of the impact on the aerospace giant depends on some key definitions in the new tariffs from China. \nThese tariffs will affect older, narrowbody Boeing jets, but due to a lack of specificity in the announcement Wednesday, it is not yet clear if the company’s 737 MAX family will be affected. \nChina’s Ministry of Commerce issued the tariffs against aircraft with an “empty weight” of between 15,000 kilograms and 45,000 kilograms (15 to 45 tonnes) , according to Reuters . But the documents announcing these measures did not define the term. \nIt’s possible that they could apply to Boeing’s new big-selling 737 MAX 8 jet and not its larger MAX 9 and MAX 10 models. \nThe Gulfstream 650, produced by General Dynamics , also falls within the “empty weight” range targeted. \nMany of the unfilled orders to China for 737s are for the MAX models which are replacing the older, narrower aircraft that will definitely be subject to the new tariffs.
