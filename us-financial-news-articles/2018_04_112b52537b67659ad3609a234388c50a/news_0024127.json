Andrew McCutchen knocked in a run with an infield out, and Buster Posey followed with a two-run homer, his second long ball of the season.\nArizona starter Robbie Ray was pulled at that point, having allowed five hits and three runs in 4 2/3 innings. He walked three and struck out six in a no-decision.\nSuarez allowed a one-out double to Marte in the sixth before handing the ball off to Dyson, whose second pitch was bombed to deep center field by Goldschmidt for the go-ahead two-bagger.\nSuarez (0-1) was charged with four runs on four hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out seven and did not walk a batter.\nThe Diamondbacks turned the game into a rout with a three-run seventh, Murphy and pinch hitter Daniel Descalso providing a run apiece with consecutive doubles, and Marte making it a 7-3 game with a two-out, RBI single.\nMarte (three), Goldschmidt (two) and Murphy (two) combined for seven of Arizona’s nine hits. Goldschmidt finished with three RBIs.\nFive Diamondbacks relievers combined for 4 1/3 innings of one-hit, scoreless ball, with Fernando Salas (2-1) earning the win.\nPosey had two hits for the Giants, who completed a 3-4 homestand.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:48:46.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
