REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo \nA PSA spokesman declined to comment on Luton production plans or on a Bloomberg report that the auto group was ending the existing van partnership between Opel/Vauxhall and French rival Renault ( RENA.PA ), which also declined to comment. \nLuton builds the current Opel/Vauxhall Vivaro van model on technical underpinnings shared with Renault’s Trafic model, which has also been assembled at the UK plant in the past. \nPSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares is expected to announce new van production plans during a visit to the factory on Wednesday. \nRight-hand-drive variants of the Peugeot Expert and Citroen Jumpy models will be built in Luton alongside future versions of the Vivaro, the company source told Reuters. PSA acquired Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors ( GM.N ) last year.
