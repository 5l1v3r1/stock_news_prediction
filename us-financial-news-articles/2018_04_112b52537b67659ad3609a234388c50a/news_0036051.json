U.S.-based equity funds collected $5.2 billion in new cash during the seven days ended April 11, according to the trade group, following three weeks of punishing withdrawals of tens of billions of dollars. More than $6.2 billion of cash moved into exchange-traded funds, which are used heavily by quick-traded institutional investors. That was slightly offset by more than $1 billion pulled from mutual funds favored by buy-and-hold retail investors, ICI data showed. During the week, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to cut import tariffs, giving succor to investors worried about a clash between the world's two biggest economies. Investors are looking ahead to strong profit results expected from an earnings season now underway. \"We're going to see rising corporate earnings, and the economy is certainly humming,\" said Rick Platte, chief investment officer of Schwartz Investment Counsel Inc, which manages Ave Maria Mutual Funds. \"It seems like corporations are optimistic. Consumers, generally, are optimistic.\" Some $6.5 billion poured into bond funds during the same weekly period, representing the largest haul for those funds in four weeks, according to ICI. The data revealed a move to take more risk in bonds as well. Demand for relatively low-risk municipal bond funds, backed by government debt, sank to $696 million of withdrawals, the most that has been pulled from those products since January 2017, ICI said. Earlier data for the same week from Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit showed strong demand during the week for corporate bonds, including riskier high-yield debt. Funds invested in commodities, such as gold, took in $1.1 billion during the seven-day period, their best showing in 11 weeks.
