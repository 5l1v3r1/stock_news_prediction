The 20 percent growth cuts across this and by doing so, we will ultimately be growing our bottom line,” he added.\nHe cited calmer politics, along with an anticipated uptick in government spending on infrastructure and other projects, as reasons why growth would be stronger this year.\nIncreased foreign direct investment, tourism inflows and diaspora remittances would also drive growth, he said.\nJubilee Insurance offers a broad range of insurance products, including life, medical, home, motor and travel policies, as well as personal pension plans.\nKenya has dozens of licensed insurance companies, but few compete with Jubilee Insurance, suggesting consolidation is needed, analysts say. Some large international insurers including Allianz and Swiss Re have entered the market in recent years.\nJubilee Insurance also has to compete with emerging insurance models piloted by tech start-ups and catering to groups like farmers and other low-income populations.\nKipng’etich took over as CEO of the insurance conglomerate in January after resigning from the loss-making Kenyan supermarket chain Uchumi.\nJubilee Holdings is the parent company of five insurance businesses that operate in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Mauritius. It claims total assets of over $1 billion and has more than 500,000 clients across its five markets.
