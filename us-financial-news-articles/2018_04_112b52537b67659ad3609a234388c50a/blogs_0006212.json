The company believes most of its users who had a specific search function enabled have had their profile data scraped.\nThe content and delivery of Zuckerberg's message Wednesday gave the first optimistic outlook for the company in weeks, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note Thursday. \n\"Zuckerberg's comments to reporters Wednesday afternoon suggesting it has not seen any meaningful user or advertiser impact, and his tone with reporters, suggest to us that the worst is likely behind [Facebook],\" Deutsche Bank said. \nThe firm expects to hear more details about the issue, and further data policy changes, from Zuckerberg when the company reports its first quarter earnings. \nZuckerberg also said data from 87 million users had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political research firm that provided information to the Trump presidential campaign. Earlier, it was estimated that data from 50 million users had been harvested without authorization. \nWATCH: Facebook's Zuckerberg takes questions from reporters show chapters Facebook's Zuckerberg takes questions from reporters      6 Hours Ago | 01:14", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T15:25:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
