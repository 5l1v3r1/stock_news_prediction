REUTERS/Marco Bello For a chart: tmsnrt.rs/2qrrmT3\nThe range is formed by the 61.8 percent and the 50 percent projection levels of a downward wave C from $9,188. A break below $6,492 could confirm the extension of this wave towards $5,855.\nThe bias may be towards the upside, as bitcoin has broken above the trendline falling from $11,682. A small double-bottom has also formed around $6,492. However, this pattern needs to be confirmed when bitcoin breaks above $7,007. The break will lead to a gain to $7,522.\nReporting by Wang Tao; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2qrrmT3", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T11:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:45:21.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
