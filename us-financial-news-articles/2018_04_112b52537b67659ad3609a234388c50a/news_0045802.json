(NASDAQ:RCKY) today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Sales and Income\nFirst quarter net sales were $61.4 million compared to $63.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The Company reported first quarter net income of $3.3 million, or $0.44 per diluted share compared to a net income of $1.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nJason Brooks, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The new year is off to a strong start. Our wholesale and retail divisions continue to benefit from the strategies we’ve implemented to drive improved full price selling across our core work, western and outdoor categories. At the same time, our commercial military business grew double digits over the same period last year as our domestic and international expansion plans gain further traction. The growth in commercial military sales partially offset the expected top-line headwinds from our contract military business while also helping expand gross margins through increased productivity at our company-owned manufacturing facilities. We are very pleased with our recent performance and the Company’s strong financial position. That said, our sights are firmly focused on the future and on continuing to deliver enhanced profitability and greater value for our shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter Review\nNet sales for the first quarter were $61.4 million compared to $63.1 million a year ago. Wholesale sales for the first quarter increased 3.2% to $40.4 million compared to $39.2 million for the same period in 2017. Retail sales for the first quarter increased 10.0% to $13.1 million compared to $11.9 million for the same period last year. Military segment sales for the first quarter were $7.9 million compared to $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nGross margin in the first quarter of 2018 increased to $21.0 million, or 34.2% of sales, compared to $19.7 million, or 31.3% of sales, for the same period last year. The 290 basis point increase was driven by higher wholesale and military margins combined with a lower percentage of military sales, which carry lower gross margins than wholesale and retail sales.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to $16.7 million, or 27.3% of net sales, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $17.4 million, or 27.6% of net sales, a year ago. The $0.6 million decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily related to the reduction in expenses related to the Creative Recreation brand, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations increased 78.7% to $4.2 million, or 6.9% of net sales compared to income from operations of $2.4 million a year ago.\nInterest expense was $47,000 for the first quarter of 2018, versus $90,000 for the same period last year.\nIncome tax expense was estimated at 20.5% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 34.0% for the first quarter of 2017 due to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).\nThe Company had no funded debt at March 31, 2018 versus $5.2 million at March 31, 2017.\nInventory at March 31, 2018 decreased 5.3% to $65.2 million compared to $68.8 million on the same date a year ago.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company’s conference call to review first quarter 2018 results will be broadcast live over the internet today, Tuesday, April 24, 2018 at 4:30 pm Eastern Time.
