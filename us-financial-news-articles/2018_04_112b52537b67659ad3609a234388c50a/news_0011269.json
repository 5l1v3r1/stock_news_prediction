Prosecutors say she died either by strangulation or by having her throat cut.\nHe denies murdering Wall, although he admits he cut up her body so he could get it out of the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine. He intended to dispose of the body parts at sea to restore a “normal” condition on board, he said, adding that he was not thinking rationally at the time.\nMadsen has changed his explanation several times, initially saying Wall died after hitting her head on a submarine hatch.\nHe later changed his explanation, saying she had been killed by exhaust gases caused by a defect in the submarine, claiming the initial explanation was to protect the deceased’s relatives from the details.\nMadsen has said a defect in the submarine caused the submarine hatch to lock while he was on deck and Kim Wall was inside. The defect also filled the submarine with exhaust gases which killed Wall, he claims.\nHowever, the amount of gas produced in the submarine, should Madsen’s explanation be true, would not have been lethal, Ditte Dyreborg told the court.\nMadsen could face up to life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder. Most life sentences in Denmark end in 14 to 16 years.
