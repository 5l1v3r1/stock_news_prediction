The company also beat 2018 projections for the quarter. Splash was founded in December 2014, and the company has now been profitable every month since October 2015—30 straight months.\n“We are pleased by the results,” said Robert Imeson, Splash Wines Founder and CEO. “It is a rarity in our industry for a company at this stage of development to break even. We have now been profitable since October 2015 and haven’t looked back.” Imeson added that “while we have accomplished a lot, we have a lot more in front of us. We are truly just beginning.”\nThe direct-to-consumer wine market in the USA is red hot, now accounting for almost 10% of total wine sales and last year reached over $2.5 billion. Millennials are now the largest consumers of wine, which bodes well for the segment since they will be around a long time and are very comfortable with making online purchases. The Splash model, featuring transparent pricing, free shipping and economic 15-bottle cases, was a hit from the outset. “We are in the right place at the right time, but it is more than that,” stated Splash Marketing Director Garrett Imeson. “The simplicity of the Splash concept of delivering great wines at phenomenal prices supported by top-notch customer service is gaining serious traction, and that makes it fun. We bring passion to the job every day and it shows.”\nSplash Wines recently opened up investments to the general public to further grow the business. Seedinvest, a leading US crowdfunding platform, is managing the offering and anyone can invest.
