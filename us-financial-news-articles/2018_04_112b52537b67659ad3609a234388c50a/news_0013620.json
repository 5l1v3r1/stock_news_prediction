REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger “Theoretically everything is still possible as we don’t know the data yet ... but in Hungary a two-thirds victory is possible if neither side loses more than 10 districts and there is a difference of at least 20 percent between the winner and the runner-up,” Gulyas said.\n“I consider this unlikely. I think this is outside the category of reality.”\nReporting by Gergely Szakacs and Krisztina Than.
