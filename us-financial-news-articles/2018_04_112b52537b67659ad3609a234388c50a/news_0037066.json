Strong interest from foreign investors and local funds has pushed up the benchmark index .VNI by 17 percent so far this year, making it one of Asia’s best performers after rising nearly 50 percent last year.\nReuters reported last week that Vietnam Technological and Commercial Joint Stock Bank launched an IPO that aims to raise as much as $922 million and has attracted global funds, including GIC, as cornerstone investors.\nVingroup is a diversified company, operating in real estate, education, healthcare, entertainment, retailing, agriculture and automobile manufacturing sectors.\nLast year, Warburg Pincus-backed Vincom Retail JSC VRE.HM, Vietnam’s biggest shopping mall operator and a unit of Vingroup, raised roughly $700 million through an equity offering.\nReporting by Khanh Vu and Anshuman Daga; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T07:45:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
