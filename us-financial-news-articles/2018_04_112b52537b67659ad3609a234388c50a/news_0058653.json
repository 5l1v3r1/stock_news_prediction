Stevens said the major driver was the amount of factory downtime the automaker needed to retool factories for truck manufacturing.\nStevens said he expects strong performance in the second quarter, but the continued switch to trucks will likely hurt second half results.\nLike its rival Ford , GM has been shifting its portfolio away from passenger cars and toward trucks, SUVs and crossovers, which combine elements of cars and SUVs.\nThe largest U.S. automaker has been cutting shifts at some factories that make passenger cars, such as its plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which makes the compact Chevrolet Cruze sedan. At the same time, it has added a shift at its Spring Hill assembly plant in Tennessee to meet demand for the GMC Acadia and Cadillac XT5 crossovers.\nSUVs and trucks went from less than 50 percent of the U.S. market in 2008 to 65 percent e at the end of 2017 and are expected to further grow in popularity, according to LMC Automotive.\nSome changes among executive ranks are happening as well. The president of GM's luxury brand Cadillac Johan de Nysschen was abruptly replaced in mid-April by GM Canada executive Steve Carlisle . Cadillac has lagged other brands in the SUV and crossover segments, which has been a source of frustration for some dealers. Cadillac plans to release its third SUV, the XT4, in late 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:36:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
