The Chevron Richmond leak was caused by corrosion.\nCDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock from all other units. VDUs take residual crude oil from CDUs and refine it at vacuum pressure.\nAlkylation units convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.\nHydrotreaters extract hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. Sulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T09:23:31.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
