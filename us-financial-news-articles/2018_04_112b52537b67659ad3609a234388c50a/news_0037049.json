The life-long diabetic was treated by paramedics for low blood sugar at her home in Washington in January. \nSotomayor, one of the nine-member court’s four liberal justices, was named to the court in 2009 by Democratic former President Barack Obama. She is the first Hispanic justice to serve on the court. \n“Justice Sotomayor plans to continue with her schedule as usual,” Arberg said. \nReporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T17:25:26.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
