I feel like the game is in really good shape and (I’ve) got a lot of confidence coming into here this week.” \nJohnson, 33, has already won once during the PGA Tour’s 2017-18 wraparound season along with two second-place finishes. Slideshow (2 Images) \nPrior to crashing out of the World Golf Championship-Dell Technologies Match Play event in Austin 11 days ago, Johnson’s worst finish in five starts this season was a tie for 16th at the Genesis Open. \nWhile not quite as hot as last year when he arrived at the Masters on the back of victories in three consecutive starts against strong fields, Johnson has plenty to feel good about going into the season’s first major. \nWhen asked to rate his confidence on a scale of one-to-10, the American left no doubt that he is nearly as upbeat this year as he was in 2017. \n“Well, last year I was about as confident as I’ve ever been, so it was probably a 10. This year it’s probably a nine and a half,” said Johnson, a 17-times winner on the PGA Tour. \nDespite being squarely focused on claiming a second major title after his U.S. Open triumph in 2016, Johnson said it was hard not to recall last year’s freak accident while preparing this week at Augusta National. \n“I get asked about it every day out here on the range or walking down the fairway so I’m reminded all the time. So, yeah, I definitely was thinking about it,” he said. \n“It was kind of just a freak thing and it happened, there’s nothing I can do about it except I’m here this year, hopefully I can tee it up on Thursday, and (I’ll) definitely be looking forward to that.” Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T01:28:17.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
