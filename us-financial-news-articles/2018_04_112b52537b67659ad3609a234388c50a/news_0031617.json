It also improves the precision and speed of processing and thereby reduces operational costs.\nAccording to a senior analyst at Technavio for research on food service , “A complex robotic system may be controlled using a programmable logic controller, but a simple robotic system is operated without using a PLC. Some of the prominent players in the confectionery and candy processing equipment offer robotic technology for industrial end-users.”\nGlobal market opportunities\nRegarding regional dominance, the Americas led the global confectionery and candy processing equipment market , followed by EMEA and APAC in 2017. In the Americas, the increase in government support for confectionery and candy processing activities and the corresponding expansion of processing facilities has led to the dominance of this region. This factor is expected to propel the market growth of confectionery and candy processing equipment in this region in the coming years.\nIn EMEA, some of the confectionery and candy processing companies have been focusing on mergers and acquisitions to strengthen their presence in the market. These acquisitions will aid in augmenting the production capacities of the companies involved, which would lead to a significant demand for confectionery and candy processing equipment.\nTechnavio’s best deals of the month!\nTechnavio supports Health for All campaign on this World Health Day with 20% savings on all reports in the Health and Wellness category for the entire month.\nOR\nCelebrate International Astronomy Day by indulging in a whopping 30% savings on all reports in the Space category .
