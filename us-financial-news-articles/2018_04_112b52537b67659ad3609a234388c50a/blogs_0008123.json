Get the scoop from past employees \nTo get a better understanding of the company you're interviewing for, Aujla recommends finding a few people who used to work there that have since moved on and reach out to them about the possible manager. \nEither through email or LinkedIn, tell those former employees something along the lines of, \"I am doing some referencing and saw that you worked at [this company] during [whatever years] and was wondering if you would have ten minutes to talk with me about [your future boss's name.]\" \n\"Be open and tell this person that you are considering working with his or her previous employer and ask what the team there is like to work with, what motivates the company and what the internal dynamics within the company are,\" Aujla writes. \nIf it seems appropriate, Aujla recommends asking the person why he or she left the company. Talk to the future boss's boss \nYour first step in getting a feel for what a future boss is like is to \"aim higher than you expect.\" \nAujla's rule of thumb: If the company you're applying to is made up of less than 60 employees, reach out to the CEO or the department you would like to work in. If the company is bigger than that, find your future boss and talk to the person who is directly above him or her. \n\"It is better to be passed down than to be passed over,\" Aujla writes. Email your potential boss \nGiven you likely don't know your potential boss, you'll have to send them a cold email . \nAujla recommends that you first \"follow their online trail\" by reading any publications, articles or projects they share on their personal websites. \nAlthough sending a cold email is a gamble, doing your research will prepare you to know their background and allow them to engage with you when you reach out. \nOnly after completing your research should you reach out to your potential boss, Aujla notes. \nThis email should demonstrate how you've not only done your research, but you also have what it takes to succeed at that company. \nAujla recommends making this a unique, roughly four-paragraph email that covers the following bases: demonstrate your skill, prove how your mission aligns with the company, tell them what you want to accomplish at the company and finally ask for the opportunity to talk. \n\"The employer won't do the work to understand your story, but you can,\" Aujla writes, \"and the employer will not only notice but hire you because of it.\" \nNotably, according to a 2015 LinkedIn report , much of our job searches take place online: 60 percent of people are using online job boards like Glassdoor and Indeed and 56 percent are using social professional networks like LinkedIn, but Aujla notes that \"judging and finding the right personality in a boss is impossible to do online.\" \n\"It will happen in conversations as you walk your path, while you're learning and asking questions,\" he writes, making it \"hard to know if your future boss is a personality fit until you meet him or her.\" \nWhen you get the opportunity to meet your potential boss in person, keep in mind that these \"meetings are not just one-sided transactions,\" Aujla writes. \n\"A major part of a boss's job is hiring and developing a pool of great talent,\" Aujla adds, \"the boss needs to meet you too.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:25:05.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
