But Netanyahu on Monday unveiled tens of thousands of pages of documents that he said undercut those claims.\n\"Tonight I'm here to tell you one thing. Iran lied, big time,\" he said.\nNetanyahu's office billed the televised statement as a \"significant development\" regarding the Iran nuclear deal, but it largely presented evidence to prove what the world long ago accepted: that Iran sought to develop nuclear arms.\nThat acknowledgement marshaled international support for a U.S. campaign to impose a tough series of sanctions against Iran. The impact of those sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table and ultimately led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.\nNetanyahu's remarks come less than two weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump must decide whether to continue suspending sanctions against Iran under that deal, or restore the penalties on one of the world's biggest oil producers.\nAmir Cohen | Reuters Israeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a news conference at the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv, Israel, April 30, 2018. The files presented by Netanyahu were allegedly copied from a \"highly secret location\" in Iran. They detail Project Amad, which Netanyahu described as \"a comprehensive program to design, build and test nuclear weapons.\"\nHe said the files provided \"new and conclusive proof of the secret nuclear weapons program that Iran has been hiding for years from the international community in its secret atomic archive.\"\nHelima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said Netanyahu's statement appeared timed to make sure Trump does not extend the sanctions waivers next week.\nIn a tweet, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif accused Netanyahu of resurfacing \"old allegations\" already fielded by the International Atomic Energy Agency ahead of Trump's decision in a bid to \"nix\" the nuclear deal.\n@JZarif: Pres. Trump is jumping on a rehash of old allegations already dealt with by the IAEA to \"nix\" the deal. How convenient. Coordinated timing of alleged intelligence revelations by the boy who cries wolf just days before May 12. But Trump's impetuousness to celebrate blew the cover.\nThe televised announcement followed a meeting this past weekend between Netanyahu and newly sworn-in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a prominent Iran hawk.\n\"We've shared this material with the United States and the United States can vouch for its authenticity,\" Netanyahu said on Monday.\nThe Obama administration negotiated the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 along with China, France, Germany, Russia and the U.K. The accord lifted a series of sanctions against Iran in exchange for Tehran accepting limits on its nuclear program and allowing international investigators access to its facilities.\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency and the signatories to the agreement, including Trump, have repeatedly confirmed that Iran is complying with the deal as it is written.\nBut the Trump administration, Israel and foreign policy hawks have long argued that the accord itself is flawed. Last year, the White House announced a major policy shift aimed at working with U.S. lawmakers and European partners to toughen the nuclear deal.\nIn January, Trump waived sanctions against Iran , but said he would not suspend them when the next deadline arrived on May 12 unless the United States and Europe had agreed on a path forward.\nThe European partners are open to starting new talks with Iran, but want to preserve the existing deal. Russia and China also continue to back the accord.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is working with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to salvage the deal , following Macron's meeting with Trump last week. At the end of his visit to Washington, Macron said he believes Trump will leave the nuclear deal for \"domestic reasons.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T20:42:48.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
