Net interest revenue increased 16% driven by higher interest rates and higher deposits. Noninterest expense increased 4% reflecting the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher staff expense and volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expenses, partially offset by lower consulting expense.

Net interest revenue increased in most businesses primarily driven by higher interest rates. The other drivers of net interest revenue and fee revenue by line of business are indicated below. Asset Servicing - Both increases primarily reflect higher net interest revenue due in part to an increase in deposit balances, higher fees driven by an increase in volumes, market values and foreign exchange volumes, as well as the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Pershing - Both increases primarily reflect higher net interest revenue and higher fees due to growth in long-term mutual fund balances and clearance volumes. Issuer Services - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher net interest revenue in Corporate Trust as well as the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher Depositary Receipts revenue. Treasury Services - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and payment volumes. Clearance and Collateral Management - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth in collateral management, higher clearance volumes and net interest revenue. Both noninterest expense comparisons reflect higher technology costs, the unfavorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar and higher volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expense. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by lower consulting expenses. The sequential decrease is primarily due to lower severance, litigation and an asset impairment recorded in 4Q17.\nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n(dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted; not meaningful - N/M)\n1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nTotal revenue by line of business: (a)\nAsset Management\n$\n770\n$\n738\n$\n661\n4\n%\n16\n%\nWealth Management\n318\n310\n302\n3\n5\nTotal revenue by line of business\n1,088\n1,048\n963\n4\n13\nProvision for credit losses\n2\n1\n3\nN/M\nN/M\nNoninterest expense\n705\n771\n683\n(9)\n3\nIncome before taxes\n$\n381\n$\n276\n$\n277\n38\n%\n38\n%\nPre-tax operating margin\n35\n%\n26\n%\n29\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax operating margin – Non-GAAP (b)\n39\n%\n29\n%\n32\n%\nMetrics:\nAverage loans\n$\n16,876\n$\n16,813\n$\n16,153\n—\n%\n4\n%\nAverage deposits\n$\n13,363\n$\n11,633\n$\n15,781\n15\n%\n(15)\n%\nWealth Management client assets (in billions) (current period is preliminary) (c)\n$\n246\n$\n251\n$\n236\n(2)\n%\n4\n%\nChanges in AUM (in billions) (current period is preliminary) : (d)\nBeginning balance of AUM\n$\n1,893\n$\n1,824\n$\n1,648\nNet inflows (outflows):\nLong-term strategies:\nEquity\n—\n(6)\n(4)\nFixed income\n7\n(2)\n2\nLiability-driven investments, including currency overlay\n13\n23\n14\nMulti-asset and alternative investments\n(3)\n2\n2\nTotal long-term active strategies inflows\n17\n17\n14\nIndex\n(13)\n(1)\n—\nTotal long-term strategies inflows\n4\n16\n14\nShort term strategies:\nCash\n(14)\n(4)\n13\nTotal net (outflows) inflows\n(10)\n12\n27\nNet market impact\n(14)\n47\n41\nNet currency impact\n29\n10\n11\nDivestiture/Other (e)\n(30)\n—\n—\nEnding balance of AUM\n$\n1,868\n$\n1,893\n$\n1,727\n(1)\n%\n8\n%\n(a)\nSee \"Change in Presentation\" on page 13 for additional information on the Investment Management business.\n(b)\nNet of distribution and servicing expense.

Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing\nexpense categories, primarily other expense.\nKEY DRIVERS\nThe year-over-year increase primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher staff expense driven by the annual merit increase that was effective in July 2017 and higher performance-based incentives. The-year-over-year increase also reflects higher volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expenses, which were partially offset by lower consulting expense.\nThe sequential decrease reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories. The decrease primarily reflects severance, litigation and an asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher incentives due to the impact of vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.\nTHE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION\nCondensed Consolidated Income Statement\nQuarter ended\n(in millions)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nFee and other revenue\nInvestment services fees:\nAsset servicing\n$\n1,168\n$\n1,130\n$\n1,063\nClearing services\n414\n400\n376\nIssuer services\n260\n197\n251\nTreasury services\n138\n137\n139\nTotal investment services fees\n1,980\n1,864\n1,829\nInvestment management and performance fees\n960\n962\n842\nForeign exchange and other trading revenue\n209\n166\n164\nFinancing-related fees\n52\n54\n55\nDistribution and servicing\n36\n38\n41\nInvestment and other income (loss)\n82\n(198)\n77\nTotal fee revenue\n3,319\n2,886\n3,008\nNet securities (losses) gains\n(49)\n(26)\n10\nTotal fee and other revenue\n3,270\n2,860\n3,018\nOperations of consolidated investment management funds\nInvestment (loss) income\n(11)\n17\n37\nInterest of investment management fund note holders\n—\n—\n4\n(Loss) income from consolidated investment management funds\n(11)\n17\n33\nNet interest revenue\nInterest revenue\n1,381\n1,219\n960\nInterest expense\n462\n368\n168\nNet interest revenue\n919\n851\n792\nTotal revenue\n4,178\n3,728\n3,843\nProvision for credit losses\n(5)\n(6)\n(5)\nNoninterest expense\nStaff (a)\n1,576\n1,628\n1,488\nProfessional, legal and other purchased services\n291\n339\n313\nSoftware and equipment\n234\n297\n223\nNet occupancy\n139\n153\n136\nSub-custodian and clearing (b)\n119\n102\n103\nDistribution and servicing\n106\n106\n100\nBank assessment charges\n52\n53\n57\nBusiness development\n51\n66\n51\nAmortization of intangible assets\n49\n52\n52\nOther (a)(b)(c)\n122\n210\n119\nTotal noninterest expense\n2,739\n3,006\n2,642\nIncome\nIncome before income taxes\n1,444\n728\n1,206\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n282\n(453)\n269\nNet income\n1,162\n1,181\n937\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (includes $11, $(9) and $(18) related to consolidated\ninvestment management funds, respectively)\n9\n(6)\n(15)\nNet income applicable to shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n1,171\n1,175\n922\nPreferred stock dividends\n(36)\n(49)\n(42)\nNet income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n$\n1,135\n$\n1,126\n$\n880\n(a)\nIn 1Q18, we adopted new accounting guidance included in ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Improving the\nPresentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which required the reclassification\nof the components of pension and other post-retirement costs, other than the service cost component.

Tangible common shareholders' equity excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure is an additional useful measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.\nBNY Mellon has presented the operating margin for the Investment Management business net of distribution and servicing expense that is passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. BNY Mellon believes that this measure is useful when evaluating the business's performance relative to industry competitors.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the return on common equity and tangible common equity.\nReturn on common equity and tangible common equity reconciliation\n(dollars in millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNet income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation – GAAP\n$\n1,135\n$\n1,126\n$\n880\nAdd: Amortization of intangible assets\n49\n52\n52\nLess: Tax impact of amortization of intangible assets\n12\n18\n18\nAdjusted net income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon\nCorporation, excluding amortization of intangible assets – Non-GAAP\n$\n1,172\n$\n1,160\n$\n914\nAverage common shareholders' equity\n$\n37,593\n$\n36,952\n$\n34,965\nLess: Average goodwill\n17,581\n17,518\n17,338\nAverage intangible assets\n3,397\n3,437\n3,578\nAdd: Deferred tax liability – tax deductible goodwill (a)\n1,042\n1,034\n1,518\nDeferred tax liability – intangible assets (a)\n716\n718\n1,100\nAverage tangible common shareholders' equity – Non-GAAP\n$\n18,373\n$\n17,749\n$\n16,667\nReturn on common equity (annualized) – GAAP\n12.2\n%\n12.1\n%\n10.2\n%\nReturn on tangible common equity (annualized) – Non-GAAP\n25.9\n%\n25.9\n%\n22.2\n%\n(a) Deferred tax liabilities, for the prior periods, are based on fully phased-in U.S. capital rules.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the book value and tangible book value per common share.\nBook value and tangible book value per common share reconciliation\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\n(dollars in millions except common shares)\n2018\n2017\n2017\nBNY Mellon shareholders' equity at period end – GAAP\n$\n41,728\n$\n41,251\n$\n39,138\nLess: Preferred stock\n3,542\n3,542\n3,542\nBNY Mellon common shareholders' equity at period end – GAAP\n38,186\n37,709\n35,596\nLess: Goodwill\n17,596\n17,564\n17,355\nIntangible assets\n3,370\n3,411\n3,549\nAdd: Deferred tax liability – tax deductible goodwill (a)\n1,042\n1,034\n1,518\nDeferred tax liability – intangible assets (a)\n716\n718\n1,100\nBNY Mellon tangible common shareholders' equity at period end – Non-GAAP\n$\n18,978\n$\n18,486\n$\n17,310\nPeriod-end common shares outstanding (in thousands)\n1,010,676\n1,013,442\n1,039,877\nBook value per common share – GAAP\n$\n37.78\n$\n37.21\n$\n34.23\nTangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP\n$\n18.78\n$\n18.24\n$\n16.65\n(a) Deferred tax liabilities, for the prior periods, are based on fully phased-in U.S. capital rules.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the pre-tax operating margin for the Investment Management business.\nPre-tax operating margin reconciliation - Investment Management business\n(dollars in millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nIncome before income taxes – GAAP\n$\n381\n$\n276\n$\n277\nTotal revenue – GAAP\n$\n1,088\n$\n1,048\n$\n963\nLess: Distribution and servicing expense\n110\n107\n101\nAdjusted total revenue, net of distribution and servicing expense – Non-GAAP\n$\n978\n$\n941\n$\n862\nPre-tax operating margin – GAAP (a)\n35\n%\n26\n%\n29\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax operating margin, net of distribution and servicing expense – Non-GAAP (a)\n39\n%\n29\n%\n32\n%\n(a) Income before taxes divided by total revenue.\nThe following table presents the impact of U.S. tax legislation and other charges recorded in 4Q17.\nAmounts included in 4Q17 results\n(dollars in millions except earnings per share)\nU.S. tax\nlegislation\nOther\ncharges\n(a)\nFee and other revenue\n$\n(279)\n$\n(37)\nIncome from consolidated investment management funds\n—\n—\nNet interest revenue\n(4)\n—\nTotal revenue\n(283)\n(37)\nProvision for credit losses\n—\n—\nTotal noninterest expense\n—\n282\nIncome before taxes\n(283)\n(319)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n(710)\n(73)\nNet income\n$\n427\n$\n(246)\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.41\n$\n(0.24)\n(a) Other charges include severance, litigation, an asset impairment and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities.\nCHANGE IN PRESENTATION\nIn 1Q18, we began presenting total revenue for each of the primary lines of business in our two principal businesses.
