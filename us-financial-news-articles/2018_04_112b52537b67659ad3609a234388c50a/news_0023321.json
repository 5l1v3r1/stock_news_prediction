Gustavel, Executive Chairman of Idaho Independent Bank (“IIB” or the “Bank”) (OTC Pink:IIBK), announced IIB’s unaudited, consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nMr. Gustavel reported that IIB’s net income for the quarter was $1.4 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, compared to net income of $783,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. “The improvement was primarily due to loan and deposit growth, improved yields on earning assets, and a lower corporate income tax rate,” Chairman Gustavel stated. Gustavel noted that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, lowered the Bank’s top federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% and will be a significant benefit to IIB in 2018 and into the future.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank's total assets were $698.8 million, an increase of $32.2 million, or 4.8%, when compared to March 31, 2017. Total loans, including loans held-for-sale, increased $36.2 million, or 11.0%, to $365.8 million; while deposits and repurchase agreements increased $29.8 million, or 5.0%, to $614.3 million over the same timeframe. As of March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $6.2 million, or 1.7% of total loans, excluding loans held-for-sale, and nonperforming assets continued to be less than 0.3% of total assets.\nAs of quarter end, the Bank’s stockholders' equity to average total assets was 10.0%, and IIB’s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory thresholds required to be considered “Well-Capitalized.” During the quarter, the Bank purchased 3,715 shares of its common stock at a cost of $46,080. IIB may still purchase shares worth up to $774,000 under its current buyback approval.\nIIB will file its Consolidated Report of Condition and Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, (\"Call Report\") with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by April 30, 2018, and will be available on the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council website at http://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/ .\nAbout IIB\nIIB was established in 1993 as an Idaho state-chartered, commercial bank that operates branches in Boise (3), Caldwell, Coeur d’Alene, Hayden, Meridian, Mountain Home, Nampa, Star, and Sun Valley/Ketchum, Idaho.
