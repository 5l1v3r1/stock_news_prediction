Resuming sanctions would likely kill the deal.\nRussia, China, Germany, Britain and France, which all struck the accord with Iran and the United States, see the deal as the best way to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb.

Trump has called on Gulf countries to provide funding and troops to stabilize areas once controlled by the group in Syria.\nPompeo was one of the first Trump administration officials to visit Saudi Arabia early in his tenure as CIA director.\nIn Riyadh, Pompeo was greeted on the tarmac by Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. He is expected to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and King Salman during the visit.
