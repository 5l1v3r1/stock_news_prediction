The 40-year yield was down 1 basis point at 0.845 percent, also the lowest since December 2016. \nThe benchmark 10-year JGB yield edged up 1 basis point to 0.030 percent, tracking an overnight rise in U.S. Treasury yields. \nAs the 10-year yield nudged higher while super-long JGB yields fell, the yield curve flattened. \nU.S. Treasury yields rose overnight as stock markets firmed and as investors looked ahead to Fridayâ€™s closely watched employment report for March.
