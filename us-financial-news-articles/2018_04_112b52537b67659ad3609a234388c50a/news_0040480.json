A meeting of ERS’s supervisory board is underway.\nLocal media have reported the state-run utility suffered a loss of 47.8 million Bosnian marka ($30.3 million) due to suspicious power sale and purchase agreements, but no official was immediately available for comment.\nIn 2016, ERS posted a profit of 5.2 million marka.\nA long drought and soaring temperatures lowered water levels across the Western Balkans last year, hitting hydro-power output and driving consumption and spot power prices sharply higher.\nBosnia’s biggest power utility EPBiH’s said last week its 2017 net profit tumbled to 620,382 marka from nearly 13 million marka in 2016, as drought curbed its hydro generation and forced it turn to costly imports.\nERS operates two coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 600 megawatts (MW) and three big and several small hydro power plants with a total capacity of 617 MW.\nBosnia, normally the region’s only net power exporter, more than doubled power imports to 317 million marka last year to make up for the hydro-power shortfall, according to data from the state statistics agency.
