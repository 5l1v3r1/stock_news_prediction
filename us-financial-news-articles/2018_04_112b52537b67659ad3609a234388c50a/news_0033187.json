The pact runs until the end of this year, and the June meeting will see participants decide their next course of action.\nA surplus in global oil inventories was close to evaporating, OPEC said last week, citing healthy energy demand and its own supply cuts. It also revised up its forecast for output from rivals that have benefited from higher oil prices.\nOPEC has a self-imposed goal of bringing oil inventories in industrialised countries down to their five-year average.\nBarkindo said in Kuwait on Monday that oil stocks in the developed world fell in February to below 50 million barrels above the latest five-year average and that the declining trend would continue over the coming months.
