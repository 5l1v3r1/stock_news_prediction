The Braves scored 62 runs in their first nine games but could not do much in this contest.\nScherzer was dominant on the cold night in Washington, getting some revenge from the 7-1 loss the Nationals suffered in Atlanta on April 4 when the right-hander gave up five runs in five innings — although just two were earned.\nThis time, Scherzer (2-1) did not allow a runner to get into scoring position and faced just one batter over the minimum. He also did not walk a batter while posting the ninth complete game of his career.\nJulio Teheran was the hard-luck loser for Atlanta in this game. Teheran (0-1) gave up two runs on five hits in six innings while striking out seven and walking four.\nThe Nationals gave Scherzer all the offensive support he needed in the first inning.\nAnthony Rendon doubled with one out, and Bryce Harper followed with a walk. With two outs, Kendrick lined a double to left that scored both runners for a 2-0 lead.\nWashington catcher Matt Wieters (left oblique strain) will begin what the team thinks is a short rehab with Class-A Potomac on Tuesday. He’s eligible to come off the disabled list Wednesday.\nFor Atlanta, Braves manager Brian Snitker told the media that pitcher Luiz Gohara is going to do a side session of three innings Tuesday. The rookie is recovering from a sprained left ankle and was expected to be the No. 5 starter. If all goes well, the skipper said Gohara could be back by late April or early May.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:45:50.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
