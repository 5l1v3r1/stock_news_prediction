Dudley attends a forum hosted by the Puerto Rico Chamber of Commerce in San Juan, Puerto Rico March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Alvin Baez “The markets are seeing that three is possible, four is possible, but five or six seems to me is quite unlikely,” Dudley, an influential outgoing Fed policymaker, said on CNBC. He added: “Three percent is a reasonable starting point in terms of thinking about what ‘neutral’ might be over the long run.”\nThe Fed hiked rates last month and forecasts showed policymakers split on whether to tighten two or three more times this year. The forecasts also showed the Fed expects inflation to rise above a 2 percent target next year, after more than five years below it.\n“I don’t think we know exactly how many more hikes we’ll do this year,” Dudley added. “As long as inflation is relatively low, we’re going to be gradual. Now if inflation were to go above 2 percent by an appreciable margin then I think the gradual path might have to be altered.”\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
