For years the bank had bet on recovering bad loans internally, building a dedicated business that employs 600 people. \nAs part of the agreement, Intrum will control 51 percent of a company which will be made up of Intesa’s debt recovery business and Intrum’s Italian operations. \nThe new company will manage around 40 billion euros in soured debts, becoming a major player in the Italian debt servicing market, one of Europe’s biggest. \nBy 1156 GMT shares in Intesa rose 1.8 percent in line with the sector as the deal’s favourable terms lifted other Italian banking stocks. \nIntesa is offloading the bad loans at 28.7 cents on the dollar, in line with their book value and stands to book a 400 million euro capital gain from the overall deal. \nRival Italian bank UniCredit had to raise 13 billion euros in capital to offset the hit from writedowns needed to pave the way for a 16 billion euro bad loan sale last year at a price of just 13 cents on the dollar. \n($1 = 0.8092 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T16:22:08.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
