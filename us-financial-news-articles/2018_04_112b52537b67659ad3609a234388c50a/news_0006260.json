Trump instructed trade officials on Thursday to consider a $100 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods after China said it would subject $50 billion of U.S. goods to increased tariffs. The escalation followed Trump’s initial proposal for a 25 percent tariff on many imports from China. “So far it is still just a war of words, with investors assuming the final outcome will fall far short of the threats, though nervousness has risen,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note. \n“We still expect China to soften its tone behind the scenes, as it has more to lose in a full-blown trade war, but it would be prudent to stick to risk-neutral trades as trade war headlines shake out.” \nThe S&P/ASX 200 index closed 10 basis points lower at 5,788.7, and logged a weekly gain of 0.5 percent, ending a three-week run of losses. \nGains in materials stocks countered losses in financials as miner BHP closed 0.5 percent higher, cancelling Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s 0.4 percent loss. \nWoodside Petroleum added 1.1 percent and closed at it highest in nearly two months, while mall operator Westfield Corp finished the session up 1.6 pct. \nHealthcare stock CSL Ltd was the biggest drag, down 0.8 percent. \nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.4 percent, or 29.28 points, to finish the session at 8,393.27. The index added 0.9 percent on the week, gaining in three of this four sessions. The market was closed on Monday for an Easter holiday. \nMaterials and consumer discretionary stocks led gains with Fletcher Building closing 1.6 percent higher and Sky Network Television ending up 6.3 percent.
