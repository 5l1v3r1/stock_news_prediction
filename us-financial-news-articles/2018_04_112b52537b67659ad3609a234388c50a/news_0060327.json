(NYSE: RE) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $210.3 million, or $5.11 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $291.6 million, or $7.07 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017. After-tax operating income 1 was $219.7 million, or $5.34 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to after-tax operating income¹ of $267.1 million, or $6.48 per diluted common share, for the same period last year.\nCommenting on the Company’s results, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominic J. Addesso said, “Everest continues to deliver a solid performance with double digit returns on equity. Our diversified growth strategies, with premium up 21%, continue to provide balance and stability to the overall portfolio. In fact, excluding catastrophe losses, our net operating income was up 5% and underwriting income was above $200 million. We are pleased with our overall results and believe they once again demonstrate the strength of the Everest franchise.”\nEffective this quarter, the Company changed its reporting of operating income, a non-GAAP financial measure. Historically operating income represented net income, excluding realized capital gains and losses and the tax impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017. Starting in first quarter 2018, the Company further adjusted operating income to exclude foreign exchange gains and losses as it believes the impact of foreign currency movements on income is not indicative of the performance of the underlying business in a particular period.\nOperating highlights for the first quarter of 2018 included the following:\nGross written premiums for the quarter were $1.9 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the first quarter of 2017. On a constant dollar basis, premium was up 19%, quarter over quarter. Worldwide reinsurance premiums were up 22% to $1.4 billion, with growth across each segment primarily driven by increased pro-rata premium. Direct insurance premiums were up 16%, from first quarter 2017, to $505 million, consistent with the growth trends noted through 2017. The combined ratio was 93.3% for the quarter compared to 86.0% 2017. Excluding the previously announced catastrophe losses arising from the 2017 Northern and Southern California wildfires, the attritional combined ratio was 87.1% compared to 84.5% in the same period last year. The higher attritional loss ratio is driven by changes in mix of business as well as higher retrocessional costs in the quarter. Net investment income increased 13% for the quarter to $138.3 million. Net after-tax realized and unrealized capital losses amounted to $19.4 million and $199.4 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations was $195.6 million compared to $381.8 million for the same period in 2017. For the quarter, the annualized after-tax operating income¹ return on average adjusted shareholders’ equity² was 10.5%. Shareholders’ equity ended the quarter at $8.3 billion, relatively flat compared to year end 2017. Book value per share was modestly down from $204.95 at December 31, 2017 to $203.62 at March 31, 2018.\nThis news release contains within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

The supplemental information is located at www.everestregroup.com in the “Financial Reports” section of the “Investor Center”. The supplemental financial information may also be obtained by contacting the Company directly.\n1 The Company generally uses after-tax operating income (loss), a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate its performance. After-tax operating income (loss) consists of net income (loss) excluding after-tax net realized capital gains (losses), after-tax net foreign exchange income (expense), and the tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), as the following reconciliation displays:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in thousands, 2018 2017 (unaudited) Per Diluted Per Diluted Common Common Amount Share Amount Share Net income (loss) $ 210,318 $ 5.11 $ 291,643 $ 7.07 After-tax net realized capital gains (losses) (19,355) (0.47) 32,110 0.78 After-tax net foreign exchange income (expense) 9,933 0.24 (7,558) (0.18) Impact of TCJA enactment - - - - After-tax operating income (loss) $ 219,740 $ 5.34 $ 267,091 $ 6.48 (Some amounts may not reconcile due to rounding.) Although net realized capital gains (losses) and net foreign exchange income (expense) are an integral part of the Company’s insurance operations, the determination of net realized capital gains (losses) and foreign exchange income (expense) is independent of the insurance underwriting process. The Company believes that the level of net realized capital gains (losses) and net foreign exchange income (expense) for any particular period is not indicative of the performance of the underlying business in that particular period. Providing only a GAAP presentation of net income (loss) makes it more difficult for users of the financial information to evaluate the Company’s success or failure in its basic business, and may lead to incorrect or misleading assumptions and conclusions. The Company understands that the equity analysts who follow the Company focus on after-tax operating income (loss) in their analyses for the reasons discussed above. The Company provides after-tax operating income (loss) to investors so that they have what management believes to be a useful supplement to GAAP information concerning the Company’s performance.\n2 Adjusted shareholders’ equity excludes net after-tax unrealized (appreciation) depreciation of investments\n--Financial Details Follow--\nEVEREST RE GROUP, LTD.
