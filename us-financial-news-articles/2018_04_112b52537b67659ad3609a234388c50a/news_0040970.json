He faces up to 35 years in prison. Brunson denies the charges. \nErdogan has previously linked Brunsonâ€™s fate to that of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric Turkey blames for the coup attempt. Gulen has lived in the United States since 1999 and denies the charges. Turkey is seeking his extradition from the United States. \nU.S. President Donald Trump and dozens of U.S. senators have urged Erdogan to release Brunson.
