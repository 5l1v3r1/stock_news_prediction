When the current supply of state-funded bottled water is depleted, the four remaining distribution centers will close and deliveries will end.\n“The scientific data now proves the water system is stable and the need for bottled water has ended,” Snyder said in the statement. “Since Flint’s water is now well within the standards set by the federal government, we will now focus even more of our efforts on continuing with the health, education and economic development assistance needed to help move Flint forward.”\nOfficials from Flint, a predominantly black city of nearly 97,400 residents, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nFlint regained control of its finances on Wednesday after Michigan announced the end of nearly seven years of state oversight, a period marked by the water crisis.\nFlint switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a cost-cutting move in April 2014. The polluted river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Lead poisoning stunts children’s cognitive development.\nThe city switched back to Lake Huron water in October 2015. The water crisis prompted dozens of lawsuits and criminal charges against former government officials.
