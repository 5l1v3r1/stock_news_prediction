(NASDAQ:AIPT) (“Precision” or “the Company”), formerly Skyline Medical, a company focused on applying artificial intelligence to personalized medicine and drug discovery, announced today financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and provides a business update on its plans to transition its strategic focus to precision medicine and the Contract Research Organization (“CRO”) services sector.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter of 2017 and recent weeks include:\nAnnounced new strategic focus on applying artificial intelligence to precision medicine and drug discovery Changed corporate name from Skyline Medical to Precision Therapeutics Changed its NASDAQ Capital Market ticker symbol from 'SKLN' to ‘AIPT' to align the symbol with its new name Purchased 25% of Helomics, a precision diagnostic company and integrated clinical contract research organization Precision Therapeutics, Helomics Corporation and GLG Pharma formed a partnership to use their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients Formed TumorGenesis Inc. subsidiary to develop the next generation of patient derived (“PDx”) tumor models for precision cancer therapy and drug development Secured license agreements with SyntArray LLC, 48Hour Discovery and CellBridge Incorporated to advance its strategy Raised $2.5 million in net proceeds in a public offering, subsequent to the year end\nSkyline Medical, a division of Precision Therapeutics, highlights of 2017 and recent weeks:\nFive STREAMWAY® Systems sold in Q4 2017; a total of ten STREAMWAY Systems sold in FY 2017 Implemented international expansion strategy by partnering with independent distributors in Canada, Switzerland and Australia Opened new European headquarters in Belgium and appointed Jean-Paul Rasschaert as Vice President of International Sales Appointed Kevin Hungerford as Global Vice President of Sales and Marketing 16 STREAMWAY Systems sold in the first three months of 2018; 100 total STREAMWAY Systems projected to be sold in 2018\nManagement Commentary\n“In late 2017 and early 2018 we made significant progress executing on our strategy to diversify our portfolio of products and solutions by entering the fast-growing precision medicine market,” commented Dr. Carl Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Precision Therapeutics. “The emergence of precision medicine is creating a paradigm shift away from generalized medical solutions that treat large numbers of patients with similar symptoms, toward therapies that take into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle for each person. Our new strategic focus is on applying artificial intelligence to personalized medicine and drug discovery. By working to provide solutions that improve precision medicine clinical trial outcomes, we are positioning the Company as a critical partner to the industry, thereby enabling its stakeholders to participate in the growth of this emerging field of healthcare.\n“To advance our strategy, we formed our TumorGenesis subsidiary to develop next generation, ex-vivo , patient-derived tumor models. These tumor models will be designed to ‘fool’ the cancer cells into behaving as though they are still in the patient’s body, which is expected to lead to better testing of drugs for personalized therapy and in the development of new drugs, compared with traditional animal models. We have secured several medical technology licenses to advance the development of these tumor models. To fuel revenue generation, we plan to offer testing of the TumorGenesis PDx tumors, in conjunction with Helomics, to pharmaceutical companies for the development of precision therapies, and to use the data generated to continue the build out of the Helomics’s D-CHIP Artificial Intelligence (AI) database of tumor profiles.\n“Helomics’ ‘big-data’ D-CHIP repository currently contains the drug response profiles of over 149,000 patient tumors and their molecular, genomic, biochemical and histopathology data coupled to de-identified patient demographics. The D-CHIP uses a proprietary AI-powered bioinformatics engine to provide actionable insights to aid in the development of precision therapies. This technology represents a one-of-a-kind value proposition. Big Data and Artificial Intelligence are the foundation of the development of targeted treatments and personalized therapies. Providing actionable insights based on the specific biomarkers and gene signatures that cause diseases, is invaluable to disease diagnosis, the development of new diagnostics and therapies, and clinical trials performance.\n“We plan to monetize these technologies by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to advance the emergence of ground-breaking personalized cancer treatments. This presents a major opportunity for the Company. The precision medicine market was valued at over $43.6 billion in 2016 and is expected to witness more than 10.5% CAGR from 2017 to 2024 and we are excited at the opportunity to participate in its growth,” continued Dr. Schwartz.\n“In the Skyline Medical division, we implemented an aggressive sales and marketing campaign in 2017, leading to an acceleration of STREAMWAY System sales in the fourth quarter. We believe this momentum will continue to drive higher sales and are encouraged by Skyline Medical’s outlook in 2018. We have already secured 16 sales this year, which exceeds our total 2017 sales, and with a March surge of selling 10 systems we expect an increased momentum toward selling a projected 100 STREAMWAY Systems in 2018. We are also expanding our international presence through independent distribution agreements and our recent hiring of key personnel to support the growth of our business, including a new Global Vice President of Sales and Marketing and an International Vice President of Sales and Marketing. We are confident in the future of the Skyline Medical division, and pleased with this continued progress,” concluded Dr. Schwartz.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $220,313, compared with $139,563 for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

Helomics® is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the company maintains state-of-the-art, CLIA-certified, clinical and research laboratories. For more information, please visit www.Helomics.com .\nPrecision Therapeutics has also announced the formation of a subsidiary, TumorGenesis, to pursue a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient. Precision Therapeutics and Helomics have also announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients). The growth strategy in this business includes securing new partnerships and considering acquisitions in the precision medicine space.\nSold through the Skyline Medical business of Precision Therapeutics, The STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical's STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with OSHA and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room, and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the U.S. For additional information, please visit www.skylinemedical.com .\nContacts:\nInvestor Relations\nKCSA Strategic Communications\nElizabeth Barker\n(212) 896-1203\nebarker@kcsa.com\nMONEYINFO, LLC\nCharles Moskowitz\n617-827-1296\ninfo@moneyinfo-llc.com\nFor more efficient communication we would appreciate your participation in the conference call by simply sending your email address to Info@MoneyInfo-llc.com so that we can add you to our database.
