Average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 2.7% from a year earlier, broadly in line with analysts’ expectations and the moderate pace of wage gains so far this year.\nThe report had little immediate impact on investors’ outlook for interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve. Expectations of tightening monetary policy tend to boost the dollar, as rising rates make the currency more attractive to yield-seeking investors.\n”U.S. jobs growth slowed in March more than expected, but the details of the report suggest investors and policy makers will look through it,” Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to clients.\nThe U.S. dollar has fallen for five straight quarters and is down around 7% over the last 12 months, as expectations of accelerating growth and tightening monetary policy abroad have pushed investors out of the currency.\nMost recently, the dollar has also reacted to escalating trade tensions with China. It has typically climbed against emerging-market currencies when investors are concerned about a trade war, while falling against the Japanese yen, which is a refuge for traders during times of political or economic uncertainty.\nStill, the response of traders has been more muted than some analysts think is warranted.\nThe U.S. dollar has fallen for five straight quarters and is down around 7% over the last 12 months.
