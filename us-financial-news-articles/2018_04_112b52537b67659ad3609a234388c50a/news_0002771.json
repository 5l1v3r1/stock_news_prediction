The offers will have to be submitted on April 15 and the winners will be announced the same day, he added.\nThe oil ministry announced on Thursday measures to reduce the fees received by the oil companies from the government in the new contracts.\nThe new contracts will exclude oil by-products from the companies' revenues, establish a linkage between prevailing oil prices and their remuneration, and introduce a royalty element.\nOil producers in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which include crude and oil by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas and dry gas.\nProduction now up to 4.7 million barrels per day OPEC's second largest producer, after Saudi Arabia , Iraq decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in 2014, reducing Baghdad's ability to pay the fees.\nCompanies including BP , Exxon Mobil , Eni , Total and Royal Dutch Shell helped Iraq grow its production in the past decade by over 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 4.7 million bpd.\nThe semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government produces oil and gas from fields under its control in northern Iraq under a production sharing model more profitable to companies.\nThe new contracts offered by Baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oil fields they develop on territory under its control.\nIraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel for local consumption or exports.\nIraq hopes to end gas flaring by 2021, which costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most of its unmet needs for gas-based power generation, according to the World Bank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T11:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T11:40:20.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
