Excluding charges, the gross margin rate was 36.4%, down 120 basis points from prior year as volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by an anticipated $50 million of commodity inflation.\nSG&A expenses were 24.5% of sales. Excluding charges, SG&A expenses were 24.0% of sales compared to 23.8% in 1Q'17, reflecting investments in SFS 2.0 initiatives moderated by continued tight cost management.\nRestructuring charges for the quarter were $22.9 million. Excluding M&A related charges, restructuring charges for the quarter were $21.8 million compared to $15.3 million in 1Q'17.\nOther, net totaled $58.0 million for the quarter. Excluding charges, Other, net totaled $52.1 million compared to $60.5 million in 1Q'17, reflecting the impact from the one-time $17 million environmental remediation charge in 1Q'17 partially offset by increased intangible amortization related to acquisitions.\nTax rate was 32.4% which reflects a charge of $23.1 million related to the refinement of the one-time tax charge from the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Excluding charges, tax rate was 23.0% versus the 25.0% in 1Q'17 reflecting the ongoing benefits from the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation.\nWorking capital turns for the quarter were 6.2, down 0.6 turns from prior year resulting from higher inventory balances in Tools & Storage in anticipation of new product launches, including Craftsman.\nStanley Black & Decker's President and CEO, James M. Loree, commented, \"We had a strong start to 2018, with high-single digit earnings per share expansion in the face of significant commodity headwinds. We also reported healthy, above-market organic growth of 4%, backed by 6% organic growth from Tools & Storage as well as Industrial outperforming our expectation.\n\"The organic growth outlook remains robust as we execute a series of opportunities including Lenox and Irwin revenue synergies, FlexVolt, emerging markets and the rollout of the Craftsman brand, all while the organization remains focused on generating new core and breakthrough innovations. In addition to organic growth, we continue to focus on strategic capital allocation actions. The Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition was completed in early April. We continue to see a strong acquisition pipeline and are exploring multiple opportunities to create significant value.\n\"As we navigate 2018, our 175 th year in operation, the team is focused on acting with the agility required to achieve success in such a dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, taking actions to achieve our 22/22 vision, and striving to become known as one of the world's leading innovators, while continuing to deliver top-quartile financial performance and demonstrate our commitment to social responsibility.\"\n1Q'18 Segment Results\n($ in M)\nSales\nProfit\nCharges 1\nProfit\nEx -\nCharges 1\nProfit Rate\nProfi t Rate\nEx -\nCharges 1\nTools &\nStorage\n$2,216\n$301.4\n$14.7\n$316.1\n13.6%\n14.3%\nIndustrial\n$504\n$80.5\n$2.0\n$82.5\n16.0%\n16.4%\nSecurity\n$489\n$45.5\n$1.3\n$46.8\n9.3%\n9.6%\n1\nSee Merger And Acquisition (M&A) Related Charges On Page 5\nTools & Storage net sales increased 17% versus 1Q'17 due to acquisitions (+8%), volume (+6%) and currency (+3%). All regions contributed to the 6% organic growth for the quarter with emerging markets +15%, Europe +7% and North America +3%. Emerging markets growth was largely due to mid-price-point product releases, higher e-commerce volumes and benefits from changes to our distribution models in Russia & Turkey. Share gains continued within Europe as the growth was supported by new product launches and continued successful commercial actions. North America organic growth remained strong despite a combined 3 point impact from a slow start to the outdoor products season due to an extended period of winter weather in several regions and planned channel inventory reductions in preparation for the upcoming Craftsman rollout. The growth was supported by new product innovation, including the expansion of the DEWALT FlexVolt system, strong commercial execution, and a healthy U.S. tool market. Overall Tools & Storage segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 14.3%, down from the 1Q'17 rate of 15.9%, as the benefits from volume leverage and productivity were more than offset by the anticipated impact from commodity inflation and investments to support growth.\nIndustrial net sales increased 5% versus 1Q'17 due to currency (+6%) partially offset by divestitures (-1%). Engineered Fastening organic revenues were flat as automotive fastener penetration gains were offset by the anticipated impact from lower automotive system shipments and lower volumes within electronics. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 1% as higher volumes from successful commercial actions and improved market conditions in Hydraulic Tools were offset by expected lower pipeline project activity in Oil & Gas. Overall Industrial segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 16.4%, down 130 basis points from the 1Q'17 rate, as productivity gains and cost control were offset by the impact of commodity inflation and SFS 2.0 related investments.\nSecurity net sales increased 2% versus 1Q'17 as currency (+5%), bolt-on commercial electronic security acquisitions (+3%) and price (+1%) were partially offset by the sale of the Mechanical Security business (-5%) and lower volume (-2%). North America organic growth was flat as higher automatic doors volumes were offset by lower volume in Healthcare. Europe declined 2% organically as strength within the Nordics and UK was offset by anticipated weakness in France. Overall Security segment profit rate, excluding charges, was 9.6%, down 100 basis points versus the prior year rate, which reflects investments to support organic growth and the impact from the sale of the Mechanical Security business.\nEquity Derivative Transaction\nDuring the first quarter the Company entered into a capped call transaction that provides the right to purchase 3.2 million shares through March 2021. This transaction supports our long-term strategy to return approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nUpdated 2018 Outlook\nManagement is revising its 2018 EPS outlook to $7.40 - $7.60 from $7.80 - $8.00 on a GAAP basis reflecting the M&A related charges associated with the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition and one-time tax charge. The Company is reiterating its adjusted EPS range of $8.30 - $8.50 and its free cash flow conversion estimate of approximately 100%.\nThe following reflects the key assumption changes to the Company's prior EPS outlook:\nIncremental price, cost and productivity actions as well as accretion associated with the Nelson Fastener Systems acquisition (+~ $0.15) Higher commodity inflation expectations, including the impacts from the recently announced steel and aluminum tariffs (-~ $0.15)\nDonald Allan Jr., Executive Vice President and CFO, commented, \"Stanley Black & Decker's outlook for 2018 includes above-market organic growth of 5% and strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 11% - 14% versus prior year, while offsetting approximately $180 million of commodity inflation headwinds. We are confident in the organization's ability to deliver in today's dynamic environment as we remain focused on strong day-to-day execution and operational excellence, which includes the rollout of the Craftsman brand, price realization and the successful integration of our recent acquisitions. We continue to make targeted investments to support our SFS 2.0 operating system, which will position the Company to deliver sustained above-market organic growth with operating leverage, strong free cash flow conversion and top-quartile shareholder returns over the long-term.\"\nMerger And Acquisition (\"M&A\") Related Charges\nTotal M&A related charges in 1Q'18 were $25.1 million, primarily related to restructuring, deal and integration costs, as well as facility-related charges. Gross margin included $1.7 million of these charges while SG&A included $16.4 million. Other, net and Restructuring included $5.9 million and $1.1 million of these charges, respectively.\nThe Company will host a conference call with investors today, April 20, 2018, at 8:00 am ET.

Operating margin is defined as sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. Management uses operating margin and its percentage of net sales as key measures to assess the performance of the Company as a whole, as well as the related measures at the segment level. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital and software expenditures. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and to provide a return to the shareowners. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company's common stock and business acquisitions, among other items. Free cash flow conversion is defined as free cash flow divided by net income. The normalized statement of operations and business segment information, as reconciled to GAAP on pages 12 and 13, is considered relevant to aid analysis of the Company's margin and earnings results aside from the material impact of the acquisition-related charges, gain on sales of businesses and a one-time tax charge related to the recently enacted U.S. tax legislation.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nUnder the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nStatements in this press release that are not historical, including but not limited to those regarding the Company's ability to: (i) achieve full year 2018 GAAP EPS of $7.40 – $7.60 and Adjusted EPS of $8.30 - $8.50; (ii) generate 2018 free cash flow conversion approximating 100%; (iii) achieve its 22/22 vision; (iv) returning approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and opportunistic share repurchases; and (v) achieve above-market organic growth of 5% and strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 11%-14% versus prior year, while offsetting approximately $180 million of commodity inflation headwinds, (collectively, the \"Results\"); are \"forward-looking statements\" and subject to risk and uncertainty.\nThe Company's ability to deliver the Results as described above is based on current expectations and involves inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors listed below and other factors that could delay, divert, or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from current expectations.
