The figure fell below an average of analyst expectations for 31 percent. \n* Cold weather threatens to stress crops, already weakened by dry weather. \n* Soybeans got a boost from fresh export business, including confirmation from the USDA on Monday that private exporters sold another 232,500 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to unknown destinations. \n* The USDA said the U.S. corn crop was 2 percent planted by Sunday, in line with trade expectations, but down from 3 percent a year ago. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar sagged against its peers on Tuesday as rhetoric from Chinese and U.S. policymakers kept alive concerns about a trade conflict between the world's two largest economies and undermined support for the greenback. \n* Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, easing after strong gains in the previous session when hopes that trade disputes between the United States and China could be resolved buoyed global markets. \n* Wall Street's major indexes rose on Monday as a softer stance by U.S. policymakers on China tariffs powered a rebound from last week's selloff, but stocks pared much of their gains late in the session after a report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the office of President Donald Trump's lawyer. \nGrains prices at 0131 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 488.50 -2.25 -0.46% +3.44% 475.03 72 CBOT corn 390.25 -0.50 -0.13% +0.45% 384.06 65 CBOT soy 1047.00 0.00 +0.00% +1.28% 1042.37 61 CBOT rice 12.82 $0.00 +0.00% +2.60% $12.42 80 WTI crude 63.38 -$0.04 -0.06% +2.13% $62.84 49 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.232 $0.000 +0.01% +0.32% USD/AUD 0.7703 0.001 +0.08% +0.36% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
