We achieved profitability in China, which in turn, resulted in the entire company posting a quarterly EBITDA profit as a public company. While the company sustained considerable losses, we have made significant positive strides in our diversity recruitment and women's networking segments. The improvements in these sectors in the U.S. are very important to our global growth. Our women's networking and employment services operations in the U.S. are very complementary to our China expansion. The company was and remains committed to providing our members with a network to enhance them professionally and personally.”\nWang continued, “We have more work to do in China and the U.S. in 2018 to enhance shareholder value. Our recruitment brand is very strong and I am pleased with the progress made in 2017 to create more value for our customers by launching new services to help companies hire executive talent, especially in the digital transformation sector. Early results to date in 2018 are favorable, our recruitment business new revenue bookings at $704,000 in Q1 2018 as of March 29, 2018 versus new revenue bookings of $547,000 in all of Q1 2017. In 2017, we launched the International Association of Women (IAW) and had a brand-establishing event in Paris for our members. In January of 2018, we launched the new IAW in the USA. This new brand has three basic principles. First, enhanced value to our members, with an increase in our digital platform member interaction, including an enhanced website, content calendar and digital networking events. Second, transparent pricing and a consultative approach towards new membership sales and finally a global digital platform to use as a foundation for our future expansion. Again, early results of the new membership efforts are encouraging. We believe that our diversity recruitment and women's networking segments, combined with our global operations, have strong potential for upside value. In 2018, we will remain vigilant on our cost controls and invest in growth where and when we see opportunities to do so.\nTo be very clear, we are at an early stage of our development in building a global network for our members to receive benefits from our platform and from fellow members. While we have experienced significant net losses as we seek to reposition our business, we believe that China presents significant opportunity for our future growth toward profitability and much of my time and the company’s efforts will be in the China market. In the USA we have enhanced the value of our network offering to our members and to our business partners. We are dedicated to integrating our resources in both China and the U.S., creating interactions and synergy between our members in both countries, doing business in an honest, sincere and creative manner, and ultimately enhancing our value proposition by helping our members improve professionally and find opportunities in the capital markets. We believe that we must continue to invest in our products, our member benefits, and our services.”\n2017 Year-End Financial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, PDN reported total revenue of $22.05 million, a 15.9% decrease from the year ended December 31, 2016, attributable primarily to reductions in our sales staff and workforce in our NAPW segment.
