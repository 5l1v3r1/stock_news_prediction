Acquiring the Sava stake would raise AIK’s stake to over 50 percent, obliging the lender to bid for all remaining shares in Gorenjska at the same price as it would pay for the Sava stake.\nAIK was not available for an immediate comment.\nThe Bank of Slovenia had ordered Sava to sell its stake in Gorenjska, saying indebted Sava was not financially strong enough to support Gorenjska.\nGorenjska has a market share of about 4.7 percent in Slovenia, in terms of balance sheet assets.
