Rebels pray before they are evacuated from the town of Douma, eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria April 1, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh \nUnder the agreement, Jaish al-Islam fighters will evacuate Douma and move to the northern city of Jarablus, near the border with Turkey, within 48 hours, state media quoted an official source as saying. \nJaish al-Islam, one of the most prominent insurgent groups in the war, is bowing to the Syrian government’s demand to pull out of Douma, in the eastern Ghouta region near Damascus, after the city was devastated by a seven-week government offensive. \nThe agreement comes after medical aid groups reported that dozens of people were killed by poison gas in Douma on Saturday in an attack the rebels say was carried out by Damascus. The government has denied carrying out any such attack. \nRussian news agency RIA, citing a security source, said Jaish al-Islam rebels will leave Douma in two batches in the coming hours. \nThe agreement will be enforced by Russian military police, who will enter the city, the opposition negotiators said. \nCommercial crossing points into the besieged city are to be opened under Russian military police supervision, they said. \nRussian military police have played a similar role in some Syrian towns and villages but this would be first such deal in a city the size of Douma. Related Coverage \nOpposition negotiators said the deal would allow those fighters from Jaish al-Islam who do not wish to leave to make peace with the Syrian authorities without being pursued by the security forces. \nThe deal includes a six-month reprieve for those wanted for military conscription, negotiators told Reuters. \nThe government said under the deal rebels will release an undisclosed number of prisoners and hostages in their prisons. \nFive prisoners were released on Wednesday, after earlier departures by hundreds of sick and wounded fighters from Jaish al-Islam and their families. \nState media showed hundreds of families of detainees at a crossing point near Douma waiting for the start of the release of the hostages and prisoners. A Reuters witness said they saw ambulances and celebratory firing of guns. \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has regained control of nearly all of eastern Ghouta in a Russian-backed military campaign that began in February, leaving just Douma in rebel hands. Tens of thousands of people are estimated to be sheltering in the battered city. \nThe offensive in Ghouta has been one of the deadliest of the seven-year-long war, killing more than 1,600 civilians, according to rescuers and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \nTaking Douma would further strengthen Assad’s position as it is the biggest rebel enclave near Damascus.
