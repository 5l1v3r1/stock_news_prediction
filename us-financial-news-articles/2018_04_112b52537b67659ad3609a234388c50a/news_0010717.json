More than 13,700 Eritreans were in the asylum process in February.\nThe policy switch, hailed by conservatives and attacked by the left, followed a Swiss court ruling last year that Eritreans who have completed their military service can safely be sent home.\nNow authorities have started to inform Eritreans that they have to leave, SRF’s Rundschau program said, although they cannot force people out as Switzerland lacks a treaty on repatriations with the Horn of Africa country.\nIt cited a letter sent by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) to an Eritrean woman who has lived in Switzerland since 2015 that her returning to Eritrea was “reasonable” and that it was revoking her temporary admission.\n“At the moment we are reviewing around 3,200 temporary admissions for Eritreans,” an SEM spokesman told SRF, adding each case would be treated individually.\nA Unitred Nations special rapporteur on the situation in Eritrea in March again expressed concerns about human rights violations across the country.\nEritrean leaders should be tried for crimes against humanity including torture, rape, murder and enslaving hundreds of thousands of people, an investigation set up by the U.N. Human Rights Council said in 2016.\nEritrea has said the U.N.’s allegations of human rights violations are biased and based on false information. It dismissed suggestions of crimes against humanity as laughable.\nReporting by Michael Shields; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:15:05.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
