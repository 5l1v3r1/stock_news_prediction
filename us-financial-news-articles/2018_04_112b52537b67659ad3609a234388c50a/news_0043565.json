Apple was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq.\nTSMC’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.3 percent. Intel declined 3.1 percent, falling the most on the Dow. All stocks on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index were in the red, with the index itself tumbling 3.9 percent.\nThe S&P consumer staples sector declined 3.2 percent as Philip Morris plunged 17.4 percent after the tobacco company’s weak results and forecast.\nPhilip Morris was the biggest drag on the S&P and also dragged rival Altria down 7.8 percent.\nAlso weighing was Procter & Gamble, which dropped 2.5 percent after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins.\nAt 11:23 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 57.28 points, or 0.23 percent, at 24,690.79, the S&P 500 was down 15.70 points, or 0.58 percent, at 2,692.94 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 53.47 points, or 0.73 percent, at 7,241.77.\nStill, not everything was gloomy.\nThe financial sector was up a healthy 1.1 percent, helped by a jump in American Express and as bank stocks bounced with 10-year Treasury yields reaching near one-month highs.\nAmEx jumped 7.1 percent after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates as record investments in card rewards contributed to higher customer spending.\n“What’s happening in this season is even if you meet, that’s not good enough, you’ve got to beat convincingly,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\nOf the 52 companies among the S&P 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAnother bright spot was Amazon, which gained 1.6 percent after the e-commerce retailer said it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.00-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 23 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 80 new highs and 37 new lows.
