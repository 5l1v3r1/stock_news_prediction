Look out for buying opportunities into weakness, but be prepared to sell into strength as the economic environment remains uncertain.\nWith that in mind, Cramer went over his game plan for the coming week, with earnings from Apple , BP and other top companies.\nApple has more to lose with tariffs Jason Lee | Reuters Tim Cook, CEO, Apple If a trade war breaks out, companies like Apple and Walmart will be caught in the crossfire, but Apple has the most to lose, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued on Friday.\n\"You can't crack down on China without hurting large swaths of the American economy,\" the \" Mad Money \" host said. \"Why? because China's our biggest trading partner.\"\nWhile both companies have a substantial base in the People's Republic — 10 percent of Walmart's business is in China, as is 20 percent of Apple's — Cramer said Apple is the most vulnerable .\nAs many of Apple's products are assembled in China, this move could cause disruptions to the supply chain and could spur other penalties such as boycotts.\nCentene CEO: Either grow or get paid to stay the same\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC Michael F. Neidorff, CEO of Centene. Centene , a company that provides a portfolio of services to government-sponsored health care programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, is continuing to grow, with new products and additional states in its programs.\n\"We're going to have probably a $65 billion run rate when this thing all gets closed, up from $48 billion last year,\" Centene CEO Michael Neidorff told Cramer in a Friday interview.\n\"You either grow or get paid a whole lot more for staying the same. And we want to grow,\" the CEO said.\nThe company beat expectations with its Tuesday earnings report, delivering a 29-cent beat off of a $1.88 basis. Revenue was slightly weaker than expected, but still up 12.5 percent year over year.\nCramer also pointed out that the company doesn't have to worry about commodity prices, doesn't have exposure to China and is \"exactly the kind of stock that can work if you're concerned about an economy that might be losing steam.\"\nBriggs & Stratton CEO talks long-term growth\nThe world's largest producer of gasoline engines posted earnings on Wednesday, delivering a 1-cent earnings beat off of an 83-cent basis and revenue up just 1.2 percent year over year.\nBut management cut their full-year guidance across the board, offering reduced estimates on revenue, margins and earnings for the coming quarters. Shares quickly fell about 11 percent on Thursday, regaining some of the losses during Friday's session. Investors were not happy.\n\"It was pretty darn disappointing,\" Cramer said.\nBut in a Friday interview with Cramer , Briggs & Stratton CEO Todd Teske said the company has a good long-term strategy with solid fundamentals.\n\"There's some tailwinds that we start to see coming down the pipe with housing and that sort of thing, so there's a lot to be optimistic about,\" Teske said on Friday. \"It's just you get into one of these quarters where things didn't quite work out in terms of the guidance that we had to give.\"\nLightning round: Opportunity in T? In Cramer's lightning round , he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\nAT&T : \"Look, AT&T is, actually, I think, putting in a bottom because people are buying stocks [of] domestic companies that have high yields where the cash flow's good and I think that's ATT.\"\nNew York Community Bancorp : \"It's too risky for me, sir. It's too risky. I think we've got some great American banks, the largest ones, that have been acting terribly but are worth a great deal, so I'd rather have you in one of those.\"\n Amazon, Apple, DowDuPont and Microsoft.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T02:23:28.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
