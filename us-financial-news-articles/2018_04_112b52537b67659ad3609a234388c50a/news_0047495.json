(\"Dipharma\") today announced that Amerigen's Abbreviated New Drug Application (\"ANDA\") for Miglustat 100 mg capsules has received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is the first such ANDA to be approved as a generic equivalent to Actelion Pharmaceuticals' Zavesca ® . The ANDA filing was the result of an exclusive collaboration between Amerigen and Dipharma in developing and commercializing Miglustat 100 mg capsules worldwide. Miglustat active ingredient is supplied to Amerigen by Dipharma who holds two granted U.S. patents, US9079856B2 and US8802155B1, one pertaining to a method of synthesis for miglustat and the other for a crystalline form of the same. Amerigen has the right to enforce these patents in the U.S. whilst Amerigen's affiliates will manufacture the finished product and commercialize it in the U.S., where it has already been launched.\nMiglustat is a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option.\nJohn Lowry, Amerigen's President and CEO, commented \"We are delighted to launch this product following a fruitful collaboration with Dipharma. This is Amerigen's fifth U.S. product launch and the third time we have brought a first generic to market, with important savings for the American healthcare system.\"\nMarc-Olivier Geinoz, Chief Executive Officer of Dipharma, expressed his satisfaction regarding the collaboration with Amerigen. \"This marks the first approval of a series of products our group has been developing in collaboration with Amerigen for various markets.\" he said. \"Thanks to this approval, chronically ill U.S. patients and payers will have available a high quality, more affordable alternative to current treatment.
