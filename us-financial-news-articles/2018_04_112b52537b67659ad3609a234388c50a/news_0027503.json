Under the currency peg system, the HKMA is obliged to intervene if trading hits either end of the band. $1 = 7.8499 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Donny Kwok and Twinnie Siu; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T10:40:34.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
