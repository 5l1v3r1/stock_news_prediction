He added that Spotify may not open for trading until after midday.\nSpotify's opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers, the exchange said.\nBased on those orders, the opening price will be set based on a designated market maker's determination of where buy orders can be matched with sell orders at a single price.\nWhile Ek is skipping New York Stock Exchange rituals such as opening bell-ringing and trading floor interviews to tout the stock, the front of the 115-year-old Greek Revival exchange building has been draped in a vast green-and-black Spotify banner.\nGlobal recorded music industry revenue in 2014 had fallen by 40 percent to $14.3 billion from $23.8 billion in 1999, when the rise of music file-sharing service Napster ravaged sales of CDs.\nThe industry has returned to growth since 2015 driven by streaming service revenue, which now accounts for 60 percent of recorded music sales, according to market estimates.\n(Additional reporting by Helena Soderpalm in Stockholm, Joshua Franklin in New York and Stephen Nellis and Salvador Rodriguez in San Francisco; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:52:15.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
