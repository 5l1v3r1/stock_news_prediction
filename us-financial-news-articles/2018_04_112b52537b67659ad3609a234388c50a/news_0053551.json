They have received offers for higher salaries and funding but say they are insufficient and plan to continue their walkout. The protests have been spurred by activism in Republican-controlled states like West Virginia, Kentucky and Oklahoma that brought increases in pay and budgets.\nArizona’s historic state-wide strike has closed public schools serving more than 800,000 students. In Colorado, at least 600,000 students were not in class on Friday.\nIn Phoenix, teachers and their supporters again rallied at the capitol in 90-degree heat and continued to seek a meeting with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey.

However, they booed after he laid out a school spending proposal that was short of their demands.\n“They’ve been telling us they value us, and we’re underpaid since 2009,” said one demonstrator, who asked not to be named.\nColorado lawmakers have offered schools the biggest budget increase since the recession. Teachers want the state to repay funding withheld under its strict budget laws since 2009, address a 3,000-teacher shortage and adequately staff schools with counselors, social workers and special educators.\nThe Arizona and Colorado protests are part of a wave of actions by teachers in states that have some of the lowest per-student spending in the county. A nearly two-week strike in Oklahoma ended earlier this month with a pay rise for teachers.\nIn Arizona, teachers are demanding a 20-percent increase in salaries, a return of education funding to 2008 levels and a freeze on tax cuts until the education budget reaches the national average.
