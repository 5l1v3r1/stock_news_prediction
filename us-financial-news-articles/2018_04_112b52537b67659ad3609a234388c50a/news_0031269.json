Asked about reports of the missile attack, an Israeli military spokesman said: “We don’t comment on such reports.” \nSaturday’s strikes by the U.S., Britain and France were in retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Syrian military in eastern Ghouta. Both Damascus and its ally Russia have denied using any such weapons.
