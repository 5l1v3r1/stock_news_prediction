The Bank’s Development Strategy, approved today, sets out a clear and efficient road map towards the achievement of this goal,” the head of the board, Engin Akchakocha, was Quote: d as saying.\nThe bank did not give the exact amount of profit expected in 2018, but hopes to post profit of 8 bln hryvnias in 2020.\nThe lender reported losses of almost 24 billion hryvnias in 2017 and 176.6 million hryvnias in 2016.\nPrivatBank’s nationalisation was the culmination of a swingeing clean-up of Ukraine’s financial system, backed by the International Monetary Fund. Dozens of lenders have closed since a pro-Western government took office in 2014.\nIts former main shareholders reject the Ukrainian authorities’ assessment of the health of PrivatBank’s loan portfolio and accuse them of unfairly targeting the bank.\n$1 = 26,2300 hryvnia Reporting by Natalia Zinets; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:26:03.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
