Many people who were evacuated to shelters have only just returned to their homes and some roads remain closed.\nTropical storms are graded from the lowest Category One to the highest Category Five. In February, Fiji escaped without deaths or widespread damage when Gita, a Category Four storm, lashed the region, causing widespread destruction in Tonga and Samoa.\nReporting By Jane Wardell; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T03:02:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
