REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz Speaking on Fox News Sunday, Haley listed three aims for the United States: ensuring that chemical weapons are not used in any way that pose a risk to U.S. interests, that Islamic State is defeated and that there is a good vantage point to watch what Iran is doing.\nIt is our goal “to see American troops come home, but we are not going to leave until we know we have accomplished those things,” Haley said.\nTrump, who on Friday joined France and Britain in ordering missile strikes against Syrian targets, has sent mixed signals on Syria.\nHe has made clear he wants to withdraw the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria involved in the anti-Islamic State campaign. But he appeared to contradict that message when he said on Saturday that Western allies were prepared to “sustain” the military response if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad does not stop using prohibited chemical weapons.\nAsked about U.S.-Russia relations, Haley said ties were “very strained” but that the United States still hoped for a better relationship.\nReporting by Caren Bohan and Susan Cornwell; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T16:54:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
