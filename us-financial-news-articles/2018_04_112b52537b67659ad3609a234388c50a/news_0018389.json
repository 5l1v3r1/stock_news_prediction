Since May 2005, it has been allowed to move between 7.75 and 7.85. \nAs the currency approaches the lower end of its trading band, the HKMA has said it would guarantee that the Hong Kong dollar will not weaken past 7.8500, and it will buy Hong Kong dollars and sell U.S. dollars. \nThe HKMA intervened in the currency markets in 2015, when the stronger side of the band at 7.75 was under threat as the Hong Kong dollar appreciated rapidly. \nIn early March, HKMA said it had no immediate plans to issue additional exchange fund bills to prevent the local currency from weakening further given the abundance of liquidity in the banking system. \nIt also said it was confident Hong Kong can deal with volatile asset markets and challenges arising from capital outflow.
