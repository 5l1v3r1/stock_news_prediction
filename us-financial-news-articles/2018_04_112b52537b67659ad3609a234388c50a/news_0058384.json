GNC has thousands of stores globally, with 3,385 locations in the U.S. and Canada.\nGNC has been working to improve its business as it faces a difficult environment in which dozens of brick-and-mortar chains have liquidated thousands of stores in the last year. The vitamin retail sector has been distressed in particular. Competitor Vitamin Shoppe Inc. recently interviewed turnaround advisers, WSJ Pro Bankruptcy reported , while Vitamin World sought chapter 11 protection in 2017.\nLast year GNC announced it hired Goldman Sachs & Co. to evaluate its hefty debt load and explore strategic alternatives. Since then GNC has completed a debt-for-equity swap with noteholders and landed an investment from a Chinese pharmaceutical company.\nHarbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co. struck a deal with GNC in February regarding a strategic partnership and joint-venture agreement for the manufacturing, marketing, sale and distribution of GNC-branded products in China. As part of the deal, Harbin plans to invest $300 million in convertible perpetual preferred shares and become GNC’s largest single shareholder, according to a news release.\nOn Thursday the retailer announced Harbin’s shareholders voted in favor of the investment and partnership, according to public filings. Harbin, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in China, is backed by CITIC Capital, a global investment management and advisory company with a strong position in Chinese businesses, according to its website. The firm manages more than $22 billion in capital.\nGNC, which has more than 2,000 international stores, has seen its business perform better overseas. Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar said during Thursday’s first-quarter conference call that GNC has recently signed agreements with to expand business in India, and has found a new partner to bring its products to Australia.\nHowever, the Harbin deal still awaits approval from GNC’s shareholders. While 92% of the proxies received from GNC’s shareholders were in favor of the deal, it was only from 36% of the company’s shareholder base. The company said in public filings it’s allowing extra time to receive more votes so it can obtain a quorum for its special meeting regarding the deal.\n“We continue to believe that the Harbin investment is the best path forward for GNC, and expect that we will obtain the votes necessary to establish a quorum and approve the transaction,” said Chief Executive Ken Martindale during a Thursday earnings call.\nMeanwhile, GNC said during the first quarter it inked previously-announced amendments to extend the maturity on its $1.1 billion term loan from March 2019 to 2021. The retailer previously said it would repay its $300 million revolver due in September in order to enter into a new $100 million asset-backed loan due in August 2022, and a $272 million ABL term loan due in December 2022.\nGNC reported Thursday that its consolidated revenue dropped to $607.5 million in the first quarter, from $654.9 million in the same quarter last year. The retailer attributed the decrease to two factors: the sale of Lucky Vitamin in September 2017, which led to a $22.7 million reduction in revenue, and the end of its U.S. gold card member pricing program, which resulted in a $23 million decrease.\nThe retailer’s adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization decreased, too. GNC’s Ebitda fell to $59.3 million in the first quarter compared to $73.7 million in the same period last year, blaming the termination of the gold card program and a higher marketing expense due to a media campaign.\nWrite to Lillian Rizzo at Lillian.Rizzo@wsj.com\nWSJ Pro Bankruptcy also covers distressed companies.
