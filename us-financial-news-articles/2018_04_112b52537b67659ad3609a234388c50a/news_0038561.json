[O/R] \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 116.23 points, or 0.47 percent, to 24,631.84, the S&P 500 lost 18.31 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,690.33 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.58 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,237.66. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.02 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.47 percent. \nThe bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down. \nInvestors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump. \nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.9173 percent, its highest since Feb. 21. \nThe 30-year bond fell 1-7/32 in price to yield 3.1097 percent, from 3.046 percent late on Wednesday. \nThe dollar rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies as the higher yields and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate increases offset concerns about a trade war and a ballooning U.S. budget deficit.
