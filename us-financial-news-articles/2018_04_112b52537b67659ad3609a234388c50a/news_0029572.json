U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen exits a hotel in New York City, U.S., April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon \nCiting unidentified sources, McClatchy said on Friday that investigators for Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is also probing possible collusion between Moscow and the Trump campaign, had proof Cohen entered the Czech Republic through Germany. \nMcClatchy said in its report that confirmation of the trip would lend credence to a dossier compiled by a former British intelligence agent that alleged Cohen met in Prague with a prominent ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nRussia has denied interfering in the election and Trump has said there was no collusion. Cohen has denied ever visiting the Czech capital. \n“Bad reporting, bad information and bad story,” Cohen wrote on Twitter, with a link to the news agency’s report. “No matter how many times or ways they write it, I have never been to Prague. I was in LA with my son. Proven!” \nCohen is due to appear in federal court on Monday in connection with a raid this week on his New York office and home by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was based in part on a referral from Mueller. \nThey were seeking information on a $130,000 payment made by Cohen just before the 2016 election to porn star Stormy Daniels, who has said she had sex with Trump in 2006, a person familiar with the matter said. Trump has said he did not know about the payment.
