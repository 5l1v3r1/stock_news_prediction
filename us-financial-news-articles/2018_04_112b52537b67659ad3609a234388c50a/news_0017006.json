Asked by a panel moderator whether China would devalue its currency to counter U.S. tariffs, Yi said the exchange rate mechanism is “market-determined” and is “working very well as it is.” He did not say whether China would devalue its currency or not. \nYi, who became governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) last month, said China would allow foreign investors into trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance by the end of the year. \nThe government would also not set foreign ownership limits for investment in wealth management companies set up by commercial banks by the end of 2018. \nYi renewed China’s pledge to further open the financial markets, and said most financial opening measures would be implemented by the end of June. He did not specify exactly what policies he was referring to. \nYi also said interest rate differentials between China and the United States were in a comfortable range, and said China was prepared for global monetary policy normalisation.
