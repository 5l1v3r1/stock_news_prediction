(\"Coeur\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: CDE) today reported first quarter 2018 financial results as well as an overview of key operating and strategic achievements during the period.\nFinancial results for the first quarter included revenue of $163.3 million and net income of $0.7 million. First quarter cash flow from operating activities was $15.5 million, adjusted EBITDA 1 was $49.5 million, and free cash flow 1 was $(26.8) million. These results reflect strong production and cost performance at the Company's Palmarejo silver-gold mine in northern Mexico, including a second consecutive quarter of costs applicable to sales (\"CAS\") per average spot silver equivalent ounce (\"AgEqOz\") 1 below $7.00. Performance was also impacted by (i) a normalization of production levels at the Rochester mine in Nevada, which benefited from a temporary boost to production during the prior quarter due to accelerated recoveries from the newly-expanded Stage IV leach pad and from the placement of higher-grade gold ore during the second half of 2017; (ii) planned lower grades during the quarter at the Wharf and Kensington mines; (iii) and a $17.9 million increase in working capital compared to year-end 2017. Free cash flow 1 during the quarter was additionally affected by capital expenditures of $18.6 million related to the commissioning of operations at the Company's new Silvertip underground mine in British Columbia.\nCoeur achieved several important milestones during the first quarter, which included commencing production slightly ahead of schedule at the Silvertip mine and announcing the results of a re-scoped mine plan and preliminary economic assessment (\"PEA\") for its Rochester mine in Nevada. The PEA reflects plans to add high-pressure grinding roll (\"HPGR\") technology to Rochester's crushing circuit, potentially improving silver recovery curves and doubling the mine's expected net asset value (\"NAV\") to $609 million. The Company also completed the sale of its wholly-owned Bolivian subsidiary and the San Bartolomé mine, the result of which is a North America-focused and U.S.-centric platform with a significantly improved geopolitical risk profile and cost structure. As a result of this transaction, the San Bartolomé mine is excluded from consolidated operating statistics and financial results for all periods presented unless otherwise noted.\nHighlights\nQuarterly silver equivalent 1 production higher year-over-year - First quarter silver equivalent 1 production increased 4% year-over-year to 8.3 million AgEqOz 1 due primarily to a 31% increase in silver production at Palmarejo, partially offset by a 14% decrease in gold production at Wharf over the same period. Quarter-over-quarter, silver equivalent 1 production declined 23% due to temporarily lower mining rates at Palmarejo, the normalization of production levels at Rochester and lower planned grades at Wharf and Kensington Higher quarterly unit costs - Companywide unit costs were up both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year despite continued strong cost performance at Palmarejo, which delivered adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 of $6.94 during the quarter. First quarter companywide all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") per average spot AgEqOz 1 were $14.44 compared to $12.33 in the prior quarter and $13.29 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was driven by higher sustaining capital expenditures at Palmarejo and Kensington combined with fewer silver equivalent 1 ounces sold both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year Production commenced at the high-grade Silvertip mine - Production commenced at the high-grade Silvertip mine in early March following the successful commissioning of mill operations. Silvertip is expected to reach commercial production mid-year and ramp up to nameplate capacity of 1,000 metric tonnes, or about 1,100 short tons, per day in early 2019. The Company also plans to file a technical report on Silvertip in the second half of 2018 incorporating results from current drilling efforts Substantial expected impact to Rochester based on new PEA - The results of Rochester's re-scoped mine plan and PEA, published February 26, 2018, reflect the strong positive impact expected from the planned addition of HPGR technology to Rochester's crushing circuit. The introduction of HPGR technology has the potential to increase Rochester’s silver recoveries from 61% over 20 years to 70% in just over two years, which could significantly improve the mine’s economics. The expected improvements reflected in the PEA include: (i) more than a twofold increase in NAV 5% to $609 million, (ii) over a 20% reduction in costs per AgEqOz 1 for the first ten years after the HPGR installation, (iii) a 122% increase in total pre-tax life of mine cash flows and improved margins, and (iv) an extension of mine life to 2038 Continued focus on near-mine exploration - The Company demonstrated its continued commitment to near-mine exploration with Palmarejo, Kensington and Silvertip accounting for approximately 67% of the $11.9 million in expensed and capitalized exploration during the first quarter. Drilling at Palmarejo and Kensington emphasized resource expansion at near-mine, high-grade targets close to existing infrastructure, while exploration at Silvertip was focused on conversion of resources to reserves with the goal of declaring an initial reserve estimate later this year\n\"We achieved several key strategic objectives in the first quarter,\" said Mitchell J. Krebs, Coeur's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The sale of our San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia resulted in a meaningful upgrade to our portfolio given the mine's short remaining life, higher operating costs and future estimated closure-related costs. Combined with the successful start-up at our new Silvertip mine in British Columbia and our announced plans to install new HPGR technology at our Rochester mine in Nevada, which is expected to more than double the mine's net asset value, we are entering the second quarter with strong momentum.\n\"Lower production and higher costs companywide during the quarter were in-line with our previously disclosed expectations due to the normalization of production levels at Rochester and lower planned grades and production at Wharf and Kensington. Our Palmarejo mine in Mexico continued to be a stand-out performer with unit costs below $7.00 per ounce for the second consecutive quarter.\n\"As we look ahead to the remainder of year, we expect production and free cash flows 1 to rise as Silvertip ramps up and development capital expenditures decrease. In April, Silvertip's mill throughput has averaged over 300 metric tonnes (330 short tons) per day and is tracking towards the Company's year-end target of 750 metric tonnes (825 short tons) per day. Important milestones, including the completion of dewatering efforts and subsequent increase in mining rates at Kensington's Jualin deposit as well as work to complete an NI 43-101 technical report for Silvertip, are on track for the second half of 2018.\"\nFinancial and Operating Highlights (Unaudited)\n(Amounts in millions, except per share amounts, gold ounces produced & sold, and per-ounce metrics) 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 Revenue $ 163.3 $ 214.6 $ 159.9 $ 149.5 $ 185.6 Costs Applicable to Sales $ 99.3 $ 122.0 $ 101.6 $ 102.2 $ 114.5 General and Administrative Expenses $ 8.8 $ 9.2 $ 7.3 $ 7.0 $ 10.1 Net Income (Loss) $ 0.7 $ 14.3 $ (11.7 ) $ (10.0 ) $ 18.3 Net Income (Loss) Per Share $ 0.00 $ 0.08 $ (0.06 ) $ (0.05 ) $ 0.10 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 1 $ 0.7 $ 14.1 $ (15.3 ) $ (1.3 ) $ 6.8 Adjusted Net Income (Loss) 1 Per Share $ 0.00 $ 0.08 $ (0.09 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.04 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding 187.6 187.0 179.3 179.2 183.1 EBITDA 1 $ 49.4 $ 69.6 $ 38.6 $ 23.4 $ 71.4 Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 49.5 $ 77.0 $ 40.2 $ 31.9 $ 54.5 Cash Flow from Operating Activities $ 15.5 $ 91.8 $ 37.3 $ 24.1 $ 43.9 Capital Expenditures $ 42.3 $ 47.1 $ 29.0 $ 37.1 $ 23.6 Free Cash Flow 1 $ (26.8 ) $ 44.8 $ 8.3 $ (13.0 ) $ 20.3 Cash, Equivalents & Short-Term Investments $ 159.6 $ 192.0 $ 195.7 $ 201.0 $ 160.6 Total Debt 2 $ 414.0 $ 411.3 $ 288.7 $ 284.6 $ 218.8 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Silver $ 16.70 $ 16.57 $ 16.86 $ 16.95 $ 17.49 Average Realized Price Per Ounce – Gold $ 1,268 $ 1,224 $ 1,240 $ 1,206 $ 1,149 Silver Ounces Produced 3.2 3.7 3.0 2.7 2.7 Gold Ounces Produced 85,383 118,756 93,293 82,819 88,218 Silver Equivalent Ounces Produced 1 8.3 10.8 8.6 7.7 8.0 Silver Ounces Sold 3.2 3.8 2.9 2.7 3.3 Gold Ounces Sold 87,153 123,564 89,972 86,194 110,874 Silver Equivalent Ounces Sold 1 8.4 11.1 8.3 7.9 10.0 Silver Equivalent Ounces Sold (Average Spot) 1 10.1 13.2 9.7 9.0 11.1 Adjusted CAS per AgEqOz 1 $ 9.69 $ 9.43 $ 11.05 $ 12.02 $ 10.60 Adjusted CAS per Average Spot AgEqOz 1 $ 8.48 $ 8.35 $ 9.90 $ 10.96 $ 9.79 Adjusted CAS per AuEqOz 1 $ 955 $ 800 $ 843 $ 860 $ 791 Adjusted AISC per AgEqOz 1 $ 17.20 $ 14.45 $ 17.35 $ 17.81 $ 14.78 Adjusted AISC per Average Spot AgEqOz 1 $ 14.33 $ 12.26 $ 14.79 $ 15.58 $ 13.30 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter was $163.3 million, down 24% quarter-over-quarter due to lower planned production and 12% year-over-year due to elevated sales in the first quarter of 2017 related to inventory carried over from the preceding year. Silver sales contributed 32% of revenue during the first quarter, and gold sales contributed 68% based on average realized prices of $16.70 and $1,268 per ounce, respectively. The Company's U.S. operations accounted for approximately 55% of the Company's revenue during the quarter.\nAverage realized gold prices during the first quarter reflect the sale of 9,906 gold ounces at a price of $800 per ounce, pursuant to Palmarejo's gold stream agreement.\nCosts applicable to sales were $99.3 million for the quarter, 19% and 13% lower quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, respectively, due to lower metal sales. General and administrative expenses were $8.8 million, 4% and 13% lower quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, respectively, due primarily to lower employee-related expenses and professional service costs.\nAmortization expense decreased 31% quarter-over-quarter and 21% year-over-year to $30.5 million due primarily to lower ounces sold during the quarter as well as higher life of mine reserves.\nQuarterly interest expense, net of capitalized interest, increased 9% from the prior quarter and 67% year-over-year to $6.0 million. This resulted from higher overall debt levels attributable to the Company's 5.875% senior notes due 2024 as well as amounts drawn on the Company's $200 million revolving credit facility established in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter capital expenditures increased nearly 80% year-over-year to $42.3 million. Development capital expenditures were largely associated with the commencement of production at Silvertip, where pre-production operating expenses, conversion drilling, and underground development totaled $18.6 million for the quarter. Sustaining capital expenditures also increased as a percentage of total capital expenditures accounting for approximately 46% of the total compared to 34% in the prior quarter and 38% in the first quarter of 2017. The shift was driven by higher sustaining capital expenditures at Palmarejo and Kensington.\nOperations\nHighlights of first quarter 2018 results for each of the Company's operations are provided below.\nPalmarejo, Mexico\n(Dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 2Q 2017 1Q 2017 Tons milled 359,893 389,524 413,086 335,428 360,383 Average silver grade (oz/t) 6.88 6.92 5.53 4.98 4.91 Average gold grade (oz/t) 0.10 0.10 0.08 0.08 0.09 Average recovery rate – Ag 81.4% 87.0% 83.6% 87.3% 86.5% Average recovery rate – Au 80.4% 92.0% 83.1% 91.1% 93.7% Silver ounces produced (000's) 2,013 2,346 1,908 1,457 1,531 Gold ounces produced 29,896 37,537 28,948 24,292 30,792 Silver equivalent ounces produced 1 (000's) 3,807 4,600 3,644 2,914 3,378 Silver ounces sold (000's) 2,031 2,343 1,794 1,484 1,965 Gold ounces sold 30,888 38,953 26,554 25,191 41,045 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (000's) 3,884 4,681 3,387 2,996 4,427 Silver equivalent ounces sold 1 (average spot) (000's) 4,479 5,331 3,809 3,324 4,837 Metal sales $70.0 $83.2 $60.7 $53.2 $77.7 Costs applicable to sales $31.1 $36.0 $33.3 $33.9 $43.0 Adjusted CAS per AgEqOz 1 $8.01 $7.54 $9.76 $11.21 $9.68 Adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 $6.94 $6.64 $8.68 $10.11 $8.87 Exploration expense $4.0 $2.7 $4.5 $3.1 $1.6 Cash flow from operating activities $27.3 $52.1 $18.5 $18.8 $50.5 Sustaining capital expenditures (excludes capital lease payments) $9.3 $4.9 $6.5 $6.1 $5.0 Development capital expenditures $— $2.1 $(1.0) $5.1 $1.2 Total capital expenditures $9.3 $7.0 $5.5 $11.2 $6.2 Free cash flow 1 $18.0 $45.1 $13.0 $7.6 $44.3 First quarter silver equivalent 1 production was 3.8 million ounces, up 13% year-over-year due to higher grades and down 17% quarter-over-quarter due to temporarily lower mining rates Adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 of $6.94 for the first quarter were 5% higher quarter-over-quarter, 22% lower year-over-year and well below the full-year 2018 guidance range of $9.25 - $9.75 Silver and gold grades were 40% and 11% higher, respectively, year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. Production benefited from mining of higher grade material over the past two quarters in a faulted zone within Independencia, which the Company had conservatively modeled. This was offset by temporarily lower mining rates as additional ground support was installed along the fault. Grades are expected to gradually decrease in subsequent quarters, while mining rates are expected to return to 4,500 tons per day Palmarejo began commissioning an on-site absorption, desorption, and recovery (\"ADR\") plant at the end of the quarter, which resulted in a temporary increase to in-process inventory and lower recovery rates. The ADR plant is expected to be fully commissioned by the end of April Higher sustaining capital expenditures during the quarter reflect Palmarejo's completed transition to underground operations and sustained production rates at Independencia, $1.2 million spent on the replacement of surface equipment and $1.2 million in expenditures related to Palmarejo's new ADR plant As a result of the ongoing success of Palmarejo's exploration program, drilling activity at Palmarejo and other targets within Mexico increased during the first quarter, with exploration expense rising 48% quarter-over-quarter to $4.0 million During the quarter, 9,906 ounces, or approximately 32%, of Palmarejo's gold sales were made pursuant to its gold stream agreement at a price of $800 per ounce. For the full year, the Company anticipates a similar percentage of Palmarejo's gold sales to be made under the gold stream agreement Palmarejo generated $18.0 million of free cash flow 1 during the quarter, partially due to the payment of approximately $17 million in cash income and mining taxes related to 2017 earnings in early April 2018 rather than during the first quarter as previously expected. Total cash income and mining tax payments in Mexico this year, including those related to 2017 earnings, are expected to be $40 - $45 million, $30 - $35 million of which is expected to be paid during the second quarter Full-year production guidance is unchanged at 6.5 - 7.1 million ounces of silver and 110,000 - 115,000 ounces of gold.

The quarter-over-quarter decline was driven by elevated production in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from accelerated recoveries from the newly-expanded Stage IV leach pad and from the placement of higher-grade gold ore during the second half of 2017 First quarter adjusted CAS per average spot AgEqOz 1 of $11.89 were slightly higher quarter-over-quarter, relatively flat year-over-year and below the full-year 2018 guidance range of $12.00 - $12.50 First quarter free cash flow 1 of $0.8 million reflected lower production and an increase in leach pad and metal inventory of $3.7 million, partially offset by lower capital expenditures relative to the prior quarter. Rochester is expected to generate higher free cash flow 1 during the remaining three quarters of the year The upgrade of Rochester's crushing circuit with the planned addition of HPGR technology is on-track to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. The project envisions the decommissioning of Rochester's smaller crushing plant later this year, at the same time the installation of an HPGR unit to Rochester's larger crushing facility is expected to begin. A gradual improvement to silver recoveries is anticipated beginning as early as the second quarter of 2019 Full-year 2018 production is unchanged at 4.2 - 4.7 million ounces of silver and 45,000 - 50,000 ounces of gold.

Second quarter production at Kensington is expected to remain consistent with first quarter levels Adjusted CAS per AuOz 1 of $1,010 reflected lower production and grades during the quarter. Costs were additionally impacted by higher diesel and consumables costs. Higher grades and production levels in the second half of 2018 are expected to result in lower unit costs Total exploration spend during the quarter was $2.7 million, including $1.6 million in expensed exploration an $1.1 million in capitalized exploration Lower production and higher unit costs during the quarter resulted in negative free cash flow 1 of $6.8 million Production and cost guidance for the full-year remain unchanged at 115,000 - 120,000 ounces of gold at CAS per AuOz 1 of $900 - $950\nExploration\nDuring the first quarter, the Company demonstrated its continued commitment to its near-mine exploration program. Companywide exploration expense totaled $6.7 million for the period and represented a 26% increase compared to first quarter of 2017. Capitalized exploration of $5.2 million, primarily attributable to resource conversion efforts at Silvertip, was twice the capitalized exploration total from the same period in 2017. Up to 19 drill rigs were active, including seven at Palmarejo, three at Kensington and six at Silvertip.\nAt Palmarejo, four drill rigs targeted expansion of the Nación and Zapata resources throughout the quarter with three drill rigs focused on conversion drilling at Independencia and Guadalupe. Underground drilling also targeted definition of the more recently-discovered Madero vein to the west of Guadalupe. Geologic work on the Portales and Jacobo veins, east of Guadalupe, is ongoing with further drilling planned for the second quarter.\nDuring the quarter, exploration at Kensington continued to target expansion of the Raven vein and lower Kensington Main Block L. Drilling completed on lower Jualin Vein #4 early in the quarter is reflected in Kensington's updated technical report filed April 25, 2018.\nExploration at Silvertip remained primarily focused on conversion drilling and accounted for $3.0 million of the companywide capitalized exploration total. Preparation of underground access, which began in the prior quarter, enabled drilling to quickly ramp up to four rigs in January and six by quarter-end, with two underground and four active from the surface. The mine's infill and expansion drill programs are on-schedule, and results are expected to be included in an updated technical report anticipated in the second half of 2018.\n2018 Production Outlook\nCoeur's production guidance remains unchanged from the guidance originally published January 8, 2018.\nSilver Gold Zinc Lead Silver Equivalent 1 (K oz) (oz) (K lbs) (K lbs) (K oz) Palmarejo 6,500 - 7,100 110,000 - 115,000 — — 13,100 - 14,000 Rochester 4,200 - 4,700 45,000 - 50,000 — — 6,900 - 7,700 Kensington — 115,000 - 120,000 — — 6,900 - 7,200 Wharf — 85,000 - 90,000 — — 5,100 - 5,400 Silvertip 1,500 - 2,000 — 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 4,030 - 5,080 Total 12,200 - 13,800 355,000 - 375,000 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 36,030 - 39,380 Total (including discontinued operations) 12,800 - 14,400 355,000 - 375,000 23,000 - 28,000 23,000 - 28,000 36,630 - 39,980 2017 Cost Performance and 2018 Outlook\nThe Company's cost guidance is unchanged and spot guidance remains based on silver-to-gold, -zinc and -lead equivalence ratios of 75:1, 0.09:1 and 0.07:1, respectively.\nOriginal Guidance (if changed) Current Guidance (dollars in millions, except per ounce amounts) 60:1 Spot 60:1 Spot CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Palmarejo $10.50 - $11.00 $9.25 -$9.75 CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Rochester $13.25 - $13.75 $12.00 - $12.50 CAS per AuOz 1 – Kensington $900 - $950 CAS per AuEqOz 1 – Wharf $850 - $900 CAS per AgEqOz 1 – Silvertip $15.00 - $15.50 $12.00 - $12.50 Capital Expenditures $120 - $140 General and Administrative Expenses $32 - $34 Exploration Expense $20 - $25 AISC per AgEqOz 1 from continuing operations $17.50 - $18.00 $15.00 - $15.50 Financial Results and Conference Call\nCoeur will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results on April 26, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nDial-In Numbers: (855) 560-2581 (U.S.) (855) 669-9657 (Canada) (412) 542-4166 (International) Conference ID: Coeur Mining Hosting the call will be Mitchell J.

Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause Coeur's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the risk that expectations regarding Silvertip including the timing of commercial production, obtaining necessary permits, and filing a technical report do not occur on a timely basis or at all, the risk that anticipated production, cost, expense, and free cash flow levels are not attained, the risks and hazards inherent in the mining business (including risks inherent in developing large-scale mining projects, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, weather or geologically related conditions), changes in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead and a sustained lower price environment, the uncertainties inherent in Coeur's production, exploratory and developmental activities, including risks relating to permitting and regulatory delays, ground conditions, grade variability, any future labor disputes or work stoppages, the uncertainties inherent in the estimation of gold and silver reserves, changes that could result from Coeur's future acquisition of new mining properties or businesses, the loss of any third-party smelter to which Coeur markets its production, the effects of environmental and other governmental regulations, the risks inherent in the ownership or operation of or investment in mining properties or businesses in foreign countries, Coeur's ability to raise additional financing necessary to conduct its business, make payments or refinance its debt, as well as other uncertainties and risk factors set out in filings made from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Canadian securities regulators, including, without limitation, Coeur's most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Actual results, developments and timetables could vary significantly from the estimates presented. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Coeur disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly such forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additionally, Coeur undertakes no obligation to comment on analyses, expectations or statements made by third parties in respect of Coeur, its financial or operating results or its securities.\nChristopher Pascoe, Coeur's Director, Technical Services and a qualified person under Canadian National Instrument 43-101, approved the scientific and technical information concerning Coeur's mineral projects in this news release. The PEA for the re-scoped mine plan at Rochester described in this news release is preliminary in nature and is based in part upon inferred mineral resources, and does not have as high a level of certainty as a plan based solely on proven and probable mineral reserves. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be considered for estimation of mineral reserves and there is no certainty that the results from the preliminary economic assessment will be realized. For a description of the key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral reserves and resources, as well as data verification procedures and a general discussion of the extent to which the estimates may be affected by any known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant factors, Canadian investors should refer to the Technical Reports for each of Coeur's properties as filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) with certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), costs applicable to sales per silver equivalent ounce (or per gold equivalent ounce or per average spot silver equivalent ounce), adjusted costs applicable to sales per silver equivalent ounce (or per gold equivalent ounce or per average spot silver equivalent ounce), adjusted costs applicable to sales per silver ounce (or per gold ounce), all-in sustaining costs, and adjusted all-in sustaining costs. We believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist management, investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. We believe EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), costs applicable to sales per silver equivalent ounce (or per gold equivalent ounce or per average spot silver equivalent ounce), adjusted costs applicable to sales per silver equivalent ounce (or per gold equivalent ounce or per average spot silver equivalent ounce), adjusted costs applicable to sales per silver ounce (or per gold ounce), all-in sustaining costs, and adjusted all-in sustaining costs are important measures in assessing the Company's overall financial performance. For additional explanation regarding our use of non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, please refer to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNotes\n1.
