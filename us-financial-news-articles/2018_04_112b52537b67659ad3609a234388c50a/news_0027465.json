JPY= \nOverall investors have now pumped $119 billion into equities this year so far, while the bond inflows bring the year-to-date number to $54 billion. CAUTION EXISTS \nHowever, there have been some signs of caution in other areas. Inflows of $3.4 billion into U.S. Treasuries this week mean money is flowing into U.S. government bonds at a record pace of $18.6 billion year-to-date. \n“Global synchronised recovery, record profits, low unemployment, massive fiscal stimulus, Fed selling, $70 oil ... yet 10-year USTs still unable to break 3 percent,” the analysts wrote, suggesting this means yields could move even lower. \nAs much as $1.1 billion also flowed into safe-haven gold, which means $7 billion has now been driven into funds investing in the precious metal since the start of the year. \nMeanwhile, investors shed European equities at the fastest pace since July 2016, with $5.2 billion leaving the continent’s shores.
