REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo \nThe festival confirmed on Thursday that Von Trier would screen his serial killer movie “The House That Jack Built”, marking the return of the one-time art-house darling who became persona non grata after his comments at Cannes in 2011. \nIn a now notorious news conference after the screening of “Melancholia”, Von Trier rambled about wanting to be a Jew, but finding out he was “really a Nazi because my family was German”. \nAs his leading actress Kirsten Dunst squirmed next to him, he went on: “I understand Hitler... And I sympathise with him a little bit yes ... I am of course very much for Jews. No not too much because Israel is a pain in the ass ...” FILE PHOTO: Director Lars von Trier poses during a photocall to promote the movie \"Nymphomaniac Volume I\" during the 64th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin February 9, 2014. REUTERS/Tobias Schwarz/File Photo \nVon Trier was banned from attending the rest of the festival, but Dunst went on to win best actress for her role in “Melancholia”, the dark portrayal of a cosmic collision that ends all life. \nThe director apologised for his remarks and later told Reuters: “I think that I’m talking to my friends back at the cafe and suddenly I find out, of course, that I’m talking to the world which are not amused.” \nAsked at the time if he would return to Cannes, Von Trier, who won the festival’s top prize in 2000 for “Dancer in the Dark” replied: “I don’t know if I will be allowed in the Palais (festival centre) again. Maybe Cannes has pushed me out to be more of a rebel.” \n“The House That Jack Built”, starring Uma Thurman and Matt Dillon, will screen out-of-competition in the festival that runs May 8-19.
