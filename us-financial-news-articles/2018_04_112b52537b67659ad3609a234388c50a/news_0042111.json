A source from Waha said militants were suspected of attacking the pipeline.\nMilitants were blamed for a previous attack on the pipeline in December, when the NOC also reported a production loss of 70,000-100,000 bpd.\nFighters loyal to Islamic State are present in the area, Libyan officials have said.\nThe pipeline was repaired within a few days after the December attack.\nReporting by Ayman al-Warfalli; Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T15:34:02.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
