But for the privilege to be nullified, Litman said the taint team would have to get the approval of the court to present the material to the prosecution.\nIn order to fall under attorney-client protection, the documents just have to be related to Cohen dispensing legal advice or gathering information in order to give that advice, Litman said. But merely having an attorney involved does not guarantee the protection.\n\"It can't just be that somebody with the bar degree is in the general vicinity,\" Litman said.\nBased on his experience with cases involving issues of attorney-client privilege, Litman said is likely that the prosecution never sees 80% or more of the documents.\nAnother reason raids on attorney's offices are rare is that they can easily come back to haunt the prosecution.\n\"If you go to the attorney's office and you look at attorney-client privileged material by mistake, you're in a world of hurt,\" Litman said. \"You're going to get disqualified from the whole matter and the whole prosecution could go down the tubes.\"\nAnd if the potentially privileged material is challenged, the burden of proof is on the prosecutors to show that they made \"zero use of privileged material\" and their investigation was not in any way influenced by it.\n\"Then, if you lose that fight, it's quite possible that anybody who's seen that document is off the case,\" Litman said. \"So, you're playing with fire.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/983444184513335299", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/09/donald-trump-weighs-options-syria-perhaps-including-missile-strike/498390002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/09/federal-deficits-projected-rise-surpassing-1-trillion-2020/500371002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/09/fbi-raids-office-donald-trumps-lawyer-michael-cohen/500635002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/04/09/syria-patrick-reed-cosby-facebook/498642002/", "https://twitter.com/BuckSexton/status/983472699778523136"], "published": "2018-04-10T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:22:17.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
