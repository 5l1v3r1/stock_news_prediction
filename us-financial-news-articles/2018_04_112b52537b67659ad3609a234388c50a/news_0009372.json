Facebook expanded its share of social app downloads in March by 33.2 percent from 30.1 percent.\nSeveral Wall Street analysts said the stock decline presented a good opportunity to buy into the social network's previously high-flying shares, although they cautioned that much will still depend on Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress next week.\n\"We suspect that looking back a year from now, if not sooner, this episode will have been a uniquely compelling buying opportunity in the mega cap internet space,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said.\nThe data scandal led to the \"DeleteFacebook\" hashtag trending on Twitter and several celebrities including singer Cher, actor Will Ferrell and Tesla Chief Elon Musk deleted their accounts.\nCompanies also chimed in with U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys, internet company Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank AG suspending advertisement on the platform.\nFacebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday that a few advertisers had paused spending in the wake of the incident, but that the company was having reassuring conversations about how it has built privacy into its system. ( https://bloom.bg/2q89KMt )\nSandberg also said a tool that allowed a researcher to gain access to personal information of up to 87 million users, complied with a privacy agreement the company signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2011.\nHer comments come after reports that the FTC was investigating the social media company over a possible violation of that agreement, which demands it to get user consent before sharing their information.\n\"While it's clear that investor sentiment has been materially impacted by (the) Cambridge Analytica revelations, we believe FB is acting proactively and aggressively to tighten its privacy controls and increase the level of transparency into its practices,\" Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena said.\nZuckerberg said on Wednesday he accepted blame for the data leak and should have done more to audit and oversee third-party app developers like the one that Cambridge Analytica hired in 2014.\nAsked in the interview whether Zuckerberg was still the right person to head Facebook, Sandberg endorsed him: \"I believe deeply in Mark. Mark had a vision for what social services and social sharing could be, and that vision remains really important.\"\nZuckerberg will testify about the scandal next week in front of a U.S. congressional committee.\nFacebook shares were up 2.4 percent at $158.83 in late afternoon trade.
