Last week it rose 2.7 percent while the broader S&P 500 closed flat.\nSince February, when a U.S. employment report heralded quickening wage growth, real estate sector stocks have declined at just half the rate of the overall market.\nIf inflation remains moderate amid economic growth, REITs may outperform the broad stock market, research by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit) shows.\nOver the past 25 years the total return of REITs in rolling four-quarter periods was positive 87 percent of the time when interest rates were also rising, Nareit said.\nREIT total returns exceeded that of the S&P 500 index 53 percent of those periods, it said.\nRising demand can drive rents higher and boost net operating income from property, which ultimately will result in increased returns, said San Francisco-based Leupp.\nREITs tend to briefly fall in the face of rising rates as yield-sensitive investors halt new investments as they wait for higher rates to provide for greater returns, he said.\nMost property types, with the exception of retail, are experiencing growth in rents, Joi Mar, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, wrote in a recent report.\nWith supply and demand roughly in balance, inflationary-type rent growth can be expected for the near future, she said.\nRates are rising because the economy is doing well and that should translate into better real estate valuations, said Lainie Minnick, head of finance at Denver-based Black Creek Group, a developer and investor in commercial real estate.\n“Real estate is effectively valued based on where your rents are, quite frankly, and you’re getting yield on the rents,” Minnick said. “There’s some point if rates go up too much, obviously this changes.”\nBlack Creek favors the industrial sector because of the strong demand for warehousing that e-commerce is driving and the relatively short time - about nine months - it takes to build a facility compared to years for building an office building.\n“Industrial has the strongest fundamentals in the market today and that’s definitely where we’re spending our time,” she said. “You can shut off the industrial overbuilding faster, because your lead time is faster.” Reporting by Herbert Lash; editing by Daniel Bases; editing by Jonathan Oatis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T20:46:54.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
