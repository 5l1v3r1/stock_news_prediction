FILE PHOTO: Arnaud Lagardere, the head of French media group Lagardere, attends the groups annual general meeting in Paris, France, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo \nLagardere said on Wednesday that the publications it planned to sell to Czech Media Invest included Elle and its other titles such as Version Femina, Art & Décoration, Télé 7 Jours and its various extensions, France Dimanche, Ici Paris and Public. \nLagardere will keep its Europe 1 radio station, the Paris Match magazine and Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper. \nThe planned deal is the second struck this week between Lagardere and energy investor Daniel Kretinsky’s Czech Media Invest arm, following Lagardere sale of its eastern European radio assets. \nLagardere is in the process of selling off assets in order to boost its cashflow. \nThe Czech Media Invest group is the publisher of the Czech Republic’s top-selling tabloid Blesk, three other daily papers and several magazines. \nIt is 50 percent owned by Kretinsky, whose EPH energy group has bought plants in Germany, Italy and Britain from western utilities to bet that coal-fired sources will still play an important role despite the sector’s shift to renewables.
