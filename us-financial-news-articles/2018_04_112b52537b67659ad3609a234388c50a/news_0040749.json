REUTERS/Richard Carson “We are looking today at monetizing some of our assets during the turn of 2018. But we want to make sure that we do this at the right time,” Patrick Schorn, an EVP at Schlumberger’s new ventures unit, said on a conference call with analysts.\nSchlumberger Production Management (SPM), formed in 2011 to develop client assets as the oilfield services major looked to diversify its business, had $1.4 billion in revenue in 2016.\nRevenue from Schlumberger’s production group unit, of which SPM is a part of, had $2.96 billion in the latest first quarter.\nThe unit allows the company to have a say in drilling decisions, oilfield management and even on hiring other Schlumberger units for service contracts.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T00:10:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
