(NASDAQ:AKRX), today filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court asking that Fresenius Kabi AG be required to fulfill its obligations under the definitive merger agreement, and issued the following statement:\n“Fresenius’ attempt to terminate the transaction on the pretext that the findings from the ongoing investigation are a breach of the merger agreement is completely without merit. The previously disclosed ongoing investigation, of which we have voluntarily notified and are in regular communication with the Food and Drug Administration, has not found any facts that would result in a material adverse effect on Akorn’s business and therefore there is no basis to terminate the transaction. The investigation is not a condition to closing and the only remaining condition is approval from the Federal Trade Commission. We intend to vigorously enforce our rights, and Fresenius’ obligations, under our binding merger agreement.”\nThe transaction was announced on April 24, 2017 after the boards of directors of both companies approved the sale of Akorn to Fresenius Kabi for $34.00 a share in cash. Akorn shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction on July 19, 2017.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
