On March 26, the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response. \nThe White House and Treasury declined comment on whether they planned to impose sanctions this week. When asked about the issue, a senior U.S. official said: \n“The administration is committed to implementing the CAATSA law as we have said many times. We published an oligarch designation recently and the secretary of the Treasury said further action would be taken. But at this time we don’t have anything specific to announce.” \nComplying with the law, the Trump administration on Jan. 30 published a list of the heads of Russian state-owned companies and “oligarchs,” including such prominent figures as Alexei Miller, the chief executive of Gazprom, and Igor Sechin, the chief executive of Rosneft.
