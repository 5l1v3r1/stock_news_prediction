I feel comfortable back on the clay,” Nadal said on the Davis Cup website. \n“It’s a great feeling to be back, coming back from injuries is always difficult, but it’s great to be in front of my crowd on a very memorable day. I’m very happy with the match.” \nIt seemed plain sailing for Pouille in Genoa after he swept aside Seppi in the opening two sets but the slugfest went the distance after the Italian fought back in front of a passionate home crowd. \nCilic had an easier task in Varazdin in northern Croatia, as he breezed past Popko to put the competition’s 2005 winners in the driving seat. \nThe United States are at home to Belgium in Nashville in the other quarter-final, with John Isner due to take on Joris de Loore in the opening singles rubber at 2100 GMT.
