June ended 2.725 cents higher at 105.050, and above the 10-day moving average of 104.095 cents.\nHigher live cattle futures and technical buying boosted CME feeder cattle contracts.\nApril closed 2.975 cents higher at 137.475 cents.\nHOGS END MOSTLY HIGHER Most CME hog contracts settled higher after investors sold April futures ahead of its April 13 expiration and bought remaining trading months, traders said.\nSharply higher CME cattle futures encouraged the exchange’s deferred-month hog market buyers, they said.\nHowever, China’s higher tariffs on U.S. pork that took effect on Monday limited market advances, said traders and analysts.\nLast year China/Hong Kong was the second-largest volume market for U.S. pork at 495,637 tonnes, according to the USMEF.\nOn Thursday, hog prices rose for the first time in almost two weeks after a few packers shored up inventories for early next week’s production, a Midwest hog dealer said.\nHe said other packers might compete for hogs when snow and cold temperatures in parts of the country give way to weather more suited for spring grilling.\nApril hogs closed down 0.625 cent per pound at 52.450 cents. May ended 2.975 cents higher at 65.850 cents, and June finished 0.550 cent higher at 73.825 cents.
