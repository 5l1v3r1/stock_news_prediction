He'd just sold his first business, MicroSolutions, to CompuServe for a reported $6 million .\nSo Cuban's pals had question: \"They asked me what I wanted to do with the money I just had gotten,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It .\nIt was a question Cuban had thought a lot about. Since founding MicroSolutions seven years earlier at age 25, he'd been solely dedicated to work and had gone all those years without a vacation, according to his blog. \n\"I gave up a lot, personally, early on to try to accomplish my goals,\" Cuban said on \"The Thrive Global Podcast,\" \"knowing that if I ever reach the levels of success even close to where I ended up, I was just gonna have fun.\" \nBy the time of the dinner, Cuban had decided it was finally time to do just that. \nSo Cuban pitched an idea to his pals: \"I told them I wanted a lifetime pass on [American Airlines] so I could go anywhere anytime,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It. \nIn 1981, American Airlines introduced the lifetime unlimited AAirpass, a ticket to fly anywhere as often as you wanted — for a steep fee. The passes cost $250,000 when they were introduced, according to the Los Angeles Times, and buyers could shell out another $150,000 to add a companion pass. In 1990 the pass cost $600,000, including a companion ticket. (For comparison, that amount in January 1990 had same buying power as $1,175,293.56 in March 2018, adjusting for inflation .) In 1993, the price increased to $1.01 million, and by 1994, American stopped selling the unlimited passes — perhaps because one owner of the pass flew over 40 million miles , according to the Los Angeles Times.\nBut Cuban had decided globetrotting would be a fun way to spend his windfall.\n\"We were at an old school steakhouse that had phones at the tables,\" Cuban explains to CNBC Make It. \"So I used the phone to call [American Airlines] and asked them if they sold life time passes.\n\"All my friends were drunk when I bought it,\" he adds.\nThe paperwork showed up a few days later. While Cuban says he doesn't remember exactly how much he paid nearly 30 years ago, he figured it to be a smart investment at the time.\n\"I guessed/calculated that my predicted cost per mile would be 12 cents,\" he says. \"That was a good deal to me. So I bought it.\"\nToday, only a few dozen people still own an unlimited pass , according to an American Airlines spokesman, and they are still valid.\nOf course, Cuban is now a multibillionaire with his own private plane , so who knows if he's flying commercial anymore.\nBut at the time, the splurge was one of the \"most fun, best business decisions I ever made,\" Cuban tweeted Monday. He used the AAirpass \"to go party like a madman,\" he says on the \" Thrive Global Podcast .\"\n\"I don't know the number,\" he tells CNBC Make It of the countless trips he took. \"I went everywhere.\" \nDon't miss: Mark Cuban says quitting this one common bad habit made him more successful \nLike this story?
