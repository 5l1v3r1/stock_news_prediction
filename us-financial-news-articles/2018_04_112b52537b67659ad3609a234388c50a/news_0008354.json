YouTube staffers and the rest of the tech and ad community are still in shock this morning after a woman armed with a handgun opened fire at the video company’s headquarters in San Bruno, Calif., wounding three people, before turning the weapon on herself. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki posted on Tuesday , “There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter @YouTube today. Our deepest gratitude to law enforcement & first responders for their rapid response. Our hearts go out to all those injured & impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family.”\nSorrell Under Investigation WPP CEO Martin Sorrell, arguably the ad world’s most powerful executive, is under investigation by the company’s board . The Wall Street Journal first reported Tuesday that WPP is looking into whether Mr. Sorrell misused company assets as well as allegations of improper personal behavior. WPP issued a statement confirming it has appointed an independent counsel to investigate “an allegation of personal misconduct” against the CEO. In a statement, Mr. Sorrell denied any misconduct, saying, “I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognize that the company has to investigate it.” The news comes as Mr. Sorrell is already under pressure, with WPP recently posting its weakest quarterly results since the financial crisis. Mr. Sorrell’s position atop WPP has seemed cemented for the decades since he transformed an unknown manufacturer of wire baskets into the world’s biggest advertising agency group. Whatever the outcome of the investigation, might this situation finally force some clarity around who could lead the company next were Mr. Sorrell to leave?\nFly Me to the Moonves What will Shari do? CBS officially kicked off merger drama in the Redstone media empire by submitting an offer for Viacom at a price less than its market value , WSJ’s Joe Flint reports. And there was a key condition attached: CBS’s management team — CEO Leslie Moonves and President Joe Ianniello — would run the combined entity. This is likely the opening salvo in what could be back-and-forth negotiations in coming weeks. The stipulation on management is likely to be a sticking point. National Amusements, the Redstone family holding company that controls CBS and Viacom, is said to be sour on any deal that doesn’t have a place in management for Viacom CEO Bob Bakish. Shari Redstone, the NAI president who rose to prominence in the empire in 2016 amid a power struggle and the declining health of her father Sumner, is close to Mr. Bakish. So, I ask again, what will Shari do?\nYou Make Me Feel Mighty Reel(io) A newsletter exclusive from CMO Today’s Alex Bruell : Digital media company Fullscreen is looking to expand its influencer marketing business through the acquisition of Reelio, an influencer marketing technology firm. Fullscreen, which is owned by Otter Media, a joint-venture between AT&T and Chernin Group, purchased the 50-person company for a sum in the tens of millions, but under $50 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. Fullscreen touts a handful of digital streaming channels under its Rooster Teeth brand, as well as a separate marketing services group that works with brands. Its influencer business has doubled to around 150 people in the past couple years, said Pete Stein, general manager at Fullscreen. “With audiences shifting their viewing habits and being in control, we think content, not interruption, is going to be the primary mechanism for brand building in the future,” he said. “We believe influencer marketing is a core part of that.” Reelio’s technology can match influencers with brands based on the advertiser’s audience data and objectives. It can also track the success of a campaign and alert a brand if its not meeting its objectives.\nGettin’ Dilly Wit It Don’t you dare “Dilly Dilly” at the Masters!
