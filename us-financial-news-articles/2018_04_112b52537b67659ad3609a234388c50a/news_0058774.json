The increase is due primarily to i) a $13.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below), ii) our $10.9 million equity share of a gain recorded by PS Business Parks in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and iii) a $6.0 million reduction in income allocated to our preferred shareholders. These increases were offset partially by i) $7.8 million in additional share based compensation included in general and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to the upcoming retirement of our CEO and CFO, ii) a $7.1 million increase in interest expense due to higher debt balances and iii) a $6.3 million increase in foreign exchange losses associated with our euro denominated debt.\nThe $13.6 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $6.5 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $7.1 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 2.1% or $11.5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 2017, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.3% or $5.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to 2017, due primarily to increased property taxes and property manager payroll. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 127 self-storage facilities acquired and developed since January 2016.\nFunds from Operations\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, funds from operations (“FFO”) was $2.37 per diluted common share, as compared to $2.34 in 2017, representing an increase of 1.3%. FFO is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) term defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.\nWe also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses and ii) $7.8 million in additional share-based compensation included in general and administrative expense in the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to the upcoming retirement of our CEO and CFO. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.\nThe following table reconciles from FFO per share to Core FFO per share (unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Percentage 2018 2017 Change FFO per share\n$ 2.37 $ 2.34 1.3 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO, including our equity share from investments:\nForeign currency exchange loss 0.07 0.03\nAccelerated expense of executive officer share based awards due to upcoming retirement\n0.04 - Core FFO per share $ 2.48 $ 2.37 4.6 % Property Operations – Same Store Facilities\nThe Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2016. We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2016, 2017 and 2018. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. The Same Store pool increased from 2,042 facilities at December 31, 2017 to 2,052 facilities at March 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,052 facilities (131.6 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 83% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31, 2018.\nSelected Operating Data for the Same\nStore Facilities (2,052 facilities)\n(unaudited):\nThree Months Ended March 31, Percentage 2018 2017 Change Revenues: Rental income $ 525,184 $ 514,263 2.1 % Late charges and administrative fees 24,719 24,173 2.3 % Total revenues (a) 549,903 538,436 2.1 % Cost of operations: Property taxes 58,582 56,050 4.5 % On-site property manager payroll 28,729 27,577 4.2 % Supervisory payroll 9,617 10,165 (5.4 )% Repairs and maintenance 9,425 9,702 (2.9 )% Snow removal 2,139 2,030 5.4 % Utilities 10,847 10,235 6.0 % Advertising and selling 6,538 6,816 (4.1 )% Other direct property costs 15,066 14,303 5.3 % Allocated overhead 13,108 12,222 7.2 % Total cost of operations (a) 154,051 149,100 3.3 % Net operating income (b) $ 395,852 $ 389,336 1.7 % Gross margin 72.0 % 72.3 % (0.4 )% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 92.3 % 93.1 % (0.9 )% Realized annual rental income per (c): Occupied square foot $ 17.30 $ 16.79 3.0 % Available square foot (“REVPAF”) $ 15.96 $ 15.63 2.1 % At March 31: Square foot occupancy 92.1 % 93.2 % (1.2 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (d)\n$ 17.81 $ 17.35 2.7 % (a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include ancillary revenues and expenses generated at the facilities with respect to tenant reinsurance and retail sales. (b) See attached reconciliation of self-storage net operating income (“NOI”) to operating income. (c) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income. (d) Contract rent represents the applicable contractual monthly rent charged to our tenants, excluding the impact of promotional discounts, late charges and administrative fees.

At March 31, 2018, we were under contract to acquire three self-storage facilities (one each in Indiana, Kentucky and South Carolina) with 0.2 million net rentable square feet for $19 million.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, we completed four newly developed facilities and various expansion projects (0.5 million net rentable square feet) costing $60 million. At March 31, 2018, we had various facilities in development (2.7 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $381 million and various expansion projects (2.3 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $281 million. The remaining $382 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 months.\nDistributions Declared\nOn April 25, 2018, our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 13, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for April 26, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the first quarter earnings results.

FFO represents net income before real estate depreciation, gains or losses and impairment charges, which are excluded because they are based upon historical real estate costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment, debt repayment, and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO and FAD are not substitutes for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because they exclude investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.

We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. This table reconciles from NOI for our self-storage facilities to the operating income presented on our income statement.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006715/en/\nPublic Storage\nRyan Burke\n(818) 244-8080, Ext. 1141\nSource: Public Storage", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006715/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicstorage.com&esheet=51794849&newsitemid=20180425006715&lan=en-US&anchor=www.publicstorage.com&index=1&md5=da0c078d4399d0483fef23157b98136f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicstorage.com&esheet=51794849&newsitemid=20180425006715&lan=en-US&anchor=www.publicstorage.com&index=2&md5=994d5d5df51ce4eb543d2ecb77a02c06", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publicstorage.com&esheet=51794849&newsitemid=20180425006715&lan=en-US&anchor=www.publicstorage.com&index=3&md5=4884ffcc76426d9e7eac250b6449e53a"], "published": "2018-04-26T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T01:08:12.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
