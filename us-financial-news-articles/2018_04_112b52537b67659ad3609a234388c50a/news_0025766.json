Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - Real Madrid vs Juventus - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - April 11, 2018 Juventus players appeal to referee Michael Oliver after he awarded a penalty to Real Madrid REUTERS/Stringer \nFans, players and pundits were divided on Oliver’s decision to award Real Madrid a penalty for a foul by Juventus’ Medhi Benatia in extra time. \nCristiano Ronaldo converted the spot-kick to win the tie 4-3 on aggregate for the Spanish side. \n“Let’s be clear about one thing first: Michael Oliver got the two important decisions at the end of last night’s game absolutely spot on,” Clattenburg wrote in his column for The Times. \n“Medhi Benatia’s challenge on Lucas Vazquez was a penalty. Michael will have seen from his view what was a small push by Benatia... \n“From his angle, the assistant referee would have seen the foot wrapping around Vazquez’s body... It’s a clumsy foul, but it’s still a foul.” \nOliver was also criticised for sending off veteran Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon for heatedly protesting the penalty, a move which led the Italy international to blast the referee after the match. \nClattenburg said Oliver’s decision was the right one as Buffon furiously confronted the referee twice.

There is no reason why Michael will not referee finals in the next few years. \n“But there is a problem that the pressures of refereeing are making careers at the top level shorter. This applies to other countries in Europe as well.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T12:02:54.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
