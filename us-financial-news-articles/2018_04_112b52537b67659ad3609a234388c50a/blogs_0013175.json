He said there is always an open line of communication with China, but no formal tariff talks have begun.\n\"This is a moderate, tempered approach that we are taking,\" he said. \"This is not a trade war.\"\nEarlier in the week, Kudlow's comments insisting that the U.S. is not looking to provoke a major confrontation with China helped sooth a jittery market that staged a 700-point swing Wednesday in the Dow industrials .\nHe reiterated Friday the U.S. concern over China stealing U.S. intellectual property, particularly in technology.\n\"There's no secret here. They've got enormous trade and tariff barriers,\" he said. \"They've got to stop their stealing of the intellectual property that we try to use in any company around the world. Those are good places to start.\"\nKudlow, a fomer CNBC special contributor, succeeded Gary Cohn as Trump's top economic advisor. Cohn, who opposed imposition of tariffs, resigned in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T17:38:36.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
