(NASDAQ:FRED) has rescheduled its conference call to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nThe conference call originally scheduled for April 18, 2018 will now be held on Friday, May 4, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern time. The delay is related to the decision to sell the Company’s specialty pharmacy business, and is not the result of any matters concerning the Company’s continuing operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s board of directors approved a plan to actively market the Company’s specialty pharmacy business, which necessitated presenting the results of operations for the specialty pharmacy business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the Company’s K.\nAccordingly, the Company requires additional time to complete the accounting and reporting processes necessary to satisfy the requirement to reflect the discontinuation of its specialty pharmacy operations. The Company expects that its Annual Report on 10-K will be filed no later than May 4, 2018, and, therefore, has rescheduled the earnings conference call for that date.\nThe Company will report its financial results in a press release prior to the call.\nFred’s management will host the conference call, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Friday, May 4, 2018\nTime: 8:00 a.m. Eastern time\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-877-407-4018\nInternational dial-in number: 1-201-689-8471\nConference ID: 13678332\nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
