The trophy Thomas received for winning the PGA Championship last summer sits above racks of shirts on sale.\nBut visitors wondering what the elder Thomas’s teaching secret was are often surprised by what they hear. More than any technical advice, Mike Thomas recalls contests in which the two of them would attempt the goofiest shots they could imagine: over or under a tree, closest to the pin without landing the ball on the green and so on.\n“My goal with him was every time you come out here, we’re going to have fun,” Mike Thomas said. “It wasn’t instruction. It was fun. Then, I was able to sneak some instruction in just because he’d ask me.”\nJustin Thomas gave his father a signed flag from the PGA Championship. Photo: Brian Costa/The Wall Street Journal The history of sports prodigies is filled with parents who pushed hard and never relented. But Justin Thomas—at age 24, the No. 2 player in the world—is a byproduct of an approach that completely defies the one most commonly seen in elite youth sports.\nOne of the most qualified parent-coaches in sports raised a major champion by under-coaching him. This was partly by necessity. Mike Thomas’s job required him to spend most of his days teaching members of the club, set amid rolling hills and thoroughbred breeding farms outside Louisville.\nBut it was also by design. Because he had to ask before receiving a swing tip, Justin was allowed to develop two things on his own: first, a love for the game, and then a feel for it.\nThe effect wasn’t just the avoidance of mental burnout. It was a degree of self-reliance that made him an outlier in a game filled with players who need to look outside the ropes to correct a flaw.\nThomas’s best rounds have been historic. A 59 at last year’s Sony Open made him the youngest PGA Tour player to break 60. His third-round 63 at last year’s U.S. Open was the lowest score relative to par ever in that tournament. But his defining rounds may be the ones in which he starts poorly, makes a change his peers wouldn’t dare attempt on the fly and finishes under par.\n“People are always blown away by that,” Thomas said while hosting a junior golf tournament at Harmony Landing last week. “They’ll be like, ‘You’ll change your grip in the middle of a round?’ Well, what am I going to do, keep hitting it bad?”\nJustin Thomas’s grandfather Paul looks at a display with signed balls from every tournament Thomas has won since his junior days. Photo: Brian Costa/The Wall Street Journal In the most basic sense, Thomas’s upbringing was typical for elite golfers. He grew up at a country club. Even as a baby, when his mother worked in the pro shop, he would nap there. He was hitting balls on the driving range by age 2 and spent most daylight hours at the course during the summer. But what made the club a perfect incubator for Thomas’s golf game is highly unusual.\nFirst, the members allowed a staff member’s child to roam and play freely. At one point, Mike Thomas said he turned down a higher-paying job at a blue-blood club because he knew that would never fly there.\nSecond, Thomas had access to high-level instruction without the pressure or over-coaching that, for many elite juniors, often goes along with it. This wasn’t unique to him. In the junior golf program at Harmony Landing, parents are often befuddled by the sight of inflatable swimming pools being used as targets on the driving range.\n“They’re like, ‘What are they learning from that?’” Mike Thomas said. “Here’s what they’re learning: They’re learning golf is fun, and that’s our goal. If they happen to get better, that’s a bonus.”\nGood golf genes have been passed down through the Thomas family. Justin’s grandfather, Paul Thomas, was a longtime golf pro who qualified for three major championships in the early 1960s. But the way in which the game has been shared across generations has also changed.\nBalls from Justin Thomas's first and second win. Photo: Brian Costa/The Wall Street Journal Mike Thomas grew up under far more pressure from his father to play well. “I was a little bit forceful with him,” Paul Thomas said, sitting beside his grandson’s memorabilia display one morning last week. “The way he brought Justin along, I could see where I made a mistake.”\nNeither way is perfect. Since October 2016, Justin Thomas has been arguably the best player in the world, with more wins (7) and top-10 finishes (17) than anyone else on the PGA Tour. But at times he has demanded more assertive input from his father, who remains his coach.\n“Sometimes he’s tentative to tell me stuff,” Justin Thomas said. “Like I won’t play well one day, and he’s like, ‘Yeah, I saw something in your warm-up.’ I’m like, ‘Well why didn’t you tell me?’”\nBut the ability to self-correct is part of what has gotten Thomas this far. He recalled one tournament during his time at the University of Alabama, where he won a national championship in 2013.\nThomas had just returned from an amateur event in Turkey and had barely practiced. His putting was woeful, putting him at 3 over par through three holes, so he switched to a cross-handed grip—left hand below the right, in reverse of the traditional position. It was akin to a basketball player switching to an underhanded shot because of a few missed free throws.\nHe still has the ball he used in that tournament. It’s on display in the pro shop at Harmony Landing, alongside the rest.\nWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T04:41:16.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
