Joe Manchin, a Democrat. Mr. Trump was seated Thursday between Rep. Evan Jenkins and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. The Republican president talked about a number of issues including immigration, the opioid crisis, coal, trade policy and gang violence.\nThe White House didn’t invite Mr. Blankenship, a former coal executive who served a year in prison on a charge of conspiring to violate mine-safety laws before a 2010 mine disaster, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nLate Thursday, Mr. Blankenship put out a statement thanking the president for visiting the state. He didn’t address Mr. Trump’s snub, but said Messrs. Morrisey and Jenkins are “career politicians willing to say and do anything to get elected and neither is capable of defeating Joe Manchin in November.”\nThursday marked the eight-year anniversary of Massey Energy Co.’s Upper Big Branch Mine explosion that killed 29 people . Mr. Blankenship was CEO of Massey at the time. \nMr. Trump attacked Mr. Manchin, a former West Virginia governor who faces a tough re-election fight in the conservative state, for not supporting legislation the White House backed on taxes and immigration. “We’re going to get a chance to have a senator that’s going to help our program,” the president said.\nLast year, Mr. Manchin regularly talked to Trump administration officials about developing a bipartisan tax bill, complaining that congressional Republicans had excluded Democrats from the tax talks.\nMr. Manchin issued a statement late on Thursday that criticized the president for “political posturing.”\nAs he wrapped up the event, Mr. Trump turned to the two GOP Senate candidates sitting on either side of him. “Evan. Good luck,” he told Mr. Jenkins. Then he turned to Mr. Morrisey, sitting on his left. “I don’t know. You, too. Good luck.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T09:06:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
