He returned in the eighth and got two outs before walking Manny Machado.\nJonathan Schoop then broke up the no-hitter with a single to center.\nGabriel Moya gave up a double to Baltimore pinch hitter Danny Valencia in the ninth before Tim Beckham homered. Still, the Orioles finished with just three hits.\nThey did draw seven walks, but couldn’t do much offensively with them.\nOn offense, the Twins relied on their power. They got solo homers from Sano, Jason Castro and Max Kepler in the first four innings.\nEach of those came off Baltimore starter Andrew Cashner (0-1), making his Orioles debut after they signed him during spring training. Cashner lasted five innings but allowed five runs (four earned) on six hits.\nSano also drove in a run on a groundout. He brought home another run when grounding into a double play but did not get an RBI for that.\nSano started the scoring with a homer in the first off Cashner. Castro homered in the third to make it 2-0, and Sano got his RBI groundout later in that inning.\nIn the fourth, Kepler homered for a 4-0 lead. Sano’s double-play grounder in the fifth stretched the lead to 5-0.\nJoe Mauer’s RBI single made it 6-0 in the seventh against rookie Nestor Cortes Jr., who was making his major league debut with the Orioles. Pedro Araujo came on in the eighth and made his major league debut also, breezing through a 1-2-3 inning.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:32:19.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
