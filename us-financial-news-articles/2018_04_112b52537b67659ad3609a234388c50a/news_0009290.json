Consumer-facing banking and private banking are also driving the move,” said Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer at Sanctum Wealth Management.\nThe Nifty auto index rose as much as 2 percent and was set to post a third consecutive session of gains.\nTata Motors climbed as much as 5.8 percent after Morgan Stanley said sales of Land Rovers in the United States grew 38 percent in March.\nEicher Motors Ltd rose as much as 3.8 percent on a higher production forecast for Royal Enfield motorcycles in the current fiscal year.\nPrivate lenders also rose, with the Nifty private bank index climbing as much as 0.7 percent, ahead of a decision on monetary policy by India’s central bank. Yes Bank Ltd was up over 2 percent.\nThe Reserve Bank of India is expected to keep monetary policy steady at its April meeting but shift to a hawkish stance by the end of this year and raise interest rates early in 2019 as inflation pressures build, a Reuters poll showed.\nAmong other gainers, Jet Airways Ltd rose as much as 3.2 percent after it announced a deal with Boeing Co to buy 75 Boeing 737 MAX narrow-body jets.\nShares of ICICI Securities Ltd and state-run Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd, however, fell on market debut.
