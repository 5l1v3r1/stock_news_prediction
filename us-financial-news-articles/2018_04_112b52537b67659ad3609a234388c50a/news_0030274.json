Equity performance was marginally negative. \n“The increased market volatility experienced over the past three months has had little effect on the fundamental drivers of returns in Emerging Markets and, as expected, both Emerging Markets fixed income and equity markets have outperformed,” Chief Executive Mark Coombs said. \n“Volatility that originates in the developed world typically leads to Emerging Markets assets being mispriced, presenting attractive investment opportunities.” \nAttractive valuations, the need to add to underweight allocations, better corporate earnings and credit fundamentals, and the prospect of currency strength as the dollar weakens, should all support investor confidence in emerging markets going forward, Coombs said.
