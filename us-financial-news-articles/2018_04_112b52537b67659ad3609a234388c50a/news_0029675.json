Saric later drained two 3-pointers and Redick hit one during a 12-0 push to increase the advantage to 112-87 with 6:25 left, and the 76ers cruised to the finish with a 40-point fourth quarter.\nOlynyk had 14 points as the Heat held a 60-56 halftime lead.\nMiami went on a 23-4 burst in the opening quarter to turn a seven-point deficit into a 35-23 lead.\nThe 76ers scored the final six points of the first quarter as part of an 18-3 surge that saw them take a 41-38 advantage with 8:14 left in the half.
