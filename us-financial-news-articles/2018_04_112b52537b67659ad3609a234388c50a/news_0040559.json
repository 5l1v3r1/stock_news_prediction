DIFFICULT DAY \nArsenal’s majority owner Stan Kroenke said it was “one of the most difficult days we have ever had in all our years in sport.” \n“One of the main reasons we got involved with Arsenal was because of what Arsene has brought to the club on and off the pitch,” he said. \n“His longevity and consistency over such a sustained period at the highest level of the game will never be matched.” \nWenger was virtually unknown to many fans when he arrived from Japan’s Nagoya Grampus Eight to take charge at the old Highbury ground at a time when foreign managers were still a rarity. \n“Arsene Who?,” read one banner.

He took Arsenal into the Champions League for 20 years in a row. \nThey won the league and FA cup double in 1998 and 2002. GREATEST MANAGER \nNews of his decision drew a flood of tributes and reaction from throughout the game. \n“He is above Herbert Chapman and all of the guys who won trophies,” former goalkeeper Bob Wilson told the BBC, adding that he was “shell-shocked” by the news. \n“Arsene is not only the greatest manager in Arsenal’s history, he has personally changed the face of the game in this country.” \nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho, who once derided Wenger as “a specialist in failure”, paid tribute to his old rival and said he hoped he stayed in football.

Maybe in the last few months not everybody was happy with this result or that... he was the dominating guy in the mid 1990s, 2000s.” \nFormer Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman said it was a sad day: “Can we now give him the send off/respect he deserves,” he asked on Twitter.
