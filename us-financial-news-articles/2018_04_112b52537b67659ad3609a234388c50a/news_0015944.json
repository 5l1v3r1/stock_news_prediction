It was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the stock in nearly two years. \nZuckerberg’s testimony aimed to strike a conciliatory tone in an attempt to blunt possible regulatory fallout from the privacy scandal engulfing his social network. \nThe energy index .SPNY had the highest percentage gain among the S&P’s 11 major sectors, adding 3.3 percent as oil broke above $70 a barrel. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 428.9 points, or 1.79 percent, to 24,408, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 43.71 points, or 1.67 percent, to 2,656.87 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 143.96 points, or 2.07 percent, to 7,094.30.

JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC.N ) will kick off the earnings season on Friday. \nAnalysts expect quarterly profits for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, which would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nSprint Corp ( S.N ) shares jumped 17.1 percent after reports that the company had restarted merger talks with   ). T-Mobile shares rose 5.7 percent. \nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.93-to-1 ratio favored advancers. \nThe S&P 500 posted six new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and 32 new lows. \nVolume so far on U.S. exchanges was 7.14 billion shares, compared with the 7.33 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
