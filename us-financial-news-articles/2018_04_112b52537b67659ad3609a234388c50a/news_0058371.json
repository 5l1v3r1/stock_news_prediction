TSMC, a key supplier for Apple Inc’s ( AAPL.O ) iPhones, cut its revenue target last week.\nBut Samsung Electronics, a rival and supplier to Apple, forecast continuing strong sales not only of server chips but mobile chips as well.\nSewon Chun, senior vice president at Samsung’s memory business, said the trend toward “high-density” chips with more processing power and bigger storage capacity would underpin demand for mobile DRAM and NAND chips this year.\nThis was being driven by new applications such as high-performance gaming, he told an earnings call.\nSamsung Electronics said operating profit was 15.6 trillion won ($14.4 billion) in the first quarter, up 58 percent from a year ago and in line with the 15.6 trillion won the company had estimated. Revenue jumped 19.8 percent to 60.6 trillion won, also in line with its estimate.\nSlideshow (2 Images) CHIPS UPSIDE The chip business was Samsung’s top earner again as it booked a record 11.6 trillion won operating profit in January-March, from 10.9 trillion won in the previous quarter, despite signs the recent boom in memory chips was tapering off.\nSamsung hinted at further potential upside after the United States banned U.S. firms from doing business with Chinese mobile phone and telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp ( 000063.SZ ) ( 0763.HK ).\nZTE would be forced to look elsewhere for mobile chips if top supplier Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) is locked out by the U.S. ban.\nBen Hur, vice president of Samsung’s System LSI business, which competes with Qualcomm, said Samsung would “actively respond” to new clients when he was asked by analysts if the ban would help Samsung’s chip sales in China.\nSamsung said its mobile business booked 3.8 trillion won in quarterly profit, up 82 percent from a year ago. Its flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone hit the market in mid-March.\nAccording to market research firm GfK, global smartphone demand fell two percent to 347 million units in the first quarter of 2018. Demand was especially sluggish in China and North America, it said.\nHowever, the average sales price grew 21 percent year-on-year in the quarter, leading to an 18 percent rise in global smartphone revenue to $129.8 billion.\n($1 = 1,081.2000 won)\nReporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T03:08:17.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
