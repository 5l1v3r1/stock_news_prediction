REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/Files The bank reinforced its “overweight” view on commodities, with a forecast return of 10 percent over the next 12 months.\n“With low cross-asset correlations, increasing inflationary risks, a positive carry and the potential for oil supply disruptions in the Middle East, the strategic case for owning commodities has rarely been stronger,” analysts at the investment bank said in a note.\nHowever, the bank does not expect direct impact on the global oil market from last week’s U.S. sanctions directed at Russian oligarchs and companies. Among them are aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin.\nLondon aluminium was on track for its biggest weekly gain on record after the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska-owned UC Rusal, the world’s second-biggest producer of the metal.\nMeanwhile, the potential reintroduction of sanctions on Iran was unlikely to have an immediate impact on the oil market, Goldman said.\nA worker controls forming of aluminium ingots on a conveyor belt at the foundry shop of the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, Russia November 9, 2017.
