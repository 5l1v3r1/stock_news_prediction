If we were to change our strategy whenever a tweet comes out, we would get crazy,\" he told Reuters.\nHARMFUL FOR ALL\nAround 18 percent of all BMWs sold in the world's largest car market were exported from Spartanburg last year, a total of 100,203 cars and the carmaker warned that a further escalation of the trade row \"would be harmful for all stakeholders\".\nChina has threatened to double tariffs to 50 percent on imported automobiles and other U.S.-made goods to retaliate against U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on products including vehicles and automotive parts.\n\"The BMW Group stands for free trade worldwide: Our company has a global production network and a global sales market,\" it added in a statement late on Wednesday.\nBMW this year quietly stopped exporting the X3 from the United States to China amid escalating trade tensions, moving the production footprint of the X3 to a plant in Rosslyn, South Africa and another in Shenyang, China.\n\"Thirty-five percent of those (vehicles) exported to China were the BMW X3, which is no longer exported from Spartanburg to China,\" BMW said.\nThe move to ramp up production capacity in China also stems from tightening requirements by Chinese regulators to increase sourcing of components from local suppliers.\nDaimler, parent company of Mercedes-Benz, declined to provide specific export figures from the United States to China and said: \"We dont speculate about ongoing negotiations. We are of course monitoring the situation closely.\"\nOther companies that will be affected include Tesla , which ships an estimated 15,000 cars a year to China from its California plant and Ford.\nDecisions on whether and where to shift vehicle production could be complicated by moves to significantly revamp or withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement that allows tariff-free shipments of vehicles to the United States from Mexico and Canada.\nBMW shares were trading up 0.55 percent at 87.9 euros at 1047 GMT, while Daimler stock was up 1.47 percent at 69.12 euros. Both lagged Germany's blue-chip DAX index, which was 1.9 percent higher.
