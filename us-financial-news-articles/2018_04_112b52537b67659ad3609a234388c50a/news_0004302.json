Resurgens has ranked as one of the 25 largest employers in the Atlanta Metro Area for six consecutive years. The Covington facility is one of 23 Resurgens locations across the Atlanta area.\nCompleted in 2004, Building 1 (Phase 1), representing 20,000 square feet, houses clinical space, physical therapy area, and MRI room. Building 2 (Phase 2), built in 2016, represents 12,785 square feet and houses a two-room, licensed surgery center. Both buildings are located on the same site and have highly specialized buildouts which provide a full range of orthopedic services for patients that include imaging, diagnosis, surgery and rehabilitation.\n“Resurgens is a household name throughout the state of Georgia, and we could not be more excited to complete this transaction with them,” said Chip Conk , CEO of Montecito Medical. “With the opportunity for Resurgens to continue to manage the property, and for their physicians to invest back into this property and others in our growing portfolio, we believe we are creating wins for all parties.”\nThe property acquired by Montecito involves Resurgens’ easternmost location and is approximately 25 miles from the organization’s next nearest facility. The property is strategically located between Covington and Conyers, allowing the practice to conveniently reach multiple markets along the I-20 corridor. The property is also situated between two short-term acute care hospitals, the Rockdale Medical Center (six miles west) and Piedmont Newton Hospital (six miles east).\n“Resurgens is excited about the growth occurring in our Newton County location. Our new outpatient surgery center and expanded office continue to serve the community in a comprehensive quality setting. We strive to care for the patients’ needs from office visits, physical therapy, advanced Imaging and outpatient surgery all in a superb quality setting. Our Newton county facility fits the Resurgens Mission,” said Dr. John R.
