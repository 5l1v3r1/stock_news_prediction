Eskom’s new management said its balance sheet was not sustainable after the firm reported a sharp slide in profits in January. \nThe government said as far back as 2015 that it was considering divesting some Eskom assets, but the proposal was vehemently opposed by unions like COSATU, on which Ramaphosa relies for support. \nEskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the utility would hold talks with unions about the plans to sell EFC.
