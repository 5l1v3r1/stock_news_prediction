But a decision on the next disbursement was delayed as the government’s talks with its creditors dragged on. \nIn a statement late on Friday, the IMF said it would immediately disburse about $51 million. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, the Fund’s deputy managing director, said the February deal “is expected to yield the necessary financing for the program and firmly restore external debt stability”. \nThe IMF also said it expects Chad’s economy to grow by 3.5 percent this year, after it contracted by 3.1 percent last year, assuming the terms of the agreement are implemented.
