The larger effort will now support 200 middle school STEM programs by 2020 and aim to reach 5 million students with free technology resources, teacher training, STEM curricula, and connectivity.\nVerizon asked for public nominations of middle schools to take part in the program. This can be done via Twitter posts directed at @verizon with the hashtag #Humanability.\n“Verizon has become increasingly concerned about the chasm between those Americans who are prepared to thrive in the digital age, and those who are not,” CEO Lowell McAdam said in a statement. “Our mission, which we call ‘Humanability,’ is to give people the ability to do more in this world—that’s why it’s paramount we invest to give kids the technology education and resources they need to succeed.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nWhile Verizon’s resources are offered to millions of students and teachers, the selected 200 schools also get in-school labs with gear to teach skills related to augmented reality, machine learning, computer coding, and 3-D printing.\nThe tax cut plan approved last year will have a disproportionate impact on Verizon because almost all of the company’s revenue comes from inside the United States. It was not able to take advantage of the common tax reduction strategies used in the tech and pharmaceutical industries, among others, under the old, higher tax rate. The reduction in the basic rate to 21% from 35% will increase Verizon’s cash flow by $3.5 billion to $4 billion this year alone.\nVerizon (vz) has previously announced that it would pay employee bonuses via grants of restricted stock worth over $2,000 each due to the tax legislation.", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-dials-up-wireless-revenue-growth-1516714601", "http://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-invest-more-200-million-stem-education-pledges-reach-5-million-students-5-years"], "published": "2018-04-02T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T00:20:44.089+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
