Gulf of Mexico and North Atlantic margins narrowed slightly.\nSan Antonio, Texas-based Valero has also been investing heavily in logistics assets such as pipelines and storage facilities to reduce costs and increase margins.\nThe company maintained its $2.7 billion capital expenditure forecast for the year.\nNet income attributable to Valero shareholders rose to $469 million, or $1.09 per share, from $305 million, or $0.68 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Valero earned $1 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 6 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose 21.4 percent to $26.44 billion.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T16:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:54:58.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
