Air France-KLM declined to comment and Cerberus was not immediately available for comment.\nAlitalia entered insolvency proceedings last year and the Italian government has since been seeking new investors. The sale process has been delayed as a result of last month’s elections.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan, Tim Hepher, Agnieszka Flak, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:29:54.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
