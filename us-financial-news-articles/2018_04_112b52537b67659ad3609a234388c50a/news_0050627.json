Trade frictions could affect market sentiment but are unlikely to have a big impact on the economy, Tajima said.\n“Until the U.S. mid-term election, the issue will not be solved. We don’t expect a trade war but there won’t be a trade peace either,” he said.\nAs for dollar assets, the insurer is looking to floating-rate products to make the most of the likely U.S. rate hikes.\n“So far we have been buying mostly fixed-coupon bonds. But we are looking into a shift to floating-rate bonds, such as securitised products,” Tajima said.\nTokio Marine plans to maintain full currency hedging on foreign bonds, officials said.\n“The exchange rate risk has a strong correlation with Japanese stocks, of which we already have quite a lot. So when we look at the risk-return (trade-off) of our entire portfolio, foreign bonds without currency hedging is not attractive,” Tajima said.\nThe insurance firm plans to reduce its Japanese stock portfolio, as their price volatilities remain one of biggest business risks for the company, officials also said.\nIn the year that ended on March 31, it cut its domestic stock holdings by 100 billion yen, they also said.\nEditing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T10:45:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
