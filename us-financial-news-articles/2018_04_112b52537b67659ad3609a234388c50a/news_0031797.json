Kevin Brady (R) Texas, Ways and Means Committee Chair; Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R) California, House Majority Leader; and Mick Mulvaney , Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Additional interviews are available on CNBC.com .\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\nREP. KEVIN BRADY (R) TEXAS, WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIR\nVideo: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/17/rep-mccarthy-and-rep-brady-on-tax-reform-house-leadership-and-trade.html?play=1 .\nBrady on \"The best is yet to come\":\nThe best is yet to come. Because this was really redesigned to leapfrog America to the lead pack as one of the best places on the planet for that next new plant, new facility. That takes some time. So I think the best is yet to come and today besides this being the last time we have to file, look at what's happening. So we are proposing the first reform of the IRS in 20 years. So we redesign, refocus, and really rein in the IRS abuses.\nBrady on IRS changes:\nWe require the IRS to bring us back a new restructure in the whole agency within a year and a half. We redesign their whole I.T. system so they can protect our personal, private taxpayer information better. And then we really create a truly independent appeals process that puts taxpayers on the same level as the IRS in these disputes so they can be resolved more affordably and more quickly. And that's just one part of some major changes of the IRS.\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R) CALIFORNIA, HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER\nVideo: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/17/rep-mccarthy-and-rep-brady-on-tax-reform-house-leadership-and-trade.html?play=1 .\nMcCarthy on the tax bill:\nAs economic growth continues to go, I think come November, and then April will even be greater. I know the chairman, this week, just today, we're passing 13 more tax bills on the floor that are changing the form of the IRS and identity theft. Very important things that Americans care about. We continue to work. I think at the end of the day, you'll see this is very popular.\nMcCarthy on Paul Ryan:\nPaul and I -- when we first came to congress, he's been one of my best friends. I don't know if you remember, back when we were in the minority, Paul and I and another -- Eric Cantor created, \"Young Guns,\" one of the integral parts of helping us win majority. We have been a partner all the way through this. I'm humbled Paul would say that, but what's most important, Kevin will tell you and every member of this conference, we have to make sure a republican could become speaker in the next congress. So we have a lot of work to do. History goes against us.\nMICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR OF OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET\nVideo: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/04/17/mick-mulvaney-on-tax-cuts-and-the-us-economy.html?play=1 .\nMick Mulvaney on structural changes:\nWe fundamentally changed the way the economy is structured, and the way we're going to tax wealth in this country, and wealth creation. Because keep it mind it's not only the tax code which we've reformed. Not just reduced the rates, we've changed the tax code. But we've also changed the regulatory policy, we've changed the energy policy, we've changed a lot of the way the economy works. This is a structural change of the economy for the better, and it's not a one-time thing.\nMick Mulvaney on why Democrats need tax reform to fail:\nThey're heavily invested in this message failing. If we reduce taxes, we reduce regulation, we increase energy independence and the economy does well, and all these people in this room get wealthier. There's a lot of Democrats who don't have anything to sell after that, so they need it to fail. And that's what worries me if the Democrats take the House.\nMick Mulvaney on spending:\nEven those Democrats who worry about the deficit, we have a fundamental disagreement over how to solve the problem. We think it's growth and spending restraint and they think it's higher taxes. That is a fundamental difference. And that is what worries me again about Democrat control. Not that they don't worry about the deficit – they don't worry about it as much as they say, but even those that worry about it want to solve it by raising taxes, which I think we're proving doesn't work.\nFor more information contact:\nJennifer Dauble\nCNBC\nt: 201.735.4721\nm: 201.615.2787\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\nEmma Martin\nCNBC\nt: 201.735.4713\nm: 551.275.6221\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com\nAbout CNBC:\nWith CNBC in the U.S., CNBC in Asia Pacific, CNBC in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and CNBC World, CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news and provides real-time financial market coverage and business information to more than 409 million homes worldwide, including more than 91 million households in the United States and Canada.
