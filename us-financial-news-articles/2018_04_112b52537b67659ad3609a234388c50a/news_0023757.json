The exact time and place of the summit have not been established.\n“Communications will by definition have to be sufficient for us to establish and prepare a successful summit,” the official said. “Preparations are under way.”\nAbe will be making his second visit to Mar-a-Lago. In February 2017, Trump and Abe were meeting there when North Korea launched a ballistic missile test.\nThe official said Trump will want to hear more advice from Abe about the prospective meeting with Kim. They will also talk about trade, the Indo-Pacific region and Chinese activity in the South China Sea that has raised tensions in the region, the official said.\nThe two leaders speak frequently on the phone.\n“The president has a great deal of respect for Prime Minister Abe’s views on Northeast Asia security. He will certainly want to know what additional thoughts Prime Minister Abe has beyond what he has already shared,” the official said.\nJapan, a long-time treaty ally of the United States, was taken by surprise when Trump announced his plan to meet Kim. Abe wants to ensure Tokyo’s security interests are taken into account.\nU.S. and Japanese officials familiar with the preparations for the Trump-Abe summit say Japan is worried Trump may seek a deal with Kim under which Pyongyang would agree to give up missiles capable of reaching the United States, without eliminating short- and medium-range missiles that threaten Japan and South Korea.\nSuch fears would not have been allayed by remarks on Thursday by CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s choice for next secretary of state.\nPompeo told his Senate confirmation hearing the aim of the Trump-Kim summit would be “an agreement with the North Korean leadership such that the North Korean leadership will step away from its efforts to hold America at risk with nuclear weapons.”\nAbe told Japan’s parliament this week he would ask Trump to seek elimination of all North Korean missiles that could reach Japan. Getting rid only of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles “has no meaning for Japan,” Kyodo news agency Quote: d him as saying.\nAsked if Trump would push for the elimination of all missiles, the administration official said: “I won’t go into details, other than to say the president ... is always keeping careful consideration of the interests of our allies and our alliances as well as the interests of securing the American people here at home.”\nAsked about Pompeo’s comments, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Katina Adams, said Washington remained “committed to achieving the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and its commitment to the defence of South Korea and Japan was “ironclad.”\nTrump and Abe will have an initial one-on-one meeting on Tuesday, then will be joined by national security aides for more talks. That night they will dine with their wives.\nOn Wednesday, the leaders will have broader discussions about a range of topics, followed by a joint news conference. Unlike last year, they are not expected to play golf.\nReporting by Steve Holland, David Brunstrom and John Walcott; Editing by Will Dunham, Phil Berlowitz and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:01:27.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
