He added that he intends to protect consumers who are ensnared in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices.\nThe CFPB is seeking a record fine against Wells Fargo & Co for auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses, Reuters reported, which would be the bureau’s first sanction under Mulvaney.\nMulvaney will also appear on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee. There, he is likely to be confronted by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has repeatedly questioned the agency’s current direction in Congress and opinion columns.
