REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo At a meeting at the presidential palace, Mattarella gave her an “exploratory mandate” and a Friday deadline to report back to him about the possibility of breaking the deadlock.\nIt has proved impossible to form a ruling coalition since the March 4 vote produced a hung parliament.\nCasellati, 71, said she would meet with members of the centre-right coalition which won most seats at the election but fell short of a working majority, and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which emerged as the largest single party.\nIt would be a surprise if her efforts are successful.\nThe 5-Star said earlier on Wednesday it would definitely not form a government with former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!) party, which is a core component of the centre-right.\nCasellati is a senior member of Forza Italia and is extremely close to Berlusconi.\nThe European Union’s third-largest economy has been under a caretaker government since the election.\nTwo rounds of formal consultations have failed to overcome seemingly irreconcilable positions, and the stalemate is likely to persist until regional elections later this month, according to political sources.\nReporting By Philip Pullella, editing by Gavin Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T18:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:03:17.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
