REUTERS/Amit Dave \nRates for top exporter India’s 5 percent broken parboiled variety fell by $2 to $417-$421 per tonne. \nThe falling rupee has allowed exporters to sign deals at lower prices without reducing net revenue, said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. \nThe dollar rose to the highest in nearly seven months versus the rupee on Thursday, pushing up prices in dollar terms. \nAlso weighing on Indian exports was weak demand from Bangladesh, which had emerged as a major importer since 2017 after floods depleted stocks. India had accounted for over two-thirds of Bangladesh’s imports due to lower freight charges. \nBangladesh expects to harvest 19 million tonnes from its summer crop, nearly 6 percent more than a year ago, said Mohammad Mohsin, director general of Department of Agriculture Extension. \nNo new deals are being struck as harvesting has started, while the government’s stock levels have improved significantly, a trader said. \nIn Thailand, 5 percent broken rice rates jumped to $445-454 per tonne free on board (FOB) Bangkok, the highest since June 2017, from $437-438 last week. \n“This year off-season crops have been damaged by pests, so supply has decreased. In some areas, it reduced production by half of what was expected for April. Things should improve by the end of next month when new lot of off-season crops are harvested,” a Bangkok-based trader said. \nThai exporters were also stocking up amid speculation of new deals with Indonesia. \n“If the deal with Indonesian government does materialise, it should be for 200,000–300,000 tonnes,” the trader said, adding that fresh deals with the Philippines could also happen in the coming weeks. \nHowever, another trader said the market was slightly overheated. \n“I think the prices are slightly inflated because it is based more on speculation than actual fresh deals.” \nVietnam’s 5 percent broken rice prices rose for a fourth straight week, edging up to $438-$440 a tonne from $435-$440 previously. \n“Prices remain high as Vietnam has recently been clinching new deals with Indonesia and Philippines, while the winter-spring harvest has almost ended,” a Ho Chi Minh City-based trader said. \nThe National Food Authority of the Philippines earlier this week sent a request to Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade to buy 250,000 tonnes, including 200,000 tonnes of 25 percent broken rice and 50,000 tonnes of 15 percent broken rice, as per the request seen by Reuters. \nThe procurement is part of the Philippines’s government-to-government purchasing plan for 2018.
