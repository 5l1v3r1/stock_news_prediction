The firms have slashed prices for car rides, motorcycle trips and a raft of other services.\nThe transport ministry moved last month to classify Grab and Go-Jek as transportation instead of technology companies. That means they would be subject to the same regulations as regular taxi and bus companies and could potentially face higher costs and scrutiny.\nMotorcycle taxi drivers working for online ride-hailing start-ups Grab and Go-jek protest against low tariffs outside parliament in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Whiteside But there were no plans yet to apply the regulations to motorcycle taxis, said Budi Setyadi, director general of land transportation at the transport ministry.\n“With regard to tariffs, it depends on the goodwill of the companies,” Setyadi told Reuters on Monday.\nThe drivers said on Monday they want a standard fare of 3,000 to 4,000 rupiah (22 cents to 29 cents) per kilometer.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Both Grab and Go-Jek have yet to make significant changes to their tariff structure.\nGrab has said it preferred to maintain current rates because “Grab has other programs to improve the livelihood of its drivers”.\nReporting by Darren Whiteside and Tabita Diela; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T15:07:15.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
