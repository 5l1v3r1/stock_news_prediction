They won’t leave their homes and they’re on the verge of depression — some more than others because some of the sanctions are manageable, but the Rouet brothers (bans) are very harsh.” \nSpain can still qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1999 but will need to beat Portugal in a playoff in order to qualify for a two-legged tie against Samoa in June. \nNone of the five banned players will be able to feature in those games. \nNo date has been set for the playoff and Nava said his players were struggling to focus while the investigation into the Belgium game continues. \n“Right now no-one is thinking about the Portugal game or any other game,” added the captain. \n“We’re going to take this issue, which is the federation’s priority, (to) the end. We’re going to see what conclusions World Rugby come to. We want to think that this injustice will be resolved.” Reporting by Richard Martin,; Editing by Neville Dalton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:03:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
