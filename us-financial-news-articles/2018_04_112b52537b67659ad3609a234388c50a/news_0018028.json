He added that conservative lawmakers were “far, far away” from backing EDIS. \nThe responsibility for economic and political decisions in Europe has to remain with individual member states and must not be mutualised, Brinkhaus said. \nThe senior lawmaker also rejected a proposal from the European Commission to create a synthetic “safe asset” that would offer investors an alternative to sovereign bonds. \n“I think it’s a fishy proposal and I’m worried that this would lead to euro bonds by the backdoor,” Brinkhaus said. \nBerlin has long been opposed to the introduction of jointly issued sovereign bonds, also called euro bonds. German taxpayers are concerned that any attempt to mutualise debt with other European nations with less budget discipline could mean they would end up footing the bill for other governments’ failures. \nThe euro zone’s bailout chief Klaus Regling has urged governments to find a compromise over ambitious reform for the single currency bloc. He warned that a lack of action carried the risk of missing a crucial window of opportunity. \nRegling said political momentum was being lost as governments quarrel over how to advance the banking union and create new eurozone instruments.
