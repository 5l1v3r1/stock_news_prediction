But just as Klizan appeared to be on the verge of delivering a psychological blow, the 10-times Barcelona champion saved the set point at 4-5 down before breaking back to level.\nHe held in the next game to take the lead for the first time in the second set and then broke a tired Klizan to clinch his place in the semis, where he will be looking for an 18th consecutive match win on clay against either Belgian David Goffin or Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut.\nGreek teenager Stefanos Tsitsipas also reached the last four after overwhelming third seed Thiem 6-3 6-2 and the 19-year-old will next face Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta, who served up another upset by defeating second seed Grigor Dimitrov 6-3 7-6(4).\nTsitsipas converted four out of eight break points and made Thiem pay for an error-strewn display to secure the biggest win of his career.\nThiem began the contest strongly and came within a point of going up 3-0 in the opening set but allowed Tsitsipas to fight back. The Greek won a decisive break to go ahead at 5-3 after a double fault by Thiem and then served out the set.\nTsitsipas broke at 2-2 in the second set after more wayward hitting by Thiem and the world number 63 pulled away to seal the match.\nCarreno Busta, seeded fifth in Barcelona, saw off Dimitrov to reach his second semi-final of the year and level his head-to-head with the Bulgarian at three wins apiece.
