With this latest release, Disney DIS, -0.61% now has nine of the 10 biggest box-office domestic openings of all time. “Avengers” barely passed the domestic record held by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which made its debut to $248 million in 2015, and trounced the $541 million global record set by last year’s “The Fate of the Furious.”\nThe studio is on an unprecedented box-office streak. It crossed the $1 billion mark at the domestic box office in 117 days this year — another industry record.\nWith a budget of about $300 million, “Avengers: Infinity War” is the first half of a two-part culmination for Disney’s Marvel Studios, which has been building out a “cinematic universe” of interconnected characters and story lines over 19 movies thus far. “Infinity War” combines those elements, tossing characters like Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Spider-Man into the same movie as the good guys team up against a civilization-crushing villain called Thanos. A follow-up to “Infinity War” is scheduled for release in May 2019.
