(NYSE: GEO) (“GEO”), a fully integrated equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and a leading provider of evidence-based offender rehabilitation and community reentry services around the globe, reported today its financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet Income Attributable to GEO of $35.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share Net Operating Income of $146.0 million Normalized FFO of $0.43 per diluted share AFFO of $0.57 per diluted share Repurchased over 1.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $40.0 million during 1Q18\nGEO reported first quarter 2018 net income attributable to GEO of $35.0 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $40.4 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the first quarter 2017. GEO reported total revenues for the first quarter 2018 of $564.9 million up from $550.6 million for the first quarter 2017.\nGEO reported first quarter 2018 Normalized Funds From Operations (“Normalized FFO”) of $52.6 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to $58.1 million, or $0.51 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017. GEO reported first quarter 2018 Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) of $69.8 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to $74.0 million, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017.\nGeorge C. Zoley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GEO, said, “We are pleased with our first quarter results and our improved outlook for the balance of 2018. We continue to be optimistic about the demand for our services and are pursuing a number of quality growth opportunities. We also recognize that we can enhance our shareholders’ value by repurchasing our common shares at times when we believe our stock is undervalued. During the first quarter, we repurchased over 1.8 million shares of our common stock. Our board and our management team remain focused on effectively allocating capital to drive long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders.”\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter 2018, GEO repurchased over 1.8 million shares of its common stock for approximately $40.0 million under the $200.0 million stock repurchase program approved by GEO’s Board of Directors.\nThe stock repurchase program is intended to be implemented through purchases made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable Securities and Exchange Commission requirements. The stock repurchase program does not obligate GEO to purchase any specific amount of its common stock and may be suspended or extended at any time at the discretion of GEO’s Board of Directors.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn April 11, 2018, GEO’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.47 per share. The quarterly cash dividend will be paid on May 3, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 23, 2018. The declaration of future quarterly cash dividends is subject to approval by GEO’s Board of Directors and to meeting the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations. GEO’s Board of Directors retains the power to modify its dividend policy as it may deem necessary or appropriate in the future.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nGEO updated its financial guidance for the full-year 2018 and issued financial guidance for the second quarter 2018.\nGEO expects full-year 2018 total revenue to be approximately $2.3 billion. GEO expects full-year 2018 Net Income Attributable to GEO to be in a range of $1.27 to $1.35 per diluted share. GEO expects full-year 2018 Adjusted Net Income to be in a range of $1.30 to $1.38 per diluted share. GEO expects full-year 2018 AFFO to be in a range of $2.45 to $2.53 per diluted share.\nGEO’s full-year 2018 guidance does not assume the reactivation of any of GEO’s approximately 7,000 idle or underutilized beds or any additional share repurchases under GEO’s $200.0 million share repurchase program beyond the over 1.8 million shares of common stock that were repurchased during the first quarter 2018.\nFor the second quarter 2018, GEO expects total revenues to be in a range of $571 million to $576 million. GEO expects second quarter 2018 Net Income Attributable to GEO to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.32 per diluted share. GEO expects second quarter 2018 Adjusted Net Income to be in a range of $0.31 to $0.33 per diluted share and AFFO to be in a range of $0.59 to $0.61 per diluted share.\nReconciliation Tables and Supplemental Information\nGEO has made available Supplemental Information which contains reconciliation tables of Net Income Attributable to GEO to Net Operating Income, Net Income to EBITDAre (EBITDA for real estate) and Adjusted EBITDAre (Adjusted EBITDA for real estate), Net Income Attributable to GEO to Adjusted Net Income, and Net Income Attributable to GEO to FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO along with supplemental financial and operational information on GEO’s business and other important operating metrics.

(NYSE: GEO) is the first fully integrated equity real estate investment trust specializing in the design, financing, development, and operation of correctional, detention, and community reentry facilities around the globe. GEO is the world's leading provider of diversified correctional, detention, community reentry, and electronic monitoring services to government agencies worldwide with operations in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. GEO's worldwide operations include the ownership and/or management of 141 facilities totaling approximately 96,000 beds, including projects under development, with a growing workforce of approximately 23,000 professionals.\nNote to Reconciliation Tables and Supplemental Disclosure –\nImportant Information on GEO’s Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nNet Operating Income, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, Funds from Operations, Normalized Funds from Operations, Adjusted Funds from Operations, and Adjusted Net Income are non-GAAP financial measures that are presented as supplemental disclosures. GEO has presented herein certain forward-looking statements about GEO's future financial performance that include non-GAAP financial measures, including, Net Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDAre, FFO, Normalized FFO, and AFFO. The determination of the amounts that are excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures is a matter of management judgment and depends upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts recognized in a given period. While we have provided a high level reconciliation for the guidance ranges for full year 2018, we are unable to present a more detailed quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of such GAAP measures. The quantitative reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures will be provided for completed annual and quarterly periods, as applicable, calculated in a consistent manner with the quantitative reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures previously reported for completed annual and quarterly periods.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) Impact. We recorded a net charge of $0.3 million related to the TCJA during the three months ended March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA. Our net charge is provisional based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. Changes to these estimates or new guidance issued by regulators may materially impact our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. Our accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA will be completed during the measurement period, which should not extend beyond the fourth quarter of 2018. We have provided non-GAAP financial measures related to the TCJA to aid investors in better understanding our performance. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNet Operating Income is defined as revenues less operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, real estate related operating lease expense, and start-up expenses, pre-tax. Net Operating Income is calculated as net income adjusted by subtracting equity in earnings of affiliates, net of income tax provision, and by adding income tax (benefit) provision, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, and real estate related operating lease expense.\nEBITDAre (EBITDA for real estate) is defined as net income adjusted by adding provisions for income tax, interest expense, net of interest income, depreciation and amortization, and gain on sale of real estate assets, pre-tax. Adjusted EBITDAre (Adjusted EBITDA for real estate) is defined as EBITDAre adjusted for net income/loss attributable to non-controlling interests, stock-based compensation expenses, pre-tax, and certain other adjustments as defined from time to time, including for the periods presented merger and acquisition (“M&A”) related expenses (including transition related expenses), pre-tax. Given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, we believe that EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are helpful to investors as measures of our operational performance because they provide an indication of our ability to incur and service debt, to satisfy general operating expenses, to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs or reinvest cash into our business.\nWe believe that by removing the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) and excluding certain non-cash charges, amounts spent on interest and taxes, and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre provide our investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, per diem rates and operating costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to GEO.\nThe adjustments we make to derive the non-GAAP measures of EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in income from continuing operations and which we do not consider to be the fundamental attributes or primary drivers of our business plan and they do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by our management and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of our historical operating performance and our business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes.\nFunds From Operations, or FFO, is defined in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, which defines FFO as net income/loss attributable to common shareholders (computed in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from the cumulative effects of accounting changes, extraordinary items and sales of properties, and including adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Normalized Funds from Operations, or Normalized FFO, is defined as FFO adjusted for certain items which by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure GEO’s actual operating performance, including for the periods presented net TCJA impact, M&A related expenses (including transition related expenses), and tax effect of adjustments related to M&A expenses.\nAdjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, is defined as Normalized FFO adjusted by adding non-cash expenses such as non-real estate related depreciation and amortization, stock based compensation expense, the amortization of debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium and other non-cash interest, and by subtracting recurring consolidated maintenance capital expenditures.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income Attributable to GEO adjusted for certain items which by their nature are not comparable from period to period or that tend to obscure GEO’s actual operating performance, including for the periods presented net TCJA impact, M&A related expenses (including transition related expenses), net of tax, and gain on sale of real estate assets, net of tax.\nBecause of the unique design, structure and use of our correctional facilities, we believe that assessing the performance of our correctional facilities without the impact of depreciation or amortization is useful and meaningful to investors. Although NAREIT has published its definition of FFO, companies often modify this definition as they seek to provide financial measures that meaningfully reflect their distinctive operations. We have modified FFO to derive Normalized FFO and AFFO that meaningfully reflect our operations.\nOur assessment of our operations is focused on long-term sustainability. The adjustments we make to derive the non-GAAP measures of Normalized FFO and AFFO exclude items which may cause short-term fluctuations in net income attributable to GEO but have no impact on our cash flows, or we do not consider them to be fundamental attributes or the primary drivers of our business plan and they do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. We may make adjustments to FFO from time to time for certain other income and expenses that do not reflect a necessary component of our operational performance on the basis discussed above, even though such items may require cash settlement. Because FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO exclude depreciation and amortization unique to real estate as well as non-operational items and certain other charges that are highly variable from year to year, they provide our investors with performance measures that reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, per diem rates, operating costs and interest costs, providing a perspective not immediately apparent from Net Income Attributable to GEO.\nWe believe the presentation of FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO provide useful information to investors as they provide an indication of our ability to fund capital expenditures and expand our business. FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO provide disclosure on the same basis as that used by our management and provide consistency in our financial reporting, facilitate internal and external comparisons of our historical operating performance and our business units and provide continuity to investors for comparability purposes. Additionally, FFO, Normalized FFO and AFFO are widely recognized measures in our industry as a real estate investment trust.\nSafe-Harbor Statement\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and future performance of GEO that involve risks and uncertainties that could materially affect actual results, including statements regarding financial guidance for the second quarter of 2018 and full year 2018, the assumptions underlying such guidance, and statements regarding future project activations and growth opportunities.
