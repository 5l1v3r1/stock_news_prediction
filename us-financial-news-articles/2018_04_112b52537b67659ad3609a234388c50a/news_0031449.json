P-Series technology was invented and perfected in Silicon Valley, and will now be built in SolarWorld Americas' factory, helping to reshape solar manufacturing in America.\"\n\"SunPower is the solar industry technology leader,\" said JÃ¼rgen Stein, CEO of SolarWorld Americas. \"We are delighted that SunPower has agreed to inject fresh capital and their industry leading P-Series technology into SolarWorld Americas operations here in Hillsboro.
