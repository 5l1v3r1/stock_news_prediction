Feldmann, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Cubic Corporation. \"We regularly evaluate our portfolio to ensure we are devoting our resources to strategic markets where domain expertise, innovation and technical competency enable us to build market-leading positions with strong growth potential and higher margins. The sale proceeds will provide us with increased financial flexibility to pursue profitable growth opportunities in those markets.\"\n\"We also believe current market dynamics are driving consolidation in the defense services industry, and the scale required to compete has increased meaningfully. This transaction will allow our Services business and its employees to be part of a more appropriately focused platform that will be better positioned to grow,\" added Feldmann.\nOn March 31, 2018, the assets and liabilities of CGD Services will be considered held for sale and will be held at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less estimated cost to sell. In Cubic's fiscal second quarter results, the CGD Services business will be reflected as discontinued operations and the previous period financial results will be reclassified for comparative purposes.

Upon the close of sale, the non-cash charge will be adjusted based upon a final analysis of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities at the date of the sale, including the assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.\nThe transaction is anticipated to be completed within 30 to 60 days, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\nCGD Services is a non-Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) providing training, operations, intelligence, maintenance, technical and other support services to the U.S. government, its agencies and allied nations.
