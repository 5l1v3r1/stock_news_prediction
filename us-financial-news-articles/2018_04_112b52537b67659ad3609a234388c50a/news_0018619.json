But Will does not believe that description of the events actually happened. \n“He’s not the type who would not have his hands on the steering wheel, he’s always been [a] really careful driver,” he said. \nRegardless, Tesla says it is not responsible for preventing all crashes from occurring — just reducing the likelihood of them happening. \n“In the US, there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers,” the automaker said in a March 30 statement. “For Tesla, there is one fatality, including known pedestrian fatalities, every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware. If you are driving a Tesla equipped with Autopilot hardware, you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident. \n“Tesla Autopilot does not prevent all accidents – such a standard would be impossible – but it makes them much less likely to occur,” the statement continued. “It unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants, pedestrians and cyclists.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": ["http://abc7news.com/automotive/exclusive-wife-of-man-who-died-in-tesla-crash-gives-emotional-interview-to-i-team/3325177/", "https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-last-week%E2%80%99s-accident"], "published": "2018-04-12T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T02:22:17.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
