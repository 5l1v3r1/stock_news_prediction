Growth at constant scope and exchange rates was 3.8%.\nSopra Steria: Consolidated revenue – Q1 2018 €m / % Q1 2018\nIFRS 15\nQ1 2017\nIFRS 15\nOrganic\ngrowth*\nTotal growth\nRevenue 991.8 949.7 3.8% 4.4% * Alternative performance measures are defined in the glossary at the end of this document Comments on Q1 2018 business activity\nSopra Steria posted revenue growth of 4.4% for the first quarter of 2018. Changes in scope had a positive impact of €17.2 million, while currency fluctuations had a negative impact of €11.0 million, due to the drop in the value of the British pound and Scandinavian currencies with respect to the euro compared to the first quarter of 2017. At constant exchange rates, revenue growth was 5.7%. At constant scope and exchange rates, growth came to 3.8%.\nIn France , first-quarter revenue was €426.3 million. Taking into account a negative calendar effect (1 day less), organic growth was 1.8%. Excluding the calendar effect, market patterns and revenue growth trends remained similar to those observed over full-year 2017. Business for the quarter was driven by consulting, up more than 10%, and by cybersecurity, up more than 30%. The quarter’s best-performing vertical markets were banking, insurance, defence and aeronautics.\nIn the United Kingdom , first-quarter revenue (€188.4 million) equated to negative growth of 7.4%. At constant exchange rates and scope, negative growth was 4.8%. This change was due to the decrease in revenue for the SSCL joint venture, for which revenue for financial year 2018 is expected to total around £140 million (as indicated in early 2017). Excluding SSCL, the business recorded slight growth for the quarter. This change was driven by an improvement in the market environment with respect to the second half of 2017, particularly in the public sector. In parallel, ongoing initiatives (to refocus the business model on higher-added-value services, reinforce the Group’s presence in the private sector, invest in consulting and the Group’s sales force, and cut costs) continued according to schedule during the quarter.\nThe Other Europe reporting unit posted robust positive organic revenue growth of 13.4%, with revenue coming to €231.6 million. All the countries in this reporting unit contributed to growth for the quarter. Performance was very strong in Germany, particularly in the public sector and the banking sector, confirming the country’s positive sales trend and operational momentum.\nSopra Banking Software posted revenue of €88.2 million, representing organic growth of 11.8%. With the key features of 2018 being the continuation of major investments and the delivery of the last main components of the “Platform” core banking product, the first quarter also saw strong growth in Cassiopae’s specialist loans business. Following the successes achieved with Hyundai, Volkswagen and Siemens, Sopra Banking Software began business relations with Nissan. In payments, the Sopra Banking Platform for Payments software solution for Transactis successfully went live. Another noteworthy trend was the continued momentum in Africa, which was boosted in particular by the success of the new “Amplitude Up” version of the Group’s “Amplitude” core banking product.\nThe Other Solutions reporting unit generated revenue of €57.4 million, equating to organic growth of 2.2%. It now includes Property Management Solutions-related revenue generated by Cassiopae. As regards Human Resource Solutions, the first quarter benefited in particular from preparations to implement income tax withholding in 2019 in France.\nWorkforce\nAt 31 March 2018, the Group’s total workforce consisted of 42,376 people (41,661 at 31 December 2017), with 19% working in X-Shore zones.\nExternal growth\nOn 8 January 2018, the Group announced its plan to acquire BLUECARAT, a German company with 2017 revenue of €33 million. The company should be consolidated during the second quarter of 2018. Sopra Banking Software successfully acquired O.R. System, the developer of a counterparty risk management solution for the banking sector and financial institutions. The company posted revenue of around €2 million in 2017, and will be consolidated during the second quarter of 2018.\nOutlook\nAs a reminder, the Group’s targets for the 2018 financial year are as follows:\nOrganic revenue growth of between 3% and 5% A slight improvement in operating margin on business activity Free cash flow in excess of €170 million (€133 million including the 2017 sale of trade receivables for €37 million)\nThe seasonal effect between the two half-year periods will be more pronounced in 2018 than in 2017, due to the more favourable calendar effect in the second half-year, the higher concentration of licence sales in the second half-year and the investment plan launched in the first half-year in the United Kingdom.\nUpcoming events\nTuesday, 12 June 2018: Annual General Meeting of Shareholders – 2:30 p.m. / Pavillon Dauphine, Paris (France)\nFriday, 27 July 2018: Publication of 2018 half-year results (before market) and presentation meeting\nGlossary\nRestated revenue : Revenue for the prior year, expressed on the basis of the scope and exchange rates for the current year.
