He is widely considered as the favourite for the job. \nThe 56-year-old, with a doctorate in economics from Oxford University, spent a decade at the European Commission, and during the euro zone debt crisis was economic and monetary affairs commissioner. \nIn that role, he became known for advocating strict fiscal discipline and structural reforms for troubled European states. \nIn 2016, Rehn quit his post as a government minister in Finland to become a member of the Bank of Finland’s board. \n“I would say Rehn is the favourite here, due to his experience and knowledge,” said Jan Von Gerich, an analyst at Nordea Bank. \n“If a small country wants to have a wider impact on the ECB, the person must have certain qualities to enter the right circles there.” \nMajor policy changes are not expected after the departure of Liikanen, who is known for largely backing ECB President Mario Draghi. \nOther candidates for the job include Timo Loyttyniemi, the vice chairman at the EU’s Single Resolution Board, and member of parliament Juhana Vartiainen. \nA group of lawmakers at the bank’s parliamentary supervisory council will conduct the interviews. Finland’s president Sauli Niinisto is due to nominate the new governor in May.
