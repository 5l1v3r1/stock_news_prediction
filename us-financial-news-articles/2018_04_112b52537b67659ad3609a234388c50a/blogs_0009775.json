The diesel vehicles cost the force 97,000 Swiss francs (roughly $100,693) per vehicle on average compared to 140,000 Swiss francs (about $152,597) for each Model X, they said.\nThe police noted that the Teslas have a range of over 465 kilometers (up to 289 miles) on a full charge, while the force's current fleet of diesel vehicles covers an average of 200 kilometers (124 miles) per day. That means the electric vehicles should have no problem making it through a full day of police work without needing to recharge. (There are also plans to install two charging stations in the area.)\nshow chapters Elon Musk's personally responding to questions and complaints from his customers 5:04 PM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 00:54 The move has been met with some criticism, though. Councilor Felix Wehrli, a detective at the Criminal Investigation Department, told Swiss newspaper BZ Basel : \"It is incomprehensible that almost one million francs [roughly $1 million] are being purchased for vehicles that have not yet been tested in everyday police life.\"\nBut as Elon Musk himself says , anything innovative comes with risk.\nThe Basel-Stadt police would not be the first law enforcement group to consider adding Teslas to their fleet. The Los Angeles Police Department previously tested the idea of adding Tesla Model S sedans to its fleet, while the Denver Police Department actually did convert a Model S into a police car for community outreach events (but not for daily patrols).\nTWEET\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, a Canadian police division in Ontario also outfitted a Tesla Model X as a police car for the Canadian International Auto Show as part of a display the group called \"the future of policing.\"\nDon't miss:\nIn Twitter rant, Elon Musk says he's deleting Tesla and SpaceX Facebook accounts\nElon Musk shows off Tesla pulling a 250,000-pound load\nElon Musk explains his motivation to succeed: \"There need to be things that inspire you\"\nLike this story?
