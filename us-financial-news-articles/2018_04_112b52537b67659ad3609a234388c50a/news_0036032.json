Everything you see in sci-fi movies is going to happen,\" he said.\nHe highlighted the sheer speed of technological progress.\n\"There are no peaks anymore, there are no big discoveries anymore ... It's all happening so fast that you don't realize the amount of change between this year and last year,\" he said. \"The technology adoption curve ... is just very very much accelerating, to the point we're now talking about product life cycles in months, not even in years.\nEthical question for machines A.I. has sparked fears and warnings that machines might dominate humans, but Gawdat said that it's up to people to show them the right behavior.\n\"The idea of us worrying about this might be warranted, (but) it doesn't get us far.\" Instead, he said, action should be taken. That could include portraying the right value sets to machines, which are continually observing humans, he explained.\nDespite that, Gawdat warned that, eventually, it would be the machines that have the power, not countries owning the technology.\nSpeaking to CNBC's Martin Soong, Gawdat said he believed it will be tough to control machines through regulation.\n\"Control is an illusion ... there is no control, especially if you are trying to control a species that is much smarter than you are,\" he said.\n\"The reality is the smartest hacker today hacks the internet regardless of all the controls we put in. Who's going to be the smartest hacker in 20 years time? The machine.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T09:01:35.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
