In addition, the funding commitment from Fengate will facilitate Greengate’s continued growth as an industry-leading producer of renewable and clean energy projects in North America. CohnReznick Capital acted as the exclusive financial advisor to Greengate.\n“We are excited as this transformative funding builds on more than a decade of Greengate’s success in Alberta and Ontario’s growing renewable and clean energy markets and supports our move into other markets,” stated Dan Balaban, President and Chief Executive Officer of Greengate Power. “Our strong track record has proven we are nimble and creative, and now with solid financial backing from Fengate, a top-tier investor, Greengate is well-positioned to capitalize on its capabilities and satisfy the growing demand for renewable and clean sources of energy.”\n“We are pleased to expand our platform to build and provide clean, reliable sources of energy across North America,” said Andrew Cogan, Managing Director, Infrastructure Investments, Fengate. “We are impressed with Greengate’s track record and the quality of their developments, and this investment will provide stable, long-term cash flows for our investors. Our partnership enables us to access opportunities at an earlier stage, in a prudent manner, leveraging the deep expertise of Greengate.”\nGreengate is a leading independent renewable and clean energy developer with a strong track record of successfully originating and developing 480 MW of operating renewable energy assets in Alberta and Ontario, Canada, since 2007.
