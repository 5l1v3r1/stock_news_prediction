Prior year results were not impacted by an income tax provision.\nThe Company converted $10.6 million of outstanding trust preferred securities to 1.6 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2018.

More than $21 million in new SBA loans were originated during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 16.00% and Tier I Leverage Ratio was 10.09% at March 31, 2018.\nBook value per common share increased to $3.99 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $3.84 as of March 31, 2017.\nIncome Statement\nThe major components of the income statement are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended 03/31/18 03/31/17 % Change Total Revenue $ 25,434 $ 20,525 24 % Provision for Loan Losses 400 - 100 % Non-interest Expense 20,102 16,804 20 % Income Before Taxes 2,149 1,753 23 % Provision (Benefit) for Taxes 372 (34 ) n/m Net Income 1,777 1,787 (1 %) Net Income per Share $ 0.03 $ 0.03 - % The Company reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 24%, to $25.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $20.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income as a result of the strong growth in interest-earning assets over the last twelve months driven by the Company’s “Power of Red is Back” expansion program.\nNon-interest income increased to $4.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $4.3 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 20%, to $20.1 million during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $16.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was mainly caused by the increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the growth and relocation strategy also contributed to the increase in non-interest expenses.\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of $372 thousand for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit for income taxes in the amount of $34 thousand for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The amount recorded during the first quarter of 2018 is a normalized provision reflective of the new corporate tax rate included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The benefit for income taxes recognized during the first quarter of 2017 was driven by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance that had been recorded by Company in previous years. This valuation allowance was reversed during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nThe major components of the balance sheet are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDescription\n03/31/18\n03/31/17 % Change\n12/31/17 % Change Total assets $ 2,471,464 $ 1,968,588 26 % $ 2,322,347 6 % Total loans (net) 1,244,262 1,016,962 22 % 1,153,679 8 % Total deposits 2,123,451 1,720,512 23 % 2,063,295 3 % Total assets increased by $502.9 million, or 26%, as of March 31, 2018 when compared to March 31, 2017.
