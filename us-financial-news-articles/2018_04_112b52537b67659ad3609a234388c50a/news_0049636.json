(“ Prophecy ” or the “ Company ”) ( TSX:PCY , OTCQX:PRPCF , Frankfurt:1P2N ) announces an amendment to the Gibellini mineral lease agreement dated June 22, 2017 (the “ MLA ”), whereby Prophecy has been granted the right to cause the current holder (the “ Lessor ”) of the Gibellini mineral claims (which Prophecy is currently leasing) to transfer their title to the claims to Prophecy.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180423005223/en/\n(Graphic: Business Wire)\nMineral Lease Agreement Background:\nUnder the MLA, Prophecy agreed to pay the Lessor, annual advance royalty payments which will be tied, based on an agreed formula (not to exceed US$120,000 per year), to the average vanadium pentoxide price of the prior year. Upon commencement of production by Prophecy, the Company will stop advance royalty payments and instead pay to the Lessor, a 2.5% net smelter return ( “NSR” ) until a total of US$3 million is paid. Thereafter, the NSR will be reduced to 2% over the remaining life of the mine (and referred to thereafter, as “production royalty payments”). All advance royalty payments made, will be deducted as credits against future production royalty payments.\nProphecy leased the Gibellini mineral claims (which comprise the majority of the resource per the Company’s news release dated November 20, 2017) with the intent to develop and operate a mine on the claims. In addition, Prophecy has either staked or acquired an additional 24 square kilometers surrounding the leased mining claims in the past 9 months for its proposed processing facility and potential future resource expansion.\nDetails of the Amendment:\nWith the amendment, Prophecy shall have the option to, at any time during the term of the MLA, require the Lessor to transfer title over all of the leased, unpatented lode mining claims (excluding four claims which will be retained by the Lessor for sentimental reasons and which contain minimal resource) (the “ Transferred Claims ”) to Prophecy in exchange for US$1,000,000, to be paid as an advance royalty payment (the “ Transfer Payment ”). A credit of US$99,027.22 in favour of Prophecy towards the Transfer Payment is already paid upon signing of the amendment, with the remaining US$900,972.78 portion of the Transfer Payment due and payable by Prophecy to the Lessor upon completion of transfer of the Transferred Claims from the Lessor to Prophecy. The advance royalty obligation and production royalty shall not be affected, reduced or relieved by the transfer of title.\nJohn Lee, Prophecy’s Executive Chairman, states: “With the rights to the title transfer secured, Prophecy can now engage in in-depth discussions with cornerstone investors, vanadium product off-takers and banks on equity, debt and prepaid off-take financing. Talks are already underway and we expect to report material progress in due course.”\nVisit www.prophecydev.com for the latest Gibellini claim map.\nAbout Prophecy\nProphecy Development Corp. is a Canadian public company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
