The funds will be spent on teacher training, research and developing regional technology hubs to explore how AI can be used in industries such as law and insurance.\nA Center for Data Ethics and Innovation, look at ensuring the safe development of data driven technologies and ways to protect consumers, will also be set up.\nReporting by William James\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-26T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T02:22:43.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
