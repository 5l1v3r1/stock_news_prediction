Groups are often involved in multiple types of smuggling, making huge profits from illicit sales of fuel and the transfer of migrants towards Europe. \nBetween 30 and 40 percent of fuel refined in Libya or imported into the country is stolen or smuggled, according to the NOC. Libyan vessels smuggle mainly diesel to international ships offshore, while gasoline is diverted to roadside sellers or smugglers who operate across Libya’s land borders. \nThe practice costs the Libyan state one billion Libyan dinars per year, or $750 million at the official exchange rate, the NOC estimates. \nAction taken so far — including Italian prosecution and U.S. sanctions against smuggling networks and a ditch and berm built by Tunisia on its border with Libya — had “not been enough to create a major disincentive for the fuel smugglers”, Sanalla said. \nThough local officials say they are trying to crack down on fuel smuggling, fuel is still allocated to inoperational or “ghost” petrol stations. Prices are among the lowest in the world, though rampant smuggling means petrol shortages are common and Libyans often pay a higher, black market price. \n“Fuel smugglers are well-armed, and well-resourced. And every day their grip on regions of Libya – and also on neighbouring countries who receive smuggled and stolen Libyan fuel – becomes stronger and more institutionalised,” Sanalla said. \nHe called for the mandate of the EU’s naval mission, Operation Sophia, to be extended to combat the smuggling of refined fuel as well as oil, saying that much of the illegal activity could be traced by radar or satellite and was concentrated at Hurd’s Bank anchorage just outside Maltese territorial waters.
