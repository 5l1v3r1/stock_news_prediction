Bush’s second inaugural address. But there is a key difference. President Bush spoke as an unabashed universalist. He argued that dignity is the God-given claim of every individual, as is self-government for every people. “Eventually, the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul,” Mr. Bush declared.\nBy contrast, Mr. Macron defended not universal values but rather the European project, grounded in Europe’s “identity,” which includes belief in “the democracy Tocqueville spoke about,” liberal democracy, which “respects the individual, minorities, [and] fundamental rights.” Europe’s identity extends even further: “It is a culture found nowhere else in the world, which combines this passion for freedom, the taste for equality, and an attachment to diverse ideas, languages and landscapes.”\nThe implication of President Macron’s argument is that while European liberal democracy is an international project, it is not a universal project, because other cultures do not embrace the principles of the project—certainly not in full and not with the same intensity. (Not even the U.S., the French president delicately suggested, perhaps because Americans’ passion for freedom is not matched by a taste for equality—at least not as Europeans understand equality.)\nSo oddly, while the French president disagrees with the populist nationalists’ interpretation of European culture, he agrees with them that the foundation of the European project is to be found in culture rather than in universal reason, as the philosophers of the French Revolution believed.\nBe this as it may, Mr. Macron understands full well that the European project is threatened by the renewal of narrow nationalism and by a surge of illiberal, authoritarian populism. And he offered a remarkable diagnosis of these forces: “It is not the people who have abandoned the European idea, it is la trahison des clercs that threatens it.”\nSome readers will recognize this allusion to a famous book published by the French essayist Julien Benda in 1927, as the forces opposed to liberal democracy in Europe began to gather strength. The treasonous “clercs” were intellectuals who had abandoned their disinterested search for general truth in favor of glorifying national particularism. This betrayal had broad political consequences, Benda argued, because intellectuals are the “educators of the human mind.” By legitimating ethno-national passions, intellectuals created and unleashed them.\nAlthough Benda’s critique of intellectuals’ irresponsibility is powerful, his trickle-down account of ethno-nationalism is naive and oddly optimistic. If popular passions aren’t rooted in enduring features of particular cultures or of human nature—if they are merely the product of bad ideas—then they can be purged by better ideas. Benda couldn’t countenance the possibility that leaders may manipulate antiliberal sentiments without creating them, and neither, it seems, can Emmanuel Macron. If an increasing number of ordinary European citizens are themselves questioning the European project, then the task of rescuing this project becomes more difficult.\nAl Smith, the Democratic Party’s 1928 presidential candidate, once declared that the ills of democracy can be cured only by more democracy. In the same vein, President Macron believes that the only cure for Europe’s ills is more Europe. Although we must “listen to the anger of the European people,” Mr. Macron acknowledges, they don’t really want a return to destructive nationalism, whatever they may say. Instead, they need a “new project.” This is why Mr. Macron propounds an expansive conception of “European sovereignty,” which deals with refugees, the common defense, economic and trade issues, climate and energy, health and food, digital regulation, and social programs, among other matters. “In no way should we scale back the ambition of current policies,” he insists, but we must “promote new ambitions.” L’audace, l’audace, toujours l’audace.\nWe will find out whether the people of Europe will democratically endorse the French president’s audacity. Whatever his political fortunes, one must be moved by Mr. Macron’s passionate sense of responsibility. “I belong to a generation which has never experienced war [and] is allowing itself the luxury of forgetting what its forbears lived through,” he said. But “I don’t want to belong to a generation of sleepwalkers [that] refuses to face up to the problems of its own present.”\nMr. Macron is instead part of a generation that has decided to defend Europe’s democracy and sovereignty, which will enable future generations to “choose their own futures.” Americans who cherish their own democracy must wish him well.\nAppeared in the April 25, 2018, print edition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T07:47:26.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
