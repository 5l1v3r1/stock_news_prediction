He is president of Warburg Pincus. Photo: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images A decade after the financial crisis , The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and former Attorney General Eric Holder .\nSince helping steer the U.S. through the global financial crisis, former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has been cashing in.\nHe signed a book deal and hit the six-figure-speech lecture circuit. He so impressed one audience, at Warburg Pincus LLC’s annual meeting, that the Manhattan investment firm hired him as its president .\nIn March 2014, he started at the firm known for staking oil explorers and multibillion-dollar buyouts of retailer Neiman Marcus and eye-health company Bausch & Lomb. He wasn’t the first former Treasury secretary to go from Washington to Wall Street . Unlike predecessors, however, his arrival wasn’t a homecoming. He had never worked for a financial firm or a bank.\nPresident Barack Obama greeted Mr. Geithner following the State of the Union address in 2012. Photo: Saul Loeb/Pool/Getty Images Mr. Geithner was a civil servant who had climbed the technocratic career ladder one financial crisis after another—Mexico, Asia, Russia—until he became head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in 2003. He was still there four years later when financial markets began to implode and he was tapped, in the middle of the maelstrom, by President-elect Barack Obama to see through the financial system’s rescue as Treasury secretary.\nRelated Attorney General During Financial Crisis Is Now a Confidant to Corporations Neel Kashkari: Fed Official Who Bailed Out Big Banks Is Now One of Their Biggest Critics James Cayne: Ex-Bear CEO Now Plays Bridge, Not Markets Kyle Bass: Won Big Betting on Housing Collapse, Now Falters With China Bets Alan Schwartz: Last Bear Head Takes on Wall Street Nobody Thinks the Bailout Would Happen Again A Decade Later, Seeds of Instability Are Germinating His confirmation hearing revealed him to be very different from the banking titans who typically held the post, never mind his boyish looks: He was well-off enough to afford household help, yet used TurboTax to prepare his returns.\nWhen he joined Warburg, New York state records show, he had to borrow the cash that the firm requires its executives to invest in its private-equity funds. So-called skin-in-the-game can amount to millions of dollars up front but can return staggering wealth over time.\nMr. Geithner, 56 years old, declined to comment, and a Warburg spokeswoman said the firm doesn’t discuss the particulars of his days. Generally, she said, Mr. Geithner strategizes with the firm’s co-chief executives, meets with investors and, sometimes, gets involved with particular investments, usually in Asia or involving financial firms. A Warburg spokesman said he also lectures at the Yale School of Management.\n‘We did save the economy, but we lost the country doing it,’ Mr. Geithner wrote in his memoir. Photo: Haruyoshi Yamaguchi/Bloomberg News Mr. Geithner refers to himself as a “backstage guy” in his 580-page memoir, “Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises.” He found the spotlight glaring and felt he sometimes struggled to articulate his rescue plan.\n“I’d somehow managed to convince the public we’d be overly generous to Wall Street while convincing the markets we wouldn’t be generous enough,” he wrote of his first speech as Treasury secretary.\nSome—by no means all—of the anger over bank bailouts could have been soothed had he better explained his unpopular but necessary decisions, Quote: : “We did save the economy, but we lost the country doing it.”\nAugust 2007 marked the beginning of worst financial crisis since the great depression. A decade later, WSJ's finance and banking editors break down the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis.
