I’m really looking forward to becoming an Osprey.”\nNorth left Welsh side Scarlets in 2013 to sign for Northampton, and all four regions in Wales were vying for his signature after he announced his intention to return.\n“George returning home to Wales is a major positive for Welsh Rugby and for the Ospreys,” WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips said. “I know he is really looking forward to next season and making a positive impact on Welsh rugby.” Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T17:28:18.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
