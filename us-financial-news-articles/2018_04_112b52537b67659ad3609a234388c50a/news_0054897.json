But market research firm Euromonitor found that Amazon last year outstripped MercadoLibre in business-to-consumer sales by $13 million.\nAmazon has invested heavily in Mexico since its official 2015 launch in the country.\nOn Thursday, Mexican retailer and bottler Fomento Economico Mexicano said it will expand a pilot program that uses its ubiquitous Oxxo convenience stores as Amazon package pick-up points.
