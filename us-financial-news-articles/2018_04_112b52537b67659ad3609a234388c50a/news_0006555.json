The Justice Department said that on Monday the FBI is producing 3,600 pages of additional material requested by the House Judiciary Committee.\nThe Inspector General’s initial request for information resulted in production of over a million pages of material, the majority of which was not relevant to the FBI’s investigation, the Justice Department said.\nThese documents include grand jury material, classified information, and information about unrelated and ongoing investigations that must be redacted before it can be disclosed to Congress “and to avoid the appearance of political influence in criminal prosecutions,” the Justice Department said.\nOn Saturday, President Donald Trump tweeted about the delay in producing documents. “What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide? Why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE? Stalling, but for what reason? Not looking good,” he wrote.\nIn October, Republican lawmakers launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Clinton’s emails.\nClinton was Trump’s Democratic rival in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and faced questions about her handling of classified material after it became public that she used a private email server in her home for some of her correspondence.\nAfter first clearing Clinton in the email probe, then FBI director James Comey announced 11 days before the election that the FBI had begun investigating a newly discovered batch of Clinton emails. Clinton has said Comey’s letter to Congress on the issue tilted the race to Trump.\nReporting by David Shepardson and Sarah Lynch\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T05:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T06:00:05.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
