The court decision on Thursday will keep him from becoming president for the same reason. Catalonia’s struggle to find a leader began after it declared independence in October. Spanish courts ruled the declaration was illegal, took direct control of the region and called for new elections.\nHowever, a loose alliance of pro-independence groups won the first vote, in December. Since then, Catalonia has tried four more times to choose a president, including the latest attempt to name Sanchez.\nOn Tuesday, Sanchez had asked the court’s permission to leave prison to attend Friday’s parliamentary session in Barcelona. In a 54-page ruling, Spanish judge Pablo Llarena denied his request, saying there was a risk of a repeat offence.\nCatalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent said on Thursday that Sanchez - the former head of pro-independence civic group Catalan National Assembly - was the rightful candidate.\n“We are working on different fronts ... and believe that the international community, such as the United Nations and the European Union, have to stand up for the defence of democratic values,” Torrent said to private radio station Cadena SER.\nCatalan lawmakers have also unsuccessfully put forward former leader Carles Puigdemont and his ally Jordi Turull as potential regional chief, as well as Sanchez.\nIf a new leader is not named before the end of May, Catalonia will be forced to call another election.\nIn letters last month to Spanish authorities and Sanchez’s lawyers, a United Nations rights group requested the state take all steps to ensure he be allowed to exercise his right to stand for office, while noting it had reached no decision “on the substance of the matter under consideration”.
