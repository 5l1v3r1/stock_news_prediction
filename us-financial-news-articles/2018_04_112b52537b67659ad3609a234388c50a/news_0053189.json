This compares with fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $548 million. Fourth-quarter 2017 earnings included a $2.7 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform.\n“We had a strong start to the year,\" said Greg Garland, chairman and CEO of Phillips 66. \"We delivered solid earnings, operated well, advanced strategic initiatives, and continued rewarding our shareholders with significant distributions. Our earnings reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio, and we are also seeing positive, ongoing impacts from U.S. tax reform. CPChem has fully recovered from Hurricane Harvey and contributed strong results in the quarter, while successfully starting up its new world-scale ethane cracker. We recently completed yield-enhancing projects at the Bayway and Wood River refineries, and successfully executed major turnarounds at multiple refineries.”\n“Building on our strong record of rewarding our shareholders, we distributed $3.8 billion through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter,\" Garland continued. \"We repurchased over 37 million of our shares, representing a 7 percent reduction in shares outstanding during the quarter. Since our company’s formation in 2012, we have returned over $20 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges.”\nMidstream\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Transportation $ 136 105 136 108 NGL and Other 73 20 73 20 DCP Midstream 24 14 24 14 Midstream $ 233 139 233 142 Midstream first-quarter net income was $233 million, compared with $139 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

The increase reflects lower taxes and operating costs, partially offset by lower volumes, primarily from the impact of refinery turnarounds.\nNGL and Other first-quarter adjusted net income was $73 million, compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First-quarter adjusted net income reflects improved realized margins and positive inventory impacts.\nThe company’s equity investment in DCP Midstream generated adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter, compared with $14 million in the prior quarter.

Excluding working capital impacts, operating cash flow was $1.3 billion.

The Gray Oak Pipeline will provide crude oil transportation from West Texas to destinations in the Corpus Christi and Sweeny/Freeport markets, including the Phillips 66 Sweeny Refinery. A second binding open season is underway to determine the final scope and capacity of the pipeline system, which could be up to 700,000 BPD. Assuming the pipeline is fully subscribed, its capacity could ultimately be expanded to approximately 1 million BPD of long-haul takeaway. Phillips 66 Partners will initially own a 75 percent interest in the pipeline system. Other third parties have an option to acquire up to 32.75 percent interest in the joint venture. If all options are exercised, Phillips 66 Partners would own 42.25 percent. The pipeline is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2019.\nThe Bayou Bridge Pipeline, in which Phillips 66 Partners holds a 40 percent interest, currently operates from the Phillips 66 Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Construction continues on the segment from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, and commercial operations are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPhillips 66 Partners began construction of a new 25,000 BPD isomerization unit at the Lake Charles Refinery. The unit will increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components, with completion anticipated by the end of 2019.\nPhillips 66 is constructing 3.5 million barrels of additional crude oil storage at the Beaumont Terminal that will bring the terminal's total crude and products storage capacity to 14.6 million barrels. The new capacity is anticipated to be online by the end of 2018.\nDCP Midstream’s Sand Hills NGL Pipeline capacity was close to 400,000 BPD at the end of the first quarter. Further expansion of the line to above 450,000 BPD is expected in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills is owned two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners.\nDCP continues construction of two additional gas processing plants in the high-growth DJ basin, each with a design capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The Mewbourn 3 plant is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, and the O’Connor 2 plant is scheduled for completion in mid-2019.\nDCP is participating in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline project, which will provide an outlet for natural gas production in the Permian Basin to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast and has a total design capacity of approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day. DCP holds a 25 percent equity interest in the project, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn Chemicals, CPChem has completed its world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) Petrochemicals Project. The new ethane cracker at Cedar Bayou commenced operations in the first quarter, and reached full design rates in April. Along with the two polyethylene units that started up in the third quarter of 2017, the USGC project increased CPChem’s global ethylene and polyethylene capacity by approximately one-third.\nIn Refining, the company is progressing yield-enhancing projects that are expected to deliver a combined 25,000 BPD of additional clean products by the end of this year. This includes the modernization of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units at both the Bayway and Wood River refineries that were recently completed. At the Lake Charles Refinery, crude unit modifications to run more domestic crudes and reduce feedstock costs were completed, with additional improvements anticipated in the fourth quarter.\nFour Phillips 66 refineries were recognized by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) for exemplary safety performance in 2017. The Bayway Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual safety award the industry recognizes, and the Sweeny Refinery received the second-highest recognition, the Elite Gold Award. The Alliance and Wood River refineries were both selected as recipients of the Elite Silver Award, which recognizes the top five percent of all sites for safety performance.\nInvestor Webcast\nLater today, members of Phillips 66 executive management will host a webcast at noon EDT to discuss the company’s first-quarter performance and provide an update on strategic initiatives.
