Four people were wounded, he said.\nThe Taliban, seeking to restore strict Islamic rule after their 2001 defeat by U.S.-led troops, did not immediately comment.\nThe attack happened just days after a blast in Shindand killed at least six people, including four children.\nEarlier on Thursday, Taliban militants stormed a district in Ghazni province, killing more than a dozen people including the district’s governor before retreating.\nFighting in Afghanistan traditionally increases in the spring when warmer weather melts snow blocking mountain passes, increasing the mobility of the insurgents.\nReporting by Jalil Rezaee in Herat, Afghanistan; Writing by Rod Nickel in Kabul; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T10:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T10:50:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
