REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure \nThe move, likely to deepen the country’s biggest political crisis in a decade, follows days of street protests against Serzh Sarksyan, the newly-appointed prime minister whom protesters accuse of clinging to power. \nBefore being appointed prime minister, Sarksyan, 63, did a 10-year stint as president. Under a constitutional change, most state powers are now invested in his new role.

REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure \nTens of thousands of protesters have marched through the capital Yerevan in recent days, blocking streets and staging sit-ins. They are demanding that Sarksyan resign to pave the way for early elections, something he has so far refused to do. \nOn Sunday, police detained three opposition leaders and nearly 200 protesters, drawing a rebuke from the European Union. \nOn Monday, men wearing military uniforms could be seen marching in Yerevan with protesters. Images broadcast on the Internet and social media showed the soldiers hugging protesters and waving the country’s national flag. \nThe Armenian Defence Ministry condemned what it said was their illegal action, saying the men belonged to a brigade of military peacekeepers. \n“The harshest legal measures will be taken against the soldiers,” it said in a statement.
