REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo The United States imposed major sanctions on Friday against 24 Russians, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.”\nEn+ said it intended to continue to fulfill its existing commitments whilst seeking solutions to address the impact of the U.S. sanctions.
