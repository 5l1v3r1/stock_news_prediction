When you look at some of the boys divisions, some of them have 24 to 26 boxers there,” Evans told local media. \n“We’ve got a guaranteed bronze but I’m tipping that colour might change.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T10:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T11:11:59.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
