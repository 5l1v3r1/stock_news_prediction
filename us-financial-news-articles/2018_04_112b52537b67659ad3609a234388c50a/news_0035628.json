The commander said preparatory shelling of the jihadist enclave had started on Tuesday morning. \nThe government is also set to recover another rebel enclave south of Damascus around the town of Beit Sahm, the commander said, though this would happen through an agreement with the government by which fighters would leave for Idlib. \n“The lists of militants who will go on the buses toward Idlib are being gathered,” the commander said. \nIdlib is a rebel-held territory at the border with Turkey.
