The appraisal was performed by JFR Consulting.\nCMMI is a capability improvement framework that provides organizations with the essential elements of effective processes that ultimately improve their performance. An appraisal at maturity level 3 indicates the organization is performing at a “defined” level. At this level, processes are well characterized and understood, and are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods. The organization’s set of standard processes, which is the basis for maturity level 3, is established and improved over time.\nLinQuest Corporation’s MASIES Acquisition Program was used for the assessment of process artifacts and affirmations. Capability Level 3 was achieved in Measurement and Analysis, Process and Product Quality Assurance, Configuration Management, Risk Management, Requirements Management, Acquisition Requirements Development, Acquisition Validation, Acquisition Verification, and Acquisition Technical Management of the CMMI Institute’s Capability Maturity Model Integration v 1.3 (CMMISM). The assessment is based on results from a standard CMMISM Appraisal method for Process Improvement v1.3 (SCAMPISM).\nMr. Chris Beres, the SSEI General Manager, stated, “Being appraised at CMMI-ACQ Level 3 substantiates the maturity and effectiveness of our Space Systems Engineering and Integration processes. Specifically, the CMMI-ACQ model focuses on applying best practices in the acquisition environment—the environment in which we serve our customers.
