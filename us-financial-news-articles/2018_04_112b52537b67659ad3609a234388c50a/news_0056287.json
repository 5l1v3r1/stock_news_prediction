Mountbatten was killed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who detonated a bomb on his boat in 1979.

REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/Files\nThe birth of the new prince has provided a welcome distraction for many in Britain where Brexit and political turmoil has dominated the headlines since the 2016 shock vote to leave the European Union.\nLouis joins siblings Charlotte, 2, and George, 4, in the growing royal family, and the queen, Philip, Charles, and his wife, Camilla have all expressed delighted with the birth of the monarch’s sixth great-grandchild.\n“It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them,” Charles said.\nThe name was a surprise, with the bookies’ favourites having been Albert, Arthur, Alexander, James and Philip. The betting odds indicated just a 5 percent chance of Louis.
