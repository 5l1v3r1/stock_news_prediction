REUTERS/Cris Toala Olivares \nThe 34-year-old forward scored a stunning second goal with a chip over the goalkeeper from an acute angle for the club he rejoined in January after spells at Arsenal, Manchester United and Fenerbahce. \nIt was Van Persie’s first major trophy in Dutch football, who has since said he is not sure he wants to continue. \n“I’m going to think about it over the next weeks and sit down with Feyenoord to discuss. Sometimes I feel I’d like to go on for five, six more years,” he told Dutch television. \n“But then there is the other side, where I find it hard to prepare for a game. It has to do with my age and with my body. \n“I’ve tried to keep up a maximum intensity and I’ve been happy with the way things have gone in the last five months since I joined Feyenoord,” he added. \n“Maybe the solution for me is not to play full matches anymore.” \nReacting to the interview, Feyenoord coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst said the club would seek to have Van Persie back for next season. \n“He is of enormous value to us and we want him to stay,” Van Bronckhorst said.
