Colleagues of Palestinian journalist Yasser Murtaja, 31, who died of his wounds during clashes at the Israel-Gaza border on Friday, mourn during his funeral in Gaza city April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Suhaib Salem \nYaser Murtaja, 30, a cameraman for Palestinian Ain Media, was the 29th Palestinian killed in the week-long protests. \nPhotos showed Murtaja lying wounded on a stretcher wearing a navy-blue protective vest marked ‘PRESS’ in large black capital letters. Health officials said a live bullet had penetrated the side of his abdomen and he succumbed to his wounds in hospital. \nA statement from the Israeli military said: “The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) does not intentionally target journalists. The circumstances in which journalists were allegedly hit by IDF fire are not familiar to the IDF and are being looked into.” \nThe daily protests, dubbed “The Great March of Return”, began on March 30 along the Israel-Gaza frontier, reviving a longstanding demand for the right of return of Palestinian refugees to towns and villages from which their families fled, or were driven out, when the state of Israel was created. \nEight Palestinians were wounded there on Saturday, Gaza health officials said, and an Israeli military spokeswoman said she was checking the report. \nIsrael has stationed sharpshooters to stop attempts by Palestinians to breach the border or sabotage the security fence. \nFreelance photographer Ashraf Abu Amra told Reuters he was next to Murtaja, whom he said was wearing a helmet and protective vest. Abu Amra said they were both clearly marked as journalists. \n“We were filming as youths torched tyres. We were about 250 meters from the fence,” said Abu Amra. “Israeli forces opened fire and injuries began. Yaser and I ran to film when suddenly Yaser fell to the ground. \n“I screamed to him ‘Yaser are you alright?’. He didn’t respond and there was blood on the ground underneath him. I knew it was a bad injury and people carried him away,” said Abu Amra. \nVideo footage showed Murtaja being carried to an ambulance with crowds around and black smoke rising from where protesters had set tyres alight, east of Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip. FUNERAL \nReporters Without Borders (RSF) Secretary-General Christophe Deloire condemned what the group described as Israel’s disproportionate response and called for an independent investigation into the incident. \nThe Foreign Press Association echoed the call and urged the military to show restraint. \nMurtaja was married with a two-year-old son. Hundreds of mourners, among them many journalists, attended his funeral on Saturday. \nHis body was covered with a Palestinian flag and his press jacket laid beside him on the stretcher as it was carried through the streets of Gaza City to his home for a last farewell.

It was unclear if he had taken them himself. \nAt least three other journalists were wounded on Friday in other locations, Gaza officials said. There have been no Israeli casualties in the protests. \nIsrael’s response to the protests has drawn international criticism, with human rights groups saying it involved live fire against demonstrators posing no immediate threat to life. \nThe European Union in a statement said the killings raised serious questions about the use of force. It added reports by Israel of stones and fire-bombs being thrown along with attempts to cross the fence into Israel “must also be clarified.” \nIsrael says it has been warning Gazans for weeks not to approach the border fence. \n“The IDF uses means such as warnings, riot dispersal means, and as a last resort firing live rounds in a precise, measured way. The IDF is committed to preventing infiltration into Israeli territory and threats against IDF troops and Israeli civilians,” the military’s statement said. \nHamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza, says the protests demanding the right of return of refugees will continue. \nThe Israeli government has ruled out any right of return, fearing the country would lose its Jewish majority. \nIsrael says many of the dead were militants and that Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the West, is using the protests as cover to launch attacks along the border and ignite the area, while putting Gaza’s civilians at risk. \nHamas rejects this.
