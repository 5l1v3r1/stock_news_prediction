Given that we are ending a period of exceptionally negative stock-bond correlations and face the very real possibility of an extended period of rising inflation, what should a 60/40 portfolio owner consider? \nA few thoughts: \nThe five years after the prior trough for stock/bond correlations (back in 1964, at -0.64) saw 10-year Treasurys deliver just a 0.06 percent compounded average total return between 1965 and 1969. Moreover, CPI inflation went from 1 percent in 1964 to 6.2 percent in 1969, so bond investors saw negative real returns over this period. \nEquity returns over the 1965–69 period were choppy and substandard. The compounded annual total return for the S&P 500 over the period was just 5.0 percent. By comparison, the 60/40 portfolio showed a compounded annual return of 3.2 percent from 1965–69. This lagged inflation, which showed compounded growth of 3.9 percent over the same period.

Equities may not excel when inflation rises, but they certainly do better than bonds. \nLong periods of rising inflation recouple stock and bond correlations, and this continues over the crest for the peak of higher prices and into the next down cycle. Ten-year price-return correlations peaked in 1994-95, at 0.74, reflecting a long journey through high inflation (early 1980s) through monetary discipline (mid- to late-1980s) and eventually lower long-term inflation expectations (1990s).
