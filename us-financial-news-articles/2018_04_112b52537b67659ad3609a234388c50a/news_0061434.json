One other represents Bezeq’s workers, Bezeq said.\nTypically in Israel, the controlling shareholder controls the board.\nThe new board will convene on Monday and is widely expected to name Shlomo Rodav as chairman. Rodav served as chairman of Bezeq from 2007 to 2010.\nInterest in Bezeq’s annual meeting has been building since January when activist investor Elliott said it had taken a 4.8 percent stake to push for changes in the wake of a securities investigation into the company’s management and owners.\nElliott’s calls have received backing from several other minority shareholders, mainly Israeli institutions.\n“It was important to convey a clear message that every company officer and director ... who was present at the time of an interested party transaction that harms the public will encounter institutional investors who will do everything in their power to remove him from the company,” said Meitav Dash Investments, which owns 1.3 percent of Bezeq.\nBezeq CEO Stella Handler was arrested in February in connection with a wider investigation into alleged fraud, bribery and securities offences. She has denied any wrongdoing and plans to step down in July.\nControlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was also arrested along with a number of other officials connected with Bezeq. They all deny any wrongdoing.\nElovitch controls Bezeq through B Communications, a unit of his indebted Eurocom group.\nMost directors implicated in the investigation have resigned, clearing the way for the board to be overhauled. The terms of two directors implicated will end at the end of the year.\nShares in Bezeq, once a strong state-run monopoly but whose various units now face stiff competition, were up 2 percent in morning trade on Sunday. They are down 10 percent this year and fell by 29 percent in 2017.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:17:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
