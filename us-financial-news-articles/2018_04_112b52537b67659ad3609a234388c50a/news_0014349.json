I don’t see what happens behind and unfortunately he got hurt,” said Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion. “My job is to go when the light says so. Hopefully, he’s OK.”\nFerrari chairman Sergio Marchionne wished the mechanic a speedy recovery in his post-race statement.\n“I am sorry for Kimi who could certainly have finished on the podium,” he added.
