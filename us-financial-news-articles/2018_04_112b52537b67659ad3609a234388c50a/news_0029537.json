The incoming Board Members are:\nCourtney Hagen, Senior Vice President of Human Resources, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton Inc.\nCourtney Hagen creates and executes strategic HR programs to support the talent needs of LVMH and its portfolio of brands, across internal and external talent sourcing, assessment and talent acquisition, executive recruiting, succession planning, strategic organization development programs, and diversity and inclusion initiatives. Prior to joining LVMH, Courtney led global executive talent acquisition for PepsiCo. Courtney joined PepsiCo after a career in executive search and management consulting with Russell Reynolds Associates, where she led searches for marketing, sales and HR executives. Earlier in her accomplished career, Courtney led business development and marketing strategy for co-branded card partnerships at American Express. She started her career with management consulting firm Bridge Strategy Group/Renaissance Worldwide, where she led strategy consulting engagements for Fortune 1000 companies in the US, Europe and South Africa. Courtney holds a B.A. from Wellesley College and an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School.\nBrendan Dickinson, Partner, Canaan\nBrendan Dickinson invests in disruptive technology startups and marketplace businesses that are changing the world and innovating the fintech, e-commerce and digital media sectors. He most recently built Canaan’s investment thesis in insurance, and is passionate about investing in emerging companies that re-imagine how legacy industries can be vastly improved and re-invented. Previously, Brendan was a senior quantitative analyst at Lehman Brothers and Barclays Capital. He holds an M.B.A. with distinction from NYU Stern School of Business, a M.S. in Computer Science from Brown University, and a B.A. Political Science from Bowdoin College. Brendan will be replacing Warren Lee on ExecThread’s Board of Directors.\n“We are very fortunate to have Courtney Hagen and Brendan Dickinson join our Board of Directors,” said Joe Meyer, Founder & CEO of ExecThread . “Courtney’s expertise in the executive search industry will be extremely beneficial to ExecThread, and will help mold and influence our future commercial service offerings to executive-level candidates and hiring companies; and having Brendan’s input from an investment and technical perspective will help us grow our unique give-to-get model that provides current and future business leaders with far greater access to hidden career opportunities than traditional executive recruiting methods.”\n\"From my experience with executive recruiting both in an executive search firm and in-house, I see ExecThread's crowdsourced and community-driven platform as a game changer in enabling talent acquisition professionals and hiring managers to find candidates they might not otherwise know about, and opening the 'hidden job market' to a broader set of executives,” said Hagen. “ExecThread can deliver better talent to a hiring company, and it also helps to diversify the talent pool available to employers.”\n“ExecThread’s novel and disruptive approach to executive recruiting is certainly breaking all the molds in the recruiting space,” said Dickinson. “As a venture investor I see a clear opportunity to innovate a large legacy industry like executive recruiting with a data-oriented and platform-driven approach that caters to candidates, and I am thrilled to be part of ExecThread’s Board.”\nAbout ExecThread, Inc.\nFounded in 2015 by Joe Meyer (former CEO of HopStop [acquired by Apple] and former executive at AOL and GM at eBay), and headquartered in New York City, ExecThread, Inc. is a venture capital backed start-up and premium network of highly qualified and carefully vetted executives and aspiring executives who discreetly share career opportunities with each other.
