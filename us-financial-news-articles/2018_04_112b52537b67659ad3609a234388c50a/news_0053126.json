(the “Company\" or \"Besi\") (Euronext Amsterdam:BESI) (OTC markets:BESIY) (Nasdaq International Designation), a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nKey Highlights\nRevenue of € 154.9 million, up 1.1% vs. Q4-17 and within guidance. Up 40.5% vs. Q1-17 due to growth across product portfolio, favorable industry conditions and continued market share gains Orders of € 205.8 million, up 37.8% vs. Q4-17 due primarily to capacity additions for smart phone applications. Bookings down 14.2% vs. exceptionally high levels in Q1-17 Gross margin of 56.5% up 0.2 points vs. Q4-17 and 0.8 points vs. Q1-17 despite adverse forex influences from decline of USD vs. euro. Within guidance Net income of € 37.1 million, down € 6.5 million vs. Q4-17 primarily due to higher share based compensation expense and a 5.7 point higher effective tax rate as such expenses are not tax deductible. Up € 12.8 million (+52.7%) vs. Q1-17 Net cash and deposits reach € 290.1 million, an increase of € 114.4 million (+65.1%) year over year as cash generation remains strong\nOutlook\nQ2-18 revenue expected to grow by 10-15% vs. Q1-18. H1-18 revenue anticipated to increase approximately 17% vs. H1-17 at the midpoint of guidance\n(€ millions, except EPS) Q1-2018 Q4-2017 Δ Q1-2017 Δ Revenue 154.9 153.2 +1.1 % 110.2 +40.5 % Orders 205.8 149.4 +37.8 % 239.8 -14.2 % Operating Income 48.6 52.1 -6.7 % 30.8 +57.8 % EBITDA 52.0 55.5 -6.3 % 34.2 +52.0 % Net Income 37.1 43.6 -14.9 % 24.3 +52.7 % EPS (basic) 1.00 1.17 -14.5 % 0.65 +53.8 % EPS (diluted) 0.91 1.09 -16.5 % 0.60 +51.7 % Net Cash 290.1 247.6 +17.2 % 175.7 +65.1 % Richard W. Blickman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi, commented:\n“Besi’s Q1-18 results were positively influenced by a continuation of many favorable trends from 2017. Our financial performance benefited from an extended industry upturn, ongoing customer investment in advanced packaging applications and Besi’s favorable market position with key customers and supply chains. As such, revenue and net income increased by 40.5% and 52.7%, respectively, vs. Q1-17. In addition, gross and net margins showed further steady improvement vs. last year due to increased production efficiencies and the strategic execution of cost reduction initiatives despite adverse forex influences from the significant decline in the US dollar vs. the euro.”\nRevenue growth this quarter was broad based across Besi’s die bonding and packaging portfolio and reflected increased demand by Asian customers for smart phone and high performance computing applications and by North American and European IDMs for automotive and cloud server applications. In addition, Q1-18 orders grew by 37.8% vs. Q4-17 to reach € 205.8 million due primarily to capacity additions for smart phone applications by both IDMs and Asian subcontractors.\nBesi’s cash generation was also strong in Q1-18 with net cash and deposits expanding to € 290.1 million, an increase of € 114.4 million, or 65.1%, compared to the end of Q1-17. We utilized € 6.0 million of excess cash flow this quarter to enhance shareholder value via regular share repurchase activities.\nFor Q2-18, we estimate that Besi’s revenue will grow by 10-15% vs. Q1-18 and that H1-18 revenue will rise by approximately 17% vs. H1-17 at the midpoint of Q2-18 revenue guidance. We also expect significantly higher operating profit both on a sequential quarterly and half year comparative basis given anticipated revenue growth and the efficiency of our business model. Looking forward, leading industry analysts expect continued growth of the assembly equipment market into 2018. However, subsequent to quarter end, VLSI Research downwardly revised its 2018 market growth estimate from 18.1% in January to 12.5% based on announcements by several semiconductor manufacturers indicating a softening of demand trends from 2017.“\nFirst Quarter Results of Operations\nQ1-2018 Q4-2017 Δ Q1-2017 Δ Revenue 154.9 153.2 +1.1 % 110.2 +40.5 % Orders 205.8 149.4 +37.8 % 239.8 -14.2 % Backlog 215.2 164.4 +30.9 % 205.9 +4.5 % Book to Bill Ratio 1.3x 1.0x +0.3 2.2x -0.9 Besi’s Q1-18 revenue increased by 1.1% vs. Q4-17 and was within guidance (-5% to +5%). Revenue increased by 40.5% on a year over year basis reflecting broad based demand across Besi’s die bonding and packaging portfolio, a continuation of favorable market conditions and market share gains. In addition, it reflected increased demand by Asian customers for smart phone and high performance computing applications and automotive and cloud server applications by North American and European IDMs.\nOrders of € 205.8 million increased by 37.8% vs. Q4-17 due primarily to capacity additions by both IDMs and Asian subcontractors for smart phone applications. Q1-18 orders declined by 14.2% vs. exceptionally high levels in Q1-17. Per customer type, IDM orders increased sequentially by € 36.4 million, or 48.7%, vs. Q4-17 while subcontractor orders increased by € 20.0 million, or 26.8%. IDM and subcontractor orders represented 54% and 46%, respectively, of total Q1-18 bookings vs. 82% and 18%, respectively, of total Q1-17 bookings.\nQ1-2018 Q4-2017 Δ Q1-2017 Δ Gross Margin 56.5 % 56.3% +0.2 55.7% +0.8 Operating Expenses 39.1 34.2 +14.3 % 30.5 +28.2 % Financial Expense, net 4.3 3.3 +30.3 % 2.0 +115 % EBITDA 52.0 55.5 -6.3 % 34.2 +52.0 % Besi’s gross margin in Q1-18 increased by 0.2 points vs. Q4-17 and was within guidance (55-57%). As compared to Q1-17, the 0.8 point gross margin increase was due primarily to production cost efficiencies. In both comparable periods, gross margin was adversely affected by a significant decline in the value of the USD vs. the euro.\nQ1-18 operating expenses increased by € 4.9 million (+14.3%) vs. Q4-17 due to higher share based compensation expense associated with Besi’s 2017 performance. Vs. Q1-17, operating expenses increased by € 8.6 million (+28.2%) primarily due to € 4.6 million of increased share based compensation expense and higher headcount and variable overhead expenses necessary to support increased revenue levels. Total headcount at March 31, 2018 increased by 13.5% (+254 employees) vs. March 31, 2017 principally due to higher fixed and temporary Asian personnel necessary to support Besi’s revenue growth and an expansion of its Asian sales and service operations.\nFinancial expense, net increased by € 1.0 million vs. Q4-17 and € 2.3 million vs. Q1-17 due primarily to higher net interest expense associated with Besi’s issuance of € 175 million of Convertible Notes in December 2017. On a year over year basis, net financial expense also grew due to higher hedging costs related to increased sales volume.\nQ1-2018 Q4-2017 Δ Q1-2017 Δ Net Income 37.1 43.6 -14.9 % 24.3 +52.7 % Net Margin 23.9 % 28.4% -4.5 22.0% +1.9 Tax Rate 16.3 % 10.6% +5.7 15.9% +0.4 Besi’s Q1-18 net income declined by € 6.5 million vs. Q4-17 due to higher share based compensation expense and a higher effective tax rate as such expenses are not tax deductible. Excluding such charges, Besi’s effective tax rate would have been 14.0%, 14.6% and 10.3%, respectively, in Q1-18, Q1-17 and Q4-17. As compared to Q1-17, net income increased by € 12.8 million (+52.7%) and net margins rose 1.9 points to 23.9% as significant revenue and gross margin improvement more than offset higher operating expenses.\nFinancial Condition\nQ1-2018 Q4-2017 Δ Q1-2017 Δ Net Cash 290.1 247.6 +17.2 % 175.7 +65.1 % Cash flow from Ops. 54.9 77.8 -29.4 % 18.6 +195 % Besi’s net cash rose to € 290.1 million at the end of Q1-18, an increase of € 42.5 million, or 17.2%, vs. Q4-17 and € 114.4 million, or 65.1%, vs. Q1-17. The Company generated cash flow from operations of € 54.9 million in Q1-18 which was utilized primarily to fund (i) € 6.0 million of share repurchases, (ii) € 2.6 million of capitalized development spending and (iii) € 1.9 million of capital expenditures.\nDuring the quarter, Besi repurchased 71,738 of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 78.73 per share. Cumulatively as of March 31, 2018, a total of 678,374 shares have been purchased under the current 1.0 million share repurchase authorization at an average price of € 47.78 per share for a total of € 32.4 million.\nOutlook\nBased on its March 31, 2018 backlog and feedback from customers, Besi forecasts for Q2-18 that:\nRevenue will increase by 10%-15% vs. the € 154.9 million reported in Q1-18. Gross margin will range between 55-57% vs. the 56.5% realized in Q1-18. Operating expenses will decrease approximately 5%-10% vs. the € 39.1 million reported in Q1-18.\nInvestor and media conference call\nA conference call and webcast for investors and media will be held today at 4:00 pm CET (10:00 am EST).
