Prosecutors also said that covert surveillance was conducted on several email accounts of his before Monday's raid.\nProsecutors said they were worried that if the FBI did not conduct those raids that evidence related to the case could end up being destroyed without a trace.\nThe United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is handling the case, plans to avoid violating the attorney-client privilege by using a special process to handle materials seize from Cohen.\nThat process calls for a so-called filter team made up of prosecutors not associated with the case would review the materials, determine which ones are protected by privilege, and hand over the remaining materials to the prosecutors in the case. The U.S. Attorney's office has noted that that process has been used in the past in criminal cases against lawyers.\nBut Cohen in a court filing late Thursday night requested a different process, one that prosecutors say would be unprecedented. Cohen wants his own lawyers to review the material, determine what information is privileged, and then turn over the unprivileged evidence to prosecutors.\nFailing that, Cohen is asking that a so-called special master judge be named to review the materials, to avoid privileged documents from being seen by the prosecution.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:35:17.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
