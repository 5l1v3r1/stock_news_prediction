This is moving towards what the regulators would like to see,” said ANZ Senior China Economist Betty Wang. \nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales. \nThat can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector and its inter-linkages with commercial financial institutions, which authorities have also been targeting. \nWithin TSF, there was a sharp jump in bond issuance and drops in entrusted loans, trust loans and bankers’ acceptances in March. \n“The slowdown in broad credit growth that has been underway since mid-2016 showed no signs of abating last month,” Capital Economics Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. \nCapital Economics said its own measure of broad credit growth in China declined from 12.9 percent to 12.1 percent in March, its slowest pace since 2006. \nA pickup in bank loans amid a decline in overall credit growth indicates that more lending is coming from traditional bank loans, which are considered less risky than other forms of credit, an encouraging sign for China’s regulators. \nLending to non-financial corporations increased 16 percent in the first quarter to 3.06 trillion yuan. \nLast week, China’s banking and insurance regulator said the country would crack down firmly on shadow banking, and would seek to push banks to bring off-balance sheet assets onto their balance sheets to give regulators a better idea of their risk exposure. \nOutstanding total social financing increased 10.5 percent year-on-year in March, down from 11.2 percent growth in February. NEW LOANS REBOUND \nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted new yuan loans of 1.2 trillion yuan, rebounding from February’s weaker-than-expected 839.3 billion yuan. \nChina’s banks extended a record 13.53 trillion yuan in new loans last year, 7 percent more than the previous high in 2016. \nAfter banks doled out a record 2.9 trillion yuan in new yuan loans in January, they came under pressure from regulators to rein in lending, financial magazine Caixin reported in February, citing banking sources. \nBeijing is in the second year of a regulatory push to reduce risks to the financial system that have been fueled by a rapid build-up in debt linked to stimulus campaigns. \nWhile escalating U.S.-China trade tensions pose a risk for economic growth, the threat has not reached a point where China is likely to change its monetary policy, the Bank of Communications said in a recent report. \nLong-term household loans, mostly mortgages, rose to 377 billion yuan in March from 322 billion yuan in February, according to PBOC data. \nOverall new household loans totaled 580 billion yuan, 52 percent of total new loans in March, versus 33 percent in February. \nBroad M2 money supply grew 8.2 percent in March from a year earlier, missing forecasts for an expansion of 8.9 percent and compared with 8.8 percent in February. \nPremier Li Keqiang said in his annual work report in March that he expected reasonable growth in broad M2 money supply and total social financing this year, without giving hard targets. \nOutstanding yuan loans grew 12.8 percent from a year earlier, slower than an expected 12.9 percent rise and the same pace as in February. CRACKDOWN CONTINUES \nAnalysts expect a further tightening of the regulatory screws this year for the financial sector and local government debt. \nChina’s central bank published rules on Friday to restrict the issuance of short-term financing notes by brokerages. \nBut authorities are proceeding cautiously and keeping the financial system well supplied with cash to avoid any sharp drag on the world’s second-largest economy or excessive financial market volatility. \nSeparate data on Friday showed solid growth in China’s first quarter imports and exports, though a decline in March exports is likely to keep authorities vigilant for signs of any sustained slowdown. \nChina will release first-quarter GDP on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the economy grew 6.8 percent from a year earlier, the same pace as the fourth quarter. \nIn January, analysts had forecast a slowdown to 6.6 percent, citing a cooling property market and rising borrowing costs which have been a byproduct of the regulatory tightening campaign. $1 = 6.2841 Chinese yuan renminbi Reporting by Elias Glenn and Cheng Fang; additional reporting by Yawen Chen and Lusha Zhang; Editing by Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T12:02:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
