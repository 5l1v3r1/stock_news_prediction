Chairman Peter Voser of Swiss power technology and automation group ABB addresses the company's annual shareholder meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \nA year ago, ABB bought Austrian industrial automation specialist Bernecker & Rainer (BR), which makes programmable controls for machines, to better challenge German rival Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) on the factory floor. \nNow it plans to create around 1,000 new jobs at a new campus at the B&R headquarters in Eggelsberg in the province of Upper Austria, ABB said. \nThe campus is expected to be finished by 2020. \nABB said a year ago it aimed to increase B&R’s annual sales to above $1 billion from around $600 million. \n“We are well on track to achieve this goal,” Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in a statement. \nThe Austrian acquisition helped ABB consolidate its No. 2 position in the $130 billion processing and industrial sector behind Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) but ahead of rivals such as Emerson ( EMR.N ), Rockwell Automation and General Electric ( GE.N ).
