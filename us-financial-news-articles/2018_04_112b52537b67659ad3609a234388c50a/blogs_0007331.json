It was the lowest rating for this point in the crop year since 2002. \n* Markets were pressured by fears of a U.S. trade war with China, a top buyer of agricultural products, after Beijing warned of counter-measures to further tariffs on Chinese goods. \n* A cold and wet weather pattern is expected to persist in the heart of the U.S. corn belt through mid-April, stoking concerns that delayed planting could dent yield prospects. Acreage is already projected to be down from last year. \nMARKET NEWS \n* The dollar rose on Tuesday, led by gains against the yen and Swiss franc, as risk appetite improved and Wall Street's main indexes advanced, helping the U.S. currency stabilize after recent declines. \n* Oil edged up on Tuesday, supported by a recovery in the equities market and on a technical bounce for crude after the biggest daily percentage drop in almost a year, but Brent futures stayed well below $70 a barrel. \n* The three major U.S. stock indexes ended higher after a choppy session on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season while the S&P 500 pushed above a key support level and Amazon.com shares jumped on bets that criticism from President Donald Trump would not translate to policy changes. \nDATA AHEAD (GMT) \n0145 China Caixin services PMI Mar 0900 Euro zone Unemployment rate Feb 1215 U.S. ADP national employment Mar 1400 U.S. Factory orders Feb 1400 U.S. ISM non-manufacturing PMI Mar \nGrains prices at 0104 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 460.75 3.25 +0.71% +3.25% 473.43 54 CBOT corn 388.50 0.00 +0.00% +0.32% 382.25 71 CBOT soy 1040.75 2.75 +0.26% +0.51% 1043.99 58 CBOT rice 12.41 $0.02 +0.16% +0.77% $12.35 59 WTI crude 63.37 -$0.14 -0.22% +0.57% $62.82 47 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.228 $0.001 +0.06% -0.20% USD/AUD 0.7685 0.000 +0.03% +0.30% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
