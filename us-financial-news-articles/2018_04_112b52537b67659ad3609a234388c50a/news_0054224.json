Platinum production for the group as a whole was down 4.5 percent to 316,000 ounces from 331,000 ounces.\nThe rebound is significant and is a rare piece of good news in the South African platinum industry, which has been grappling for years with depressed prices and violent protests and strikes, making most of its shafts loss-making.\nLast year, Implats was considering shutting Marula down after it lost 10,000 ounces out of almost 80,000 ounces of planned output to community protests that included road blocks, vehicle stonings and assaults on people reporting for work.\nA nearby chrome project Implats had set up with a tribal council, made up of a chief and his aides, had collapsed, triggering a wave of protests from local residents who had hoped to benefit from its revenue flows - part of a wider pattern of such deals coming unstuck and fanning turbulence.\nThe project has since been rebooted, dousing the flames of discontent aimed at it.\nThe region in north eastern South Africa was hit by over 400 incidents of social unrest between Jan. 1 2016 and March 31 this year which affected the operations of platinum producers including Implats and rivals such as Anglo American Platinum.\nEditing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:01:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
