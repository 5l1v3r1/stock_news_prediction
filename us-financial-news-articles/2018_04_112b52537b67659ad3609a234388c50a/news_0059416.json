That's almost 10 million barrels above the five-year average.\nU.S. crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA> climbed by 46,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the previous week, to 10.59 bpd. That's an increase of more than a quarter since mid-2016.\nAmerican crude oil output has overtaken that of top exporter Saudi Arabia. Only Russia currently produces more, at around 11 million bpd.\nThe soaring U.S. output has made WTI crude around $6 per barrel cheaper than Brent, the international benchmark for oil prices.\nDutch bank ING said \"the wide discount for WTI to Brent saw exports rising 582,000 bpd week-on-week to a record high of 2.33 million bpd.\"\nWith U.S. output and exports surging, some analysts warn that the 20-percent climb in Brent prices since February is starting to look overdone.\n\"The market does look a little toppish,\" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Joseph Radford and Richard Pullin)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:53:46.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
