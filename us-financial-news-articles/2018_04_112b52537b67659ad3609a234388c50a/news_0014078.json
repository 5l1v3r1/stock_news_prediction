I feel like this is a year to knock off our first.” \nFowler’s next shot at collecting a major will be at June’s U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills in New York. From there it will be the British Open at Carnoustie in July and the Aug. 16-19 PGA Championship at Bellerive in St. Louis. \n“So I’m really looking forward to this year and the three majors that are left,” said Fowler. \n“You know, Shinnecock is one of my favourite golf courses in the U.S. Obviously this place, and I haven’t been to the other two. But should be a very good major season.” (Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T05:59:42.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
