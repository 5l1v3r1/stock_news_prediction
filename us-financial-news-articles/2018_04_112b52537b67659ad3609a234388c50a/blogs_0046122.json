Of the 150 million or so tax returns the IRS has received annually in recent years, just 20 percent claimed the deduction, according to research from the Urban Brookings Tax Policy Center.\nThe anticipated drop is largely due to the near-doubling of the standard deduction that took effect Jan. 1 under the new tax law. Fewer taxpayers are expected to itemize their deductions, which is the only way to take advantage of the tax break for interest paid on mortgages.\nThe new report estimates that 18 million households will itemize deductions this year, down from 46.5 million last year.\nPM Images | Getty Images Taxpayers would need deductions worth more than the standard deduction for itemizing to make financial sense. And with few deductions left for taxpayers to turn to, that threshold will be a harder hurdle to clear.\nFor example, married couples filing jointly now get a standard deduction of $24,000, up from $12,700 last year. That amount for single filers is $12,000, up from $6,350. For heads of households, it's now $18,000, up from $9,350. In combination with raising those amounts, the new tax eliminated personal exemptions.\nshow chapters Rising interest rates may slow down home buyers 3:13 PM ET Fri, 20 April 2018 | 01:19 For homeowners who will still be able to take advantage of the tax break, the interest they can write off is limited to $750,000 in loans, down from the previous $1 million.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHere's why that scholarship might not be free after all\nHere's how to retire abroad â€” without any tax surprises\nHow student loans are stopping millennials from buying houses", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T23:17:39.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
