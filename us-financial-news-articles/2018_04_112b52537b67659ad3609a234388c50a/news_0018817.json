After a one-out walk by Michael Conforto, Cespedes snapped a 6-6 tie with his two-bagger just past Anderson.\nThe Mets (9-1) have won seven games in a row and lead the National League East. They have started the season by taking four straight series, including this one over the last-place Marlins (3-8).\nJeurys Familia pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his sixth save.\nMiami was led by Justin Bour, who hit a pair of two-run homers, both to the opposite field. He entered Tuesday in a slump, batting just .162 with no homers.\nMets switch-hitter Asdrubal Cabrera also homered twice, once from each side of the plate. Teammate Wilmer Flores pulled an RBI double and a solo homer.\nNew York’s Jacob deGrom settled for a no-decision. DeGrom allowed seven hits, one walk and four runs in six innings, striking out six.\nMarlins starter Caleb Smith, who struck out seven in five innings, also took a no-decision, allowing five hits, one walk and three runs.\nNew York opened the scoring in the first. Conforto beat the shift with an opposite-field single, and he scored on Flores’ one-out double down the left-field line.\nThe Mets extended their lead to 2-0 in the fourth on Cabrera’s second homer of the season, a shot to left. Cabrera hit a 2-2 pitch, a 93-mph fastball up in the zone.\nNew York made it 3-0 in the fifth. Rosario banged a one-out double to left and used his speed to score from second on another opposite-field single by Conforto.\nMiami took a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the fifth. The rally started with a one-out infield hit by pinch-hitter Yadiel Rivera and a Derek Dietrich single. Miguel Rojas dribbled a single off the glove of third baseman Todd Frazier, Starlin Castro added a sacrifice fly and Bour’s homer capped the inning.\nNew York tied the score in the sixth. Frazier doubled, took third on a fly out to left and scored on Juan Lagares’ sacrifice fly.\nMiami grabbed a 6-4 lead in the seventh as Dietrich beat out an infield single and scored on Bour’s second long ball of the night. But the Mets tied the score in the eighth on the solo homers by Flores and Cabrera.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:02:36.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
