They are down 19 percent this year versus a 4.7 percent rise in the Oslo benchmark index.\n($1 = 7.9325 Norwegian crowns)\nEditing by Gwladys Fouche, Jason Neely and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2FapPWM", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T13:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:52:34.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
