I look forward to continuing the great tradition of this Office to pursue justice without fear or favor,” Berman said in a statement.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office is currently investigating Trump’s longtime personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Berman, however, is not participating in that investigation, court filings show.\nPreet Bharara held the Manhattan U.S. Attorney post until March 2017, when he and 45 other U.S. Attorneys from the Obama administration were asked to resign.
