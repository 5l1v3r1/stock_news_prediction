And so, working with our allies and our partners from NATO to Qatar and elsewhere, we are going to address this issue,” Mattis said before the start of a meeting with Qatar’s Emir.\nMattis had been asked if the U.S. was capable of striking President Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons facilities.\nWhen asked if he could rule out taking actions, like launching airstrikes against Assad, Mattis said: “I don’t rule out anything right now.”\nThe Syrian government denied its forces had launched any chemical assault, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said such allegations were false and a provocation.\nU.S. government sources said Washington’s assessment was that chemical weapons were used in a besieged rebel-held town in Syria, but they are still evaluating details.\nAssad is believed to have secretly kept part of Syria’s chemical weapons stockpile despite a U.S.-Russian deal under which Damascus was supposed to have handed over all such weapons for destruction in 2014, officials have said in recent months\nA deadly sarin attack on a rebel-held area prompted Trump to order a missile strike last year on the Shayrat air base.
