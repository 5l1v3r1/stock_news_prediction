The numbers for last year are expected to be released later this month.\nCurrent investors include Iconiq Capital, the Silicon Valley fund, which bought a stake of an undisclosed size at a $2.3 billion valuation in 2015. Other investors include General Atlantic, Temasek, Index Ventures, and Felicis Ventures.\nAdyen, which competes with WorldPay owner Vantiv [VANTV.UL] and France’s Worldline ( WLN.PA ) in a diverse landscape of payments companies, says it still has room to grow.\nIn January, Adyen won the contract to supply eBay’s payments, beating out PayPal, the former in-house payments service eBay spun out nearly three years ago.\nAt a meeting with journalists last week, CCO Prins said that there are several forces driving its growth, notably the need for merchants to keep up with an ever-growing list of mobile payment software apps.\n“We feel there are so many more markets for us out there, many more industries for us to continue that growth path,” Prins said.\n(This version of the story refiles to change “previous investors” to “other investors” for clarity.)\nReporting by Toby Sterling, Arno Schuetze and Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:39:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
