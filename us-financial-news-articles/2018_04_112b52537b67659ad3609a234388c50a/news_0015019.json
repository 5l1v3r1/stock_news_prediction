The Company also expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be within the prior guidance range of ($0.12) to ($0.08) per share.\n\"Our preliminary first quarter results reflect better than anticipated orders, primarily in our Hardware Solutions segment, with Software-Systems in-line with our expectations,\" said Brian Bronson, Radisys president and CEO. \"Importantly, we remain on track to return to non-GAAP profitability in the second half of this year, as we benefit from our recently implemented cost-reduction initiatives and Software-Systems increasingly becomes a greater portion of total revenue. We look forward to sharing more details in our upcoming first quarter earnings conference call.\"\nRadisys will report its complete first quarter 2018 results as part of the Company’s quarterly earnings conference call, which is currently scheduled for May 1, 2018.\nThese results are preliminary and unaudited and subject to adjustment during the standard accounting close process.\nAbout Radisys\nRadisys (NASDAQ: RSYS) helps communications and content providers, and their strategic partners, create new revenue streams and drive cost out of their services delivery infrastructure.
