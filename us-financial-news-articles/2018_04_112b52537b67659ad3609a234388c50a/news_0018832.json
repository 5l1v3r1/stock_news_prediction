On Tuesday it had set a seven-week high of C$1.2588, helped by higher oil prices and the easing concerns about the U.S.-China trade row.\nThe yen was little changed at 107.05 yen per the U.S. dollar , giving back some of the 0.4 percent fall on Tuesday when the Japanese currency slipped broadly.\nThe yen is a safe haven currency that tends to attract demand in times of economic uncertainty and vice versa.\nStill, the improved risk sentiment was curbed by worries over Syria.\nPan-European air traffic control agency Eurocontrol on Tuesday warned airlines to exercise caution in the eastern Mediterranean due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria in next 72 hours.\nRussia and the United States tangled on Tuesday at the United Nations over the use of chemical weapons in Syria as Washington and its allies considered whether to strike at President Bashar al-Assad’s forces over a suspected poison gas attack last weekend.\nThe dollar will probably stay below 108 yen in the near-term especially given simmering geopolitical tensions, said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda.\n“Even trade war rhetoric, I don’t think we’ve seen the end of this,” Innes said. Traders will probably prefer to take long positions in the yen, bracing for the possible next wave of risk version, he added.\nThe dollar, however, could extend its gains if it manages to rise above 108 yen, Innes said, adding that some stop-loss dollar buying could emerge at such levels.\nLater on Wednesday, the dollar could take its cues from U.S. consumer inflation data for March, as well as the minutes of the Federal Reserve’s March meeting.
