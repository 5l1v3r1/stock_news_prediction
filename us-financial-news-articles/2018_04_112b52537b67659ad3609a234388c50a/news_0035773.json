But we did not get blocks yet,” Descalzi said.\nLast year, Eni invested $600 million in Algeria and imported 11 billion cubic metres of gas from the North African country, Descalzi said.\nThe Italian government, which controls Eni, is keen to turn Italy into a Southern European gas hub capable of moving African supplies from Algeria and Libya and future flows from Azerbaijan into Europe.\nItaly’s gas imports have tipped away from Algeria towards Russia in recent years as Algerian production has stagnated.\nSonatrach has struggled to attract foreign investment, a position that CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour is trying to reverse.\nOne delayed Algerian gas field was brought online last year with three more expected to start producing this year, lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres.\nIn a statement released earlier on Tuesday, Eni said it had signed new deals with Sonatrach and that the launch of an exploration and development programme in Algeria’s Berkine basin would be “particularly important”.\nThe programme would lead to the production of new gas reserves using existing infrastructure, Eni said.\n“The renewed collaboration between our companies, enshrined in today’s agreements, allows Eni to make a further important step forward in a key country like Algeria and to consolidate further our strategic partnership with Sonatrach,” Descalzi said in the statement.
