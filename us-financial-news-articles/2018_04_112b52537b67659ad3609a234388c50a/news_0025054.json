It gave the Rockies a 5-1 lead.\nThe homers were LeMahieu’s third and fourth of the season. He totaled four RBIs, doubling his previous season total.\nThe two-homer game was the second of his career. He also had one last August against Atlanta.\nLeMahieu also doubled twice, his fourth and fifth of the season, in a 4-for-5 performance, the first driving in Parra in the second inning for a 3-0 lead. Parra had reached on an infield single.\nGonzalez allowed the first three Rockies runs, only two of which were earned, in five innings. He surrendered five hits and three walks and struck out seven.\nKendrick’s homer, his first of the season, ended Bettis’ shutout bid with two outs in the fifth.\nBettis allowed just the one run in seven innings, limiting the Nationals to three hits. He walked two and struck out five.\nParra finished with two hits for the Rockies, who outhit the Nationals 9-4 in the opener of a seven-game trip. Nolan Arenado doubled for Colorado, his fourth of the season.\nPinch hitter Moises Sierra added a double for the Nationals, who fell to 2-5 at home.\nBryce Harper went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts in the loss.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:39:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
