SKEPTICS \nSome analysts said there were signs that the company might have prioritised the cheaper car, seen as crucial to its profitability, over its Model X SUV and more-established and expensive Model S sedan. \nLast week, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson warned investors to be wary of a brief “burst rate” of Model 3 production that was not sustainable. \n“Tesla may have stockpiled batteries amid Fremont downtime, allowing production to be higher in the final week of 1Q,” Johnson wrote. “Any such ‘beat’ is unlikely to be sustainable, and questions remain on Tesla’s ability to sustainably reach 2,500/week, let alone 5k/week.” FILE PHOTO: A Tesla Model 3 is seen in a showroom in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo \nFirst-quarter deliveries totalled 29,980 vehicles, out of which 11,730 were Model S and 10,070 were Model X. Both were lower from the previous quarter and the first quarter a year ago. \n“Maybe Elon Musk switched staff from Model S and X to Model 3 to get better production numbers for Model 3,” said analyst Frank Schwope from NORD/LB. \nWhile Tesla had promised to reach 2,500 cars per week in the first quarter which ended March 31, the Model 3 weekly numbers it gave were for the seven days to April 2. Tesla declined to give production figures for the week to March 31. \nTesla shares peaked at $389 last September and have been declining steadily since, but analysts continue to give the company the benefit of the doubt as a big bet on the future of high-tech electric and self-driving vehicles. \nMeanwhile, investors raised their bets against Tesla shares by 10 percent since mid-March, according to data provided by S3 Partners LLC on Tuesday, betting the market has misjudged the electric car maker’s prospects. \nMusk himself has taken direct control of Model 3 production and the company says it already has about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the car. \nThe production numbers, while short of Tesla’s own target, are far above the 793 Model 3s built in the final week of last year. \n“Progress is the first word that comes to mind after reading the Q1 delivery report,” Nomura analyst Romit Shah said. \n“We believe that the backlog for Models S and X remains solid but that this is an area to monitor given the sequential declines.” Reporting by Munsif Vengattil, Sonam Rai and Alexandria Sage; Editing by Patrick Graham and Bernard Orr", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T22:41:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
