Net income attributable to Innoviva stockholders increased 76% from the first quarter of 2017 to $29.6 million, or $0.29 per basic share.\nBRISBANE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA) (the Company) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nGross royalties earned on net sales of RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® , ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® and TRELEGY ® ELLIPTA ® from Glaxo Group Limited (GSK) during the first quarter of 2018 were $55.8 million, up 28% from $43.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $40.7 million, a 39% increase compared with $29.3 million for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $45.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, up from $35.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $56.5 million as of March 31, 2018, which reflects a $120.0 million prepayment made by the Company on its Term B loan in February 2018. Royalties receivable from GSK totaled $55.8 million at March 31, 2018.\n“I am pleased to report that both RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® and ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® continued to achieve record TRx market share in the U.S., reaching 20.4% and 17.4%, respectively, for the quarter. First quarter 2018 net sales were unfavorably impacted by payor rebate adjustments related to prior periods and increased competitive pricing pressures,” said Eric d’Esparbes, interim Principal Executive Officer of Innoviva. “In addition, during the quarter, we improved Innoviva’s capital structure through a substantial prepayment of our Term B Loan balance, which led to a reduction in our net cash interest expense.”\nRecent Highlights\nGSK Net Sales: First quarter 2018 net sales of RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® by GSK were $307.7 million, up 19% from $257.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, with $137.0 million in net sales from the U.S. market and $170.7 million from non-U.S. markets. First quarter 2018 net sales of ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® by GSK were $134.2 million, up 73% from $77.5 million in the first quarter of 2017, with $83.5 million net sales from the U.S. market and $50.7 million from non-U.S. markets. First quarter 2018 net sales of TRELEGY ® ELLIPTA ® by GSK were $14.6 million. Product Updates: Announced in March 2018 the positive European Commission approval for labelling update to RELVAR ® ELLIPTA ® in patients with asthma. Capital Structure: Made a partial prepayment in February 2018 of $120.0 million on the principal amount outstanding under the Company’s outstanding senior secured first lien term loan debt.\nAdditional Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2018\nTotal net royalty revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $52.4 million, up 30% compared with $40.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross royalty revenues for the first quarter of 2018 included royalties of $46.1 million from global net sales of RELVAR ® /BREO ® ELLIPTA ® , royalties of $8.7 million from global net sales of ANORO ® ELLIPTA ® and $1.0 million from net sales of TRELEGY ® ELLIPTA ® in the U.S. market.\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $11.7 million (which includes $2.7 million payment to a related party pursuant to a settlement agreement, and $3.2 million in cash severance payments) compared with $11.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 (which included $4.2 million in proxy contest and related legal costs).\nNet income attributable to Innoviva stockholders in the first quarter of 2018 was $29.6 million (or $0.29 per basic share), up 76% from the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2018 was $45.6 million, up 29% from the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.35 per share, compared with $0.19 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, Innoviva uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measure is presented in the accompanying financial table under the headings \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP.\"\nInnoviva believes that the non-GAAP financial information provided in this release can assist investors, research analysts and others in understanding and assessing Innoviva's on-going operations, financial performance and prospects for the future and provides an additional tool to use in comparing Innoviva's financial results with other companies in Innoviva's industry or with similar operating profiles, without regard to financing or capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share are used as supplemental financial operating measures by Innoviva's management and frequently discussed with external users of its financial statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is determined by taking GAAP net income attributable to Innoviva stockholders and adding back interest expense (income), taxes, stock-based compensation expense, write off of debt issuance costs, depreciation expense and amortization of capitalized fees paid to a related party. Innoviva believes the non-GAAP measure of adjusted EBITDA is important as it measures the Company's ability to generate cash to pay interest costs and support its indebtedness, and it is also used currently in the Company's annual performance review process. Innoviva's method of computing adjusted EBITDA may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted earnings per share is determined by taking adjusted net income and dividing the total by the fully diluted number of shares outstanding used to calculate the GAAP diluted EPS. Adjusted net income is determined by taking GAAP net income attributable to Innoviva stockholders and adding back stock-based compensation expense, write off of debt issuance costs, amortization of debt discount, depreciation expense and amortization of capitalized fees paid to a related party. Innoviva believes the non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings per share provides useful information about the Company's core operating performance, and enhances the overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance and its prospects for the future. Innoviva's method of computing adjusted earnings per share may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute to net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities, earnings per share or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted earnings per share is not intended to represent cash flow per share and does not represent a measure of liquidity or cash available for distribution. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that it excludes significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in Innoviva's consolidated financial statements. In addition, it is subject to inherent limitations as it reflects the exercise of judgments by management in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management of Innoviva presents its non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its GAAP results. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of Innoviva's non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAbout Innoviva\nInnoviva is focused on bringing compelling new medicines to patients in areas of unmet need by leveraging its significant expertise in the development, commercialization and financial management of bio-pharmaceuticals.
