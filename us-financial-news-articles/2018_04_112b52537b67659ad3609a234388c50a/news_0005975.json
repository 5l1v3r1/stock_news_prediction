CBS shares rose 0.9 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 3.08-to-1 ratio and for a 3.18-to-1 on the Nasdaq.\nReporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:21:27.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
