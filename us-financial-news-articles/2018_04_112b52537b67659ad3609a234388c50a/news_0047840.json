FILE PHOTO: Libya's eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar salutes as he participates in General Security conference, in Benghazi, Libya, October 14, 2017. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori/File Photo\nHaftar had been in Paris for about two weeks, where his spokesman earlier said he had been treated after feeling unwell.\nFrom Paris, Haftar flew to Cairo for talks with officials from Egypt, his main backer, several Libyan and Egyptian sources told Reuters.\nHaftar, 75, has long been seen as a contender for national power, and reports about his health sparked a flurry of speculation inside Libya, including claims that he was gravely ill and that rivals were manoeuvring to replace him.\nHaftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) is aligned with a parliament and a largely powerless government that has been based in eastern Libya since 2014.\nThey control most of eastern Libya, including the majority of its oil fields and ports, as well as parts of the south.\nHaftar and others in the east have opposed an internationally recognised government in the capital, Tripoli, frustrating U.N.-led efforts to reunify the country.\nLNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said that on his return Haftar would take part in celebrations marking the anniversary of his “Karama” (Dignity) campaign, the military operation he started in 2014 to drive Islamist militants and other opponents out of Benghazi.\nHaftar declared victory in July 2017, though sporadic fighting continued until late last year.\nStreets in Benghazi and the town of Rajma, where Haftar has his main base, were earlier cleaned and decorated with posters in preparation for his return.
