The firm believes the two environmental reports will help the company win permission to resume full output from the plant, Brandtzaeg told Reuters. \n\"This puts the facts on the table and gives us a foundation for resolving the situation,\" he said, adding the firm was in \"a constructive dialogue\" with local authorities. \nAlunorte is the world's largest alumina refinery with around 2,000 employees and a production capacity of 6.3 million tonnes, transforming bauxite to alumina, which is turned into aluminium at smelters. \nHydro shares close up 6.62 percent, outperforming a flat Oslo benchmark index and extending gains from before the firm's statement was published. They were benefiting from sanctions imposed on rival Rusal of Russia, traders said. \nOn April 6, Alunorte sued prosecutors in the Brazilian state of Para, asking a court to reject findings from the government-backed Evandro Chagas Institute, a public health research organisation. \nMarcelo Lima, a researcher at the institute, in an interview on Monday repeated that its analysis was scientifically rigorous and in line with international standards. \nIn late February, Brazilian authorities ordered Hydro to temporarily halve its output from the plant.
