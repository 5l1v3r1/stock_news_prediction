The yield on rate-sensitive two-year gilts fell to as low as 0.843 percent, its lowest since Tuesday.\nBritain’s FTSE 100 jumped sharply, up 0.4 percent, after the slide in sterling on weaker than expected data. Multinational exporting companies on the index tend to make gains when the pound falls.
