Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the 2018 first quarter was $126 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $115 million for the 2017 first quarter.\n“CVR Refining reported solid financial results for the 2018 first quarter,” said Dave Lamp, chief executive officer. “The quarter’s fiscal performance was driven by stronger crack spreads, hedging gains, a reduction to our estimated Renewable Volume Obligation and lower Renewable Identification Number prices.\n“Combined crude oil throughput was approximately 178,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the quarter and was negatively impacted by the extended fluid catalytic cracking unit outage at our Coffeyville refinery,” Lamp said. “The strong financial results for the quarter, revisions to our capital spending plan and delay of our Wynnewood turnaround until 2019 allowed CVR Refining to reward unitholders with a strong quarterly distribution.”\nConsolidated Operations\nFirst quarter 2018 combined crude oil throughput was approximately 178,000 bpd. Combined crude oil throughput was approximately 214,000 bpd for the same period in 2017.\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $13.77 in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $11.54 during the same period in 2017. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), excluding major scheduled turnaround expenses, per combined total throughput, for the 2018 first quarter were $5.49, compared to $4.34 in the first quarter of 2017.\nDistributions\nCVR Refining also announced today a first quarter 2018 distribution of 51 cents per common unit. The distribution, as set by the board of CVR Refining GP, LLC, the general partner of CVR Refining, will be paid on May 14, 2018, to unitholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nCVR Refining is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices paid for crude oil and other feedstocks, as well as the prices received for finished products, RINs’ costs and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Refining previously announced that it will host its first quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, April 26, at 1 p.m. Eastern. The Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of the partnership’s developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.\nThe Earnings Conference Call will be broadcast live over the Internet at https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/kjb58tar . For investors or analysts who want to participate during the call, the dial-in number is (877) 407-8289.\nFor those unable to listen live, the webcast will be archived and available for 14 days at https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/kjb58tar . A repeat of the conference call can be accessed by dialing (877) 660-6853, conference ID 13678611.\nThis release serves as a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b).

These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP results. The adjustments are provided to enhance an overall understanding of the Partnership’s financial performance for the applicable periods and are indicators management believes are relevant and useful for planning and forecasting future periods.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining margin is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries’ performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other at which we are able to sell refined products. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of materials and other) can be taken directly from our Statements of Operations. Our calculation of refining margin may differ from similar calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between net sales and cost of materials and other adjusted for FIFO impact. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating our refineries’ performance as a general indication of the amount above our cost of materials and other (taking into account the impact of our utilization of FIFO) at which we are able to sell refined products. Our calculation of refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in our industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under our FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of our crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices decrease. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughout barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nThe calculation of refining margin, refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact, refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel (each a non-GAAP financial measure), including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nConsolidated Operating Data Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Net sales $ 1,458.2 $ 1,423.5 Cost of materials and other 1,217.7 1,201.3 Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and major scheduled turnaround expenses as reflected below) 93.0 89.2 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 32.7 33.3 Gross profit 114.8 86.8 Add: Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and major scheduled turnaround expenses as reflected below) 93.0 89.2 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 32.7 33.3 Refining margin 240.5 222.2 FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact $ 220.1 $ 222.5\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Total crude oil throughput barrels per day 177,699 214,369 Days in the period 90 90 Total crude oil throughput barrels 15,992,910 19,293,210\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except for $ per barrel data) Refining margin $ 240.5 $ 222.2 Divided by: crude oil throughput barrels 16.0 19.3 Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel $ 15.04 $ 11.52\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except for $ per barrel data) Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact $ 220.1 $ 222.5 Divided by: crude oil throughput barrels 16.0 19.3 Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel $ 13.77 $ 11.54 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for (i) FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) gain on derivatives, net and (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is the starting point for our calculation of available cash for distribution. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income or cash flow from operations. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors to better understand our ability to make distributions to our common unitholders, help investors evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Net income $ 146.7 $ 67.0 Add: Interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income 11.3 11.2 Income tax expense — — Depreciation and amortization 33.7 34.1 EBITDA 191.7 112.3 Add: FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Gain on derivatives, net (59.3 ) (12.2 ) Current period settlements on derivative contracts(1) 13.7 1.2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 125.7 $ 114.5\n(1) Represents the portion of gain on derivatives, net related to contracts that matured during the respective periods and settled with counterparties. There are no premiums paid or received at inception of the derivative contracts and upon settlement, there is no cost recovery associated with these contracts. Available cash for distribution is not a recognized term under GAAP. Available cash for distribution should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or operating income (loss) as a measure of operating performance. In addition, available cash for distribution is not presented as, and should not be considered, an alternative to cash flows from operations or as a measure of liquidity. Available cash for distribution as reported by the Partnership may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other entities, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAvailable cash for distribution is generally equal to Adjusted EBITDA reduced for cash needed for (i) debt service; (ii) reserves for environmental and maintenance capital expenditures; (iii) reserves for major scheduled turnaround expenses and (iv) to the extent applicable, reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of our general partner deems necessary or appropriate, if any. Available cash for distribution may be increased by the release of previously established cash reserves, if any, and other excess cash, at the discretion of the board of directors of our general partner. Actual distributions are set by the board of directors of our general partner. The board of directors of our general partner may modify our cash distribution policy at any time, and our partnership agreement does not require us to make distributions at all.\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Available cash for distribution is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 (in millions, except per unit data) Adjusted EBITDA $ 125.7 Adjustments: Less: Cash needs for debt service (10.0 ) Reserves for environmental and maintenance capital expenditures (25.0 ) Reserves for major scheduled turnaround expenses (15.0 ) Available cash for distribution $ 75.7 Distribution declared, per common unit $ 0.51 Common units outstanding 147.6 Q2 2018 Outlook .
