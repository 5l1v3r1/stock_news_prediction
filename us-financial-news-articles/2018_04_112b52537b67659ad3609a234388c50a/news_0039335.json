REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Banks stocks led Wall Street lower, with JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) down 3.6 percent after its earnings missed estimates. An S&P 500 index of bank stocks .SPXBK fell 2.8 percent.\nTax cuts are expected to help corporate America post its biggest quarterly profit growth in seven years. Earnings at S&P 500 companies are estimated to grow by 18.4 percent from a year earlier.\n“Even with great earnings, maybe the expectations were so high that they are not propelling the market further,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Hartland & Co in New York. “Good earnings are already priced into the market.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 207.06 points, or 0.85 percent, to 24,275.99, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.74 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,648.25 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 55.25 points, or 0.77 percent, to 7,085.00.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.10 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS shed 0.31 percent.\nIn emerging markets, stocks lost 0.70 percent.\nOvernight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.24 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.55 percent.\nGlobal investors seemed to focus on the lack of a clear sign that any U.S.-led attack on Syria was imminent, but the prospect of Western military action in Syria that could lead to confrontation with Russia hung over the Middle East.\nOil prices rose on support from lingering concerns about geopolitical risk and reports of dwindling global oil stocks.\n“The geopolitical jitters just keep getting priced in here more and more, as we get closer to the moment of the strikes, if there are any,” said John Kilduff, partner at hedge fund Again Capital Management. He noted that Syria poses a large risk to global stability because of its relationship with powerful oil producers.\n“Syria is a client state of both Russia and Iran and the risk for escalation is quite high and I think that is what the market is worried about.”\nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 32 cents to settle at $67.39 a barrel, while Brent crude LCOcv1 rose 56 cents to $72.58.\nTrade tensions also were not far from the surface, with analysts at Citi noting prolonged uncertainty will likely hurt open Asian economies such as Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority stepped into the currency market and bought another HK$3.038 billion ($387.01 million) in Hong Kong dollars on Friday as the local currency hit the weaker end of its trading range.\nThe U.S. dollar hit a seven-week high against the Japanese yen. The yen tends to benefit from geopolitical uncertainty and risk aversion.\nThe dollar index .DXY rose 0.01 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.1 percent to $1.2337.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 107.31 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.4238, up 0.09 percent on the day.\nAluminum hit a six-year high on Friday and posted its biggest weekly gain since the current contract was launched after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s UC Rusal ( 0486.HK ), the world’s second-biggest producer.\nLondon Metal Exchange aluminum CMAL3 hit its highest since March 2012 at $2,340 a tonne before retreating to close at $2,285, down 1.7 percent.\nSpot gold XAU= added 0.8 percent to $1,345.90 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained 0.54 percent to $1,349.10 an ounce.\nCopper CMCU3 rose 0.13 percent to $6,829.85 a ton.\nIn sovereign debt markets, the U.S. Treasury yield curve hovered at its lowest level in more than decade as short-dated yields have risen more than longer-dated ones this week on expectations of further interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve.\n(GRAPHIC: U.S. yield curve flattest in a decade - reut.rs/2CkkWKx )\nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.823 percent, from 2.834 percent late on Thursday.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos, Caroline Valetkevitch, Richard Leong, April Joyner and Jessica Resnick-Ault in New York, Jan Harvey in London and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T04:01:27.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
