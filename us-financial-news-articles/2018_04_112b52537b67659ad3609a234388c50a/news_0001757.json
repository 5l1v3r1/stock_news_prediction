He is progressing satisfactorily at this early stage,” the palace added in a statement. \n“His Royal Highness is likely to remain in hospital for several days,” it added. “He is comfortable and in good spirits.” \nPhilip retired from public life last August, quipping at the time that he was no longer able to “stand up much”. \nHe did not accompany the Queen, 91, to a church service at a service last Thursday because of the hip problem, a royal source said last week. \nHe also missed the Easter Sunday service traditionally attended by the royal family at St George’s Chapel in Windsor to the west of London, where his grandson Prince Harry is due to marry U.S. actress Meghan Markle next month.
