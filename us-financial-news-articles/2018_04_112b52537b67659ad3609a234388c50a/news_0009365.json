China’s top diplomat State Councillor Wang Yi waves during a meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia April 5, 2018.

Trump has traded barbs with the North Korean leader for much of his time in office as Pyongyang pursues development of nuclear weapons capable of hitting the United States. \nNorth Korea was “suffocating” under international sanctions, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Thursday, adding, “They need an out.” \nSpeaking at Duke University in North Carolina, Haley said, “When the president ends up speaking with Kim, the conversation has to be about denuclearising. Not some of it, all of it. We don’t want an irresponsible actor to have nuclear weapons.” \nShe added, “But we’re going into this very cautiously, very much knowing that he’s looked at the Iran deal, he’s seen what he can get and he’s seen how he can push through loopholes, and we’re not going to let that happen again.” \nLast month, China said it won a pledge from Kim, who was on a surprise visit to Beijing for talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping, to denuclearise the Korean peninsula. \nChina and Russia are both permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which has imposed sanctions on North Korea in a bid to force negotiations with Pyongyang. \nTension on the peninsula has eased following a flurry of diplomatic activity in the lead-up to February’s Winter Olympics held in South Korea. \nNorth and South Korea have agreed to hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, while Trump has said he would meet Kim by the end of May. \nTrump has threatened to withdraw the United States from an accord between Tehran and six world powers, signed in 2015 before he took office, unless France, Britain and Germany help to agree a follow-up pact by that date. Trump does not like the deal’s limited duration, among other things.
