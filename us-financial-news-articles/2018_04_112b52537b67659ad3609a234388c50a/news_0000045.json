In one grave, 16, and in another, 21. Many were young children,” Sayed Jaan said on Tuesday. \n“There were other burials and people were digging graves.” \nThe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a tweet its investigators were in the area looking into “disturbing reports of serious harm” to civilians. \nA senior official of Afghanistan’s defense ministry said the air attack happened during a meeting of militants, and killed at least 35 Taliban and wounded many more, but he denied reports that civilians were harmed. Two senior Taliban commanders were among those killed, the official said. \nKunduz city was seized briefly by the Taliban in 2015 and was overrun by the militants for a second time the following year but has since been considered relatively secure. However the Taliban controls much of the surrounding province, with government ground forces unable to reach many areas. \nA video posted online by the Taliban showed at least four bodies of children, wrapped in white shrouds. Other images circulated of children and adults being treated in hospital for injuries, but they could not be verified. \nBuilding up the fledgling AAF has been a major priority for the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission. \nOn Monday, the Taliban said the strike killed 150 religious scholars and civilians and denied the presence of any of its forces. \nLast year, more than 10,000 civilians died or suffered injuries in Afghanistan over the war between its Western-backed government and militant groups, down 9 percent from the previous year, a UNAMA report showed in February.
