He believes 2018 will be a year of four hikes. \n\"We should think about 3.25 percent on the 10-Year Treasury [yield] or 3.50 percent or potentially even higher,\" Zidle said. \nHis timeline: by year-end. \nAccording to Zidle, the market is more than equipped to handle higher rates. He cites strong economic and earnings fundamentals. It's a chief reason why his S&P 500 year-end price target is 3,000 — a 12 percent jump from Tuesday's level. \n\"The correction may not be over. But the good news here is that the underlying fundamentals have not been impacted. This is a market where everyone is worried about the headline risk coming from the trade spat,\" he said. \nZidle predicts a robust earnings season, which starts Friday, that will boost stocks. \n\"The data points that really matter to companies continue to flash bullish signals. We've got economies all over the world that are growing,\" said Zidle. \"It's not just a story that's contained to the United States. It's happening all over.\" \nHe classifies this market environment as a classic, late cycle bull market. \n\"You ought to be positioned in cyclicals on the equity side of a portfolio — so, things like industrials , materials , tech , energy and financials ,\" Zidle said. \"On a fixed income side of a portfolio, I think it means being in things like floating rate and credit over duration.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T16:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T15:07:10.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
