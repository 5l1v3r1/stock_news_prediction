REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo The CNH said that Pemex will have a 45 percent stake in the onshore areas scheduled to be tendered on Oct. 31.\nPemex has tempered expectations for the year after failing to find partners on its Ayin-Batsil shallow water development and the Nobilis-Maximino deepwater project, whose tender was canceled in December due to lack of interest.[nL1N1O8037]\nBy mid-year 2017, Pemex was considering 160 onshore and offshore areas for development. Now just seven more modest onshore projects are planned for such partnerships in the states of Veracruz, Chiapas and Tabasco, according to company statements.[nL2N1PP05B][nL1N1K1144]\nThe government of President Enrique Pena Nieto enacted a wide-ranging reform in 2013-2014 to encourage foreign investment and end the slide in oil output to multi-year lows.\nThe reform ended Pemex’s 75-year monopoly over the energy sector, one of the key generators of revenue for the government.\nMexico has opened oil and gas exploration and production, as well as retail sale of fuel, to private investors.\nReporting by Adriana Barrera; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:38:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
