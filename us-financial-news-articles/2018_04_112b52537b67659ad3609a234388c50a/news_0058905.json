The deal has faced difficulties as relations between Russia and the United States have deteriorated.\nThis is a second attempt by Schlumberger to acquire Russia’s leading oilfield services provider. In 2015, Schlumberger agreed to buy 45.65 percent of EDC for $1.7 billion (1.23 billion pounds), but the deal fell through after the FAS repeatedly postponed its approval. Later that year, EDC delisted its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\nFor Schlumberger, the investment would mean access to the Russian oil market, one of the world’s largest, amid rising crude prices.
