Its shares are up 23 percent so far this year, sharply outperforming a 2 percent rise STOXX Europe Automobiles & Parts Index.\nAutoliv has been winning a lot of new business at the expense of collapsed Japanese rival Takata in recent years, which has been at the centre of the auto industry’s biggest-ever recall and filed for bankruptcy last year.
