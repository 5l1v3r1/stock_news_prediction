At least until now,” said Ricciardo, winner in China two weeks ago and at last year’s chaotic Baku race.\nAsked specifically about media reports saying he had a pre-agreement with Ferrari for an exclusive negotiating period, the 28-year-old added: “That’s not true.”\nBritain’s Motorsport magazine recently reported that Ferrari had an option allowing it exclusive negotiations with Ricciardo up to a defined date, believed to be the end of June.\nThe Australian is out of contract at the end of the season, as is Kimi Raikkonen, who currently partners four times world champion Sebastian Vettel — Ricciardo’s previous team mate at Red Bull — at Ferrari.\nRicciardo has also been linked to Mercedes as a possible team mate for Britain’s four times world champion Lewis Hamilton.
