Total paid subscribers reached 1.81 million, representing a 9% increase from April 3, 2017 – the day after WrestleMania last year.\nWWE Network total subscribers at WrestleMania 34 and WrestleMania 33 2,3 :\nTotal Subscribers\n(thousands)\nApril 9 th , 2018\nWrestleMania 34\nApril 3 rd , 2017\nWrestleMania 33\n% Growth Total (Paid + Free Trial) 2,124 1,949 9% Total Paid 1,808 1,661 9% WrestleMania Milestones\nWrestleMania broke the record for the Mercedes-Benz Superdome’s highest grossing entertainment event at $14.1 million, as a sold-out crowd of 78,133 fans from all 50 states and 67 countries attended the event. As part of the week-long WrestleMania celebration, WWE hosts five consecutive nights of events at the Superdome and the Smoothie King Center WWE Network subscribers viewed 25.2 million hours during WrestleMania Week or 14 hours per subscriber during the week. This compares to 22.5 million hours last year, a 12% year-over-year increase\nWWE 2018 Perspective\nQ1 2018: Based upon preliminary data, WWE Network attracted an average of approximately 1.56 million paid subscribers over the first quarter 2018, representing a 5% increase from the first-quarter 2017 average. The first quarter 2018 average was in-line with guidance of approximately 1.53 million. 3\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company realized stronger than anticipated performance. As a result, the Company expects Q1 Adjusted OIBDA of at least $30 million (subject to the completion of its quarterly close process), exceeding its previous guidance of $23 million to $27 million. 4\nQ2 2018: If the acquisition and retention of subscribers driven by WrestleMania is comparable to the subscriber activity associated with the prior year event, average paid subscribers for the second quarter 2018 would be approximately 1.77 million, representing an increase of approximately 8% from the second quarter 2017. 5 As future subscriber performance may differ from prior activity, this range is provided for perspective rather than as guidance.\n2018: WWE management continues to expect the Company to achieve another year of record revenue and has raised its target for 2018 Adjusted OIBDA to at least $145 million (excluding stock-based compensation expense), which would be an all-time record, exceeding its previous guidance of at least $140 million. 4\nNotes\n(1)\nTotal subscribers following WrestleMania exclude pay-per-view buys with cable and satellite providers.\n(2)\nMetrics reflect subscribers who are direct customers of WWE Network and subscribers reported under licensed partner agreements, which have different economic terms for the network. The impact of these subscribers on WWE Network results is reflected in the network’s average revenue per subscriber (ARPU).\n(3) Additional information regarding WWE Network subscriber levels can be found in the Company’s website presentation at corporate.wwe.com/investors .\n(4) WWE is unable to provide a reconciliation of forward looking guidance to GAAP measures as, at this time, WWE cannot accurately determine the adjustments that would be required. Further information regarding such reconciliations can be found on page 5 of this release.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks relating to: entering, maintaining and renewing major distribution agreements, including our principal domestic television license which currently expires in September 2019; WWE Network (including the risk that we are unable to attract, retain and renew subscribers); our need to continue to develop creative and entertaining programs and events; the possibility of a decline in the popularity of our brand of sports entertainment; the continued importance of key performers and the services of Vincent K. McMahon; possible adverse changes in the regulatory atmosphere and related private sector initiatives; the highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate and greater financial resources or marketplace presence of many of our competitors; uncertainties associated with international markets; our difficulty or inability to promote and conduct our live events and/or other businesses if we do not comply with applicable regulations; our dependence on our intellectual property rights, our need to protect those rights, and the risks of our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights; the complexity of our rights agreements across distribution mechanisms and geographical areas; potential substantial liability in the event of accidents or injuries occurring during our physically demanding events including, without limitation, claims relating to CTE; large public events as well as travel to and from such events; our feature film business; our expansion into new or complementary businesses and/or strategic investments; our computer systems and online operations; privacy norms and regulations; a possible decline in general economic conditions and disruption in financial markets; our accounts receivable; our indebtedness; litigation; our potential failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, which could adversely affect our stock; Vincent K. McMahon exercises control over our affairs, and his interests may conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock; a substantial number of shares are eligible for sale by the McMahons and the sale, or the perception of possible sales, of those shares could lower our stock price; and the relatively small public “float” of our Class A common stock. In addition, our dividend is dependent on a number of factors, including, among other things, our liquidity and historical and projected cash flow, strategic plan (including alternative uses of capital), our financial results and condition, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends (including under our revolving credit facility), general economic and competitive conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant.

Adjusted OIBDA includes amortization expenses directly related to the Company’s revenue generating activities, including the amortization of feature film, television production and WWE Network programming assets.\nThe Company believes the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of operating cash flows generated by the Company’s business segments and is a primary measure used by media investors, analysts and peers for comparative purposes.\n(2) Because of the nature of the footnoted items, WWE is unable to estimate the amounts of any adjustments for these items for periods after December 31, 2017 due to its inability to forecast if or when such items will occur. These items, which could be significant, are inherently unpredictable and may not be reliably quantified.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409006305/en/\nFor WWE\nInvestors:\nMichael Guido, CFA, 203-352-8779\nmichael.guido@wwecorp.com\nor\nMedia:\nMatthew Altman, 203-352-1177\nmatthew.altman@wwecorp.com\nSource: WWE", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors%2F&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=corporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&index=4&md5=3dee00f32498aa4ca63ed98ce3b0b44f", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors%2F&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=corporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&index=3&md5=9eb7d7382b522343bfe98f50497d4db6", "http://www.wwe.com/worldwide/", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409006305/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=corporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&index=2&md5=c37ae365a3d70355934c93fb04331fba", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Fworldwide%2F&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Fworldwide%2F&index=8&md5=e696ed6eb1aaf61061f3c09c2396c0e1", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.wwe.com%2Fapp%2Fanswers%2Fkbdetails%2Fa_id%2F166%2F&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=here&index=5&md5=0f7e5fd7668e5a4c8569f08f1e30f1af", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.wwe.com&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=corporate.wwe.com&index=7&md5=cc082cbf675c38c174be79aaec75891c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=corporate.wwe.com%2Finvestors&index=1&md5=6c92aa5c152606941ddea9469300b370", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwwe.com&esheet=51785725&newsitemid=20180409006305&lan=en-US&anchor=wwe.com&index=6&md5=109749d782af5e2ae2ef9cb503bb6304"], "published": "2018-04-09T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T00:48:31.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
