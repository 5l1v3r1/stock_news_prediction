The largest number of people, 3 billion, live on level two, spending between $2 and $8 a day.\nRosling encourages people to use this framework, rather than use labels like \"developed\" and \"developing,\" because, as Gates explains, \"It's hard to pick up on progress if you divide the world into rich countries and poor countries. When those are the only two options, you're more likely to think anyone who doesn't have a certain quality of life is 'poor.'\"\nThe four levels help you grasp that \"the average person is getting a lot wealthier,\" says Gates.\n\"This is one of the most educational books I've ever read,\" the billionaire philanthropist continues. \"It covers a space that it's not easy to go learn about. The world would be better if literally millions of people read the book.\"\nLike this story?
