It’s time to find permanent solutions based in the international law to a war that has been going for far too long and ended too many lives,” Brazilian President Michel Temer said in the plenary.\nPeru, a non-permanent member of the United Nations security council, called for moderation from all parties involved and said it backed a “political solution,” according to a statement from the foreign ministry.\nArgentine President Mauricio Macri also called for the international community to seek to avoid flaming tensions further and to work “in the framework of existing international commitments.”\nThe official theme of the Summit of the Americas is the fight against corruption. Many countries in attendance are also expected to condemn a pending election in Venezuela.\nBut Syria, China and trade loomed over the talks on Saturday as Washington seeks to advance the agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump, which is widely unpopular in the region.\nTrump canceled his attendance at the summit to focus on Syria. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is filling in for him, is expected to discuss Syria in his speech on Saturday and in meetings with heads of state.\nThe Pentagon said on Saturday that U.S. strikes in Syria overnight had successfully hit every target and were aimed to deliver an unambiguous signal to the Syrian government and deter the future use of chemical weapons.
