Bitcoin is the first application of the technology, and many banks are exploring how blockchain can reduce cross-border payments processing time from days to seconds.\nSwitzerland is also among the most sensitive to that aspect of blockchain technology.\nThe nation ranks third on Moody's list of countries whose banks handle the most cross-border transactions relative to GDP â€” excluding outliers Luxembourg and Hong Kong. The UK tops the list, followed by Belgium.\nThe banking systems with the smallest shares of fee and commission income in revenues\nSource: Moody's Investor Service\nKnown historically as a hub for international banking, Switzerland has also become one of the friendliest countries in the world to blockchain and digital currency enthusiasts.\nIts Zug region has already been dubbed \"Crypto Valley\" for the number of digital currency businesses located there.
