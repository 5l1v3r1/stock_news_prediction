Hong Kong stocks gained 1.7 percent. \nBut Turkish assets took another beating due to geopolitical tensions related to Syria and after President Tayyip Erdogan reiterated on Monday that interest rates needed to be cut to “save” investors. \nThe lira touched a record low against the dollar, while stocks tumbled 2.5 percent. \nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5 \nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets \nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see \nFor TURKISH market report, see \nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg \non year \nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1169.54 +6.47 +0.56 +0.96 \nCzech Rep 1127.96 +2.41 +0.21 +4.62 \nPoland 2258.37 -3.79 -0.17 -8.24 \nHungary 38350.51 +44.17 +0.12 -2.61 \nRomania 8851.42 -9.69 -0.11 +14.16 \nGreece 812.67 +11.53 +1.44 +1.28 \nRussia 1076.85 -18.13 -1.66 -6.72 \nSouth Africa 50134.25 +742.89 +1.50 -4.57 \nTurkey 10651.40 -2504.68 -2.21 -4.06 \nChina 3190.65 +52.36 +1.67 -3.52 \nIndia 33912.71 +124.17 +0.37 -0.42 \nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local \nclose currency currency", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T12:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:27:50.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
