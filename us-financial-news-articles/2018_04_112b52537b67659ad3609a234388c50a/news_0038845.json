IMF officials were not immediately available to react to the Congolese statement. \nLike other Central African oil producing countries, Congo has been hit by low crude prices. While several neighbours, including Chad and Gabon, have secured bailouts from the IMF, talks with Congo have dragged on since last year. \nThe delay is largely due to the IMF’s call for the government to restructure its debt, which stood at $9.14 billion, or around 110 percent of GDP, by the end of July - a level the Fund says is unsustainable. \n“Republic of Congo welcomes the agreement concluded with the International Monetary Fund to support its reform programme,” the government said in a statement. “This agreement is supported by other multilateral creditors, including the World Bank and African Development Bank.” \nIt said the programme, which still required IMF board approval, aimed to restore sustainable and inclusive economic growth and support a “stable microeconomic environment compatible with the viability of the public debt”. \nThe statement did not give the expected size of the IMF package, but it said that conclusion of the programme would unlock an additional 135 million euros ($166 million) from France. \n“Republic of Congo congratulates itself for having met all of the criteria to be eligible for financing of its economic and financial programme by the IMF and its international partners,” it said. \nAt the end of its most recent visit to Congo, the IMF said on Thursday that the two parties it had come to “broad understandings on policies that could be supported by the IMF under a financial arrangement”. \nHowever, the mission did not say it had reached a staff-level agreement - the provisional deal between the IMF and the government that could then be submitted the Fund’s executive board. \nInstead, it said it expected Congo to continue implementing its strategy to restore debt sustainability and would propose a programme to the board “once compliance with all relevant IMF policies has been established.” \nCongolese authorities are in talks with creditors, including trading houses Trafigura and Glencore from whom it borrowing $2 billion. \nThe bulk of its external debt, however, is owed to Chinese entities.
