The latest statement is proof of this”, it said. \nBoth countries have accused each other of a series of mid-air incidents since Abu Dhabi and other powers imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar in June. \nThe UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, accuse Qatar of supporting regional foe Iran as well as Islamic militants. \nDoha denies the charges and say its rivals seek to rein in its foreign policy.
