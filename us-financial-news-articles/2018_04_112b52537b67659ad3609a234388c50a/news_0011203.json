REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker \nLula remained holed up inside the headquarters of a steelworkers union in metropolitan Sao Paulo with aides and allies after the federal judge’s deadline of 5 p.m. (2000 GMT) to surrender to authorities. However, Lula’s legal team was negotiating his surrender with federal police, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \nFederal police in Sao Paulo declined to say if they would attempt to forcibly take the former president into custody, a move that could trigger intense clashes with his supporters. A union spokesman said Lula was mulling his options with lawyers. \nHis legal team, which lost their last-minute appeal to a higher court, argued they had not exhausted procedural appeals and painted the case as an effort to remove Lula from the presidential race he is leading. \nHundreds of supporters filled the street outside the union headquarters, cheering defiant speeches calling the case a political witch hunt. A banner hung from the building showed Lula’s smiling face on an electronic voting machine.

THE FALL \nFederal Judge Sergio Moro, who has handled the bulk of cases in Brazil’s biggest-ever graft investigation and issued Lula’s prison order, wrote that he should not be handcuffed and would have a special cell in Curitiba, where he stood trial. \nLula was convicted last year for taking bribes from an engineering firm in return for help landing contracts with state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA ( PETR4.SA ). \nBrazil’s Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Lula’s plea to remain free until he exhausts all his appeals, in a case he calls a political witch hunt. \nThe ruling likely ends his political career and blows October’s election wide open, leaving Brazil’s left without an obvious candidate to regain power following the unpopular current president, Michel Temer. \nUnder Brazilian electoral law, a candidate is forbidden from running for office for eight years after being found guilty of a crime. Rare exceptions have been made in the past, and the final decision would be made by the top electoral court if and when Lula officially files to be a candidate. \nBrazilian financial markets rallied on Thursday after the Supreme Court cleared the way for Lula’s imprisonment, which increased the chances of a market-friendly candidate winning the election, according to analysts and political foes. \nCassio Goncalves, a labor safety specialist at the union headquarters, said Lula’s Workers Party had not considered alternatives in the presidential race. \n“We have no other plan,” he said. “Plan A, B and C is Lula, because he is innocent. He will be our president.” Reporting by Gram Slattery and Tatiana Ramil in Sao Bernardo do Campo; Additional reporting by Ricardo Brito in Brasilia, Eduardo Simoes in Sao Paulo; Writing and additional reporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Brad Haynes, David Gregorio, Rosalba O'Brien and Tom Brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T14:59:39.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
