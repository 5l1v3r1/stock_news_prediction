The rupee has weakened 1.3 percent so far this year after declining 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016.\nA gradual depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility are expected this year on account of debt repayments by the government, dealers have said.\nThe International Monetary Fund in March said that Sri Lanka’s economy remained vulnerable to adverse shocks due to its large public debt and low external buffers.\nThe government must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.68 billion) in 2018 - a record - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest.\nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 6.3 billion rupees ($40.5 million) so far this year through April 4, central bank data showed.
