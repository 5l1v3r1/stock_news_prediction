Snell (4-1) struck out nine over 7 1/3 innings, allowing two runs on five hits and a walk.\nAfter losing 13 of its first 17 games, Tampa Bay has outscored its opponents 51-28 during its winning streak.\nJ.D. Martinez (2-for-4) had a pair of RBIs and Mookie Betts (2-for-3, walk) also drove in a run for Boston, which lost for the fourth time in six games.\nRed Sox starter Drew Pomeranz (0-1) was charged with four runs on six hits and two walks with four strikeouts in five innings.\nRobertson and C.J. Cron both went 2-for-3 and Refsnyder finished the game 2-for-2 with a walk. Alex Colome earned his fifth save with a scoreless ninth.\nBoston shortstop Bogaerts made his return from the disabled list, finishing 3-for-4 with a strikeout. Bogaerts missed 15 games with a left ankle injury.\nTampa Bay third baseman Matt Duffy also came back from a seven-game DL stint and went 1-for-5 with two strikeouts.\nThe long ball bit Pomeranz in the early innings as homers by Ramos, Refsnyder and Robertson had the Rays up 4-0 after four innings.\nRamos belted a two-run shot, his third of the season, an estimated 395 feet over the Green Monster in left field in the Rays’ first.\nRefsnyder followed suit with an estimated 401-foot solo blast to left in the third for his first homer of the year. Robertson hit a solo bomb for his third home run of approximately 398 feet to left an inning later.\nThe homer for Refsnyder was his first since Oct. 1, 2015, when he slugged a solo shot versus Boston as a member of the New York Yankees. His three career homers have all come against the Red Sox.\nBetts and Martinez each knocked two-run doubles in the sixth. Martinez also had an RBI single in the eighth.\nBefore the game, Tampa Bay optioned right-hander Austin Pruitt to Triple-A Durham to make room for Duffy. Boston placed utility man Brock Holt (left hamstring strain) on the 10-day DL to account for Bogaerts’ spot.\nRays right-hander Yonny Chirinos (0-1, 2.92 ERA) opposes Red Sox left-hander David Price (2-2, 2.93 ERA) on Saturday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:53:58.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
