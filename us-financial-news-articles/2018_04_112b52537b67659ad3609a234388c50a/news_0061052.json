Bilateral ties are now based on a patchwork of sectoral accords.\nFifty-four percent of respondents in the survey by polling institute GfS Bern backed the plan to have arbitration courts comprising representatives from Switzerland, the EU and a neutral party resolve disputes.\nEven supporters of the far-right Swiss People’s Party, which opposes any new treaty, favoured this approach, the poll published by the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper found.\nOnly 4 percent of Swiss wanted the EU’s European Court of Justice to be the final arbiter of disputes, although the ECJ is envisioned to rule on matters to do with EU law. Thirty-five percent backed the current system in which a joint Swiss-EU commission is supposed to work out compromises on handling rows.\nPoll coordinator Urs Bieri called the outcome “an impressive advantage for the start of (Foreign Minister Ignazio) Cassis’s negotiating strategy”, the NZZ said.\nThe poll covered 2,500 respondents and had a margin of error of up to 2 points.\nSwitzerland in March revived plans to contribute an extra 1.3 billion Swiss francs (954.8 million pounds) for newer European Union members as relations with its biggest trading partner began improving after a spat at the end of last year.\nDiplomats say the mood has brightened since Bern laid out its negotiating position on the new treaty Brussels wants that would formalise ties.\nThe treaty would see the Swiss adopt EU laws governing the single market, with the ECJ giving its opinion on disputes on how to interpret single-market rules.\nThis is opposed by the anti-immigration People’s Party, the largest in parliament, which has two cabinet seats.\nMany Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving “foreign judges” such power, so the idea of arbitration panels, which were first proposed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in November, may help break the impasse.
