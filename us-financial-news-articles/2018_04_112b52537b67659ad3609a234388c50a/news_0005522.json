When looking at day-of prices, it's the 3rd most expensive since 2011, a website representative told CNBC.\nWhile not exactly peanuts, that price is a far cry from earlier this week, when it seemed as if, for the fourth consecutive year, fans might have to cough up more than $1000 for a seat at this year's Final Four in San Antonio. On Saturday, Loyola-Chicago will take on Michigan, while Kansas will face off against Villanova.\nAccording to TicketIQ, the most expensive Final Four ticket on the secondary market was in 2017, at $1,343, when North Carolina and Gonzaga advanced to the title game.\nIn this year's unpredictable round, the early demise of several top-seeded teams threatened to push ticket prices even lower. Yet prices have steadily increased since Selection Sunday, and on that night alone, Final Four ticket costs jumped by $200.\nThe drastic increase in demand and prices can be attributed to top teams advancing — but perhaps even more so their enthusiastic fan bases. Two of the top squads — Kansas and Michigan — bring with them some of the most vocal boosters in the game.\n\"The simple answer is that Michigan and Kansas are two of the best travelling fan bases in [college basketball], and fans wait to buy until they know their team has made it,\" TicketIQ said of the high demand.\n\"Michigan hasn't been to the Final Four since 2013 and hasn't won a national title since 1989.\"\nTicket demand and affordability are influenced by a multitude of factors like region and the intensity of a fan base. However, recent history suggests that fans get less interested — and tickets get comparatively cheaper — when top teams get knocked out.\nBack in 2011, when lower-seeded teams that advanced were fairly common, the ticket price to see the last 4 remaining teams tumbled to $552 — the lowest ever.\nThe Championship, which will pit the last teams standing from Saturday's games against one another, will take place Monday night.", "external_links": ["http://blog.ticketiq.com/2018/03/2018-ncaa-tournament-tickets-prices/"], "published": "2018-03-31T23:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T00:21:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
