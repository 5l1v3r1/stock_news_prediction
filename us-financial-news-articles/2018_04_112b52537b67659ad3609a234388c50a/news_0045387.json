Chad was on the list announced in September, but Trump removed it on April 10.\nThe conservative-majority, nine-member court has never heard arguments on the legal merits of the travel ban or any other major Trump immigration policy, including his move to rescind protections for young immigrants sometimes called Dreamers brought into the United States illegally as children.\nIt has previously acted on Trump requests to undo lower court orders blocking those two policies, siding with him on the travel ban and opposing him on the Dreamers.\nA ruling is due by the end of June.\nThe state of Hawaii , which argues the travel ban violates federal immigration law and the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the government favoring one religion over another, is the lead challenger in the case.\nThe Supreme Court on Dec. 4 signaled it may lean toward backing Trump when it granted on a 7-2 vote his administration's request to let the ban go into full effect while legal challenges played out.\nTrump has generated controversy with his hardline immigration policies, also including actions taken against states and cities that protect illegal immigrants, intensified deportation efforts and limits on legal immigration.\nTrump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from terrorism by Islamic militants.\nThe challengers have argued the policy was motivated by Trump's enmity toward Muslims, pressing that point in lower courts with some success by citing statements he made as a candidate and as president. As a candidate, Trump promised \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"\nThe Justice Department argues Trump's statements as a candidate carry no weight because he was not yet president.\nIn defending the ban, the administration has pointed to a waiver provision allowing people from targeted countries to seek entry if they meet certain criteria.\nVenezuela and North Korea also were targeted in the travel ban. Those restrictions were not challenged in court.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T15:21:08.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
