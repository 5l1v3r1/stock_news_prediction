The postal bank’s alternative assets have climbed to be worth 1.27 trillion yen as of end December, more than double levels at the end of March 2017.\nThe bank confirmed that he would step down.\nSoftBank said in a statement that Sago’s appointment to the board will be put to vote at its annual shareholders meeting on June 20.\nSago was previously vice chairman of Goldman Sachs Japan and has also been head of its securities division. He also did a stint as an advisor to Japan’s Financial Services Agency.\n$1 = 109.2900 yen Reporting by Taiga Uranaka; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T12:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T12:23:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
