A combination of file photos show U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. April 9, 2018 and former FBI Director James Comey on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria, Jonathan Ernst/File Photos \n“Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” Trump wrote in one of five Twitter posts aimed directly at the fired FBI chief. \nThe renewed attacks by Trump came as ABC News was set to air an interview with Comey at 10 p.m. EDT on Sunday (0200 GMT Monday) in which he discusses his book, “A Higher Loyalty.” \nTrump fired Comey last May, setting off a firestorm, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing possible connections between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia’s meddling in the American elections. \nRussia has denied interfering in the election and Trump has denied any collusion or improper activity. A copy of former FBI director James Comey's book \"A Higher Loyalty\" is seen in New York City, New York, U.S. April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Soren Larson \nReuters and other news outlets have obtained copies of Comey’s book before its formal release this week. In it, Comey wrote that Trump, in a private meeting, pressed the then-FBI director for his loyalty. \nThe FBI has long tried to operate as an independent law enforcement agency. \n“I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!” Trump said on Twitter. \nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” expressed qualified support for Comey. Ryan, asked whether Comey was a man of integrity, said, “As far as I know” but added that he did not know him well. \nAsked about Trump’s use of the words last week “slime ball” to describe Comey, Ryan said, “I don’t use words like that.” Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:03:12.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
