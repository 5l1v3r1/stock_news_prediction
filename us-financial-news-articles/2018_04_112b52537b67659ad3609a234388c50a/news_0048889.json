These acquisitions advance Standard Media's goal of swiftly building a substantial broadcast television group with a strong and diverse voice.\nStandard General is pleased that industry veteran Deb McDermott has agreed to lead the Company as CEO.

We are excited to work with the talented station teams established by Sinclair and Tribune and grow the business for years to come. Following this transaction, Standard Media will be well positioned to make further accretive acquisitions and we believe there is a compelling market opportunity to create another large player in the consolidating broadcast TV industry,\" said Ms. McDermott.\nThe Transaction is subject to regulatory approval, the closing of the Sinclair / Tribune merger and other customary closing conditions.
