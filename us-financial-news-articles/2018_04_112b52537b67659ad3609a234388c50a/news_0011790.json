This information is used to create a 3D map of the colon, which allows physicians to look for polyps and other abnormalities. Designed to improve the patient experience and increase the willingness of individuals to participate in recommended colorectal cancer screening, C-Scan removes many frequently-cited barriers, such as laxative bowel preparation, invasiveness and sedation.\nInvestor Contacts\nVivian Cervantes\nPCG Advisory\n646-863-6274\nvivian@pcgadvisory.com\nMeirav Gomeh-Bauer\n+972-54-4764979\nMeirav@bauerg.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/check-cap-files-annual-report-for-the-year-ended-december-31-2017-300624911.html\nSOURCE Check-Cap Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/", "http://ir.check-cap.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/check-cap-files-annual-report-for-the-year-ended-december-31-2017-300624911.html"], "published": "2018-04-05T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T19:59:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
