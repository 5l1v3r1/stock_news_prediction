They're even gaining some ground globally in places like Beijing and London.\nCNBC recently experienced a premium pod hotel in the neighborhood of Ginza in Tokyo, Japan.\nThe Prime Pod usually can run between $40 to $70 per night, and pods there come fully equipped with a television, radio, outlets and a small storage space.\nAs could be expected, the visit was filled with advanced technology throughout, including toilets which had more than a dozen buttons and features to a cordless iron.\nWhile the trend is becoming popular among backpackers, the concept dates back to when Japanese workers, particularly men, stayed in their offices or went out for dinner and drinking until late at night.
