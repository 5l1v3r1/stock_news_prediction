It’s that simple,” said the 59-year-old, adding that he would ask Congress to pass a law backing his idea.\nTaken aback, the moderator Azucena Uresti twice asked him if he was speaking literally, before checking again that he really meant what he had said.\n“That’s right. That’s right,” he replied.\nMemes based on Rodriguez’s comments rapidly spread through Twitter, among them an image of his face superimposed on a picture of what appeared to be an Islamist militant chopping off a man’s hand.\n“El Bronco” was trending ahead of the other candidates on Twitter during the debate.\nIndependent presidential candidate Jaime Rodriguez and his wife Adeline Davalos gesture after arriving at Palacio de Mineria for the first presidential debate in Mexico City, Mexico April 22, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero Crime and corruption are top issues in the election campaign, with candidates under pressure to offer a way to end massive public graft and lower the number of murders from historic highs.\nRodriguez’s comments followed a long discussion about a proposal by election front-runner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to explore a vaguely defined amnesty to end a drug war, in which about 200,000 people have been killed in a decade.\nThe idea is unlikely to gain much support in Congress, but if it were adopted would be a major shift in approach for Mexico, which prohibits the death penalty and torture.\n“It is not a bad thing, countries that have left corruption behind have done it,” said Rodriguez, without giving details. Saudi Arabia and Iran are among a handful of countries in the world that permit amputation as a punishment.\nIt was not immediately clear if the punishment envisaged by Rodriguez would be limited to public officials convicted of graft or apply to criminals generally.\nIndependent presidential candidate Jaime Rodriguez and his wife Adeline Davalos gesture after arriving at Palacio de Mineria for the first presidential debate in Mexico City, Mexico April 22, 2018.
