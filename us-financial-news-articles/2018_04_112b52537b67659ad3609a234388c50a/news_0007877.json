The tariffs threaten to hit farm states that were strong supporters of Trump in the presidential election, as Republicans prepare for November midterm elections. \n\"The 'headline risk' president has stunned Washington â€” and it takes a lot to stun Washington these days,\" Valliere wrote in a note. \"We still think a trade war can be avoided, but our confidence has been shaken; Donald Trump is itching for a fight and the Chinese will not tolerate public bullying from him.\" \nValliere said Chinese officials have privately said that trade concessions are necessary, especially on intellectual property and tariffs on U.S. cars, but Trump may have made China less likely to deal.
