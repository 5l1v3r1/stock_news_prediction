The tariff war has been a concern for a couple of weeks. The response was probably more muted than most thought,” said Colas. At 2:43 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 711.82 points, or 2.95 percent, to 23,391.29, the S&P 500 lost 82.63 points, or 3.13 percent, to 2,558.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 253.79 points, or 3.59 percent, to 6,809.65.\nAmazon.com was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 , down 5.9 percent, as President Donald Trump launched his latest in a series of twitter attacks on the online retailer.\nAll 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were in negative territory.\nThe S&P 500 Technology index was down 3.5 percent. The tech-laden Nasdaq was dragged lower by Microsoft, Intel , Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet .\nShares of Tesla Inc were down 5.2 percent after the company was reported to be making 2,000 Model 3s per week, missing its 2,500 target.\nThe electric automaker’s losses extend last week’s near 14-percent decline as investigations of a fatal California crash and a Moody’s credit downgrade weighed on the stock.\nHumana Inc shares were up 3.2 percent on news that the health insurer was in talks with Walmart to expand their partnership or to potentially be acquired by the retailer . Walmart stock fell 4.5 percent on the news.\nU.S. Treasury prices gained as investors sought safety ahead of Friday’s closely-watched jobs report.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.50-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
