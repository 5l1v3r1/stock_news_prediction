DEBT, METAL EXCLUDED \nOn the debt front, Rusal will be excluded on April 30 from JPMorgan’s CEMBI index group of emerging market corporate bonds, the U.S. bank said. \nThe exclusion will be done as part of the end-of-month rebalancing of the indexes, it added. \nAs of Friday, April 6, Rusal has a weight of 0.12 percent and 0.15 percent in the CEMBI Broad Diversified and CEMBI Diversified indexes respectively, JPM said in a statement seen by Reuters that was sent to clients late on Monday. \nMoody’s said it was withdrawing all ratings for Rusal due to its own business reasons. \n“At the time of withdrawal the ratings were: corporate family rating of Ba3 and probability of default rating of Ba3-PD At the time of withdrawal these ratings had a positive outlook,” it said in a statement. \nRusal’s aluminium brands are being excluded from the LME, the world’s biggest market for industrial metals, and the U.S. Comex exchange owned by the CME. \nThe CME revoked approved status for Rusal’s metal for delivery against CME aluminium futures contracts, effective from April 10, a notice on the CME website said. \nThe London Metal Exchange said late on Tuesday Rusal’s aluminium would be suspended from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling contracts with sanctions-hit companies. \nAluminium prices extended their rally on Wednesday to a sixth straight session, hitting an 11-week peak, amid persistent worry about shortages. \nAnalysts at CRU say Rusal accounts for 14 percent of aluminium supplies outside top producer China. Global output this year is estimated at 65 million tonnes. \n“There’s a lot of panic and uncertainty. Buyers are scrambling to try to replace where they can, to plug the gap left by not having Russian-origin metal,” said Robin Bhar, head of metals research at Societe Generale in London. \nThe sanctions have had knock-on impact on precious metal palladium, which has surged 6 percent this week on the back of concerns about supply from number one producer Russia. \nAlthough the supply pipeline of the metal, more than two-fifths of which is sourced in Russia, has not been directly hit by the sanctions, the market has been rattled by the inclusion of Deripaska on the blacklist. \nDeripaska’s Rusal owns a 28 percent stake in Norilsk Nickel , the world’s biggest palladium producer.
