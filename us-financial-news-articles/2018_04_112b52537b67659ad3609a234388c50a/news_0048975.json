REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure The move, likely to deepen the country’s biggest political crisis in a decade, follows days of street protests against Serzh Sarksyan, the newly-appointed prime minister whom protesters accuse of clinging to power.\nBefore being appointed prime minister, Sarksyan, 63, did a 10-year stint as president. Under a constitutional change, most state powers are now invested in his new role.\nThe protests, though peaceful so far, threaten to destabilize a key Russian ally in a volatile region riven by a long low level conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan and would, if successful, be a rare example of people power delivering reform in the former Soviet Union.\nTens of thousands of protesters have marched through the capital Yerevan in recent days, blocking streets and staging sit-ins. They are demanding that Sarksyan resign to pave the way for early elections, something he has so far refused to do.\nRelated Coverage Armenian opposition leader says will hold talks with acting PM on Wednesday Ally of resigning Armenian PM to become acting PM: RIA Prime Minister of Armenia says will resign after protests against him: statement On Sunday, police detained three opposition leaders and nearly 200 protesters, drawing a rebuke from the European Union.\nOn Monday, men wearing military uniforms could be seen marching in Yerevan with protesters. Images broadcast on the Internet and social media showed the soldiers hugging protesters and waving the country’s national flag.\nThe Armenian Defense Ministry condemned what it said was their illegal action, saying the men belonged to a brigade of military peacekeepers.\n“The harshest legal measures will be taken against the soldiers,” it said in a statement.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Maria Kiselyova\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
