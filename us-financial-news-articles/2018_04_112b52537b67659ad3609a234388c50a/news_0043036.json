The depropanizer processes propane produced in the alkylation unit’s reaction tower.\nIn the alkyklation process refining byproducts are converted into octane-boosting chemicals that are blended into gasoline.\nRiojas said one employee was evaluated for possible medical problems as a precaution, but “showed no health issues.” The employee returned to work at the refinery on Friday.\nFour contractors sustained minor injuries while exiting the area where the explosion occurred, she said.\nA spokesman for the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration said investigators from the workplace safety agency were at the refinery, located 42 miles (68 km) south of Houston.\n“We have sent people there,” OSHA spokesman Juan Rodriguez said by phone. “Folks from our Houston South office are there.”\nBy law, OSHA must complete its probe within six months of the explosion, Rodriguez said.\nA spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality *(TECQ) said the state pollution control agency had people at the refinery on Thursday night.\nTCEQ staff were onsite on Thursday to assess the incident and Valero’s emergency response actions, said spokesman Andrew Keese.\n“A TCEQ investigation is ongoing,” Keese said.\nA spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regional office in Dallas was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Richard Chang and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-21T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:57:53.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
