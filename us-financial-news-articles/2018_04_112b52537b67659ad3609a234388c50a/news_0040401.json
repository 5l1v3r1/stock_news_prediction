(Reuters) - Expert toxicologists for both sides are expected to take the stand on Thursday in the trial of Bill Cosby who is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting a former friend more than a decade ago. Actor and comedian, Bill Cosby, arrives for his sexual assault retrial case at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 19, 2018. Mark Makela/Pool via Reuters \nCosby, best known as the star of the 1980s TV hit “The Cosby Show,” is being retried in a Pennsylvania court on charges of giving three blue pills to Andrea Constand and raping her at his home near Philadelphia in 2004. The jury in the first trial last year failed to reach a verdict. \nCosby, 80, says the sexual contact with Constand was consensual. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. \nThe prosecution and defence plan to call expert toxicologists after the prosecution introduced a 2005 deposition in Constand’s civil trial about Cosby’s knowledge and use of Quaaludes to seduce women. \nCosby paid Constand $3.38 million to settle a civil lawsuit she filed after Pennsylvania prosecutors in 2005 initially declined to charge Cosby for the alleged assault. Other women have filed civil lawsuits against him for defamation and assault. Actor and comedian, Bill Cosby, arrives for his sexual assault retrial case at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S., April 19, 2018. Mark Makela/Pool via Reuters \nConstand is one of about 50 women who have accused him of assault dating back decades. Hers is the only case recent enough to be the subject of criminal prosecution. \nCosby has denied the accounts of the other women. \nOn Wednesday, Cosby’s star defence witness testified that Constand once told her how easy it would be to fabricate an accusation of sexual assault against a celebrity to make money. \nMarguerite Jackson, an academic adviser at Temple University, Cosby’s alma mater, said Constand made the remark while they were on a road trip by Temple’s women’s basketball team in Rhode Island. Constand was director of operations for the team. \nConstand on Monday denied ever knowing Jackson, rooming with her or ever speaking to her.
