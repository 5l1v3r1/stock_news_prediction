But he added: “We of course understand the reasons for Israel deciding to carry out actions of this kind, and would of course also prefer that these reasons not exist.”\nThe Israelis say their strikes aim to prevent Iran’s pro-Assad garrison from entrenching in Syria and linking with Hezbollah in Lebanon to form a broad front against them.\nRussia has said it might provide Syria with the S-300 missile defence system, which could clip the wings of Israel’s air force. Israel has warned against any such deal.\n“If anyone shoots at our planes, we will destroy them,” Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Ynet on Tuesday.\nShein said the idea of the S-300 delivery - on which Russia has yet to decide - was a result of the punitive April 14 missile strikes by U.S., British and French forces on Syria.\n“I emphasise that the question arose in the context of Western aggression against Syria, and has nothing to do with Israel,” he said.\nThe ambassador also played down the risk of a physical confrontation between Russia and Israel over Syria.\n“I can’t imagine any such scenario,” he said in response to Lieberman’s threat. “We are mutually coordinating and updating about Syria ... So far, there have been no incidents between us, nor even hints at incidents, and I hope there will not be.”\nWriting by Dan Williams; Editing by Jeffrey Heller and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T12:58:44.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
