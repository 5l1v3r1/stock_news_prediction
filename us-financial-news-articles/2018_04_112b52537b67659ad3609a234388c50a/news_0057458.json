This kind of investing is known as \"ESG\" for environmental, social and governance factors.\nAssets under management in U.S.-based socially responsible investing strategies climbed to $8.72 trillion at the start of 2016, roughly 20 percent of all investment under professional management and an increase of 33 percent from the start of 2014. Those numbers — published every two years by US SIF: the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, a Washington, D.C., trade group whose members include numerous mutual and pension funds — are likely higher given the growing interest in the space.\nWhile research remains limited, early academic analysis from Harvard Business School finds firms with an emphasis on environmental and social issues have a significantly higher annualized return.\n'A new paradigm' In an annual speech to hedge fund leaders last Tuesday, Robbins, Blue Harbour's chief executive, said that social and environmental considerations have become integral to how the fund's partners decide where to invest its $3 billion in assets.\n\"This is hugely important – I think this is a new paradigm for smart investing,\" he told the crowd at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Summit last week. \"Now when I'm calling up a CEO three months after we make an investment, in addition to saying: 'Where are we on the spin-out? Where are we on the balance sheet? Where are we on the margins?' I'm saying, 'Where are we on that commitment you made to me to make the board more diverse?'\"\nKnown as \"the friendly activist,\" the Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund prides itself on having never sued or run a proxy contest against a company since Robbins first founded the firm in 2004. Instead, Blue Harbour has made a name for itself through meticulous work with company management, a process Robbins considers \"one of the most important\" in determining whether to invest.\nThat simultaneous focus on both management and ESG was recently put to the test when the fund accrued a 4 percent stake in software company Open Text, according to David Silverman, managing director at Blue Harbour who quarterbacks the fund's ESG efforts.\nFor an industry infamous for its lack of gender diversity, Open Text's decision to appoint Madhu Ranganathan as chief financial officer this month came as welcome news to the Blue Harbour team.\n\"Open Text just added a new CFO who happens to be a woman of diverse background ... we think she's going to be a great CFO,\" Silverman told CNBC. \"That's important at a tech company, as more broadly in the industry there have been issues of diversity and inclusion.\"\nWhile taking steps to diversify a company's management or board may have its own ethical benefits, Silverman reiterated that Blue Harbour's focus on ESG stems from financial interest. It's those types of company-specific ESG concerns, he said, which can help concentrated activists unlock previously hidden value.\nBut Blue Harbour isn't the only activist fund integrating socially responsible investing into fund management.\nAdam Jeffery | CNBC Barry Rosenstein, founder of JANA Partners.\nRosenstein's Jana Partners also has been exploring the space, most recently hiring former BlackRock fund manager Dan Hanson to oversee a new fund targeting companies on issues like climate change and wage inequality,", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T15:33:45.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
