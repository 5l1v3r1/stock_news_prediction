The push is part of an effort to see at least 10 percent of Kenya’s land covered in trees by 2030.\n“We are planting trees on public land like schools and hospitals, and encouraging people to do the same,” he said.\nGreen TNC, a charity, has organized tree-planting initiatives in schools, with students planting hundreds of saplings - at least half of them fruit trees - at 25 schools.\nTerry Makena, one of the group’s founders, said it chose to target schools because “young people are more receptive to new ideas”.\n“Hopefully teaching them these good practices now will ensure they stick in the future,” he said.\nReporting by Caroline Wambui, editing by Zoe Tabary and Laurie Goering.
