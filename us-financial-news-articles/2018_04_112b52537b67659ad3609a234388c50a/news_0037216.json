REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo \nThat rapid growth in appetite for aviation fuel means the country’s refiners are far less likely to send cargoes abroad, tightening markets from Asia to Europe. \nYears of breakneck economic expansion have helped India become the world’s fastest growing major domestic aviation market, according to the International Air Transport Association. \nThat has been underpinned by ambitious government plans to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure, including a push to build airports and offer airlines incentives to fly to smaller cities. \n“The country’s air transport sector has huge potential to grow in the long-term given its large geographical expanse and growing consumer affluence,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, a Singapore-based analyst at energy consultancy FGE. \nAverage monthly demand for jet fuel could break through 700,000 tonnes this year, up from 2017’s record 623,000 tonnes and from 566,000 tonnes in 2016, several industry analysts estimated. \nThat would be an annual growth rate of around 12 percent, comparable to what China achieved during its main boom years in the early 2000s. \nIndia used 2.02 million tonnes of aviation fuel from January-March this year, up 9.4 percent from a year earlier, the latest government data showed. [O/INDIA2] \nFGE forecasts a 10.5-percent year-on-year increase in Indian demand for jet fuel in 2018, while energy consultancy Trifecta expects growth of 12-15 percent.

LESS FOR THE REST \nIndian oil refineries such as Reliance Industries ( RELI.NS ) and Essar Oil ESRO.M3 are significant exporters of petroleum products including jet fuel. Thomson Reuters data shows India is one of the top three Asian suppliers of jet fuel. \nBut exports are set to slow as local demand surges. \n“Domestic demand growth will certainly limit its ability to service other markets in the region,” said Richards at BMI. \nAlready, India’s monthly exports dropped by more than 7 percent year-on-year in 2017. \nTo deal with rising consumption, India’s refineries are expanding. \nIndia’s Ratnagiri Refinery & Petrochemicals - a joint venture between Indian Oil ( IOC.NS ), Hindustan Petroleum ( HPCL.NS ) and Bharat Petroleum ( BPCL.NS ) - in April signed an initial deal with Saudi Aramco to build a huge refinery in the western state of Maharashtra. \nReliance Industries, operator of the world’s largest refinery, plans to expand its oil processing capacity by over 40 percent by 2030.
