Some 31 percent abstained.\nPersimmon introduced a long-term incentive plan in 2012 that could have seen the firm’s top management, including Chief Executive Jeff Fairburn, make a profit of more than 200 million pounds ($279 million) on share options.\nFollowing widespread criticism, that scheme was scaled back in February with changes made to the 2012 plan’s entitlements for CEO Fairburn, finance chief Mike Killoran and managing director Dave Jenkinson.\nAberdeen Standard Investments, one of Persimmon’s top investors with a 2.3 percent stake, voted against the 2017 pay report saying that the CEO pay concessions were “not even... close to acceptable”.\nExcessive corporate pay has attracted public anger since the financial crisis and Prime Minister Theresa May has denounced as irrational and unhealthy the yawning gap between the amounts paid to bosses and average workers.\nThe company’s chairman and the head of its pay committee quit last year, under fire from British media and some investors for failing to reform the scheme.\n$1 = 0.7172 pounds Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:53:03.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
