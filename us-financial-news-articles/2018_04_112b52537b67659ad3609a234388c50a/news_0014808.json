Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!” Trump tweeted. \nFire officials said no member of the Trump family was in the building at the time.

As you can imagine, the apartment is quite large, we are 50 stories up. The rest of the building had a considerable amount of smoke,” Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said on Twitter. \nAbout 200 fire personnel responded to the incident that the department said was a four-alarm fire. \nVideo on social media showed flames outside of a few windows and black smoke billowing up from the high-rise. \nIn January, three people were injured in an early-morning fire at the top of Trump Tower. One firefighter was hospitalized while two people received minor injuries that were treated at the scene, the New York Fire Department said.
