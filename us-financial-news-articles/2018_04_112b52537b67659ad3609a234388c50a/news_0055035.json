These non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangibles resulting from business combination, change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrant liability and collaboration and development expense. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures help analyze the Company’s financial results, establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and to evaluate performance. The Company also believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing Aquantia’s core business and results of operations over multiple periods with other companies in the industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in the way that these measures are calculated. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered as the sole measure of our performance and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Aquantia\nAquantia is a leader in the design, development and marketing of advanced, high-speed communications ICs for Ethernet connectivity in the Data Center, Enterprise Infrastructure, Access and Automotive markets.
