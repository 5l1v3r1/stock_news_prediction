Athletics - London Marathon - Elite Men Press Conference - London, Britain - April 19, 2018 Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge poses for a photograph Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra \nKipchoge won on the streets of London in 2015 and 2016 but missed last year’s race to take part in the Nike Breaking Two project, where he ran two hours and 25 seconds with the aid of “illegal” in and out pacemakers. \nHe returned to action in Berlin in October last year, taking a second win there but has opted not to race at all since then over any distance. \n“My season has been really good and my training actually doesn’t need to be tested,” the Kenyan told a news conference. “It doesn’t need to have a race in Europe or America or anywhere to test my body. So the training is fully actually testing my body.” \nStill only 33, Kipchoge knows what he is doing, having been at the top for more than a decade, winning world championship gold on the track over 5,000metres in 2003 then bronze and silver in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics.

Even then, his second race in Berlin in 2013, he clocked the then-fastest non-winning time ever of 2:04:05 behind Wilson Kipsang’s world record of 2:03.23. \nThat world mark has since been lowered to 2:02:57 by Dennis Kimetto, who is racing in Vienna on Sunday, and despite it being forecast to be the hottest London Marathon since it began in 1981, Kipchoge has it in his sights at some point.
