A nationwide search process confirmed what we already knew: that Brian’s intimate knowledge of our operating model, balance sheet, paired share structure, and core business, combined with the executive experience that he has gained over the past three years in other franchising, real estate, and retail businesses, makes him the ideal candidate to lead our way forward as we continue to execute on our ESA 2.0 initiatives.”\nMr. Halkyard added, “I’d also like to thank David Clarkson for his outstanding service as our Interim Chief Financial Officer since January 1, 2018. David will return to his role leading our Treasury and FP&A functions, reporting directly to Brian.”\nMr. Nicholson said, “I’d like to thank Jonathan and the Boards of Directors for appointing me to succeed Jonathan as CFO. With the launch of ESA 2.0, Extended Stay America is positioned to do great things in the coming years, and I couldn’t be happier to be rejoining the company at such a transformative time.”\nForward Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
