The blast shattered a window, killing a passenger, in the first U.S. passenger airline fatality since 2009.\nSouthwest has declined to answer questions about its CFM56-7B inspection program, including how many engines were inspected prior to the accident and if the engine that failed had been inspected.\nA Southwest flight in August 2016 with a CFM56-7B engine made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated and debris ripped a hole above the left wing.\nAfter that incident, the European agency gave airlines nine months to check engines. U.S. regulators were still were considering what to do after proposing some checks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T14:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:21:09.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
