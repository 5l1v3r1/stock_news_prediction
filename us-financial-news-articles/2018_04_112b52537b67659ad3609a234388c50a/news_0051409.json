Revenue in the Company’s document solutions business increased as well, following new product launches and aggressive sales promotion. Mergers and acquisitions made new contributions to the Company’s business.\nProfitability in the components and document solutions businesses improved due to increased revenue, cost reduction, and rising productivity. However, long-term purchase agreements for polysilicon material used in the Company’s solar energy business led to a write-down totaling JPY50,165 (USD473) million. As a result, profit from operations decreased 8.6%, to JPY95,575 (USD902) million, and income before income taxes decreased 4.3%, to JPY131,866 (USD1,244) million. In addition, extraordinary tax expenses incurred by U.S. subsidiaries including AVX Corporation resulting primarily from U.S. tax law revisions reduced net income by approximately JPY11,000 (USD104) million. Net income attributable to Kyocera Corporation’s shareholders consequently decreased 21.2%, to JPY81,789 (USD772) million.\nAveraged exchange rates during fiscal year 2018 show the Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar by approximately 2.8%, to JPY111; and against the euro by approximately 9.2%, to JPY130, as compared with year-ago averages. This had the effect of increasing net sales and income before income taxes by approximately JPY39,000 (USD368) million and JPY16,000 (USD151) million, respectively.\nConsolidated Q4 Results, Year-Over-Year\nUnit: Millions (except percentages) Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\n(FY17-Q4)\nin JPY\n2018\n(FY18-Q4)\nin JPY\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\n2018\n(FY18-Q4)\nin USD\n2018\n(FY18-Q4)\nin EUR\nAmount\nin JPY\n% Net sales: 408,126 432,023 23,897 5.9 4,076 3,298 Profit from operations: 37,440 -13,409 (50,849) -\n-127 -102 Income before income taxes: 39,143 -12,998 (52,141) - -123 -99 Net income attributable to\nKyocera Corporation's\nshareholders:\n32,991 -8,478 (41,469) - -80 -65 (See note above regarding exchange rates.)
