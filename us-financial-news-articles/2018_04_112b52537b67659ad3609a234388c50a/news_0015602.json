A car-maker, for example, could find out that young women in the market for a minivan are likely to watch certain shows on ABC and CBS, and target its buy accordingly.\nAccess to more granular audience data could change how buyers and sellers negotiate, giving networks the confidence to guarantee ratings for specific audiences, versus just age and gender viewing.\nThe tool, Nielsen Enterprise Audience API (which stands for application programming interface), allows advertisers and media sellers to plug their systems into Nielsen’s, and request specific data around audience viewing on demand.\nPreviously, TV networks could request audience data from Nielsen’s research team, but the audience segments were limited. Also, Nielsen could only send age and gender data to media sellers and buyers in the form of special files delivered through a secure system.\n“The goal is to democratize access to consistent data, and make that on demand,” said George Tsivin, a senior vice president of product leadership at Nielsen.\nThe API is one more example of how the antiquated TV ad business is taking steps to compete with a digital media industry that lets advertisers target specific audience segments and individuals. Digital advertising has spoiled advertisers, pressuring TV businesses and companies like Nielsen to offer more granular viewing data and automate planning, buying and selling processes that have historically been manual.\nThe API was originally built as a way for OpenAP, a TV network consortium, to quickly grab information about which shows were likely to reach which custom audience segments across networks. Advertisers would be able to use this information to figure out how to consistently target their consumers across networks.\nNielsen has adjusted the API to make it more widely accessible for buyers, sellers and companies like Simulmedia that help advertisers buy TV inventory informed by audience data.\nMore accessible audience data could influence negotiations between buyers and sellers in the upcoming upfront season -- when TV networks preview new shows for the upcoming season and seek spending commitments from advertisers.\nFor example, a packaged-goods advertiser trying to sell diapers can request information, through OpenAP, about which shows best reach new moms. Networks can also request that data and use it to guarantee that it can generate a minimum number of impressions from new moms. The network can then secure a spending commitment from the advertiser contingent on reaching a certain number of impressions from new moms.\nTypically, buyers and sellers agree to terms that include age and gender guarantees. If sellers don’t meet those guarantees, they’re typically on the hook to give the advertiser more future inventory.\nThe API is not only meant to help TV networks with their ad sales pitch, but also “to ready for delivery those targets when it comes to the next TV season,” said Kelly Abcarian, another senior vice president of product leadership at Nielsen.\n“Getting this enterprise API launched now is so key,” she said. “Will they wholesale more access to audience-based buying this year? No. But will they take some percentage of their inventory? Absolutely.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T22:28:34.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
