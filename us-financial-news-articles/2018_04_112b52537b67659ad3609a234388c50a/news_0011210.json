He finished with a nine-over-par 81. TIGER UNABLE TO FIND RHYTHM IN MASTERS RETURN \nTiger Woods, competing in his first Masters since 2015, mostly struggled as he mixed three birdies with four bogeys for a one-over-par 73 that left him seven shots off the lead. O’MEARA MAY BID ADIEU TO AUGUSTA \nFormer champion Mark O’Meara, who shot a six-over-par 78 in the opening round, said he will “more than likely” announce on Friday that he has played his final Masters.
