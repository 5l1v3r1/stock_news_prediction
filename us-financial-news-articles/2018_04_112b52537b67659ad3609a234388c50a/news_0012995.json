DZ Bank analyst Sebastian Fellechner said the market will be looking to the Fund for the some guidance on the direction of the global economy.\n“It’s interesting to see if the IMF still expects a continuation of global economic growth or if they are seeing some implications of the trade war,” he said.\nLater this week, minutes from ECB and Fed meetings, as well as inflation data for the U.S. will further inform the government debt market.\nOn Friday, Fed Reserve chair Jerome Powell said rate hikes will likely continue as planned.\nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury yields was 2 bps higher in European trade on Monday at around 2.80 percent.\nReporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr"], "published": "2018-04-09T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T11:11:42.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
