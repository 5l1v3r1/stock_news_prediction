At one point, soldiers from the two sides threw stones and punches.\nThe confrontation between the nuclear-armed powers in the Himalayas underscored Indian alarm at China’s expanding security and economic links in South Asia.\nModi will come again to China in June for a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.\nChina will also have to tread carefully to avoid giving its close ally Pakistan cause for alarm. China on Monday reassured Pakistan that relations between the two countries were as firm as ever and would “never rust”.
