It said expenses this year will grow between 50 percent and 60 percent, up from a prior range of 45 percent to 60 percent.\nInitially, at least, investors were judging that a sensible move rather than a big threat to the company’s bottom line.\n“We believe this is a prudent move to secure the stabilization of user engagement, advertiser confidence and government relations,” Mizuho Securities analyst James Lee said.\nAt least five brokerages raised their price targets on Facebook stock, while one cut its price on the stock.\nMizuho’s Lee was most bullish with a price target of $255. Facebook’s mean price target was $216.87 versus the $170 it was trading at in premarket on Thursday.\nBarclays analyst lowered his price target on the stock to $190 from $225, saying he expects more tape-bombs in 2018 before sentiment eventually improves.\n“We don’t think (the) first quarter marks the “all clear” for Facebook shares by any means, but given the drubbing over the past two months, we think it may start an overdue stabilization period,” Sandler wrote in a client note titled “Senator, we run ads.” (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; editing by Patrick Graham)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:33:22.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
