An artist's concept of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory spacecraft during its cruise phase between launch and final approach to Mars in this illustration obtained April 27, 2018.

The mission will also look into ways to support a manned-mission to the planet.\nThe timing of the launch is key. In July and August of 2020 the positions of Earth and Mars are aligned in a way that will mean less power is required to reach the red planet compared to other times.\nThe heat shield on the Mars 2020 spacecraft would reach temperatures of about 3,800 degrees Fahrenheit (2,100 Celsius) as it speeds at more than 12,100 mph (19,550 kph) towards the Mars surface, NASA said.\nAbout 5 miles (8 kms) above the surface of Mars, the heat shield is designed to pop off the spacecraft as it is slowed by parachutes. From the craft, a so-called “sky crane” will be deployed that will lower the tethered rover onto the surface.
