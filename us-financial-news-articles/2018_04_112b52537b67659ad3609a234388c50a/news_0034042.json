Formerly president of the national nonprofit Complete College America, Sugar has championed several strategies proven to help more students from diverse backgrounds succeed, including guided pathways, proactive advising, and “15 to Finish.” At Complete College America, Sugar was also charged with creating alliances of states, systems, institutional consortia, and partner organizations that advance those strategies.\n“Tom’s experience is a perfect complement to EAB’s mission and membership model; at EAB, we bring together colleges and universities from across the country to address shared challenges with best practice research and technology designed to help students stay in school, graduate, and get good jobs,” said EAB Chief Executive Officer David Felsenthal. “We are excited that Tom is bringing his deep experience in higher education and public policy to EAB and look forward to both the value he will provide our members and also a continued partnership with Complete College America.”\nAt EAB, Sugar’s main goal will be to establish and strengthen relationships with foundations, corporations, higher education organizations and systems, and governments at the national, state, and local levels whose missions align with EAB. By doing so, Sugar will increase the reach and impact that EAB’s research and technology have on at-risk students. EAB currently supports approximately 4 million students with its student success management system, which helps students, faculty, advisors, and administrators make more informed and timely decisions that help students graduate on time, ready for a career of their choice.\n“I look forward to continuing my work in student equity and achievement in a new capacity at EAB,” Sugar said. “At Complete College America I helped define and push game-changing strategies for student success. Now for the next phase of my career, I’m excited to work at a company that’s bringing those best practices to life for millions of students.\n“The only way to permanently eliminate achievement gaps and ensure more students graduate is to mobilize like-minded leaders and equip them with powerful new ideas and technologies proven to make and sustain change,” said Sugar. “And to achieve America’s and our states’ equity and educational attainment goals, student success strategies must become engrained in every higher education practice and policy. EAB is poised to accelerate that transformation.”\nBefore co-founding and leading Complete College America, Sugar was Chief of Staff to United States Senator Evan Bayh. He is a graduate of Indiana University and a current resident of Indiana.\nAbout EABAt EAB, we are making education smarter.
