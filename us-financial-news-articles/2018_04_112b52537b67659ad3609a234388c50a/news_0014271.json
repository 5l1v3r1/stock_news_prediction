The forward-looking information contained in this press release is based on historical information in respect of the distributions and dividends paid on the securities of issuers included in the Fund’s portfolio. Actual future results, including the amount of distributions paid by the Fund, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and may differ materially from the expected monthly distribution amount. In this regard, the income from which distributions are paid by the Fund may vary due to several factors, including: changes in portfolio composition; the level of borrowing employed by the Fund; changes in dividends and distributions paid by issuers of securities included in the Fund’s portfolio; there being no assurance that those issuers will pay dividends or distributions on their securities; and the uncertainty of realizing capital gains. The risks, uncertainties and other factors that could influence actual results are described in the Fund’s prospectus dated May 28, 2015 as well as other documents filed by the Fund with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities and available at www.sedar.com .
