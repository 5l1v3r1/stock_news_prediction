Finalists in a kitchen in London prepare soups to be sold in the British supermarket Waitrose as part of a nationwide competition to support homelessness. Photo taken 17 April 2018. Thomson Reuters Foundation / Adela Suliman \nFive finalists, from lawyers to farmers, gathered at the Waitrose cookery school on Tuesday with competing recipes for the new soup under the “Big Broth” initiative. \nThe winning entry, red pepper and chorizo, will be sold in Waitrose stores across Britain from September, with 20 pence (28 cents) from each sale going to the homeless charity Centrepoint. \n“It’s important because it’s going to benefit the young and homeless people across the country,” said Abdoulaziz, who was made homeless as a teenager after a family breakdown and helped by Centrepoint. He declined to give his full name. \n“When they take home that soup, I want people to feel like they contributed to helping the youth and feel nice,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \nGovernment figures show homelessness has risen in England for seven consecutive years, with more than 1,000 people in London and more than 4,100 nationally sleeping on the streets, a 134 percent jump since 2010. \nAnother 78,000 families live in temporary accommodation as Britain struggles with a housing shortage due to a decline in homebuilding since the 1970s, government data shows.
