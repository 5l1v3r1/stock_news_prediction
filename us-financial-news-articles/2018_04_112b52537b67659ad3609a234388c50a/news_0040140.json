They were flat at 1405 GMT, in line with the Stoxx European bank index.\nPrime brokers, usually large banks, make money from hedge funds by providing services such as stock lending, financing and trade execution.\nCredit Suisse holds it annual general meeting on April 27, at which RBR will not be able to make proposals or vote on agenda items.\nMajor shareholder advisory groups are backing the bank’s pay proposals after it overhauled a compensation policy that provoked criticism last year.\nIn January, RBR announced the closure of one of its funds and said it would be placing greater emphasis on shareholder activism. It also shifted its focus on Credit Suisse by calling for it to revamp its IT platform and cut jobs.
