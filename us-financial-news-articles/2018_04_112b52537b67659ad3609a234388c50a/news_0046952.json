Additionally, Weinstein Co. paid nearly $2 million to service a debt Weinstein personally guaranteed, which was owed to a company controlled by billionaire Len Blavatnik. Records filed on Tuesday in the bankruptcy case of Weinstein Co. detail what Weinstein, his brother and studio co-chief Bob Weinstein and other leaders received from the company before and after misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein were published in October. \nMillions of dollars in pay, expense reimbursements, advances and loans went to the Weinstein brothers and to David Glasser, a top executive the studio fired in February, after New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, in a lawsuit, lambasted the company for failing to investigate and address the misconduct claims against Harvey Weinstein. Glasser’s lawyers have disputed his firing and said he “acted appropriately and responsibly whenever allegations of misconduct were brought to his attention.” \nBob Weinstein took nearly $6 million in compensation and other payments, while Glasser, the company’s former chief operating officer, took more than $4 million in the year before the March 19 bankruptcy filing, according to papers filed Tuesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. Some of the money that went to Bob Weinstein is listed as payments on a loan he made to the studio. Additionally, Bob Weinstein received more than $600,000 in expense reimbursements in the last four months of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T00:10:58.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
