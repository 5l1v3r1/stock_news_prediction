Abballa, who pledged allegiance to the militant group, was shot dead by commandos.\nThree men and three women, including the policewoman and her daughter, were detained on Monday to determine what role they may have played in the attack, the source said.\nThe policewoman was already interrogated in 2016 after hosting, at her daughterâ€™s request, a young woman monitored by police for suspected Islamist radicalization. Police officials found nothing then against the woman, who at the time was a local representative of a police union.\nReporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Ingrid Melander; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:38:35.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
