Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!” \nTrump on Thursday accused Amazon of not paying enough tax, making the postal system lose money and putting small retailers out of business. \nBut he offered no evidence to back up his criticisms and did not suggest any actions he would take.
