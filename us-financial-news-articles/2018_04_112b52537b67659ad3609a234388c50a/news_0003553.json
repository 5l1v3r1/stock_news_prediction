Marriott Chief Executive Arne Sorenson speaks during an interview with Reuters in a hotel in Berlin, March 3, 2015. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch \n“We would certainly like to pay less. We will have to see how the negotiations go,” Sorenson told Reuters on the sidelines of a press conference in Bengaluru. \nMarriott will be renegotiating contracts with major online bookers for the first time since its merger with Starwood in September 2016. \nSorensen said the first major renewal would be Expedia’s, with the current deal expiring later this year. \nThe Marriott chief was in India’s global outsourcing capital Bengaluru to open the company’s 100th hotel in the country. \nMarriott, which currently pays a commission of upwards of 10 percent to online travel agencies, is set to renegotiate its contract with Booking Holdings Inc ( BKNG.O ) sometime in 2019. \nOnline travel agencies currently contribute about 12 percent to Marriott’s overall bookings.
