But trading in digital currencies has come under scrutiny amid worries it could facilitate illegal fund flows and breed financial risks.\nAuthorities in China have taken several steps to crack down on the market, including closing exchanges and banning initial coin offerings - digital, token-based fundraising rounds.\nCryptocurrencies have seen extreme volatility, with bitcoin dropping more than 50 percent so far in 2018, as regulations get tighter in the wake of a $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck Inc earlier this year.\nCanaan started making its \"Avalon\" miners in 2013. Its main competitors include Beijing-based Bitmain, which makes the \"AntMiner\" series and has expanded globally.
