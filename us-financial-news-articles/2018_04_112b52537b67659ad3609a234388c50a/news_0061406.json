Excluding $1.6 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $138.3 million with an adjusted operating margin of 22.6 percent, up 80 basis points from the prior year period adjusted operating margin. Adjusted operating income drove adjusted EBITDA of $163.8 million which was 27 percent of sales and covered interest expense by 15 times.\nProvision for income taxes in the first quarter of 2018 of $31.2 million resulted in an effective tax rate (ETR) of 24.0 percent, which was lower than the prior year period ETR of 27.3 percent primarily due to the enactment of the 2017 tax reform. The first quarter 2018 ETR of 24.0 percent was higher than our previously guided ETR of 22.5 percent principally due to recent IRS interpretations of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nNet income was $99.0 million which resulted in EPS of $1.27. Excluding restructuring expenses, adjusted EPS of $1.29 increased 26 cents, or 25 percent, from prior year period adjusted EPS.\nCash from operations of $71.7 million led to free cash flow of $61.7 million, which was down 18 percent from the prior year period and 62 percent of adjusted net income. The decrease in free cash flow was primarily due to higher operating working capital, specifically receivables and inventory associated with timing of sales in the quarter and stronger than expected demand.\n“Organic order and revenue growth of 7 percent combined with solid execution drove a record first quarter for IDEX. First quarter results delivered all-time highs in orders, sales, operating income and EPS on top of the record fourth quarter we just experienced. We generated $20 million of backlog during the quarter led by organic order growth of 8 percent in HST and 7 percent in FMT. Adjusted operating margins expanded over 100 basis points across all three segments. We are very pleased with our organic growth over the past several quarters and remain committed to funding the best opportunities across the company. We are steadfast with our capital deployment strategy. M&A is a priority and we continue to have a strong acquisition funnel. Last week, the Board approved raising the dividend 16 percent which takes us towards the high end of our stated goal of distributing 30 to 35 percent of earnings to our shareholders. Based on our first quarter operating results and continued strength in order rates across the entire portfolio, we are raising our full year EPS and organic revenue guidance. We now expect full year 2018 adjusted EPS of $5.05 to $5.20 with projected second quarter EPS of $1.30 to $1.32, while delivering organic revenue growth of 5 to 6 percent for both the full year and the second quarter.” Andrew K. Silvernail Chairman and Chief Executive Officer First Quarter 2018 Segment Highlights\nFluid & Metering Technologies\nSales of $232.3 million reflected a 7 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 (+5 organic, -1 percent divestiture and +3 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $66.2 million resulted in an operating margin of 28.5 percent. Excluding $0.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $66.3 million with an adjusted operating margin of 28.5 percent, a 110 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives. EBITDA of $71.7 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 30.9 percent. Excluding $0.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $71.8 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.9 percent, a 90 basis point increase compared to the prior year period.\nHealth & Science Technologies\nSales of $221.1 million reflected an 11 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 (+6 percent organic, +1 percent acquisition and +4 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $51.8 million resulted in an operating margin of 23.4 percent. Excluding $1.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $52.9 million with an adjusted operating margin of 23.9 percent, a 120 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives, and up 160 basis points sequentially as operational challenges have subsided. EBITDA of $63.8 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 28.9 percent. Excluding $1.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $64.9 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.3 percent, a 110 basis point increase compared to the prior year period.\nFire & Safety/Diversified Products\nSales of $159.2 million reflected a 16 percent increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 (+9 percent organic and +7 percent foreign currency translation). Operating income of $39.6 million resulted in an operating margin of 24.8 percent. Excluding $0.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted operating income was $39.7 million with an adjusted operating margin of 24.9 percent, a 110 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher volume and productivity initiatives. EBITDA of $46.9 million resulted in an EBITDA margin of 29.5 percent. Excluding $0.1 million of restructuring expenses, adjusted EBITDA of $47.0 million resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.6 percent, a 320 basis point increase compared to the prior year period primarily due to transaction gains included within Other (income) expense.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Fluid & Metering Technologies contributed 38 percent of sales, 42 percent of operating income and 39 percent of EBITDA; Health & Science Technologies accounted for 36 percent of sales, 33 percent of operating income and 35 percent of EBITDA; and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products represented 26 percent of sales, 25 percent of operating income and 26 percent of EBITDA.\nCorporate Costs\nCorporate costs, excluding restructuring expenses, increased to $20.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $16.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of higher stock compensation, pension expense and outside consulting costs related to M&A and income taxes. Higher corporate costs in 2018 were the reason consolidated adjusted operating margins were only up 80 basis points even though each of the three segment adjusted operating margins expanded over 100 basis points.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nThe Company supplements certain U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics with non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics in order to provide investors with better insight and increased transparency while also allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the financial information used by management in its decision making. Reconciliations of non-U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics are defined and presented below and should not be considered a substitute for, nor superior to, the financial data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no adjustments to U.S. GAAP financial performance metrics other than the items noted below.\nOrganic orders and sales are calculated excluding amounts from acquired or divested businesses during the first twelve months of ownership or divestiture and the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusted operating income is calculated as operating income plus restructuring expenses. Adjusted operating margin is calculated as adjusted operating income divided by net sales. Adjusted net income is calculated as net income plus restructuring expenses, net of the statutory tax expense or benefit. EBITDA is calculated as net income plus interest expense plus provision for income taxes plus depreciation and amortization. We reconciled EBITDA to net income on a consolidated basis as we do not allocate consolidated interest expense or consolidated provision for income taxes to our segments. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA plus restructuring expenses. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures.\nTable 1: Reconciliation of the Change in Net Sales to Organic Net Sales\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 FMT HST FSDP IDEX Change in net sales 7 % 11 % 16 % 11 % - Net impact from acquisitions/divestitures (1 )% 1 % — % — % - Impact from FX 3 % 4 % 7 % 4 % Change in organic net sales 5 % 6 % 9 % 7 % Table 2: Reconciliations of Reported-to-Adjusted Operating Income and Margin (dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX Reported operating income (loss) $ 66,166 $ 51,806 $ 39,554 $ (20,843 ) $ 136,683 $ 57,813 $ 42,238 $ 32,626 $ (17,006 ) $ 115,671 + Restructuring expenses 143 1,059 100 340 1,642 1,566 3,028 73 130 4,797 Adjusted operating income (loss) $ 66,309 $ 52,865 $ 39,654 $ (20,503 ) $ 138,325 $ 59,379 $ 45,266 $ 32,699 $ (16,876 ) $ 120,468 Net sales (eliminations) $ 232,333 $ 221,075 $ 159,173 $ (257 ) $ 612,324 $ 216,770 $ 199,679 $ 137,447 $ (344 ) $ 553,552 Reported operating margin 28.5 % 23.4 % 24.8 % n/m 22.3 % 26.7 % 21.2 % 23.7 % n/m 20.9 % Adjusted operating margin 28.5 % 23.9 % 24.9 % n/m 22.6 % 27.4 % 22.7 % 23.8 % n/m 21.8 % Table 3: Reconciliations of Reported-to-Adjusted Net Income and EPS (in thousands, except EPS)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Reported net income $ 98,958 $ 75,899 + Restructuring expenses 1,642 4,797 + Tax impact on restructuring expenses (379 ) (1,529 ) Adjusted net income $ 100,221 $ 79,167 Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Reported diluted EPS $ 1.27 $ 0.99 + Restructuring expenses 0.02 0.06 + Tax impact on restructuring expenses — (0.02 ) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 1.29 $ 1.03 Diluted weighted average shares 77,739 76,894 Table 4: Reconciliations of EBITDA to Net Income (dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX Reported operating income (loss) $ 66,166 $ 51,806 $ 39,554 $ (20,843 ) $ 136,683 $ 57,813 $ 42,238 $ 32,626 $ (17,006 ) $ 115,671 - Other (income) expense - net 134 (597 ) (3,621 ) (365 ) (4,449 ) 30 143 36 (517 ) (308 ) + Depreciation and amortization 5,694 11,389 3,774 197 21,054 5,644 11,264 3,577 207 20,692 EBITDA 71,726 63,792\n46,949\n(20,281 )\n162,186 63,427 53,359 36,167 (16,282 ) 136,671 - Interest expense 11,000 11,552 - Provision for income taxes 31,174 28,528 - Depreciation and amortization 21,054 20,692 Reported net income\n$ 98,958 $ 75,899 Net sales (eliminations) $ 232,333 $ 221,075 $ 159,173 $ (257 ) $ 612,324 $ 216,770 $ 199,679 $ 137,447 $ (344 ) $ 553,552 Reported operating margin 28.5 % 23.4 % 24.8 % n/m 22.3 % 26.7 % 21.2 % 23.7 % n/m 20.9 % EBITDA margin 30.9 % 28.9 % 29.5 % n/m 26.5 % 29.3 % 26.7 % 26.3 % n/m 24.7 % Table 5: Reconciliations of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (dollars in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX FMT HST FSDP Corporate IDEX EBITDA $ 71,726 $ 63,792 $ 46,949 $ (20,281 ) $ 162,186 $ 63,427 $ 53,359 $ 36,167 $ (16,282 ) $ 136,671 + Restructuring expenses 143 1,059 100 340 1,642 1,566 3,028 73 130 4,797 Adjusted EBITDA $ 71,869 $ 64,851 $ 47,049 $ (19,941 ) $ 163,828 $ 64,993 $ 56,387 $ 36,240 $ (16,152 ) $ 141,468 Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 29.3 % 29.6 % n/m 26.8 % 30.0 % 28.2 % 26.4 % n/m 25.6 % Table 6: Reconciliations of Cash Flows from Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow (in thousands)\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 2017 Cash flow from operating activities $ 71,729 $ 84,979 $ 136,173 - Capital expenditures 10,009 10,162 15,804 Free cash flow $ 61,720 $ 74,817 $ 120,369 Conference Call to be Broadcast over the Internet\nIDEX will broadcast its first quarter earnings conference call over the Internet on Monday, April 30, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. CT.
