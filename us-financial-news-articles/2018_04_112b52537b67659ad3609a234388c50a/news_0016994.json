A company executive said during the call that subscribers are moving to a new C$50-plus rate plan from a historically lower value rate plan.\nTotal revenue from the wireless business doubled to C$209 million ($165.9 million) as the company added 93,500 post-paid subscribers, its highest to date.\n“This is the inflection point for wireless, and the business has entered a new phase of stronger multi-year growth,” Barclays analyst Phillip Huang said, upgrading the Canadian stock to “overweight” from “equalweight”.\nThe company said it added 89,702 net subscribers, up from 33,427 a year earlier.\nHowever, Shaw reported a net loss of C$164 million, or a loss of 33 Canadian cents per share, compared with a profit of C$147 million, or 30 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier due to C$417 million in charges related to its voluntary departure and restructuring programs.\nIn January, the company offered voluntary departure packages to its 6,500 employees. About 3,300 employees accepted the offer, the company said the following month.\nAdjusting for the charges, Shaw earned 50 Canadian cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 28 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose 12.4 percent to C$1.36 billion.\nThe company’s U.S.-listed shares were up 8.8 percent at $20.92.\n($1 = 1.2598 Canadian dollars)\nReporting by Ahmed Farhatha and Akshara P; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T19:24:46.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
