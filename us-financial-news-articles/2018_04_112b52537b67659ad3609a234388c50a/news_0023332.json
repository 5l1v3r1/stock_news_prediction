They sit in fifth place in the Western Conference going into their season finale at home against San Antonio on Wednesday.\nThe Spurs and Oklahoma City have the same record as New Orleans, which holds the head-to-head tiebreaker against the Thunder and leads the season series with San Antonio 2-1.\nThe Pelicans were the seventh team in the West to clinch a playoff spot. The remaining spot will go to the winner of the game between Denver and Minnesota on Wednesday night in Minneapolis.\nDavis led four Pelicans in double figures as they pulled away from the short-handed Clippers at the start of the second half. Nikola Mirotic had 24 points and a career-high 16 rebounds, E’Twaun Moore scored 19 and Ian Clark returned from a two-game absence caused to a sprained ankle to score 13 off the bench.\nThe Clippers (42-39), who were eliminated from the playoff race when they lost to Denver on Saturday, were without seven injured players Monday — Lou Williams, Austin Rivers, Danilo Gallinari, Patrick Beverley, Avery Bradley, Milos Teodosic and Jawun Evans.\nSindarius Thornwell scored 20, Montrezl Harrell had 15, Boban Marjanovic 12, Tobias Harris 11 and Tyrone Wallace and C.J.
