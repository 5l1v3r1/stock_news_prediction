Alexander Geiger/Shutterstock.com Good morning. Ransomware, phishing and financial pretexting continue to be among the most vexing cybersecurity problems facing organizations, according to the latest analysis from Verizon Communications\nRansomware attacks accounted for 39% of all malware-related data breaches in 2017, double the share in 2016, Verizon reported this week. Today’s attacks are causing more damage as they worm their way more deeply into critical information infrastructure systems, the report found . And social engineering attacks such as phishing or financial pretexting, the creation of a false narrative to get information or shape behavior, played a role in 98% of the incidents studied and 93% of breaches, the report said.\nCompanies reassessing their cyber risks and updating their defense and mitigation strategies can see from the data the importance of awareness training for employees to keep them from clicking on deceptive communications, said Laurance Dine, a managing principal of Verizon’s investigative response team. Firms need to be vigilant in staying current with security patches and routinely backing up data so they can maintain operations if attacked, he said.\nThe report analyzed data from more than 53,000 incidents in which information was compromised, compared with more than 42,000 in 2016. It looked at more than 2,200 breaches—cases resulting in a confirmed release of data to an unauthorized party—compared with more than 1,900 in 2016.\nImproving cyber awareness among employees involves, among other things, making sure they understand what information hackers are likely to target and what assets or systems they are seeking to penetrate, he said.\n“Awareness training needs to be happening continuously, not once a year [but maybe] once a quarter if not more, depending on where you work in the organization and what information you have access to,” said Mr. Dine. “People that have access to the crown jewels or to the money need to be on a serious awareness-training program. If a bad actor gets their credentials it is very easy for them to get valuable data out of the organization.”\nCompanies can and should make it hard work for hackers to get to their most valuable data, as this sometimes discourages less-sophisticated attackers who move to easier targets, said Mr. Dine. “Make them work for it,” he said.\nThe way social attacks are occurring changed slightly in the past year, as bad guys are becoming more proficient and are better able to access actual email credentials of executives, including those in the C-suite, said Mr. Dine.\nHackers in the past would alter a company’s email domain address name to send phishing emails in hopes employees would click and give them entry into the network. They now are gaining access to actual credentials of company executives, making it harder for an employee to know an email is fake, he said.\n“Once that person opens the document, the document asks for their credentials and the person puts them in. Then the bad actor has that user’s email account, as well,” said Mr. Dine. “Eventually they get to somebody with power, somebody who can [authorize a] payment or, if they get lucky they might get the chief executive or the chief financial officer. That way they can really cause damage.”\nCOMPLIANCE \nOpposition to tariffs expands. The business coalition opposing plans for tariffs on Chinese goods has doubled to 107 trade groups, ranging from such heavyweights as the National Retail Federation to such smaller local groups as the San Diego Customs Brokers Association, the WSJ reports.\nChinese politician pleads guilty.
