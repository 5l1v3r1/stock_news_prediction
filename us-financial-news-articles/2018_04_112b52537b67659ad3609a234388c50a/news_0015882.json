A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favour and no vetoes by Russia, China, France, Britain or the United States to pass.\n“Hugely disappointing that Russia vetoed the proposal at the UN for an independent investigation into Syrian chemical attacks,” Johnson said on Twitter.\n“Russia is holding the Syrian people to political ransom by supporting a regime responsible for at least four heinous chemical attacks against its people.”\nReporting by Kate Holton, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:25:39.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
