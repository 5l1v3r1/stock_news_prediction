Safra Sarasin Group for 20-23 million Swiss francs ($21-24 million).\nFILE PHOTO: A man enters the main branch of Bank Hapoalim, Israel's biggest bank, in Tel Aviv, Israel July 18, 2016. REUTERS/Amir Cohen/File Photo Hapoalim said on Thursday it expects the deal to be completed in 2018 pending regulatory approvals.\nThe bank last year decided to end its activities in Switzerland, which have been the focus of a U.S. investigation.\nU.S. authorities are investigating whether Hapoalim helped American clients evade U.S. taxes at its Swiss unit. The bank has already set aside a provision of close to $350 million.\nReporting by Steven Scheer; Editing by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:17:26.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
