Uber Technologies Inc. is shuttering the same-day parcel and package delivery service called Rush that former chief executive Travis Kalanick once touted as a pillar in a future Uber “urban logistics network.” The WSJ’s Greg Bensinger writes that the company started the operation in New York City and quickly expanded to San Francisco and Chicago—cities dense with high-income consumers—connecting Uber drivers and messengers with retailers for rapid delivery of goods. But the business never expanded after that. Now, its shutdown following the recent shuttering of packaging and delivery startup Shyp shows the hurdles the new generation of digital-driven operators face pushing into the courier and parcel market by catering to retail consumers.\nThe volleys in a trans-Pacific trade war are starting to fly. China imposed its promised tariffs on a range of U.S. goods starting today, the WSJ’s Charles Hutzler reports, following through on a promise to retaliate against American penalties on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum . Beijing says the tariffs would hit a range on U.S. imports, ranging from 25% on American pork and eight other kinds of goods to 15% on fruit and 120 types of commodities. At the same time, China’s finance ministry suggested its response is designed to be limited and doesn’t seek to escalate tensions. Beijing has promised retaliatory measures if the Trump administration follows through on tough trade talk. Soybeans and other products from American farm states are high on the list of potential targets, as well as other big-ticket U.S. goods like Boeing Co. aircraft.\nShippers howl pretty loudly when freight rail service stinks, but they’ve got nothing on residents of rural Alabama. People across the region have been complaining about the transport of treated sewage from New York City to a landfill in Adamsville, Ala., for the last 18 months, a flow of shipments that fill the air with an odiferous reminder that there’s more to the Big Apple than Times Square and Broadway shows. The WSJ’s Valerie Bauerlein and Kate King write the jeers have grown since a train with 200 shipping containers of the sludge got stalled over a legal dispute some six weeks ago, leaving the contents rotting and emitting a foul and inescapable stench. Intermodal solutions have gone nowhere, as parties fight over the legality of trucking the containers the last 25 miles to the landfill. It’s a pungent and growing problem: As urban populations grow, cities are weighing how to dispose of the one thing they are certain each city will continue creating.\nE-COMMERCE Photo: Bloomberg News Epidemic change is underway in hospital-focused medical supply chains. The early-stage deal talks between Walmart Inc. and Humana Inc. mark the latest sign of consolidation that’s taken in distributors, pharmacy operators and benefits managers. The shifting landscape is triggering deepening anxiety in the hospital sector, the WSJ’s Melanie Evans reports, where operators have been grappling with sluggish growth and competition from cheaper health-care options. Hospitals have been eyeing Walmart nervously for years as it advances into health care, seeking to leverage its enormous purchasing heft, physical reach and focus on price. The bigger goal for Walmart is to give shoppers another reason to visit the retailer’s cavernous locations even as they buy more online. Hospital officials worry that the gains for Walmart will come at their expense.\nAmazon.com Inc. carries outsize weight in digital sales, and new attention from the White House raises new questions of whether that scale eliminates competition. President Donald Trump put a harsh eye on the e-commerce giant with a series of Twitter posts that continued over the weekend , and the WSJ’s Laura Stevens writes the comments are reviving investor concerns that antitrust action could be brought against Amazon. Policy experts say targeting Amazon on anticompetition grounds would face a difficult path. The $178 billion company has about 43% of the U.S. e-commerce market, but that still amounts to less than 4% of total U.S. retail sales. Amazon’s expanding logistics role may add wrinkles to any reading on its impact on markets, with its moves to control more of its shipping and transportation assets, and to sell the logistics services to customers, bringing a stronger grip on both sales and distribution channels.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We probably have to wait until after the election, which isn’t that long. ’\n—President Donald Trump, on his infrastructure plan .\nNumber of the Day 13.6% Year-over-year increase in value of freight moving between the U.S. and Mexico in January by truck, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\nIN OTHER NEWS Canada’s economy contracted 0.1% from December to January .
