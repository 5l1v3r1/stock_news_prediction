(OTC:ACOL) is pleased to announce the purchase of the entire intellectual property portfolio for their signature product, the MedTainer™. The purchase includes both the U.S. design and utility patents, patents-pending in the European Union, international trademarks, domain names and all manufacturing processes and licenses, including molds, casts, patterns and forms. These properties, previously held by Polymation LLC, will enable the company to move forward with Acology’s plan to expand its growing operation and enable it to begin developing new products based on the unique engineering principles that have made the MedTainer so successful. Acology’s public portfolio also expands considerably with this acquisition.\nThe acquisition of the intellectual property catalog took nearly a year to negotiate with final execution of the agreement April 14, 2018.\n“It’s most gratifying to say the least, to complete an acquisition that provides such significant benefit to the Company and our shareholders,” says Acology CEO, Curt Fairbrother. “This acquisition is consistent with our aggressive expansion into the Californian and Canadian markets where beneficial legislation may soon pass. Armed with this expansive Intellectual Property portfolio, we can now begin to really concentrate on penetration into markets that we have identified as underserved.”\n“We believe we have an indispensable product for not one, but two, rapidly expanding industries in the rapidly growing legal marijuana marketplace,” added Acology’s Chief Operating Officer, Doug Heldoorn. “Our intention has always been to become a truly global enterprise and I believe this purchase is a significant catalyst to that objective.”\nFor investor or sales information please visit Acology Inc. and D&C Distributors online or by phone.
