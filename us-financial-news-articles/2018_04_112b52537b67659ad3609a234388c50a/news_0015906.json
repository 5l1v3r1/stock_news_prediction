See Breakingviews: \nB. Riley analyst Christopher Van Horn said the Federal-Mogul deal could drive expectations of more consolidation in the sector. \nTenneco’s shares rose 5.8 percent to $58.78, while Icahn Enterprises’ ( IEP.O ) shares were up 2.7 percent at $61.29. \n“Going to market with well-recognized brands, more product categories, greater coverage and expanded distribution capabilities is a strong formula for capturing growth, particularly in China,” Tenneco Executive Chairman Gregg Sherrill said on the call. \nIcahn Enterprises will get $800 million cash and 29.5 million of Tenneco common shares in the deal. \n\nFILE PHOTO: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The equity value of the deal is $2.4 billion. Federal-Mogul, which makes powertrain parts including pistons, ignition coils and spark plugs, had gross debt of $3.1 billion. \nIt was not clear if Icahn would hold stakes in the separate companies. \nHe first bought convertible bonds in Federal-Mogul in 2001 for $1.1 billion, and finally took it private last year after buying the remaining 18 percent he did not already own. \nIcahn’s firm Icahn Enterprises ( IEP.O ) typically buys undervalued assets, improves their operations, and ultimately sells them at a profit. \n“We expect to be meaningful stockholders of Tenneco going forward,” Icahn said in a statement. \nThe deal is expected to generate $200 million in annual earnings and $250 million in working capital. \nLake Forest, Illinois-based Tenneco, whose customers include Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), would now also get Cummins Inc ( CMI.N ) and luxury carmaker Jaguar as clients. \nBarclays was the lead financial adviser to Tenneco, while J.P.Morgan was the M&A adviser. \nReporting by Arunima Banerjee and Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Joe White,; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T14:45:42.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
