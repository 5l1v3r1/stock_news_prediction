Its production fell to a third of what they were a year ago.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 6 Canadian cents per share, while analysts had expected a loss of 1 Canadian cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet earnings were C$55 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of C$18 million, or 5 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.\nEarnings were helped by a C$49 million gain on the restructuring of its Inkai joint venture with Kazakhstan.\nRevenue rose to C$439 million from C$393 million.
