[0827 EDT] \n- Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL! [0956 EDT] \n- Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA. NEED WALL! [1025 EDT] \n- These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act! [1028 EDT]", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T05:45:51.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
