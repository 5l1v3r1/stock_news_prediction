It (the decision on investment) is going to be 2019.”\nGold Fields produced 2.16 million ounces of gold last year but profit fell 4 percent as it struggled to resolve operational issues at its underground mine in South Africa, South Deep.\nThe company is also investing in a new mine in Australia and upgrades at mines in Ghana and Peru.\nAssuming the Salares Norte project gets the go-ahead, Cardenas said he expected production to begin around 2021 and quickly achieve target output of 345,000 ounces of gold a year.\n“We expect to be at that level of production during the first year or entering the next year. It could be higher,” he said.\nThe financing of the project had not been finalized, he added.\n“It’s still open how to structure that. There is no clear resolution - it could be a JV (joint venture) or any alternative.”\nReporting by Peter Hobson, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:23:32.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
