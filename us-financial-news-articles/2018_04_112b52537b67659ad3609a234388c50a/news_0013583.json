State utility Sonelgaz still needs aid despite a 20 percent power price increase two years ago, the first in more than a decade.\nDemand for electricity has risen significantly in recent years due to infrastructure projects aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil and gas.\nAlgeria has also been building thousands of subsidised housing units and connecting them to the power grid.\nTo boost power output, the government plans to invite bids for the construction of three photovoltaic solar plants with a capacity of 4,000 megawatts, officials said.\nIn an effort to save power, the state electricity company has started to replace public lighting in some towns and roads under an energy-efficiency programme.\nOfficials say measures may also include higher electricity prices for firms in the next few years.\n“Everyone must comply with rationalisation, especially in administrative and public buildings, social housing, schools and mosques as well as with public lighting,” Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni said at a conference.\nTo hammer home the message, state television has launched campaigns urging people to reduce consumption. It is also promoting solar water heaters, energy-saving lamps and thermal insulation in the housing sector.\nBut analysts say making some appliances available may need additional spending as Algeria imports most of its needs.
