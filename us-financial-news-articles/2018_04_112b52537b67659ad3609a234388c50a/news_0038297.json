I’m sorry, I’m done being bullied.”\nDaniels repeated her story, first related on CBS’ “60 Minutes” last month, that she was on her way to a fitness class with her child when an unknown man approached her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011. He warned her to “leave Trump alone. Forget the story”, she said in that interview.\nOn Tuesday, her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, asked the public for help identifying the man and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his identification.\nThe picture they released shows a lightly bearded man in his 20s or 30s with backswept hair and wearing a hoodie. Daniels said she thought he looked like somebody’s husband and described him as “sort of handsome.”\nShe said she did not tell police about the threat at the time because she was afraid and did not want to reveal the alleged encounter with Trump.\n“I didn’t tell my husband at the time, I was embarrassed,” she said. “I didn’t want him to think I was a bad mom or that I put my daughter in danger.”\nTrump’s lawyers are seeking at least $20 million in damages from Daniels for multiple violations of a nondisclosure agreement.\nDaniels appearance on the ABC show came a day after she attended a hearing in Manhattan federal court where Cohen sought to limit the ability of federal prosecutors to review the documents seized in April 9 raids on his home, office and hotel room.\nThe raids stem in part from a separate probe into possible collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. A source familiar with the raids said the FBI agents were also looking for information on payments to Daniels among materials related to Cohen’s other business dealings.\nDaniels acknowledged the publicity the whole episode has brought her and said that, while she was making more money, her expenses were climbing as well. She has had to retain a team of bodyguards, as well as a tutor for her daughter.\nAdult-film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, arrives at ABC studios with her attorney Michael Avenatti (L) to appear on The View talk show in New York City, New York, U.S. April 17, 2018.
