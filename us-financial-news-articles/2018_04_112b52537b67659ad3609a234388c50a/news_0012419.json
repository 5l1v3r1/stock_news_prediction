The company said in October that upfront capital costs for development of the mine totalled $630 million and that it was in advanced talks with Chinese lenders who could finance 85 percent of it.\nSince winning the general election in 2015, the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) has introduced many regulatory changes, prompting some investors to take legal action against the government.\nPrairie, in its lawsuit, demanded that the mining usufruct agreement be signed so that it can still have the exclusive right to apply for the mining concession.\nIt said a Polish civil court could enforce the agreement in place of the ministry.\nA spokesman for the environment ministry was not immediately available to comment.\nJan Karski, situated in an area neighbouring the state-run Bogdanka coal mine, would produce semi-soft coking coal.\nPoland generates most of its electricity from coal, produced mostly by state-run mining companies, which survived a slump in coal prices thanks to state aid in 2016.\nIn October U.S. company Invenergy LLC, which says it has spent more than $600 million building windfarms in Poland, said it was formally in dispute with the Polish government over state companies failing to honour contracts.\nReporting by Agnieszka Barteczko; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T19:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:09:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
