Guggenheim has said the two have only a business relationship. \nABS drew attention partly for its purchases of one property in Malibu, California, and another two in Pacific Palisades. Court lives in one of the homes, the Journal reported. She did not respond to a request for comment. \nIn a statement on Sunday, a spokesman for ABS said it did not borrow any money from the Guggenheim subsidiary, Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, “in connection with the financing of those homes, or for any other purpose.” Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Michelle Price; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Jennifer Ablan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T22:51:39.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
