It is when we see it and analyse it that we will officially respond.”\nFuel subsidies are a contentious issue in Nigeria, where prices are kept artificially low at 145 naira ($0.48) per litre, often as a populist tool.\nThat has meant that as fuel prices increase globally, it has become unprofitable for private petrol marketers to import, forcing NNPC to step in to prevent major shortages.\nHowever, state oil firm money spent on subsidies is meant to be included in Nigeria’s national budget, subject to approval by the national assembly.\nIn December and January, a run on petrol amid rumours of a price increase created queues lasting hours at filling stations around the country.
