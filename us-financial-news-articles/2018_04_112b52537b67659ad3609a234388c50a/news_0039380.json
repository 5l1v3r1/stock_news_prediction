The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell 12.4 basis points in March.\n“We believe longer-end U.S. dynamics are much more important for Asia rates performance,” said Nomura in a report.\nThe brokerage said it doesn’t expect the current global rate environment to affect Asian bond markets in the near term as the normalization of the Fed and ECB is set to continue gradually.\nReporting by Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:32:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
