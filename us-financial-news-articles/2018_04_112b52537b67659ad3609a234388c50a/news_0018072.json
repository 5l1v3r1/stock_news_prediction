Galaxy and Leisure were not immediately available for comment outside office hours.\nThe Philippines’ gambling sector has benefited from warmer ties with China, a key source of wealthy gamblers, since the Southeast Asian country set aside territorial hostility with Beijing in exchange for pledges of loans and investments.\nThe provisional licence is only the start of a long process that will allow Galaxy to start operations, the Philippines’ gaming regulator said in a statement on Wednesday.\nThe companies have yet to submit documentary requirements such as proof of land ownership and a detailed project plan, it added.\nThe Philippines is looking to shorten the closure period for Boracay to four months from six, the tourism minister said. The island’s closure highlights the growing pressures on beach resorts across Southeast Asia as infrastructure buckles under mass tourism.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:05:18.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
