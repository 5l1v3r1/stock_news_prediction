This is my second time in Germany — I’m not here for the clay, it’s more the shopping. I didn’t come out here to play and lose.”\nHalep came back from a set down against Slovakia’s Rybarikova in their second round match.\nThe 26-year-old Romanian relied on her ferocious groundstrokes to secure a decisive break in the sixth game of the final set and went on to book a spot in the quarter-finals.\nFormer world number one Angelique Kerber avenged last weekend’s Fed Cup defeat to collect a 6-3 6-2 win over Czech Petra Kvitova in a first round match.\nThe German will meet Anett Kontaveit in the last-16 after the Estonian saved two match points to knock out last year’s runner-up Kristina Mladenovic 5-7 7-6(3) 7-6(5).\nRussian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova battled past U.S. Open runner-up Madison Keys 7-6(7) 5-7 6-4. The 26-year-old will take on second-seed Garbine Muguruza in the second round.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T22:28:49.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
