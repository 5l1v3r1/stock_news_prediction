Or it might be able to remember when you last ordered toilet paper and that it's time to order more.\nSarikaya discussed other features, like \"Context Carryover,\" which means you can ask Alexa \"What's Bruce Springsteen's first album?\" and then follow that question up with a statement like \"Play it now,\" after she provides an answer. This sort of functionality is already available from Google Assistant.\nSarikaya said Amazon Alexa will also soon be able to dip into \"skills,\" which typically need to be installed by users, to provide information. \"I recently asked: 'Alexa, how do I remove an oil stain from my shirt?' She replied: 'Here is Tide Stain Remover,'\" Sarikaya said, as an example.\nSarikaya's comments show how important Alexa is becoming for Amazon's business, and how it's not only an assistant but a primary means by which people consume and shop on Amazon.\nWATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping — here's how big its become show chapters Amazon is so much more than online shopping — here's how big its become 9:00 AM ET Sat, 14 April 2018 | 03:56", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:36:38.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
