He also owns the distinction of being the last U.S. amateur champion never to have turned professional. \nIt was as a competitor at the Masters where he met Clifford Roberts, Augusta National’s first chairman, and has been associated with each of the club’s chairmen since. \nRidley, who works as a lawyer, became a member at Augusta National in 2000 and began serving as chairman of the Tournament’s Competition Committees in 2007. \n“I read a lot in the past few months about things our founders said about really what our role and obligation was in the game of golf, and it’s been a consistent theme and part of our culture that we have an obligation to give back to the game,” Ridley said. \n“Originally that was through, exclusively through, the Masters Tournament. In more recent years, again, with the ability we have to do that, we have done a lot more. \n“And I think really it really goes back to the founders’ belief that Augusta National and the Masters had an obligation to contribute back to the game, and we’re going to continue to do that.” \nRidley already made good on his promise by announcing that Augusta National will host a women’s amateur championship the   \n“I   said Ridley. “I   golf. They’re not really very good players, but they all love the game.
