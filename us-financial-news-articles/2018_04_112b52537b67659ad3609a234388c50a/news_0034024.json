The unnamed people under suspicion include a member of the Porsche management board and a senior Porsche manager.\nPorsche confirmed to Fortune that investigators “inspected and secured documents at the offices of Porsche AG in Stuttgart and Audi AG in Ingolstadt.”\nAudi AG and Porsche AG are cooperating fully with the investigating authorities, a spokesman said in an emailed statement.\nThe diesel emissions scandal broke in 2015 when it was revealed that Volkswagen Group’s so-called “Clean Diesel” vehicles were really a hoax. Volkswagen had pinned its U.S. sales strategy on vehicles with this clean diesel technology.\nIn reality, about 580,000 VWs in the U.S. and almost 10.5 million more worldwide, weren’t even close to achieving the emissions standards and fuel efficiency that Volkswagen had advertised. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued a “notice of violation” in September 2015 that the automaker used illegal software in certain diesel engines to circumvent emissions laws. The software was programmed to recognize when the car was being tested for emissions and take actions to mask the levels spewing from its exhaust. Once testing was over, the vehicle would revert to sending illegal levels of nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere.\nThe raids follow a recent management shakeup and restructuring at Volkswagen Group that included the ouster of CEO Matthias Mueller. Herbert Diess, who was the head of the Volkswagen brand , was picked as VW Group’s next CEO. Oliver Blume, the head of the Porsche brand, was added to VW Group’s management board as part of the changes.\nVolkswagen Group will be organized into six business areas, with the truck and bus division to be prepared for a potential stand-alone stock listing. The company’s different auto brands, which include Volkswagen, Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, and Porsche, will be grouped into volume, premium, and super-premium segments. And Rupert Stadler, the head of Audi who has been plagued by his company’s role in the diesel scandal, will be responsible for group sales.", "external_links": ["https://www.ft.com/content/b422c298-4300-11e8-803a-295c97e6fd0b"], "published": "2018-04-19T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T23:01:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
