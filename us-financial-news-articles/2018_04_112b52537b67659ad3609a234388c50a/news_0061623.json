That matched expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.\nThe increase in spending reflects some renewed momentum after a slowdown earlier this year when expenditures edged up 0.2% in January and were flat in February. This earlier pullback came after strong holiday spending coupled with hurricane-induced purchases in the fourth quarter.\nConsumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic output, making it a key driver of the economy.\nGrowing worker paychecks also likely helped propel March’s spending gains.\nPersonal income, reflecting Americans’ pretax earnings from salaries and investments, rose 0.3% in March. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal forecast income grew 0.4%.\nDisposable personal income, or after-tax income, also rose 0.3% on the month in March.\nMeanwhile, consumers saved less. The personal saving rate in March was 3.1%, compared with 3.3% in February.\nWhile low unemployment and signs of rising wages bode well for consumer spending in the months ahead, Americans’ paychecks might not go as far, given rising inflation.\nThe price index for personal consumption expenditures, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, was up 2.0% from a year earlier but was flat from February. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.2% in March, matching economists’ expectations. Core inflation was up 1.9% in March from a year earlier.\nThe Federal Reserve targets 2% year-over-year inflation and has been raising short-term interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Stronger underlying price gains could encourage the Fed to be slightly more aggressive in lifting its interest rates in an effort to keep inflation in check.\nWrite to Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com and Harriet Torry at harriet.torry@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:27:54.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
