In addition at the plate, he singled, walked and reached on an error while bunting.\nRyan Madson earned his first save of the season by getting the final two outs in the ninth.\nMike Foltynewicz (1-1) gave up the two-run triple and three hits in the first inning for the Braves, who couldn’t muster much offense against Strasburg. Foltynewicz wound up yielding three runs (two earned) on five hits and two walks. He fanned three.\nWashington got its offense going starting in the first when Brian Goodwin walked and moved to second on Bryce Harper’s one-out single.\nBoth of them scored when Zimmerman lined a two-out triple to left-center for a 2-0 lead.\nGoodwin, who replaced late scratch Adam Eaton in the Washington lineup in left field, made it 3-0 with an RBI single in the fourth.\nThe Nationals stretched the lead to 4-0 with some help from Atlanta in the sixth. Washington had runners on first and third with one out when Strasburg laid down a sacrifice bunt on which pitcher Shane Carle made a throwing error, letting in a run.\nDansby Swanson hit an RBI double off Madson in the top of the ninth for Atlanta’s first run of the series.\nEaton was in the original Washington lineup Tuesday, but manager Dave Martinez scratched him for the second straight game due to a left ankle bone bruise. Eaton injured his ankle against the Mets last Thursday.\nWashington also brought back catcher Miguel Montero from the paternity list Tuesday and put fellow catcher Jhonatan Solano on the 10-day disabled list due to bone spurs in his right elbow. Starting catcher Matt Wieters (oblique strain) also could return from the DL this week.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:23:49.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
