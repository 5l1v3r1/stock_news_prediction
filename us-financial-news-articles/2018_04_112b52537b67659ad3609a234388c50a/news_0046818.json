There had been some debate about whether authorities would allow it to run because of technicalities.\nPresident Tayyip Erdogan’s decision this week to bring the polls forward by more than a year wrongfooted Turkey’s troubled opposition. His most credible challenge is seen coming from Meral Aksener, the former interior minister who last year founded the nationalist Iyi (Good) Party.\nReporting by Irem Koca and Tuvan Gumrukcu; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Dale Hudson\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T00:25:27.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
