REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \nHarry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and younger brother of Prince William, will marry Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the TV series “Suits”, at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. \nThe wedding guests will be people who have an existing direct relationship with the groom or the bride or with both, said a source at Kensington palace, the official residence of William and Harry. \nAn official spokesman for the palace said: “It has been decided that an official list of political leaders – both UK and international – is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s wedding. Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by The Royal Household.” \nThe Telegraph newspaper and other British national media said U.S. President Donald Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama had not been invited. The palace spokesman declined to comment. \nThere had been some speculation that the Obamas might be invited due to the personal rapport between the former president and Harry, but it would have been diplomatically awkward to invite the Obamas and not the Trumps. \nAlthough the royal family is expected to steer well clear of politics, Britain’s delicate constitutional balance means that its members have to consult discreetly with the government to ensure their public actions comply with foreign policy. \nThe British government source said there had been no expectation from May’s office that the prime minister would be invited. \nThe government source noted that the wedding venue was significantly smaller than Westminster Abbey, where Harry’s older brother wed Kate Middleton in 2011 in the presence of numerous heads of government.
