Two batters earlier, Ahmed delivered the game-tying double as Jake Lamb scored on a headfirst slide.\nMathis’ hit occurred more than two hours after Chris Owings hit a three-run, game-tying homer with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off Kenley Jansen.\nJansen was one strike away from closing out a 6-3 victory, but he issued consecutive walks to Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock. On the next pitch, Owings sent a cutter soaring into the left field seats.\nSix innings later, Arizona recorded its seventh consecutive regular-season win over the Dodgers when Mathis capped the 5-hour, 46-minute marathon.\nIn the top of the 15th, Chase Utley gave the Dodgers a 7-6 lead with an RBI single off Fernando Salas (1-1), who subsequently retired Logan Forsythe on a popup. Salas pitched three innings and was Arizona’s seventh reliever.\nFont tossed four scoreless innings before he was beaten in the bottom of the 15th.\nThe Dodgers carried a 6-3 lead into the ninth thanks to big hits by Yasmani Grandal and Forsythe.\nGrandal fell a triple shy of the cycle and capped a three-run first inning off Taijuan Walker with a two-run homer. Forsythe gave Los Angeles a 4-3 lead with a homer in the sixth off Yoshihisa Hirano.\nCody Bellinger, Corey Seager and Joc Pederson added RBI singles for the Dodgers, who totaled 19 hits but stranded 19. Bellinger finished 4-for-7.\nPollock hit an RBI double, Ketel Marte had a run-scoring triple and Lamb drew a bases-loaded walk for Arizona.\nLos Angeles right-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu allowed three runs, five hits and five walks in 3 2/3 innings.\nWalker gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings.\nThe Dodgers took a 1-0 lead eight pitches in as Seager lined a single up the middle. Los Angeles extended its lead to 3-0 in the first inning when Grandal slugged a 2-1 fastball over the right-center-field fence.\nArizona got a run back on Pollock’s double to left field with two outs in the first and made it a one-run game on a bases-loaded walk by Lamb with two outs in the third. The Diamondbacks tied the game when Marte tripled to center field and knocked out Ryu in the fourth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:18:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
