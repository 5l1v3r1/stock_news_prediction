If there are bans I think you may worry about the signal (it sends),” said Helbling, suggesting it could deter overseas firms planning to invest here.\nReporting by Charlotte Greenfield and Colin Packham; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T05:05:41.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
