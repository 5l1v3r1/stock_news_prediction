Trump World Golf Club Dubai, a second golf project planned by DAMAC, is expected to open by the end of 2018.\nDubai’s real estate prices, hit by new supply, could decline by 10 to 15 percent over the next two years, after falling by 5 to 10 percent in 2017, according to S&P estimates.\nThe real estate slump hit Dubai’s top property developers such as Emaar Properties and DAMAC, which in its latest financial results showed a nearly 47 percent plunge in net profit for last year’s fourth quarter.\nThe company will meet bond investors in Asia, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom from April 5, the document showed. A senior unsecured sukuk offering will follow, subject to market conditions.\nOn Tuesday, DAMAC also invited holders of its existing $650 million sukuk due in 2019 to tender those notes for purchase by the company for cash.\nIt did the same last year, when it raised $500 million in sukuk arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Emirates NBD Capital, HSBC and VTB Capital. Just before that bond sale, DAMAC bought back around $198 million of its $650 million sukuk maturing in 2019.\nReporting by Davide Barbuscia; editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T06:26:08.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
