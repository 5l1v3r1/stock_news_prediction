Major food and drink companies turn to contract manufacturers such as Hearthside to cut production costs and boost their profitability.\nThe consortium of Partners Group and Charlesbank outbid other private equity firms in the auction for Hearthside, and is negotiating final terms with the company’s existing owners, Vestar Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s ( GS.N ) private equity arm, the sources said.\nPartners Group and Charlesbank have agreed to pay the equivalent of about 11 times Hearthside’s 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, the sources added.\nIf the negotiations are completed successfully, a deal could be announced as early as Monday, the sources added, cautioning there was always a possibility that talks fall apart at the last minute.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deal discussions are confidential. Vestar and Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while representatives for Partners Group, Charlesbank and Hearthside did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nHearthside produces baked foods and snacks, including energy bars, cookies and pretzels, out of 24 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe for the world’s premier food companies, according to its website.\nThe company, based in Downers Grove, Illinois, was created in 2009 by private equity firm Wind Point Partners and Rich Scalise, a former Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products president and veteran of ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ). Scalise now serves as Hearthside’s chairman and chief executive officer.\nGoldman Sachs and Vestar acquired Hearthside for $1.1 billion from Wind Point in 2014. Hearthside has since acquired other companies, including Standard Function Foods Group last year.\nReporting by Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T02:04:27.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
