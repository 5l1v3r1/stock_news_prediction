Fares would go up.”\nAirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia Bhd, placed a firm order for 10 A350s in June 2009. It later ordered 66 A330neos, an updated version of the A330s it has in its current fleet.\nThe A350-900 has a longer range but also comes with a higher list price of $317.4 million, compared with the $296.4 million price of the A330-900neo. Airlines typically receive large discounts from the list prices.\nThe AirAsia group is one of Airbus’ largest customers, but it has also been talking to Boeing Co about buying the rival 787-10 jet, according to a source familiar with the discussions.\nA final decision on AirAsia X’s future fleet is expected later this year, the source said on condition of anonymity. The 787-10 has a list price of $325.8 million.\nA spokeswoman for the AirAsia group did not have any immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.
