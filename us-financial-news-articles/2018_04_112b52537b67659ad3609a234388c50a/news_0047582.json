Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.\nOur computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.\nIn order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.\nPORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES\n% Leased by Location March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Boston 94.8 % 94.1 % Los Angeles and San Francisco 89.0 % 89.3 % New York 86.3 % 86.9 % Washington, DC 90.6 % 91.3 % Total Portfolio 90.5 % 90.7 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006653/en/\nBoston Properties\nMichael LaBelle, 617-236-3352\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nor\nArista Joyner, 617-236-3343\nInvestor Relations Manager\nSource: Boston Properties, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006653/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51794304&newsitemid=20180424006653&lan=en-US&anchor=www.bostonproperties.com&index=3&md5=b1ca77cd84ea3d76ddfca90b712d0e2c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51794304&newsitemid=20180424006653&lan=en-US&anchor=www.bostonproperties.com&index=2&md5=6b3b9b148fb1471153b05b564c793519", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonproperties.com&esheet=51794304&newsitemid=20180424006653&lan=en-US&anchor=Boston+Properties%2C+Inc.&index=1&md5=f050067084e4f269076aa6fbd3f89225"], "published": "2018-04-25T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T03:56:00.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
