We have also focused on domestic acquisitions and global partnerships to expand our network, broaden our service portfolio and scale up our business\" said Jerry He, Bright Scholar's Chief Executive Officer.\n\"This is a very exciting time of the year for Bright Scholar as we celebrate the outstanding achievements of our students. As of April 15, 2018, 90% of our 2018 graduating students participating in AP, A Level and DP programs have received over 700 offers from global top 50 institutions. As of the release date, there are three offers from Oxford and Cambridge and 22 offers from US top 30 educational institutions, including the University of Chicago, Cornell University, UC Berkley, UCLA, Vanderbilt University, Rice University and NYU.\"\n\"We are pertinacious in our efforts to support the aspirations of our students in achieving outstanding academic results and ultimately admission to top institutions of their choosing. In this quarter, we have also made significant headway through two important strategic initiatives. Firstly, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") to acquire 75% equity interests of Foundation Global Education (\"FGE\") to our expand portfolio of complementary education services. FGE is a thriving private global education consulting company with headquarters in Hong Kong and offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen covering a broad range of national clientele. FGE has a strong team of associate counselors who implement a proven and unique approach that helps students from the ages of three to 18 to identify, apply to and gain admission into desirable overseas boarding schools and universities. In the 2018 application season, FGE's students received 170 offers from 115 overseas high schools including US top 25 boarding schools. Secondly, through Can-Achieve, Bright Scholar has entered into strategic partnership with Shorelight Education (\"Shorelight\") to broaden access to top US universities for students from our international schools. Shorelight is a renowned education service provider based in Boston with partner universities including top 100 US universities that covers over 1,870 programs. Our students are only required to take an online test \"iTep,\" implemented at Bright Scholar's international schools, instead of TOEFL or IELTS to gain admission to Shorelight's partner universities.\"\n\"Furthermore, we have enhanced our enrollment marketing capabilities by acquiring 51.67% equity interests of Guangzhou Zangxing Network Technology Co. Ltd. (\"Zangxing\") to support our expanding network. Zangxing is a Guangzhou-based education technology company and provides, through its online platform and APP 'Shangxue Bang,' consulting services on schools selection for students aged from three to 18. It also has an online enrollment marketing platform, which has over 1.2 million registered users as of the date of this release.\"\n\"Amid the seasonality in the second fiscal quarter and rapid network expansion with 53% or 33 schools still in ramp-up stage, our revenue in the first half of fiscal 2018 has increased 22% year-over-year. The percentage increase in the average student enrollment was higher by 17.2% year-over-year to 34,251 for the first half of fiscal 2018 with blended utilization at 60.4%. As of February 28, 2018, there are 35,412 students enrolled in our schools.\"\nMr. He concluded, \"Our investment in our schools, brand, students, people, service offerings and capacities is significant, which sets up the stage for accelerated future growth. The additional capital from the successful follow-on offering earlier this year enables us to continue these investments which are critical building blocks of our growth strategy and for establishing Bright Scholar as the leader in the global premium schools market. While continuing to invest in our future, we remain entirely focused on the core financial disciplines to support the success of our students and drive long term shareholder value.\"\nUNAUDITED FINANCIAL RESULTS of the Fiscal Quarter ended February 28, 2018\nRevenues\nRevenue for the second fiscal quarter was RMB323.1 million, representing a 20.6% increase from RMB268.0 million in the same period of last fiscal year.\nThe table below sets forth a breakdown of revenues:\nSecond Fiscal Quarter\nEnded February 28, 2018\nSecond Fiscal Quarter\nEnded February 28, 2017\nYoY % Change\n(RMB in million)\n(RMB in million)\nInternational Schools\n118.7\n102.4\n15.9%\nBilingual Schools\n108.6\n83.0\n30.8%\nKindergartens\n73.0\n61.0\n19.7%\nComplementary\n22.8\n21.6\n5.6%\nTotal\n323.1\n268.0\n20.6%\nInternational Schools: Revenue for the quarter was RMB118.7 million, representing a 15.9% increase from RMB102.4 million.

However, periodic reports made to shareholders will include current period amounts translated into U.S. dollars using the prevailing exchange rates at the balance sheet date, for the convenience of readers. Translations of balances in the condensed combined and consolidated balance sheets, and the related condensed combined and consolidated statements of operations, and cash flows from RMB into U.S. dollars as of and for the quarter and six month period ended February 28, 2018 are solely for the convenience of the readers and were calculated at the rate of US$1.00=RMB 6.3280, representing the noon buying rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board on February 28, 2018. No representation is made that the RMB amounts could have been, or could be, converted, realized or settled into US$ at that rate on February 28, 2018, or at any other rate.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn evaluating our business, we consider and use certain non-GAAP measures, including primarily adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss) excluding interest income, net; income tax expense/benefit; depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense and non-recurring foreign exchange gain/loss (included in other expenses) due to the movement of the cash denominated in USD at a PRC subsidiary level which is reserved for designated purpose of use in near future and adjusted net income/(loss) as net income/(loss) excluding share-based compensation expense. We define adjusted SG&A as selling, general and administration expense excluding share-based compensation expense.\nWe present the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans. Such non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income/(loss), enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation expense, and without considering the impact of non-operating items such as interest income, net; income tax expense/benefit and non-recurring foreign exchange gain/loss (included in other expenses) due to the movement of the cash denominated in USD at a PRC subsidiary level which is reserved for designated purpose of use in near future. We also believe that the use of the non-GAAP measure facilitates investors' assessment of our operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations. Interest income, net; income tax expense/benefit; depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation expense and non-recurring foreign exchange gain/loss (included in other expenses) due to the movement of the cash denominated in USD at a PRC subsidiary level which is reserved for designated purpose of use in near future have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA or adjusted net income/(loss). Further, these non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited.\nAbout Bright Scholar Education Holdings Limited\nBright Scholar is the largest operator of international and bilingual K-12 schools in China*.
