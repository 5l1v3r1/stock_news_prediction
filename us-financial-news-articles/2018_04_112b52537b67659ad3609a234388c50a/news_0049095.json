The strike had been on for 12 days as of Sunday.\n“We are very aware that our passengers are the most affected by this paralysis, so we are making all efforts to mitigate the impact,” Claudia Sender, vice president for customers at LATAM Airlines Group, said in a statement.\nUnder the previous itinerary adjustments, 1,575 flights were canceled, affecting more than 273,000 passengers. It was not immediately clear how many would be affected by the extension.\nThe company said it would keep negotiating to “reach a satisfactory agreement with the union as soon as possible.”\nLATAM was created in 2012 through a merger of Chile’s LAN and Brazil’s TAM. The company, headquartered in Santiago, has operating units in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.\nReporting by Antonio De la Jara; Writing by Hugh Bronstein; Editing Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:20:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
