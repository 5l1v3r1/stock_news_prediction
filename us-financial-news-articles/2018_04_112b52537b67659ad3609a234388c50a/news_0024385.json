Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May tours Alexander Stadium in Birmingham, April 11, 2018 \nEmmanuel Macron has signalled that France could also participate in strikes, while making clear that they would be aimed at Syrian chemical facilities rather than the Assad government and its allies. The French president could touch on Syria in an hour-long interview with French TV on Thursday. Despite President Donald Trump’s Twitter threat that missiles “will be coming”, the White House has said there is no timetable for strikes. \nWith stocks under pressure and oil prices surging, we have a slew of European central bankers speaking and the ECB will also publish an account of its March meeting. President Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that although the threat of tit-for-tat trade tariffs from Washington and Beijing would not have a big direct effect on the euro zone economy, they could trigger a retaliatory spiral that would hurt confidence. \nThe threat of strikes in Syria and a trade war certainly complicate the calculus for Draghi & Co as they edge towards an unwinding of their lavish bond purchases. Signs of economic weakness in the euro zone to start 2018 don’t help. \nPerhaps the most interesting speech today will come from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, the leading candidate to replace Draghi next year. He will spell out his vision for a reform of the euro zone amid growing scepticism that Macron and Germany’s Angela Merkel can forge a consensus on robust new steps in time for an EU summit in June. \nMARKETS \nThe prospect of imminent U.S. military action in Syria and retaliation from Russia has put markets in a firmly risk-off mood – surprising only that the market moves are not bigger. World stocks are down for the second day but only marginally so, emerging market equities have lost 0.16 percent and Wall Street may actually open higher, according to futures after closing lower on Tuesday . Sailors observe the departure of the Sachsen-class German navy frigate FGS Hessen, as part of the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group deployment towards the Middle East from Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. April 11, 2018 \nIt possibly goes to show how wedded investors are to equities, the power of U.S. earnings, firmer commodity prices and maybe also the feeling that nothing can really go wrong with the trade that has made so much money for so many for so long. \nSafe-haven assets are bid up but not overly so – the yen is flat after spiking versus the dollar on Wednesday when Trump first tweeted out his threats; Treasury and Bund yields are just off one-week lows hit on Wednesday and gold is off 11-week highs. \nAll the scary politics overshadowed Wednesday's Fed minutes and inflation data – the U.S. central bank sounded hawkish , indicating belief the U.S. economy would strengthen further and inflation would rise in coming months. \nHowever, data showed headline consumer inflation actually fell in February for the first time in 10 months, hitting the Treasury market a bit and flattening the yield curve further – the gap between the 2- and 10-year yields is at the narrowest in 10 years as fears grew about the impact of 3-4 Fed rate rises this year even as inflation stays sluggish. \nThere are the trade wars too meanwhile – the Fed warned of downside risks to the economy from trade policy while China said again it would fight back in event of an escalation in trade spat. \nAs far as economic growth is concerned, euro zone industrial production data should show if the recent run of weak numbers is continuing. Most analysts seem to think it will. Markets also await ECB minutes from the March meeting. \n— A look at the day ahead from Special Correspondent for Europe Noah Barkin and Deputy EMEA Markets Editor Sujata Rao.
