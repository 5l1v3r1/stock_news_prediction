Trim Tabs said the global equity funds were down 0.5 percent, while U.S. funds declined 0.7 percent. \nU.S. equity mutual funds lost $74.6 billion, while ETFs still had slight inflows of $11.3 billion, the lowest in the past eight quarters. Global equity inflows were at a three quarter high. \nBond funds saw strong demand, even with continuing losses. The funds received $61.8 billion, in line with recent quarters as retail investors did most of the buying, Trim Tabs said. Bond ETF inflows dropped to $13.5 billion, the lowest level in five quarters.
