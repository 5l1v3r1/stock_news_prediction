Reuters was unable to independently verify the videos’ authenticity. \nSaudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, has witnessed a series of radical political changes over the past year as the king’s son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, ousted his cousin as crown prince and then jailed senior royals in an anti-corruption sweep. \nPrince Salman returned from a month-long foreign tour earlier this month. \nThe senior Saudi official said a system would be put in place to regulate the use of recreational drones.
