It wasn’t immediately clear where she would go but the British Broadcasting Corp. reported she would be taken to a secure location somewhere in Britain.\nShe added that Sergei Skripal, a 66-year-old former Russian colonel who spied for the British government and later settled in Salisbury following a prisoner swap, has made good progress but isn’t ready to leave hospital.\nRelated \nFormer Russian Spy No Longer in Critical Condition After Poisoning (April 6) Nerve Agent Used in Attack Was Developed in Soviet Union as a Weapon (March 12) The Quiet English Life of Sergei Skripal, Poisoned Former Russian Spy (March 11) Mr. Skripal and his daughter were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury early last month and after being exposed to the nerve agent, police believe, at their home.\nThe attack, the first use of chemical weapons on European soil since World War II, sparked a diplomatic furor. London rallied its allies in blaming Moscow for the attack, leading to scores of expulsions of Russian diplomats. Russian markets convulsed Monday in response to a wave of fresh economic sanctions from the U.S., which also blames Moscow for meddling in the 2016 presidential election and has been critical of its actions in Syria and Ukraine.\nRelated Video The deepening rift between Moscow and the West is raising tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War. Following a coordinated response by Western allies, scores of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers have been expelled. WSJ's Niki Blasina explains the escalating situation. Russia denies any involvement in the attack and has criticized the British government for refusing its entreaties to launch a joint investigation. The Kremlin and its propaganda channels have propagated a variety of theories as to who was responsible, including hinting that it was the British themselves.\nIn a message on its verified Twitter account, the Russian Embassy in London on Tuesday congratulated Ms. Skripal on her recovery.\nYet it added that “we need urgent proof that what is being done to her is done on her own free will.”\nThe Novichok class of nerve agents were developed in the Soviet Union and their existence were first revealed in the early 1990s by a dissident scientist. Experts say that even brief exposure could be lethal.\nWrite to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T16:06:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
