He and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey are still in touch.\nTweet\n\"I discovered the instrument,\" he told CNBC's Wilfred Frost in an interview Wednesday.\nTrump's own tweeting habits are a constant buzz in the Twitterverse and elsewhere, and Blankfein said he isn't trying to compete with that. But with 90,000 followers (about 10,000 of them in the media, Blankfein notes), it's a way to stay in the conversation of the moment.\n\"I like the fact that it is short. I think it's a challenge to say what you want to say, be a little bit provocative, not too provocative and say that in a small space. So I kind of like the medium,\" he said.\nTweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:11:39.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
