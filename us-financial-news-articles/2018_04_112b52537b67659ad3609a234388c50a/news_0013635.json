That includes Oklahoma City and Tulsa, which said they would close again on Tuesday. \nOrganizers said Monday’s protest could be the largest since the walkout began, drawing as many as 40,000 people. Groups offering support handed out free pizza and coffee. More than 100 lawyers backing the teachers and dubbed “the women in black” for dressing in dark clothing met lawmakers. \nSince late March, lawmakers have approved nearly $450 million in new taxes and revenue to help fund teachers’ pay and education, but that is still short of the $600 million being sought by teachers. \nLawmakers on Monday discussed a bill that would remove a tax exemption on capital gains and bring in about $100 million. If enacted, the union has said it would be a major step toward ending the strike.

Educators in other states, increasingly angry over stagnating wages, are also considering walkouts. \nOpponents of the Oklahoma tax hikes said lawmakers could bolster education spending by cutting bureaucracy and waste rather than raising taxes. \nThe new taxes and revenue approved by lawmakers translate into an average teacher pay raise of about $6,100.
