However, banks are doing well today because of RBI’s latest move, which is supporting the markets,” said Neeraj Dewan, director, Quantum Securities.\nThe broader NSE index was down 0.24 percent at 10,186.85 as of 0523 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.18 percent lower at 33,194.31.\nThe Nifty PSU bank index climbed as much as 2.9 percent and was on track to snap a two-day losing streak.\nMeanwhile, Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd led losses on the NSE index, falling over 2 percent each, as investors booked profits. Both stocks had gained in the last three sessions.\nOil marketers also gained, with Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd rising 3.6 percent while Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd were up over 1 percent each.\n“Since crude is stabilising, some buying is coming back as oil marketing stocks had been oversold due to high crude prices,” Dewan added.\nMotherson Sumi Systems rose as much as 5.2 percent after the auto parts maker’s unit signed a deal to buy Reydel Automotive for $204 million in cash.\nShares of tyre makers such as MRF Ltd and Apollo Tyres Ltd also gained due to falling rubber prices.
