The city estimates that the toner asphalt reduces emissions by 40 percent compared to conventional asphalt.\nOther printer companies like Lexmark and Kyocera also participate through an organization called Close the Loop.\nRoads aren't the only way to reuse the printer parts. Cartridges can also be used to make park benches, and toner supplies can be repurposed as pens and rulers . HP toner cartridges are made out of recycled water bottles and hangers , and printers are also recycled by Best Buy.\nToshiba said that printer parts can also be used for eLumber, some of which is donated to Habitat to Humanity to make planter boxes. \nE-waste remains a huge problem worldwide: A report from United Nations University and members of industry found that only 20 percent of e-waste generated is documented to be collected and recycled, with the region around Australia having the lowest volume of output, but the highest ratio of e-waste per person.\nBut Toshiba's vice president of product and solutions marketing, Joe Contreras, said that the company has gotten positive feedback for allowing clients to recycle any printer part — not just Toshiba's — in bins Toshiba provides. That zero-waste program turns 10 this year.\n\"They see we are really committed by doing something like that,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T18:38:38.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
