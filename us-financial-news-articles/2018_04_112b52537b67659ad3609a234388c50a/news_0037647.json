Given the liquidity of Eurostoxx 50 options at this time of the day, it would thus appear much more difficult and costly to manipulate VSTOXX futures,” the report said. \nThe AMF also ruled out the possibility of manipulation of France’s volatility index, VCAC .VCAC. \n“Since the VCAC is not an underlying of listed derivatives, a manipulation scheme on the VCAC index similar to the alleged VIX manipulation may thus be ruled out,” the watchdog said, adding that no products reference the VCAC index.
