Russia annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, a move that prompted U.S. and European sanctions. \n“My children were at Artek last year. After the trip they began to understand Russia better,” Sablin quoted Assad as saying. \nAssad has two sons and a daughter, born between 2001 and 2004. Syria’s ambassador to Moscow said last year that the children had started learning to speak Russian, according to Russian media reports.
