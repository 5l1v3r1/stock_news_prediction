Based on shareholder feedback, the New York bank had proposed to continue its equity plan for three years but request no new shares for issuance under the plan.\nISS also said it would offer just \"cautionary\" support in an advisory vote for the pay of top executives including Blankfein, who received about $22 million in 2017.\nWhile investors will welcome a shift to more equity awards tied to performance, ISS wrote, Goldman's compensation committee has much discretion in setting pay and goals for executives may not be so rigorous.\nGoldman Sachs representatives did not immediately comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T12:30:17.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
