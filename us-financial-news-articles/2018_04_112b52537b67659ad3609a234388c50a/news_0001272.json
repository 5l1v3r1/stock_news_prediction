May and June finished limit down at 64.825 and 73.550 cents, respectively.\nCME lean hogs’ trading limit will expand to 4.500 cents on Tuesday.\nLIVE CATTLE HITS 5-MONTH LOW\nCME live cattle hit a five-month low on weaker cash price expectations and burdensome supply outlook, said traders.\nRenewed worries about a trade war sent the U.S. stock market tumbling, and dredged up concerns that the Chinese may also slap higher tariffs on U.S. beef.\nAfter years of lobbying, China in June of last year ended its 14-year ban on U.S. beef over worries about mad cow disease.\n“It’s (China) is still a small but growing market for U.S. beef, especially given their rising middle class,” a trader said.\nMarket participants await this week’s cash prices that a week ago sold for mostly $120 to $121 per cwt, down $5 from the week before as supplies begin to build seasonally.\nApril live cattle closed down 1.350 cents per pound at 112.400 cents, and June ended down 1.625 cents at 100.950.\nCME feeder cattle followed lower live cattle futures.\nApril closed 1.450 cents lower at 131.875 cents.
