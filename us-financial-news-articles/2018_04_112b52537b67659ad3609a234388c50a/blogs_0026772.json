Our experts agreed that upgrade cycles started to lengthen in 2017 and will continue to do so in 2018.\"\nThe analyst said Apple's China sales peaked in 2015, when the country represented 25 percent of iPhone shipments versus 19 percent today. \n\"We expect a flattish market, give or take a few points of growth depending on the overall market and product cycle,\" he wrote. \"There will be continued pressure from local competitors that have become adept at quickly replicating features.\"\nDespite the company's growth issues in China, the analyst reiterated his buy rating and $190 price target for Apple shares. He cited the company's price-to-earnings ratio of 16 times for this fiscal year, which compares favorably with other technology hardware stocks.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T21:31:25.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
