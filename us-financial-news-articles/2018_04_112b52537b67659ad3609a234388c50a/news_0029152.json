A combination of file photos show U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House in Washington, DC, U.S. April 9, 2018 and former FBI Director James Comey on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Carlos Barria, Jonathan Ernst/File Photos \nTrump fired Comey on May 9, 2017, as the law enforcement agency investigated alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between Moscow and Trump’s campaign. The firing prompted the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to lead the inquiry and look at possible obstruction of justice. \nTrump, who has denied collusion with Moscow, on Wednesday posted a tweet referring to “Slippery James Comey” and said he “was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation.” Trump did not elaborate. \nTwo days after dismissing Comey, Trump had explained why he did it in a televised interview with NBC News. \n“In fact when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said, ‘You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,” he said. “It’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.” \nThe president’s latest comments come as Comey embarks on a massive media tour to promote his book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership.” The book chronicles Comey’s brief service under Trump, who he has said is “morally unfit” to be president. \nRussia has also denied interfering in the 2016 election.
