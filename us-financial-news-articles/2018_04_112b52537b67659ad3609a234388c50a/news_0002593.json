Production will rise to 100,000 vehicles from 60,000 in 2017. \nThe French group, which is locked in labor talks with Opel’s German workers, said the Luton investment was helped by “responsible social dialogue with the Unite union guaranteeing production flexibility”, as well as UK government support. \nThe union said 350-400 jobs would be created as a result of the investment, which PSA said would amount to about 100 million euros ($123 million). Around 1,400 people are currently employed at the site, which is Britain’s only van plant. \nThe announcement is a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of talks to decide Britain’s long-term trading relationship with the European Union, although PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares underscored the need for free trade.
