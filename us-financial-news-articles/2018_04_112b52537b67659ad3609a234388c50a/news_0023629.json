According to Mongolian law, prosecutors need to apply to a court to hold suspects for more than 48 hours. \nReuters was unable to reach either Bayar or Saikhanbileg on Wednesday. Their lawyers were also not available for comment. \nMongolia’s anti-corruption body has already arrested the former finance minister Bayartsogt Sangajav, one of three government ministers to sign the original 2009 investment deal. He has denied any wrongdoing. \nThe deal, approved by Mongolian parliament, was also signed by the then mining and energy minister and the then minister of the environment. \nThe Swiss Office of the Attorney General is conducting a criminal investigation into a seized bank account that court documents indicated was used to transfer $10 million to Bayartsogt in September 2008. \nSwiss prosecutors confirmed at the end of last month that they were checking whether “questionable payments” made to Bayartsogt were linked to the Oyu Tolgoi mining project, adding that Rio Tinto itself was “not an accused”. \nAs a result of the 2009 agreement, Ivanhoe Mines held 66 percent of the Oyu Tolgoi project, with the Mongolian government holding the remainder. Ivanhoe changed its name to Turquoise Hill Resources in 2012 after Rio Tinto became its majority stakeholder.
