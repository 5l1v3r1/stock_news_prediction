He added: “That is not possible.” \n“You cannot deny one of the candidates (the chance) to go to Congress. This is a principle and I stick to this principle... I was shocked.” \nBefore 2011, World Cup hosting was decided by FIFA’s executive committee, which had 24 members at the time. \nBut the previous bidding process, for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, became embroiled in allegations of illegitimate attempts to influence the committee’s voting members. \nThe finals were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively at the same time after a vote in December 2010. A subsequent FIFA investigation detailed numerous attempts to influence the voting officials but there was no suggestion the race should be re-run. NEW FORMAT \nSwiss Blatter, FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, was also wary of the new 48-team format to be used at the 2026 World Cup, when the tournament will be increased from 32 countries. \nThe teams will be divided into 16 groups of three in the first round, with the top two qualifying for the round of 32. One team in each group will not play on a given match day. Former FIFA President Sepp Blatter gestures during an interview with Reuters in Zurich, Switzerland April 10, 2018.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann \n“We will see what will happen with 48 teams but one thing cannot be done - to play in groups of three because we had this problem in 1982 in Spain,” Blatter said. \nIn that tournament the second round had four groups of three teams, with the winners qualifying for the semi-finals. \nThe format was never used again during Blatter’s tenure. \n“In groups of three, there is always one spectator (a team who will not be in action),” he added. \nThe 82-year-old was also wary of the video assistant referee (VAR) system which was approved by soccer’s rule-making body IFAB in March and will be used at this year’s World Cup. \n“For a purist in football as I am, I think it is an innovation which is going too fast,” said Blatter. \n“Most of the referees have never worked this system and to go the World Cup and to introduce this system in the World Cup, I think it is not very clever.” \nBlatter said that when VAR was first mooted, the idea was to give teams the right to challenge decisions, as in tennis or cricket. But under the system approved in March, the referee or the video assistant decides when to review a decision. \n“I don’t feel comfortable, definitely not, and spectators don’t feel comfortable,” he said. \nBlatter remained confident he could overturn his ban, which was imposed by FIFA’s ethics committee shortly after the Swiss attorney general’s office began criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. \nNo charges have yet been brought and Blatter has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
