The crown fell 0.2 percent to 10.43 crowns versus the euro, and it was also down 0.2 percent against the dollar .\nDOLLAR STRENGTH With the euro falling, the dollar traded near a 3-1/2-month high against a basket of currencies, bolstered by the 10-year Treasury benchmark yield breaching the three percent threshold for the first time in four years.\nThe rise in yields was driven by worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices.\nThe recent jump in U.S. bond yields has caused U.S.-Japan and U.S.-German yield differentials to widen further in the dollar’s favour, leaving the yen and the euro lower.\n“Unless there is a very unlikely massive meltdown in U.S. equity markets, it is doubtful the Fed will waver on a June rate hike,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for Oanda in Singapore.\n“With equity market sentiment holding firm in the face of rising bond yields, the almighty dollar could move through G-10 currency markets like a wrecking ball,” Innes added.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar set a 2-1/2-month high of 109.49 yen but later eased to 109.285 yen, down 0.1 percent.\nThe dollar also paused against the Australian and Canadian dollars after recent gains.
