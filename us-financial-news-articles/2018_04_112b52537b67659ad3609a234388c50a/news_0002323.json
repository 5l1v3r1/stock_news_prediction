(“Bellatrix”, “we”, “our” or the “Company”) (TSX:BXE) (NYSE:BXE) announces the start-up of the Phase 2 expansion project at the Bellatrix O’Chiese Nees-Ohpawganu’ck deep-cut gas plant at Alder Flats (the “Alder Flats Plant”), an update of commodity risk management contracts, and revised 2018 corporate guidance.\nBellatrix Alder Flats Plant Phase 2 Fully Commissioned in March, Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget\nThe Phase 2 expansion project of the Alder Flats Plant was fully commissioned mid-March and began selling volumes March 19, 2018. The project more than doubles throughput capacity at the Alder Flats Plant to 230 MMcf/d (from 110 MMcf/d), was brought on-stream safely ahead of schedule, and was delivered approximately 5% under budget. The Alder Flats Plant has successfully tested inlet volumes of approximately 210 MMcf/d (combined between both Phase 1 and 2), and is performing in-line with expectations. The turbo expander is operational on Phase 2, which was designed with a colder process, thereby enhancing natural gas liquid (“NGL”) extraction capabilities. Combined NGL recovery at the Alder Flats Plant increases to approximately 55 to 60 bbl/MMcf, from approximately 45 bbl/MMcf under Phase 1; this is in addition to an expected condensate yield of an additional 10 bbl/MMcf.\nCompletion of Phase 2 adds an incremental 30 MMcf/d ownership capacity net to Bellatrix's 25% working interest. Bellatrix has redirected approximately 65 MMcf/d of gross natural gas volumes from third party processing plants to theAlder Flats Plant to optimally process under its ownership and processing volume commitments. Operating costs for natural gas processed through Bellatrix’s ownership interest in the Alder Flats Plant are approximately $0.16/mcf, providing significant cost benefits for the Company. The redirection of natural gas volumes from more expensive third-party plants are anticipated to deliver reductions in production expenditures in 2018 to a range of $7.65/boe to $8.00/boe, based on the Company’s updated production volume guidance discussed below. The completion of Phase 2 is anticipated to drive improved revenue generation through additional higher margin NGL extraction of approximately 10 to 35 bbl/MMcf over third party plants, resulting in an average corporate liquid weighting of approximately 26% in 2018, which we expect to, in turn, drive enhanced corporate profit margins and cash flow.\nThe Phase 2 expansion project represents the last stage of our multi-year infrastructure build out. With our long term infrastructure build out complete, Bellatrix expects the majority of capital investment to be utilized directly in drilling, completion and production addition activities with minimal capital required for facilities and infrastructure projects over the near term. Management expects that its existing facilities and processing capacity provide the capability to grow production volumes beyond 60,000 boe/d, with minimal future facility related capital.\nUpdated Commodity Price Risk Management Protection and Market Diversification Initiatives\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Bellatrix added to its commodity price risk management protection to further reduce the impact of price volatility on our business. Specifically, Bellatrix has added AECO natural gas fixed price swap contracts in the summer 2018 and summer 2019 months to insulate against potential seasonal weakness in local spot natural gas prices.\nIncluding the new price risk management contracts, Bellatrix has approximately 70.7 MMcf/d of 2018 natural gas volumes hedged at an average fixed price of approximately $2.96/mcf, representing approximately 45% of forecast 2018 natural gas volumes. Bellatrix has also diversified its natural gas price exposure through physical sales contracts that give the Company exposure to the Dawn, Chicago, and Malin natural gas pricing hubs. This long-term diversification strategy reduces Bellatrix’s exposure to AECO pricing on approximately 26% of the Company’s forecast 2018 natural gas volumes.\nIn combination, the market diversification sales and fixed price hedges cover approximately 2/3 of natural gas volumes in 2018 and 55% in 2019 (based on the mid-point of 2018 average production guidance). A summary of Bellatrix’s 2018 through 2020 commodity price risk management contracts as at March 31, 2018 include:\nProduct Financial Contract Period Volume Average Price (1) Natural gas Fixed price swap January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 66.1 MMcf/d $3.06/mcf Natural gas Fixed price swap April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018 7.9 MMcf/d $1.74/mcf Natural gas Fixed price swap April 1, 2019 to October 31, 2019 17.6 MMcf/d $2.03/mcf Natural gas AECO/NYMEX basis swap April 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018 10,000 MMBtu/d -US$1.24/MMBtu Natural gas AECO/NYMEX basis swap April 1, 2019 to October 31, 2020 10,000 MMBtu/d -US$1.24/MMBtu Propane Fixed price differential January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 1,000 bbl/d 47% of NYMEX WTI Crude oil Sold C$WTI call April 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 1,500 bbl/d $80.00/bbl Crude oil Sold C$WTI call January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 2,000 bbl/d $80.00/bbl Crude oil Fixed price swap January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 1,000 bbl/d $70.14/bbl (1) Prices for natural gas fixed price swap contracts assume a conversion of $/GJ to $/mcf based on an average corporate heat content rate of 40.3Mj/m3.\nBellatrix’s market diversification contracts as at March 31, 2018 include:\nProduct Market Start Date End Date Volume Natural gas Chicago February 1, 2018 October 31, 2020 15,000 MMBtu/d Natural gas Chicago November 1, 2018 October 31, 2020 15,000 MMBtu/d Natural gas Dawn February 1, 2018 October 31, 2020 15,000 MMBtu/d Natural gas Dawn November 1, 2018 October 31, 2020 15,000 MMBtu/d Natural gas Malin February 1, 2018 October 31, 2020 15,000 MMBtu/d Updated 2018 Guidance\nBellatrix’s management believes that preserving balance sheet strength and liquidity, while optimizing production levels is a prudent strategy given current commodity prices. Bellatrix is therefore reducing its expected capital expenditure budget to a range of $55 to $60 million (down from a range of $65 million to $80 million) which reduces annual average production guidance by 1,000 to 1,500 boe/d.\nBellatrix plans to fund the reduced capital budget through adjusted funds flow while reducing the potential for additional debt or bank line utilization through the end of 2018. The 2018 capital program will remain flexible and focused on optimizing forecast return on invested capital through focused development of the Spirit River liquids rich natural gas play and higher liquids weighted opportunities in the Cardium play.\nRevised 2018\nAnnual Guidance\n(April 3, 2018) Previously Set 2018\nAnnual Guidance\n(December 14, 2017) Production (boe/d) 2018 Average daily production 34,000 – 35,500 35,000 – 37,000 Production Mix (%) Natural gas 74 74 Crude oil, condensate and NGLs 26 26 Net Capital Expenditures ($000) (1) Total net capital expenditures 55,000 – 65,000 65,000 – 80,000 Expenses Production expense ($/boe) (2) 7.65 – 8.00 7.50 – 7.90 (1) Net capital spending includes exploration and development capital projects and corporate assets, and excludes property acquisitions and dispositions. Net capital spending also excludes the previously received prepayment portion of Bellatrix's partner’s 35% share of the cost of construction of Phase 2 of the Alder Flats Plant during calendar 2018.\n(2) Production expenses before net processing revenue/fees. Reader Advisories:\nBARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT: The term barrels of oil equivalent (\"boe\") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf/bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. All boe conversions in this press release are derived from converting gas to oil in the ratio of six thousand cubic feet of gas to one barrel of oil. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\nCAPITAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES: This press release contains the term \"adjusted funds flow \" which should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than \"cash flow from operating activities\" as determined in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of the Company's performance. Therefore reference to adjusted funds flow or adjusted funds flow per share may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Management uses adjusted funds flow to analyze operating performance and leverage and considers adjusted funds flow to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company's ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt. The reconciliation between cash flow from operating activities and adjusted funds flow can be found in the Company's most recent management's discussion and analysis, which may be accessed through the SEDAR website ( www.sedar.com ). Adjusted funds flow per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares for the period.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
