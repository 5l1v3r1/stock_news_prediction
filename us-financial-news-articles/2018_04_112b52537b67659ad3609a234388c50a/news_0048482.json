You never anticipate a scoreline like the way it turned out but it was really solid,” Stephens said. \nThe Americans extended their winning record to 12-2 against the French. \nThey will defend their title on Nov. 10-11 against the Czech Republic, who reached the final by defeating Germany 4-1 in Stuttgart.
