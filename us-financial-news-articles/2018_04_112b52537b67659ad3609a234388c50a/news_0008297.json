They have tumbled more than 16 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke.\n(Reporting by Makini Brice; Additional reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T11:39:58.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
