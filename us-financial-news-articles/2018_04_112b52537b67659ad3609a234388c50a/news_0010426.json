The issue came under recent focus after Japanese newspaper The Mainichi featured a man who said he and his wife broke an \"unspoken rule\" by becoming pregnant before their \"turn\" at her workplace.\nThe husband and his wife, a childcare worker in Japan's Aichi Prefecture, apologized for what her boss described as \"selfishly breaking the rules,\" the 28-year-old man told the newspaper in a letter. According to the letter, the director of the child care center set up \"shifts\" for when female employees could have children to avoid too many workers taking leave in a nation facing a scarcity of child care options.\nMore than 47,000 children remained wait-listed for certified day cares in Japan last year,", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:14:40.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
