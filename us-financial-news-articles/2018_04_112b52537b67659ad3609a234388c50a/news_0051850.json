The social media company has recently come under fire over its use of consumer data.\nComcast rose2.1 percent after the largest U.S. cable company confirmed its $31 billion bid for Sky on the heels of its better-than-expected earnings report.\nSo far, 31 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, 81.2 percent of which came in above consensus estimates. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings growth of 22 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOf the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes, 7 were in negative territory, led by Real Estate, Technology, and Financials.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, an indicator of short-term stock market volatility, jumped to 18.67 points, its highest level in more than a week.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nReporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:08:06.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
