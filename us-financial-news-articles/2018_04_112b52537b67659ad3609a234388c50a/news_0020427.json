At other periods later in the day there were no flights using the airspace. \nEurocontrol included a broader area outside the airspace controlled by Damascus in its statement. \nA spokesman for Germany’s Lufthansa said on Wednesday its airlines were aware of the Eurocontrol warning and were in close contact with authorities. \n“As a proactive precaution, Lufthansa Group airlines have already avoided the airspace in the eastern Mediterranean for some time now,” he said. \nEuropean budget carrier easyJet PLC has undertaken a safety and security assessment and will take precautionary measures including rerouting flights from Tel Aviv, the airline said in a statement. \nRyanair Holdings PLC and British Airways representatives said flights were operating normally at their respective airlines but the situation was being monitored closely. \nSeveral other major airlines that fly in the area did not respond immediately to a request for comment about their flight path plans. \nThe Nicosia flight information region named in the Eurocontrol statement covers the island of Cyprus and surrounding waters, according to a map on the agency’s website. \nThe same map did not designate any specific territory as being the “Eastern Mediterranean” region. \nThere has been heightened awareness by regulators and airlines of the risks that conflict zones pose to commercial jets since Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a surface-to-air missile over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. \nLast year, North Korea tested missiles without warning, leading some airlines to re-route flights to avoid portions of the Sea of Japan. \nEurocontrol’s warning cited a document from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Europe’s safety regulator. \nAn EASA spokesman said it had informed member states and Eurocontrol of its cautionary message on Tuesday.
