He began with a flourish, scoring two hat-tricks in Juve’s first four league games, but then suffered a loss of form and was dropped for two games in December. \nA hamstring injury also kept him out for several matches but he is now back to his best and scored a stunning goal in the 3-1 win over AC Milan on Saturday. \n“Paulo will have a great match because he is fit, he is serene and, mentally, he has improved greatly,” said Allegri as he gave the 24-year-old a vote of confidence ahead of the quarter-final first leg in Turin.

The ideal scenario would be to score and not concede a goal.” \nReal Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane dismissed any talk of comparisons with last year’s final. \n“This has nothing to do with happened 10 months ago,” he told reporters after being asked to draw a parallel with the match. \n“What happened has happened, but now we have to think about this game and make sure we play well tomorrow. \n“We mustn’t think about that or other matches against Juventus because it doesn’t mean anything.” \nReal have not had the best of seasons as they are third in La Liga and finished behind Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League group stage, but showed they are still a force to be reckoned with by beating Paris St Germain in the last 16.
