As a result, we generated $77 million of cash from operations in the quarter. In addition, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5.5% and repurchased 1.7 million shares returning a total of $93 million of cash to shareholders. As we move into the June quarter our focus on cost management and continued improvement in our net working capital days positions us well for long-term growth in shareholder value.”\nAdditional Third Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNamed a World’s Most Ethical Company for the fifth consecutive year by the Ethisphere Institute Exited the quarter with a strong book-to-bill ratio in all regions, exceeding 1.1 in aggregate Delivered sequential improvement in sales and operating margins in the Americas region Increased digital sales annual run-rate, which now exceeds $850 million Realized 70% of the $120 million annualized cost reduction program in FY18 through Q3 Reduced debt by $141 million Accelerated growth with key suppliers, adding 11 new franchises to the Avnet line card Successful implementation of the EMEA upgraded ERP system Recorded $230 million provisional repatriation transition tax liability Recorded $181 million goodwill impairment related to acquisitions prior to fiscal year 2011\nOutlook for Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2018 Ending on June 30, 2018\nGuidance Range\nMidpoint\nSales $4.65B - $4.95B $4.8B Non-GAAP Diluted EPS (1) $0.91 - $1.01 $0.96 (1) A reconciliation of non-GAAP guidance to GAAP guidance is presented in the “Non-GAAP Financial Information” section of this press release.\nThe above guidance excludes any results of discontinued operations, amortization of intangibles, accelerated depreciation, any potential restructuring, integration, and other expenses and certain income tax adjustments. The above guidance assumes 120 million average diluted shares outstanding and an adjusted tax rate of 21% to 25%. In addition, the above guidance assumes that the average U.S. Dollar to Euro currency exchange rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 is $1.23 to €1.00. This compares with an average exchange rate of $1.10 to the Euro in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis document contains certain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

When the U.S. Dollar strengthens and the stronger exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of Avnet’s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, the resulting impact is a decrease in U.S. Dollars of reported results. Conversely, when the U.S. Dollar weakens and the weaker exchange rates of the current year are used to translate the results of operations of Avnet’s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies, the resulting impact is an increase in U.S. Dollars of reported results. In the discussion of the Company’s results of operations, results excluding this impact are referred to as “excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates” or “constant currency.” Management believes organic sales and sales in constant currency are useful measures for evaluating current period performance as compared with prior periods and for understanding underlying trends. In order to determine the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales, income or expense items for subsidiaries reporting in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, the Company adjusts the average exchange rates used in current periods to be consistent with the average exchange rates in effect during the comparative period.\nManagement believes that operating income adjusted for restructuring, integration and other expenses, goodwill impairment expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets and other, are useful measures to help investors better assess and understand the Company’s operating performance. This is especially the case when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods, primarily because management views the excluded items to be outside of Avnet’s normal operating results or non-cash in nature. Management analyzes operating income without the impact of these items as well as other income (expense) excluding certain amounts as an indicator of ongoing margin performance and underlying trends in the business. Management also uses these non-GAAP measures to establish operational goals and, in many cases, for measuring performance for compensation purposes.\nAdditional non-GAAP metrics management uses is adjusted operating income margin, which is defined as adjusted operating income (as defined above) divided by sales.\nManagement also believes income tax expense, income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted for the impact of the items described above and certain items impacting income tax expense are useful to investors because they provide a measure of the Company’s net profitability on a more comparable basis to historical periods and provide a more meaningful basis for forecasting future performance. Additionally, because of management’s focus on generating shareholder value, of which net profitability is a primary driver, management believes income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the impact of these items provides an important measure of the Company’s net profitability for the investing public.\nAny analysis of results and outlook on a non-GAAP basis should be used as a complement to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP.\nFiscal Quarters Ended Year to Date March 31, December 30, September 30, 2018* 2018* 2017* 2017* ($ in thousands, except per share amounts) GAAP operating income (loss) -
