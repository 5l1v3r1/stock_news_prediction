(\"Brand\"), the parent company of The Brand Banking Company, have announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement whereby Brand and its subsidiary bank will merge with and into Renasant. The transaction currently valued at approximately $453 million in aggregate (or 224% price/TBV), includes a 5% cash component, with the balance to be paid in RNST stock, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018. Moreover, the successful integration of the transaction is expected to significantly expand Renasant Corporation’s presence in the Atlanta MSA, which represents the second-largest MSA in the Southeast by population.\nOn August 9, 2017, KBRA affirmed the ratings, including senior unsecured and subordinated debt ratings of BBB+ and BBB, respectively, for Renasant Corporation, as well as a senior unsecured debt rating of A- for Renasant Bank. The Outlook on the long-term ratings remains Stable.\nKBRA notes Brand’s weak historical performance and elevated levels of NPAs as evidenced by KBRA’s Subscription Rating Service’s financial strength rating of C. However, given RNST’s acquisitive experience, marked with rigorous due diligence processes and historically successful integrations, KBRA considers this transaction to be within the institution’s strategy.\nIn KBRA’s view, this transaction is neutral to Renasant’s ratings in the short-term, though, the successful integration of the transaction may lead to stronger deposit gathering capabilities and the recognition of cost synergies over time.\nThe ratings are based on KBRA’s Global Bank and Bank Holding Company Rating Methodology published on February 19, 2016.\nTo view the report, please click here .\nCONNECT\nWITH KBRA\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nDownload the iOS App\nYouTube\nAbout KBRA and KBRA Europe\nKBRA is a full service credit rating agency registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an NRSRO.
