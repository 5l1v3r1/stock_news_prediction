CNCBRR=ECI \nThe U.S. yield curve has hit its flattest since the global synchronised recovery, they said, despite record earnings, U.S. tax cuts, unemployment at record lows and surging commodity prices. \nAn inversion of the yield curve would be a bad omen, indicating a recession around the corner. By 1023 GMT the curve was at 48.32, up slightly from the previous session. US2US10=RR \nStrategists saw Chinese easing as another sign of a slowdown, saying the surprise move to cut reserve rates was triggered by a strong yuan and slowing export growth. \n“As macro data reflect global slowdown and central banks blink ... rotation to defensives to accelerate,” they said, adding they expect defensives to outperform cyclical assets. \nFlows since the start of the year indicate risk aversion in bonds and risk appetite in equities, a pattern BAML’s strategists labelled “schizophrenic”. TECH RETAINS CROWN \nGovernment bonds have seen strong inflows while high yield bonds have been dropped, while in equities the most popular areas year-to-date are Japan, emerging markets, and financials. Utilities and telecoms stocks, seen as defensive, have seen sharp outflows. \nCommodities were easily the best-performing asset class of the year so far, returning 23 percent, while the U.S. dollar nursed losses of 9 percent since January, in price action the bank said was typical of this late stage in the economy. \n“Last time asset performance ranked this way was in 2007,” strategists noted, striking an ominous tone. \nInvestors reversed sharply out of Japanese equities this week, driving record $5 billion outflows from the region after 19 straight weeks of inflows. \nEuropean stocks also suffered outflows of $2 billion, taking year-to-date flows into negative territory - reflecting the region’s fall from grace this year as macroeconomic data shows signs the “Euroboom” is slowing. \nU.S. equities saw $5.1 billion of inflows while emerging markets drew in $3.7 billion. \nTech remained the most popular sector, drawing in $0.6 billion, while healthcare, energy, materials and financials all saw outflows. \nBAML’s fund manager survey this week showed investors have been cutting down on their tech exposure, considering the sector the “most crowded” trade for the third month running. \nIn commodities, precious metals, whose prices have soared as Russian sanctions sparked fears of a supply squeeze, drew in strong inflows of $0.8 billion. \nItalian and Greek equities topped the chart of “overbought” areas of the stock market, indicating investors’ newfound appetite for European periphery markets.
