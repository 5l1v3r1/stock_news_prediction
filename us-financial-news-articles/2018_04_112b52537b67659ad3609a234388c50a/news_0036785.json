Even if you add Chinese (semi manufactured) aluminium exports to the mix, we’re still in deficit of 3.3 mln tonnes ex-China if you eliminate Rusal.” \nSome traders and analysts were puzzled about the surge in nickel, attributing it to technical factors, although the market has been fearful recently that the U.S. sanctions could extend to hit Russia’s Norilsk Nickel. \n“We have seen a consistent CTA (black box fund) bid of late. Nickel exhibits the largest spec long of the complex on our estimates at 10.5 percent of open interest,” broker Marex Spectron said in a note. \nPRICES: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange climbed as high as $2,490 a tonne, its strongest since August 2011, and was trading at $2,489 by 1012 GMT, up 3.5 percent. Nickel was the day’s outperformer, surging almost 5 percent to hit a high of $14,870, its highest since February 2015. \nALUMINA: Prices of alumina, the raw material for making aluminium, have surged after Rio Tinto said it could not fulfil supply contracts because of the sanctions on Rusal. \nBroker SP Angel said the Rio statement and Rusal sanctions only exacerbate global alumina supply constraints. \n“A source at a smelter ... saying ‘phones have been ringing off the hook with people looking for extra metal. They are looking for any extra tonnes, even just a few hundred’.” \nINDONESIA EXPORTS: Indonesia exported 8,637,595 tonnes of nickel ore up to March 31, 2018. \nNORNICKEL: Russia’s Norilsk is in talks with battery makers over possible investment in its mining assets. \nRIO TINTO: Rio last week declared force majeure on some customer contracts following the sanctions on Rusal, the world’s second biggest aluminium producer. \nRUSAL HALTS ORDERS: Rusal said on Tuesday it had stopped placing orders with two logistics firms that ship its exports. \nJAPAN TRADERS: Major Japanese trading houses have asked Rusal to stop shipping refined aluminium and other products.
