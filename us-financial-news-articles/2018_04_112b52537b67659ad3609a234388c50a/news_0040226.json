Seven members of the First Lady Astronaut Trainees, also known as the \"Mercury 13\", a group of women who trained to become astronauts for America's first human spaceflight program in the early 1960s, gather outside Launch Pad 39B near the Space Shuttle Discovery at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., in this 1995 photo.

According to NASA’s website, Lovelace’s Woman in Space Program was a short-lived, privately funded project testing women pilots for astronaut fitness in the early 1960s. \nThirteen of the 25 women recruited into the program passed the punishing physical exams, which included sensory deprivation and a vertigo-inducing shot of ice water into the inner ear. But the women never made it into space. \nIt was not until 1983 that the first American woman astronaut, Sally Ride, achieved space slight, some 20 years after Soviet Union cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova. \nWalsh said she was “awakened” during production of the film by how relevant the struggles of past generations of women are today. \n“I may have been blinkered somewhat in terms of how women are treated,” Walsh said. \nThe filmmakers believe the Mercury 13 women would have had a profound normalizing effect on equality around the world. \n“It was just the most tragic missed opportunity,” Sington said. “In so many ways it would be a better world today if women would have walked on the moon.” Reporting by Eric Kelsey; Editing by Robert Birsel", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:19:32.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
