That was the biggest increase since October 2013. Stocks at wholesalers increased 0.9 percent in January.\nThe component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product — wholesale stocks excluding autos — surged 1.1 percent in February.\nInventory investment subtracted 0.53 percentage point from fourth-quarter GDP growth. The economy grew at a 2.9 percent annualized pace in the October-November period. A report last week showed manufacturer inventories increased 0.3 percent in February after rising 0.4 percent in January.\nWholesale auto inventories dipped 0.1 percent in February, matching January's fall. There were increases in inventories of furniture, lumber and computer equipment.\nSales at wholesalers rebounded 1.0 percent in February after slumping 1.5 percent in January. Sales of motor vehicles jumped 1.4 percent in February after gaining 0.3 percent in the prior month.\nAt February's sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.26 months to clear shelves, unchanged from January.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T18:18:35.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
