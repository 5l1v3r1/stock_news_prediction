REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe U.S. dollar clung to gains amid fading concerns over a global trade war, while a reported decline in U.S. crude inventories and the possibility of supply disruptions pushed oil prices higher. \nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.55 percent, near its highest since March 21. \nThe index was supported by a higher open on Wall Street, following the latest batch of earnings. Morgan Stanley shares rose 3 percent after the bank reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. \n“Earnings continue to progress on the positive side and commodities are also on the rise; that should give the markets another boost,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \nStocks briefly dipped but quickly recovered after a Federal Reserve report saying that robust business borrowing, rising consumer spending and tight labour markets indicate the U.S. economy remains on track for continued growth, with trade war risks the one big outlier.

Brent futures settled at $73.48, up $1.90, or 2.65 percent.
