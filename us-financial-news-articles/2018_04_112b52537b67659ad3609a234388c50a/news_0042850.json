German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer arrives at German government guesthouse Meseberg Palace in Meseberg, Germany, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch \n“I am pushing for the promised 5.3 million cars to really be upgraded by the end of the year,” Scheuer told Sueddeutsche Zeitung in an interview published on Friday. \n“We are nearly done with the 2.5 million affected VW cars. For the other voluntary upgrades I have informed the manufacturers that they must present a time plan showing when they will deliver,” he said. \nThe German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. exhaust tests. \nGermany has committed to software upgrades for some 5.3 million diesel cars by the end of the year to reduce emissions by up to 30 percent. \n“Time is running out. I will take the manufacturers at their word,” Scheuer told Sueddeutsche. \nThe issue of emissions came to a head in February when a court allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel vehicles. Experts say bans could cut the resale value of up to 15 million diesel vehicles in Europe’s biggest car market. \nScheuer affirmed that he was opposed to bans, and that there were technical, legal and financial arguments against costly hardware retrofits of diesel vehicles.
