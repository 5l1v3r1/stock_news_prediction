Soldiers killed four militia members and captured two others the following day, he said.\nMillions of people died in eastern Congo from conflict, hunger and disease during civil wars around the turn of the century and armed violence has risen in the past two years, in part due to political instability linked to President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his mandate expired in 2016.\nReporting By Fiston Mahamba; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T19:58:12.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
