The firm’s long-term aim was to exit Sprng once it reaches capacity of 1,750 MW, he said. \nActis said in an emailed statement it has around $8.5 billion (£5.9 billion) in assets under management. \nGaurav Sood, Chief Executive Officer of Sprng, also declined to comment on the deal. \nShapoorji’s portfolio currently comprises of seven operational projects with a total capacity of 272 MW and an additional 130 MW under development. \nA deal would come hard on the heels of Actis’ sale earlier this month of its first renewable energy platform, Ostro Energy, to Goldman Sachs-backed Renew Power Ventures ( RENE.BO ) at $1.5 billion. \nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to have 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2022, up from 62 GW currently, out of which 100 GW is expected to come from solar.
