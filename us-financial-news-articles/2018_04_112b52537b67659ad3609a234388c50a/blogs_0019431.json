The Apple CEO questioned the practise of monetizing user data on social media platforms.\nZuckerberg then hit back days later , saying that the service should be free.\n\"You know, I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib. And not at all aligned with the truth,\" Zuckerberg said in an \"Ezra Klein Show\" podcast published Monday by Vox.\nThere hasn't been much else said since then, but Zuckerberg was ready to take on Apple if lawmakers asked him about it during his testimony on Tuesday in front of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg avoids regulatory promises in congressional hearing      10 Hours Ago | 03:12 That is according to his notes , which were photographed by Associated Press photojournalist Andy Harnik and posted online by a CBS editor, Stefan Becket.\nOne section of the notes was entitled \"Tim Cook on big model.\"\nThe first bullet point referenced a quote from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about working hard to charge users less money.
