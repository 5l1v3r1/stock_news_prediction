Google and Microsoft also offer key management services. \nSecrets Manager is meant for more broad-based use -- it can be used to store passwords, keys to application programming interfaces for other services, or database login information. \nIn October cybersecurity company UpGuard disclosed that Accenture had experienced a data breach of data stored in AWS that contained 40,000 passwords . The Australian Broadcasting Corporation also had a data breach that involved login information, The Register reported in November. \nIn the past year AWS has also sought to bolster its security capabilities with the acquisition of Sqrrl and the introduction of the Macie data security service. \nAmazon Web Services leads the public cloud infrastructure market, with more than 125 services available to customers. In the fourth quarter it held 34 percent of the market for cloud infrastructure services, according to Synergy Research Group. Synergy put Microsoft's share at 13 percent and Google's at 6 percent. \nThe new AWS Secrets Manager service is available today. It costs 40 cents per \"secret\" per month, and 5 cents for every batch of 10,000 programmatic requests.
