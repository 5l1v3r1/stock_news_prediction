The other prescription drop, Xiidra, carries a similar price tag. \nIn contrast, fish oil therapy costs roughly $30 to $150 per month. \nBut even the highest dose of fish oil didn’t produce more relief than placebo, according to the team from 27 sites, led by Maureen Maguire, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \nAll of the study’s participants had been dealing with moderate to severe dry eye for at least six months, and were allowed to continue their current treatments during the fish oil trial. Neither patients nor their doctors knew which type of oil they were getting. \nMore than half the patients in both groups reported improvement in the symptoms yet fish oil consumers didn’t score significantly higher than placebo recipients. \nThis illustrates that it’s very difficult for clinicians to tell whether a treatment is being beneficial, Maguire said in a telephone interview, or whether it’s random variability in the patient’s condition from one week to the next, or the patient wanting to believe the treatment is working, that accounts for improvement. \nMaguire said optometrists and ophthalmologists frequently suggest fish oil to their dry eye patients, although “many make the recommendation saying, ‘I don’t know if this will work, but you might try it.’” \nHow a patient will respond to a specific treatment, Maguire noted, “is really quite variable, which is one of the problems with this eye condition. Some people get relief from all of the various treatments, from lid hygiene to artificial tears, where different formulations work for different people. It’s a difficult condition to manage.” \nBased on the new results, if patients are looking for relief of their dry-eye symptoms, she said, “they may want to look at other alternatives.” \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2HjALGF New England Journal of Medicine, online April 13, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:15:02.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
