They dictate how much North American content vehicles must contain under NAFTA, which underpins some $1.2 trillion in annual trilateral trade.\n“We continue to work very hard on rules of origin, really the heart of this agreement,” Freeland said.\nThe Trump administration had initially demanded that North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value, up from 62.5 percent at present.\nHowever, auto industry executives said last week that Washington had significantly softened this in an effort to move faster toward a deal in the next few weeks.\nPresident Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to walk away from NAFTA unless major changes are made, says the pact has created jobs in Mexico at the expense of U.S. workers.\nLighthizer instilled fresh momentum into the talks in early March by floating the prospect of a quick deal “in principle.” Still, Mexican and Canadian officials say only an agreement covering the essential details will be viable.
