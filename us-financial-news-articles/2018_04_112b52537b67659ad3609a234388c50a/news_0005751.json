They don’t respect Syrian national sovereignty. They bomb areas in Syria. They support terrorists. These are all issues which have increased Syria’s problems,” he said.\nThe leaders of the three countries are meeting in Ankara for a summit on Syria, bringing together two powers which have been Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s most forceful supporters, Iran and Russia, with one of his strongest opponents, Turkey.\nRussia has boosted Assad’s military capabilities in the conflict by bringing in key air support.\nCritics have accused Russia of targeting civilians, a charge Moscow has denied.\nThe U.S. military has primarily limited its intervention in Syria to fighting Islamic State militants rather than targeting forces allied with the Syrian government.\nRouhani said there was no military solution to seven years of conflict in Syria, in which 500,000 people have been killed and half the population displaced. Only dialogue could end it, he said.\nShi’ite-dominated Iran is Assad’s main regional ally and has acknowledged having military advisers and volunteers from its elite Revolutionary Guards in Syria.\nTensions ramped up between Israel and Iran in early February when anti-aircraft fire downed an Israeli F-16 warplane returning from a bombing raid on Iran-backed positions in Syria.\nIsrael then launched a second and more intensive air raid, hitting what it said were 12 Iranian and Syrian targets in Syria, including Syrian air defense systems.\nSenior Iranian political and military officials have denied playing a role in shooting down the Israeli jet or launching a drone into Israeli territory.\nReporting By Babak Dehghanpisheh Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:33:03.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
