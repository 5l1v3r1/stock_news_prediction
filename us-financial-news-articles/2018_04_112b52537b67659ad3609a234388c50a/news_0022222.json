Soccer Football - Premier League - Watford vs Burnley - Vicarage Road, Watford, Britain - April 7, 2018 Burnley manager Sean Dyche reacts REUTERS/David Klein \nDyche has twice won promotion to the Premier League with Burnley and after his side secured survival with a 16th place finish last season he has guided them to seventh this year, which could be enough for a Europa League place if the FA Cup winners have already qualified for Europe. \nMedia reports linked the 46-year-old to the Everton hot seat earlier this season before he signed a new deal at Burnley, which runs until 2022. \n“I’m sure he had offers to go various places after the job that he’s done but he’s stuck here and nothing has changed,” Lowton told British media. \n“Europe is a very realistic target,” Lowton added. “The way we work, the lads are fit enough to handle it so there’s no reason why we can’t look forward to it.” \nBurnley, who have won their last four league games, could go nine points clear of eighth-place Leicester City with a win over them on Saturday.
