Lingering concerns \nWhile China has projected an image of multilateralism and restraint amid the escalating trade dispute with the United States, Beijing has been swift to respond to Washington's rhetoric and actions. \nSo far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737. \nAmong the most affected by a trade war could be the U.S. technology sector, particularly chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor sector relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue. \nIt also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in- South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China. \nOn Chinese social media on Friday, among the most searched phrases were \"China hasn't grown up afraid\" and \"China will follow through to the end.\" Damaging consequences \nAnalysts at Oxford Economics warned that a full-blown trade war will have damaging consequences. \n\"Importantly, these threatened tariffs will be subject to negotiation, and therefore shouldn't be considered as final,\" the analysts wrote in a note to client. \n\"A (full-blown) trade war meanwhile would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and China would suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point,\" and cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford's baseline scenario. \nThe escalating tit-for-tat trade actions between the two economic superpowers have roiled global financial markets, as investors worried about the impact on world trade and growth, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. \nThe dollar fell in Friday's trade, while U.S. stock futures and most of Asia's stock markets were in the red. \n\"This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start,\" said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay. \n\"We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,\" Shay added in a statement, urging Trump \"to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy.\" Related Securities ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T13:03:39.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
