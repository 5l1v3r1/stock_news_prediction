Most people also wanted to know about minor differences.\nWhen alternative treatments were much less effective, 72 percent of participants said they would transfer care to another doctor or health system to gain access to the medication in short supply. Less than half of participants would transfer to avoid minor differences effectiveness.\nWith safety concerns, 61 percent of participants said they would transfer care to avoid major differences in side effects and 40 percent said they would do this even to avoid minor differences in side effects.\nPeople who were black, uninsured, or unemployed were less likely to report that they would transfer care to avoid major differences in safety or effectiveness.\nThe study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how awareness of drug shortages might impact patients’ treatment decisions in real life, and it also wasn’t designed to assess any direct impact of shortages on health outcomes for cancer patients.\nBut many people might not realize how drug shortages impact them until they find themselves undergoing treatment for cancer and unable to get the medicine they need, said Stacie Dusetzina, a researcher at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“Drug shortages are a like recall notices for a car – you might not be aware of them unless they directly impact you,” Dusetzina said by email. “It doesn’t surprise me that people are generally unaware of this problem but a lack of awareness obviously doesn’t suggest that people are not interested, particularly if it would impact their care.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2qjptri Cancer, online April 9, 2018.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T22:38:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
