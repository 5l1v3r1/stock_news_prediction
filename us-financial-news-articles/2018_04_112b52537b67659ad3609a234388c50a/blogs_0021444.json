He says he and other credit-card holders were “duped.”\n“Chase silently smacked them with instant-cash-advance fees, plus much higher interest rates than normal, and left them without any recourse,” Tucker said in his suit, which seeks a refund of all related fees plus $1 million in damages.\nRepresentatives of JPMorgan Chase didn't immediately respond to a call seeking comment.\nAn increasing number of banks that issue credit cards are taking measures to limit or block cryptocurrency purchases.\nThe case is Brady Tucker v.
