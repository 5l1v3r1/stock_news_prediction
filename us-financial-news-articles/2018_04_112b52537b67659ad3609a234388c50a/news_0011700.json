They freeze the U.S. assets of the people and companies named and forbid Americans in general from doing business with them.\nTrump has faced fierce criticism - including from fellow Republicans - for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling, its actions in Ukraine, and its support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria's civil war.\nU.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of using hacking and disseminating false information and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 elections and eventually try to ensure Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\nOLIGARCHS AND ELITES\nIn addition to Deripaska and Kerimov, other businessmen on the sanctions list include Viktor Vekselberg, key owner of Renova holding group who Forbes magazine ranks as Russia's 9th richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia.\nAlso targeted is Kirill Shamalov, a minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur. Shamalov married Putin's youngest daughter Katerina in 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Sibur but unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin's daughter have since split.\nDeripaska and other oligarchs on the list were not immediately available for comment but a spokesperson for Deripaska's industrial group Basic Element said:\n\"The Company regrets this development and is currently analyzing the situation with its legal advisors.\"\nIn announcing the sanctions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, \"The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites.\"\nHe said Moscow \"engages in a range of malign activity around the globe, including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine, supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians, attempting to subvert Western democracies, and malicious cyber activities.\"\nRussian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said, however, Moscow's contacts with the U.S. government would not be brought to an end by the sanctions. Russia denies interfering in the U.S. election.\nThe sanctions could hurt the Russian economy, especially the aluminum, financial and energy sectors, and are a clear message to Putin and his inner circle of U.S. displeasure.\nShares in some Russian companies targeted by the sanctions plummeted but the broader market and rouble showed little reaction to the new round of geopolitical tensions.\nShares in EN+ Group, which was put on the sanctions list and manages Deripaska's aluminum and hydropower assets, were down 19.7 percent on the London stock exchange.\nDeripaska resigned as president of EN+ in February after he was one of dozens of billionaires placed on a U.S. government list of Russian oligarchs in January.\nRusal, a Russian aluminum giant also included on the list, fell 10 percent on the Moscow Exchange.\nDouglas Jacobson, an attorney with Jacobson Burton Kelley firm in Washington, D.C., said that while the sanctions prohibit U.S. banks from helping the companies targeted on Friday raise capital, most other international Western banks also are likely to also follow suit.\nThese companies now are radioactive,\" he said.\nRussian state companies under the U.S. sanctions will receive additional government support, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said, according to Interfax.\nRUSSIA AND TRUMP\nSenator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, urged Trump to set out steps to deter Kremlin aggression against the United States and its allies.\n\"Nearly 15 months into this administration, the American people and our allies are still questioning whether the president is willing to fully defend our democracy and our national security,\" said Menendez, co-author of the law under which Friday's sanctions were imposed.\nU.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump's election campaign colluded with Russia, something that Trump denies. Mueller has indicted 13 Russians and three organizations in his probe.\nDaniel Fried, the U.S. governments former coordinator of sanctions policy under former President Barack Obama, said the sanctions list \"is a solid piece of work.\nIt doesnt do anything dumb, like go after Russian gas exports. It goes after oligarchs that deserve it, said Fried, now at the Atlantic Council in Washington.\nElizabeth Rosenberg, a former senior U.S. Treasury Department official, said the sanctions were significant, although there is more to do.\n\"I would hasten to say that Russia hawks may welcome this but wouldnt find it satisfying. And by no means would this be the sum total of what the U.S. government should do to advance its concerns, said Rosenberg, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.\nTrump angered many members of Congress by failing for months to implement sanctions on Russia that lawmakers passed nearly unanimously last year.\nBut pressure for the United States to take action against Russia, especially from U.S. lawmakers, has been increasing.\nPutin's government has been blamed for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent living in Britain last month and the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response.\nIn February, the White House blamed Russia for the international \"NotPetya\" cyber attack, which has been called the most destructive and costly in history.\nOn March 15, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on 19 people and five entities, including Russian intelligence services, for cyber attacks stretching back at least two years.
