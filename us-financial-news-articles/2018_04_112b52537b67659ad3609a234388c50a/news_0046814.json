Vietnam’s benchmark index .VNI rose 50 percent last year to rank as Asia’s best performer and is currently just below its record high. \nThe largest private sector lender in Vietnam is expected to price 164 million shares or 14.1 percent of its equity capital at 128,000 dong ($5.62) each, compared with a marketed range of 120,000-128,000 dong each, the source said on Monday on condition of anonymity as pricing terms have not been announced. \nTechcombank declined comment. \nReflecting the high level of participation from funds, cornerstone investors such as Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC [GIC.UL], Fidelity Management and Research and local fund Dragon Capital snapped up 76 percent of the IPO, one of the largest for any Vietnam IPO, Reuters reported last week. \nAt the top end, the IPO will value Techcombank at about $6.5 billion and rank it among the top 10 listed local companies. Techcombank will be listed on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange. \nThe 25-year-old lender got a boost last month when Warburg Pincus agreed to invest more than $370 million in the bank, in the largest ever private equity investment in Vietnam. \nThe IPO will be bigger than Vincom Retail’s VRE.HM equity offering that raised about $700 million last year. \nVietnam is set to host other big IPOs this year, including the listing of Vingroup JSC’s VIC.HM residential property business that could raise as much as $2 billion, sources familiar with the matter have said. \nThe country’s main index is up 9 percent so far this year but has lost 11 percent from a record high struck this month. \nTechcombank provides a broad range of banking products and services to more than 5.4 million customers in Vietnam through an extensive network of 315 branches. \nMorgan Stanley, Viet Capital Securities and Deutsche Bank are the joint global coordinators for Techcombank’s IPO.
