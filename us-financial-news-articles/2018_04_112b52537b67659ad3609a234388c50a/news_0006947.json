Currency markets are not in the epicentre of this sell-off,” said Alvin Tan, FX Strategist at Societe Generale.\nAgainst a basket of currencies the greenback climbed 0.1 percent to 90.120, having spent most of the session below 90.\nAnalysts said investors were focused on U.S. payrolls data and comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell towards the end of the week, which should help determine the short-term direction of the dollar.\nWEAKER DOLLAR? Despite currency markets’ limited moves, traders were still looking for a stronger yen and a broadly weakened dollar if trade tensions do escalate.\nSome analysts also noted that April is typically a bad month for the dollar as seasonal factors weigh.\n“U.S. protectionist measures implicitly signal the administration’s desire for a weaker dollar – and such expectations are likely to be entrenched in FX markets until credibly broken,” said Viraj Patel, currencies analyst at ING.\nThe Trump administration is expected sometime this week to publish a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.\nChina’s ambassador to the United States said Beijing will take counter-measures of the same proportion and scale if Washington imposes more tariffs on Chinese goods, state television reported on Tuesday.\nHigher-yielding currencies like the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian dollars all rose, suggesting the market was not too concerned for now about how the U.S.-China trade spat could undermine global growth.\nThe Australian dollar was up 0.3 percent at $0.7683 versus the dollar, above a three-month low of $0.7643 set last week. The Aussie reacted little to the Reserve Bank of Australia keeping its cash rate at a record low 1.5 percent as expected on Tuesday.
