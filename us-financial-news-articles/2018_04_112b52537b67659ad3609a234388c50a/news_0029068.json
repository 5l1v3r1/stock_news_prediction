The nighttime news program raised serious concerns about the company’s track record, reporting that the airline suffered a high number of mid-flight breakdowns and unscheduled landings — about 100 serious incidents reported to the Federal Aviation Administration in the nearly two-year period between January 2016 and the end of October.\nAn engine caught on fire mid-flight during one incident, while in another, hazardous hydraulic fluid dubbed Skydrol 4 filled a cabin still full of passengers.\nThe net worth of Allegiant Travel Company CEO Maurice Gallagher Jr. has also taken a $52 million dip since Friday. Much of the executive’s compensation comes from shares of the company he helms. That 21% stake of the firm fell to $490 million Monday.\nOn the face of it, the report does have echoes to another from three years earlier. In 2015, a separate 60 Minutes piece digging into flooring maker, Lumber Liquidators , led to drawn-out investigations and the conclusion that some of its flooring could increase the risk of cancer. Even now, shares of the company remain below their price from before the news show publicly questioned the firm’s hardwood. That company, which was valued at $1.9 billion ahead of its 60 Minutes feature, is now valued at about $643 million — pointing to just how painful bad publicity, warranted or not, can leave lasting scars.", "external_links": ["https://www.cbsnews.com/news/allegiant-air-the-budget-airline-flying-under-the-radar/"], "published": "2018-04-17T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T20:46:56.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
