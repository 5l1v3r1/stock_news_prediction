(“Surge” or “the Company”) (OTC Pink:SPRS), a leading supplier of capacitors, discrete semi-conductors and audible/sounding devices, today announced financial results for the fiscal first quarter 2018.\nIra Levy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Surge, said, “We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2018 delivering solid year-over-year growth in sales and profitability in the first quarter. Driven by a strong sales pipeline and an ongoing commitment to servicing high margin customers, net sales increased 23.3% and gross profit increased 28.7% on a year-over-year basis. A continued focus on operational efficiencies across the business also drove solid growth in gross profit margins and helped us continue to hold electronic component lead times below industry averages.\n“We remain focused on maximizing profitability on a global scale and across industries with the continued expansion of our customer base internationally with strong sales in Asia in the quarter. Our innovative pipeline of new products along with our strong supply chain is driving increases in customer product approval rates, enabling us to win new customers and drive ongoing sales growth. We are also expanding our internal engineering teams in our Challenge division to meet growing customer demand for new product designs. We believe we are well positioned for continued growth and to deliver long-term value for our shareholders.”\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended February 28, 2018\nNet sales for the three months ended February 28, 2018 increased by 23.3% to $7.0 million, as compared to net sales of $5.7 million for the three months ended February 28, 2017. The increase in net sales for the three month period is primarily attributable to increases in product orders from new and existing customers.\nGross profit for the three months ended February 28, 2018 increased by 28.7% to $1.8 million, as compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended February 28, 2017. The increase in gross profit for the three month period is primarily attributable to increased business with new and existing customers with higher profit margins. Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 26.0% for the three months ended February 28, 2018, as compared to 24.9% in the three months ended February 28, 2017. The increase in gross profit margins in the three month period was driven by increased sales with new and existing customers. Gross profit margin in the three months ended February 28, 2017 was also impacted by a more competitive pricing and rebate strategy with Electronics Manufacturing Service subcontractors.\nSelling and shipping expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2018 increased 10.3% to $618,421, as compared to $560,776 in the three months ended February 28, 2017. The increase in selling and shipping expenses for the three month period was primarily attributable to increases in commission expense and travel and advertising costs, offset by a decline in salesman compensation, freight expenses, catalogue and printing expenses and messenger and delivery expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2018 decreased 17.4% to $1.1 million, as compared to $1.3 million for the three months ended February 28, 2017. The decrease for the three month period is primarily attributable to declines in legal fees incurred by the company during the proxy contest and related settlements with certain shareholders as well as the completed tender offer in 2017. The Company is in discussions with its insurance carrier regarding reimbursement for some of the costs incurred in connection with the proxy contest and related settlement and the tender offer. Offsetting the decline was an increase in staffing and costs for general insurance, computer expenses and director fees. This was partially offset by decreases in temporary help and consulting expenses as well as a decrease in office expenses.\nNet income for the three months ended February 28, 2018 was $35,557, as compared to a net loss of $350,172 for the three months ended February 28, 2017.\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which can be found at www.surgecomponents.com and at www.sec.gov .\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
