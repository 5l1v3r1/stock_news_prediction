Getty Images Good morning. U.S regulators proposed another step to ease pressure on the country’s banks by allowing them to phase in the impact of a new accounting rule, reports the WSJ’s Michael Rapoport. This comes as big banks — while reporting solid results – still wait for the effects of the lower corporate tax rate to kick in and a major overhaul of post-crisis banking rules is in the works.\nSome banks had been concerned that the new rule — issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in June 2016 — could cut into their regulatory capital. The rule will require banks to book all expected losses from their loans as soon as they are issued, and could compel some banks to significantly boost their loan-loss reserves.\nUnder the proposal approved for public comment by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday, banks can take up to three years to phase in the impact of the new rule on their regulatory capital, a relief at a time when loan growth remains below expectations.\nFuture bank performance depends on whether loan growth picks up on the back of lower taxes and stronger corporate investment, writes the WSJ’s Aaron Back. “As much as we’re all eager to see the benefit,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co.
