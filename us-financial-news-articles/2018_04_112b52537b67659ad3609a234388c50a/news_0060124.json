Now, your nose can enjoy chocolate, too\nBlood tests revealed the chocolate influenced gene activity, increased anti-inflammatory agents and increased infection-fighting cells, Berk said. Further research by Berk's team examined how brain activity reacted to dark chocolate consumption. Gamma waves recorded by an electroencephalogram (EEG) suggested the treat could positively impact brain function, such as cognitive function and creativity, even two hours after eating it.\nThe two studies included a total of 10 participants and results have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal for scrutiny.\nBerk said his team's next step is to research how much dark chocolate someone should eat to affect brain function. He confesses he eats some every day.\nThe research was funded by the university and is not affiliated with any chocolate companies, Berk said.", "external_links": ["https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/experience/food-and-wine/2018/02/12/americas-craft-chocolate-makers/319728002/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/05/snortable-chocolate-latest-way-get-buzz/451423001/", "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/nation-now/2018/01/02/m-ms-maker-fears-chocolate-shortage-2050-report-says/996962001/"], "published": "2018-04-27T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:46:12.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
