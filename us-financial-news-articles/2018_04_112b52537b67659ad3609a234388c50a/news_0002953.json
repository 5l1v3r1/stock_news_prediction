He died in office in 2010 and was succeeded by his deputy, Goodluck Jonathan.\nAdditional reporting by Paul Sandle in London; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T17:04:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
