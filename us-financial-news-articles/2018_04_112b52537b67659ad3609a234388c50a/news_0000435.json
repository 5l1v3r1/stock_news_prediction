Cricket - New Zealand vs England - Second Test - Hagley Oval, Christchurch, New Zealand - April 3, 2018 - New Zealand's Ish Sodhi celebrates at the end of the match. REUTERS/Paul Childs \nWinners of the first test in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs, New Zealand were 256 for eight when the umpires offered Sodhi the light, still 126 runs in arrears but with the all-important draw secure. \nEngland made the perfect start to the final day when Stuart Broad claimed wickets with the first two deliveries but the tourists were unable to winkle out the final few batsmen as the fading light cast long shadows over Hagley Oval. \nOpener Tom Latham scored a gritty 83 but it was spinner Sodhi’s 168-ball 56 not out in partnerships with Colin de Grandhomme and then Neil Wagner that most frustrated England. \n“Series victories, especially over England, don’t come around that often and just to be part of this, especially when I was quite disappointed with my performance with the ball, was massive for me,” Sodhi said.

REUTERS/Paul Childs \nNew Zealand’s success in the series was built on their new ball attack and Tim Southee was named Man of the Match for his 6-62 in England’s first innings, while his partner Trent Boult won the series award for his 17 wickets over the two matches. \n“The bowling attack has been brilliant,” said New Zealand captain Kane Williamson. “But those two guys in the last session, Sodhi and Neil Wagner - just a phenomenal effort. It was an amazing day of test cricket.” DRIVING SEAT \nEngland, humiliated when dismissed for 58 in the first innings in Auckland, had been in the driving seat in Christchurch after scoring 307 in their first innings and 352-9 declared in the second after New Zealand’s first knock of 278. \n“We threw absolutely everything at New Zealand today, very proud how we went about it as a group. Fair play to New Zealand, they hung on very well.” Root said.
