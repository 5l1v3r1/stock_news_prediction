Both sources asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. \nLibya’s 218 TV channel, which is supportive of the LNA, reported that Haftar “was undergoing a medical inspection in Paris and that there was no real danger to his health”. \nSeveral French media also reported that Haftar was being treated at a Paris hospital. \nMismari spoke about the military situation in the eastern city of Derna, which the LNA has encircled, and took no questions. \nHe also made a general comment about “lies and rumours” which he said were spread by the Muslim Brotherhood and aimed at undermining the LNA. It was not clear if the comment was a reference to reports about Haftar’s health. \nHaftar, 75, has for several years been the dominant figure in Eastern Libya, and has widely been seen as seeking national power in the oil-rich nation of six million. \nHe has presented himself as a scourge of Islamist militancy, taking a hardline stance against the Muslim Brotherhood, mirroring the position of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a Haftar ally. \nCritics, however, accuse Haftar of fuelling armed conflict in Libya. \nHaftar is aligned with a parliament and government that moved to Eastern Libya after a major escalation of fighting in the capital, Tripoli, in 2014. \nHe has spurned the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), which arrived in Tripoli in 2016 as part of United Nations-led efforts to reunify the country.
