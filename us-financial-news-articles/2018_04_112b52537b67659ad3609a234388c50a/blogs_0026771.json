They said Brazil's government, which can veto the deal, is also looking to ensure that Embraer, which would keep its defense and business jet divisions, will retain the engineering capacity to design and build new aircraft. \nThe deal is expected to go before President Michel Temer in the coming weeks, according to two other sources.
