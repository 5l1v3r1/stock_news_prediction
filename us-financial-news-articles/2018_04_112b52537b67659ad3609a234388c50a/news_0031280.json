WAGE PUZZLE \nCentral banks in many rich nations have been puzzled by the failure of wages to rise more quickly as unemployment falls, something they link to factors ranging from increased use of technology by firms to growth in the number of insecure jobs. \nThe BoE has been repeatedly wrong-footed in the past when predicting sustained improvements in wage growth.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez \nFormer BoE policymaker David Blanchflower and fellow academic David Bell said in a research paper earlier this month that British wages are unlikely to take off due to the still-large numbers of part-time workers who want to work longer hours. \nThe BoE forecast in February that wage growth would reach 3 percent by the end of the year, though since then some policymakers have said it could get there sooner, including Ian McCafferty in a Reuters interview last week. \nBefore the financial crisis, British wages typically rose by just over 4 percent a year. \nSince then, largely stagnant productivity has played a big role in keeping pay growth low, though over the last couple of quarters it has started to pick up. \nFinance minister Philip Hammond welcomed Tuesday’s record employment figures and said they could help lift productivity. \nWhile greater numbers of people in work do not automatically boost productivity, if hiring becomes harder businesses may try to squeeze more out of existing staff, for example by investing in labour-saving technology. \nWithin the labour market data, there are some signs that pay growth is gathering momentum. \nThe weakness in headline pay growth was due to a fall in bonus payments compared with a year earlier, which the ONS said could be due to month-to-month volatility. \nAnnual pay growth excluding bonuses picked up to 2.8 percent from 2.6 percent, its highest since the three months to August 2015, and April data should reflect an increase in the minimum wage and some public-sector salaries. \nBased on the ONS’s preferred CPIH measure of inflation, which takes more housing costs into account than the CPI used by the BoE and government, pay growth edged ahead of inflation for the first time in almost a year. \nHowever, some analysts said annual gains reflected weakness in early 2017, and that private-sector pay growth compared with three months earlier had slowed to a 10-month low.
