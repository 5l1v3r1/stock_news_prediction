The Group recorded significant growth in activity on these two segments over the quarter whilst simultaneously continuing to adapt its operational cost structures to this model”.\nFinancial summary - published data\n€ thousands – IFRS 31/03/2018 31/03/2017 Revenues 25,111 25,615 EBITDA* 2,333 2,967 as a % of revenues 9.3% 11.6% Operating profit 724 1,296 as a % of revenues 2.9% 5.1% Net profit group share 153 757 * EBITDA results from operating income minus expenses, non-recurring operating income, amortisation and provisions.\nRevenues of €25.1 million, -2% in actual terms and +2.2% at constant currency\nThe refocusing of the Group’s growth model on programmatic advertising and social e-commerce is paying off, with both of these key business segments seeing an improvement.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the aufeminin group’s revenues totalled €25.1 million, down 2% in actual terms but up 2.2% at constant currency:\non the French market, revenue totalled €12.2 million, up 1.4%, a performance notably attributable to the solid growth recorded by Aufeminin, Marmiton and Gambettes box; in Europe, on a like-for-like basis, the Group recorded a slight increase in its activities despite the fall in Direct Media activity; on the other international markets, the Group’s activity was up 7% at constant currency, notably driven by the growth recorded by My Little Box in Japan.\nStable operating costs – EBITDA of €2.3 million, margin of 9.3%\nThe Group is continuing to streamline its operating structure in order to adapt it to its growth model. Personnel costs were thus down 4%, at €8 million. Other operating costs only increased by 3%, principally associated with the direct costs of social e-commerce activities. Restated for this effect, operating costs were also down in the first quarter.\nEBITDA totalled €2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, giving an EBITDA margin of 9.3%, impacted by the seasonal effect and the fall in Direct Media activity.\nThe detailed income statement can be found in the appendix\nNext press release:\n19 July, 2018 (after market): H1 2018 revenues\nAbout aufeminin\n1st creator of communities, the Groupe aufeminin provides an editorial and community-based offer covering mainly : Fashion, Beauty, Parenthood, Cooking, News, Entertainment, etc.\nWith media brands such as aufeminin, Marmiton, My Little Paris, Merci Alfred, Onmeda, Zimbio.com , Livingly.com and Stylebistro.com , the Group is present in more than 20 countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and Latin America.\nThe Groupe’s presence is gaining momentum on all platforms such as mobile, videos and social networks and strengthens its diversification strategy through ecommerce, programmatic and brand publishing pillars.\nMy Little box : https://www.mylittlebox.fr/\nGambettes box : https://www.gambettesbox.fr/\nLoom: https://www.loom.fr/\nEdie & Watson : https://www.edie-et-watson.com/\nGretel box : https://www.gretel-box.com/\nBeautiful Box by aufeminin : https://www.beautiful-box.com/\nThe Groupe aufeminin, which is 78.31% owned by the Axel Springer group, is listed on compartment B of Euronext Paris (ISIN: FR0004042083, Ticker: FEM).
