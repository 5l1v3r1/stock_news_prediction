It cannot be cheap to cheat.”\nEU regulators say that, after VW was caught using software to cheat emissions test by U.S. authorities, they lacked the tools to ensure EU car owners received the same kind of compensation offered to U.S. clients.\nUnlike U.S. law, the new legislation does not give law firms the right to launch class action but it opens the door for citizen rights groups to do so - a legal avenue currently only available in a handful of member states.\nThe European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) called the initiative long overdue, but cautioned that judges and national authorities would still hold large sway in deciding whether to allow collective action in what may be a laboriously long process.\n“For too long, consumers have not had the access to justice,” BEUC head Monique Goyens said.\nHowever, business lobbies have criticised the plans, which still need approval from national governments and the European Parliament. They warn of a proliferation of lawsuits, saying EU citizens already enjoy some of the world’s strongest consumer protection rules.\nIn response, Jourova said the new rules would not allow U.S.-style profit-seeking class action suits.\n‘NEW DEAL FOR CONSUMERS’ In a bid to deliver Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker’s promise of a “new deal for consumers”, the proposal also tackles concerns over online rights and food brands being sold with inferior ingredients in different parts of Europe.\nThe new rules also ramp up pressure on social media networks and email providers like Facebook and Google’s Gmail .\nIt would extend the application of EU consumer law to “free” digital services for which consumers provide their personal data instead of paying with money, such as cloud storage services, social media and email accounts.\nConsumers would also gain the right to pre-contractual information and to cancel contracts within 14 days.
