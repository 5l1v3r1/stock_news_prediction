He allowed five hits and one walk and struck out 10.\nClayton Kershaw and Alex Wood had allowed just one run and nine hits over a combined 14 innings in the Dodgers’ two season-opening losses.\nRoss Stripling pitched two innings, followed by Pedro Baez and Scott Alexander with one apiece, completing the shutout. They allowed a combined four hits and two walks, but were aided by two double plays.\nThe foursome completed a nine-hit shutout. The Giants out-hit the Dodgers 9-4 in the game and 19-11 in the series.\nJoe Panik, Buster Posey and Blanco had two hits apiece for the Giants. Posey had the club’s only extra-base hit, a double.\nPanik, the offensive hero of two consecutive 1-0 wins to open the series with solo home runs in each, went 2-for-5.\nHolland, making his first start for the Giants, struggled through five innings, allowing five runs (three earned), three hits and three walks. He struck out four.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:47:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
