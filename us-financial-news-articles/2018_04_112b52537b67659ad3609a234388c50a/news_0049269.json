(NASDAQ:TSBK) (“Timberland” or “the Company”) today reported net income increased 36% to $4.27 million, or $0.57 per diluted common share, for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, from $3.13 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and increased 18% from $3.61 million, or $0.48 per diluted common share, for the preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018, Timberland earned $7.88 million, or $1.05 per diluted common share, an increase in net income of 26% and an increase in earnings per diluted common share (“EPS”) of 22% from $6.28 million, or $0.86 per diluted common share, reported for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nTimberland’s Board of Directors also declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per common share and a special one-time dividend of $0.10 per common share payable on May 25, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 11, 2018.\n“We have continued to emphasize our operations along Western Washington’s economically important I-5 corridor and, correspondingly, have continued to significantly and consistently improve the Company’s financial metrics year over year,” said Michael Sand, President and CEO. “We have expended considerable efforts developing and profitably growing our franchise within our primary markets and have specifically focused on increasing core deposits. Particular attention has been devoted to growing transaction account balances, and we have successfully expanded this segment of our funding base. Strong economic conditions persist in the northwest markets we serve, and we see ample opportunity for the continued profitable growth of our franchise.”\n“Additionally, based on a number of factors, including the Company’s sustained strong financial performance, Timberland’s Board of Directors voted to pay a one-time special dividend of $0.10 per share in addition to the regular $0.13 per share quarterly dividend. This special dividend marks the third special dividend the Company has paid in the past three years.”\nSecond Fiscal Quarter 2018 Earnings and Balance Sheet Highlights (at or for the period ended March 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017, or March 31, 2017):\nEarnings Highlights:\nNet income increased 36% to $4.27 million from $3.13 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 18% from $3.61 million for the preceding quarter; EPS for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 22% to $1.05 from $0.86 for the first six months of fiscal 2017; Return on average equity and return on average assets for the current quarter increased to 14.79% and 1.75%, respectively; Operating revenue increased 13% from the comparable quarter one year ago; Net interest margin improved to 4.19% from 3.88% for the comparable quarter one year ago; and Efficiency ratio improved to 56.83% for the current quarter from 60.67% for the comparable quarter one year ago.\nBalance Sheet Highlights:\nTotal assets increased 6% year-over-year reaching $1 billion; Increased net loans receivable 5% year-over-year; Increased total deposits 9% year-over-year; Decreased non-performing assets 18% year-over-year and 16% from the prior quarter; and Increased book and tangible book (non-GAAP) values per common share to $15.95 and $15.18, respectively, at March 31, 2018.\nOperating Results\nOperating revenue (net interest income before the recapture of loan losses, plus non-interest income excluding gains or losses on the sale of investment securities and other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) charges (recoveries) on investment securities) increased 12% for the current quarter to $12.69 million from $11.30 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 1% from $12.55 million for the preceding quarter. Operating revenue increased 11% to $25.24 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 from $22.83 million for the comparable period one year ago.\nNet interest income for the current quarter increased 14% to $9.62 million from $8.45 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 2% from $9.43 million for the preceding quarter. The increase in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to an increase in average total interest-earning assets and an increase in the yield earned on average total interest-earning assets and was partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits. The increase in net interest income relative to the comparable quarter one year ago was also partially due to paying off FHLB borrowings and eliminating the associated interest expense. For the first six months of fiscal 2018 net interest income increased 14% to $19.06 million from $16.76 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nThe net interest margin (“NIM”) for the current quarter improved to 4.19% from 3.88% for the comparable quarter one year ago and matched the 4.19% recorded for the preceding quarter. The NIM for the current quarter was increased by approximately six basis points due to the collection of a $134,000 loan prepayment penalty and the collection of $2,000 of non-accrual interest. The NIM for the comparable quarter one year ago was increased by approximately nine basis points due to the collection of $204,000 of non-accrual interest and the NIM for the preceding quarter was increased by approximately two basis points due to the collection of $45,000 of non-accrual interest. Timberland’s net interest margin for the first six months of fiscal 2018 improved to 4.19% from 3.90% for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nNon-interest income increased 8% to $3.08 million for the current quarter from $2.85 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and decreased 2% from $3.14 million for the preceding quarter. The decreased non-interest income for the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter was primarily due to a decrease in service charges on deposits and a decrease in gain on sales of loans, which was partially offset by an increase in ATM and debit card interchange transaction fees. Fiscal year-to-date non-interest income increased 2% to $6.22 million from $6.07 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nTotal operating expenses for the current quarter increased 5% to $7.22 million from $6.86 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and increased 1% from $7.18 million for the preceding quarter. The increased expenses for the current quarter compared to the preceding quarter were primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits and smaller increases in several other categories. These increases were partially offset by a $113,000 gain on the sale of excess land. The efficiency ratio for the current quarter improved to 56.83% compared to 57.08% for the preceding quarter and 60.67% for the comparable quarter one year ago. Fiscal year-to-date operating expenses increased 5% to $14.40 million from $13.67 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. The efficiency ratio improved for the first six months of fiscal 2018 to 56.96% from 59.86% for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased $565,000 to $1.22 million from $1.78 million for the preceding quarter and was impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Legislation which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. As a result of the new legislation (which decreases the federal corporate income tax rate to 21.0% from 35.0%), Timberland recorded a one-time income tax expense of $548,000 in conjunction with writing down its net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Since Timberland is a September 30 th fiscal year-end corporation, it will use a blended tax rate of 24.5% for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, and a 21.0% rate thereafter. Timberland’s effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was 22.2%.\nBalance Sheet Management\nTotal assets increased $7.31 million, or 1%, to $1.00 billion at March 31, 2018, from $993.90 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $3.87 million increase in net loans receivable and loans held for sale, and a $3.20 million increase in total cash and cash equivalents. These increases were primarily funded by increased deposits.\nLiquidity, as measured by the sum of cash and cash equivalents, CDs held for investment and available for sale investment securities, was 25.3% of total liabilities at March 31, 2018, compared to 25.1% at December 31, 2017, and 24.0% one year ago.\nNet loans receivable increased $3.30 million, or 1%, to $708.57 million at March 31, 2018, from $705.27 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to an $8.76 million increase in commercial real estate loans, a $3.62 million increase in speculative one- to four-family loans, a $3.17 million increase in commercial construction loans, a $2.95 million increase in land development loans, a $1.34 million decrease in the undisbursed portion of construction loans in process and smaller increases in several other categories. These increases were partially offset by a $6.21 million decrease in multi-family loans, a $4.14 million decrease in one- to four-family construction loans, a $4.11 million decrease in one- to four-family mortgage loans and smaller decreases in several other categories.\nLOAN PORTFOLIO\n($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Mortgage loans: One- to four-family (a) $ 112,862 14 % $ 116,976 15 % $ 122,889 16 % Multi-family 55,157 7 61,366 8 63,181 8 Commercial 341,845 43 333,085 42 325,120 44 Construction - custom and owner/builder 119,230 15 123,365 15 99,304 13 Construction - speculative\none-to four-family 10,876 1 7,253 1 5,311 1 Construction - commercial 25,166 3 22,000 3 10,762 2 Construction - multi-family 24,812 3 24,601 3 11,057 2 Construction – land development 2,950 -- -- -- -- -- Land 20,602 3 21,122 2 25,866 3 Total mortgage loans 713,500 89 709,768 89 663,490 89 Consumer loans: Home equity and second mortgage 38,124 5 38,975 5 38,024 5 Other 3,646 1 4,050 -- 3,527 -- Total consumer loans 41,770 6 43,025 5 41,551 5 Commercial business loans (b) 43,465 5 43,993 6 42,603 6 Total loans 798,735 100 % 796,786 100 % 747,644 100 % Less: Undisbursed portion of construction loans in process (78,108 ) (79,449 ) (59,724 ) Deferred loan origination fees (2,515 ) (2,504 ) (2,251 ) Allowance for loan losses (9,544 ) (9,565 ) (9,590 ) Total loans receivable, net $ 708,568 $ 705,268 $ 676,079\nDoes not include one- to four-family loans held for sale totaling $3,981, $3,236 and $5,542 at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively. Does not include commercial business loans held for sale totaling $171 and $256 at December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nTimberland originated $78.99 million in loans during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $79.50 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and $82.51 million for the preceding quarter. Timberland continues to sell fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans into the secondary market for asset-liability management purposes and to generate non-interest income. Timberland also (on a much smaller volume) periodically sells the guaranteed portion of U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018 fixed-rate one- to four-family mortgage loans and SBA loans totaling $15.31 million were sold compared to $15.01 million for the comparable quarter one year ago and $15.91 million for the preceding quarter.\nTimberland’s investment securities and other investments increased $965,000, or 9%, to $12.26 million at March 31, 2018, from $11.30 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to the purchase of a $1.11 million agency investment security.\nDEPOSIT BREAKDOWN ($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent Non-interest-bearing demand $ 222,302 25 % $ 210,108 24 % $ 186,239 23 % NOW checking 227,075 26 218,422 25 214,488 27 Savings 147,750 17 142,660 16 138,518 17 Money market 130,844 15 156,665 18 118,791 15 Money market – brokered 10,363 1 10,796 1 8,665 1 Certificates of deposit under $250 121,157 14 118,017 14 123,671 15 Certificates of deposit $250 and over 17,720 2 16,208 2 15,268 2 Certificates of deposit – brokered 3,200 -- 3,198 -- 3,212 -- Total deposits $ 880,411 100 % $ 876,074 100 % $ 808,852 100 % Total deposits increased $4.34 million, or 1%, to $880.41 million at March 31, 2018, from $876.07 million at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to a $13.19 million increase in non-interest-bearing demand account balances, an $8.65 million increase in NOW checking account balances, a $5.09 million increase in savings account balances and a $4.65 million increase in certificates of deposit account balances. These increases were partially offset by a $25.82 million decrease in money market account balances. The decrease in money market account balances was primarily due to a commercial customer withdrawing funds in January 2018 that were initially deposited in December 2017.\nShareholders’ Equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased $3.73 million to $117.84 million at March 31, 2018, from $114.11 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders’ equity was primarily due to net income of $4.27 million for the quarter, which was partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $959,000.\nCapital Ratios and Asset Quality\nTimberland remains well capitalized with a total risk-based capital ratio of 18.01% and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 11.66% at March 31, 2018.\nNo provision for loan losses was made for the quarters ended March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. Timberland recorded a $250,000 loan loss reserve recapture during the comparable quarter one year ago. Net charge-offs totaled $21,000 for the current quarter compared to a net recovery of $12,000 for the preceding quarter and net charge-offs of $3,000 for the comparable quarter one year ago. The allowance for loan losses was 1.33% of loans receivable at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.34% at December 31, 2017, and 1.40% at March 31, 2017.\nTotal delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more) and non-accrual loans increased 5% to $3.29 million at March 31, 2018, from $3.12 million at December 31, 2017, and increased 23% from $2.66 million one year ago. Non-accrual loans decreased 9% to $1.93 million at March 31, 2018, from $2.11 million at December 31, 2017, and increased 2% from $1.89 million one year ago.\nNON-ACCRUAL LOANS March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) Amount Quantity Amount Quantity Amount Quantity Mortgage loans: One- to four-family $ 801 6 $ 947 8 $ 820 6 Commercial 370 3 402 3 314 1 Land 395 4 395 4 296 2 Total mortgage loans 1,566 13 1,744 15 1,430 9 Consumer loans: Home equity and second mortgage 185 4 188 4 383 5 Other -- -- -- -- 27 1 Total consumer loans 185 4 188 4 410 6 Commercial business 181 2 181 2 54 2 Total loans $ 1,932 19 $ 2,113 21 $ 1,894 17\nOREO and other repossessed assets decreased 23% to $2.22 million at March 31, 2018, from $2.89 million at December 31, 2017, and decreased 26% from $3.01 million at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the OREO and other repossessed asset portfolio consisted of 13 individual real estate properties. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, one OREO property and one recreational vehicle were sold for a net gain of $81,000.\nOREO and OTHER REPOSSESSED ASSETS March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 ($ in thousands) Amount Quantity Amount Quantity Amount Quantity One- to four-family $ -- -- $ 516 1 $ 411 2 Commercial 287 1 332 1 637 3 Land 1,934 12 2,026 12 1,957 12 Consumer -- -- 13 1 -- -- Total $ 2,221 13 $ 2,887 15 $ 3,005 17\nThe non-performing assets to total assets ratio improved to 0.46% at March 31, 2018, from 0.55% at December 31, 2017, and 0.60% one year ago.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Timberland believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company’s financial performance; however, readers of this report are urged to review these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP results as reported.\nFinancial measures that exclude intangible assets are non-GAAP measures. To provide investors with a broader understanding of capital adequacy, Timberland provides non-GAAP financial measures for tangible common equity, along with the GAAP measure. Tangible common equity is calculated as shareholders’ equity less goodwill. In addition, tangible assets equal total assets less goodwill.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of ending shareholders’ equity (GAAP) to ending tangible shareholders’ equity (non-GAAP), and ending total assets (GAAP) to ending tangible assets (non-GAAP).\n($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Shareholders’ equity $ 117,843 $ 114,112 $ 104,829 Less goodwill (5,650 ) (5,650 ) (5,650 ) Tangible common equity $ 112,193 $ 108,462 $ 99,179 Total assets $ 1,001,201 $ 993,895 $ 946,682 Less goodwill (5,650 ) (5,650 ) (5,650 ) Tangible assets $ 995,551 $ 988,245 $ 941,032 About Timberland Bancorp, Inc.\nTimberland Bancorp, Inc., a Washington corporation, is the holding company for Timberland Bank (“Bank”).
