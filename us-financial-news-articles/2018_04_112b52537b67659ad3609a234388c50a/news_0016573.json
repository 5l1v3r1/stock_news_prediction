The main thing there was to execute my own race,” he said.\n“In the 100 you’ve got some boys who were incredibly fast in the front in the first 50 meters, and worked it back on the second.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “I had to stick to what I’m good at, and that’s bringing it home. So I stayed quite composed and let Chad go out, and then I tried to hunt him down. I’m very pleased with how I executed.”\nChalmers, who is swimming in the 4x200m freestyle relay later on Sunday, said he had been battling a slight head cold but there was no fatigue and no excuses for his swim, where he never really looked in contention until the final few meters.\n“I’ve got a bit of a head cold so that’s the biggest thing I’m dealing with but you can’t use that as an excuse either,” Chalmers said. “I just wasn’t fast enough.”\nLe Clos, who has two gold medals in the 50m and 200m butterfly already, said he was incredibly happy with his silver-medal finish, especially with the time.\n“It was a PB (personal best) for me,” the 25-year-old said. “I could see them swimming right next to me at the end which really pushed me.\n“I may have over-reached at the end, but big props to Duncan.”\nCameron McEvoy of Australia, who was the fastest qualifier, had turned marginally ahead of le Clos but was swum out of the medals in the final few strokes and finished fourth.\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T14:28:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
