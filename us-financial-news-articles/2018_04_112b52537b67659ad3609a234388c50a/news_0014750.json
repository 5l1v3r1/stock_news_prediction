Its second mine, Akyem, in Ghana’s eastern region, poured its first gold in 2014.\n“Operations at Ahafo have been temporarily shut and Newmont Ghana has notified families of the deceased. All other employees working in the area have been safely relocated and the scene of the accident secured,” Azumah told Reuters.\nHe said Ghana’s mining inspectorate had begun investigations into the accident but he could not say immediately when operations will resume.\n“Our focus at this time is to provide support to the families, co-workers and employees,” Azumah added. Ghana’s mine minister Peter Amewu visited the facility and bereaved families on Sunday.\nReporting by Kwasi Kpodo.
