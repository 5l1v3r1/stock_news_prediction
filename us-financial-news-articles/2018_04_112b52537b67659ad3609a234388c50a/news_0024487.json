Last year, it was one of five countries which amended its laws to ban child marriage.\nBut it has no laws protecting LGBT people, and rights groups say many LGBT people fear being open about their views or orientation. Being convicted of buggery carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, according to the law.\nThursday’s ruling was welcomed outside the courthouse by large crowds wearing rainbow outfits and singing the national anthem. Earlier this week, hundreds of people gathered outside parliament to show support for the case.\nColin Robinson, director of the Coalition Advocating for Inclusion of Sexual Orientation, warned there was a long way to go.\n“I don’t want to be alarmist, but I expect that this will take time for people to accept, and we hope the violence is minimal,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Trinidad and Tobago.\nThe group, which works for justice on sex and gender issues, said it expected the government would appeal the ruling.\nIn February, the nearby island of Bermuda became the world’s first nation to reverse a law allowing same-sex marriage. LGBT activists feared that would set a dangerous precedent for gay rights and reverberate far beyond the region.\nAdditional reporting by Emma Farge in Bermuda; Editing by Robert Carmichael.
