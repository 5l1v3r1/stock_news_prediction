The city of St. Paul, Minnesota, declared a snow emergency.\nForecasters were expecting more than a foot (30 cm) of snow in parts of Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.

Severe weather warnings extended from Texas to central Alabama, which was under a tornado watch.\nAt least one tornado packing winds up to 90 miles (145 km) per hour was reported near Jackson, Mississippi, the NWS said.\nFreezing rain and ice storms were expected to move into northern New England through Monday.\nCars are seen on a road during a tornado in Mountainburg, Arkansas, U.S., April 13, 2018 in this picture grab obtained from social media video.
