Kramer, chairman, chief executive officer and president. \"These results were highlighted by our performance in the 17-inch-and-larger segment in consumer replacement, which delivered more than double the industry growth in the U.S. and Europe,\" he added.\nGoodyear expects to benefit from its recently announced plan to establish TireHub, a leading national tire distribution joint venture in the United States. The new venture will allow the company to work more closely with its customers in the future and deliver an enhanced brand experience for consumers as buying habits continue to evolve.\n\"TireHub will deliver best-in-class service for our retail and fleet customers and will be the cornerstone of our aligned distribution network, including our company-owned retail stores,\" said Kramer. \"TireHub will strengthen our ability to promote our premium brands, our industry-leading e-commerce solution and our strategy of targeting the industry's most profitable, large rim size segments. This agreement increases our confidence in delivering on our long-term targets.\"\nGoodyear's first quarter 2018 sales were $3.8 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago. Tire unit volumes totaled 39 million, down 2.5 percent from 2017. Original equipment unit volume was down 4 percent, primarily driven by declines in the less-than-17-inch rim size segment in EMEA. Replacement tire shipments were down 2 percent, largely due to reduced industry demand for consumer tires in the U.S. and Europe.\nGoodyear's first quarter 2018 net income was $75 million (31 cents per share), down from $166 million (65 cents per share) a year ago. First quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $122 million (50 cents per share), compared to $189 million (74 cents per share) in 2017. Per share amounts are diluted.\nThe company reported first quarter segment operating income of $281 million in 2018, down from $390 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by the impact of higher raw material costs.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSee the note at the end of this release for further explanation and reconciliation tables for Segment Operating Income and Margin; Adjusted Net Income; and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share, reflecting the impact of certain significant items on the 2018 and 2017 periods.\nBusiness Segment Results\nAmericas\nFirst Quarter\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nTire Units\n16.7\n17.2\nSales\n$ 1,929\n$ 1,958\nSegment Operating Income\n127\n216\nSegment Operating Margin\n6.6%\n11.0%\nAmericas' first quarter 2018 tire unit volume was down 3 percent. Sales of $1.9 billion were down 2 percent primarily due to lower unit volume. Original equipment unit volume was down 3 percent driven by production declines in the U.S. Consumer replacement tire shipments in the U.S. were down 3 percent which outperformed USTMA industry members, who were down 5 percent.\nFirst quarter 2018 segment operating income of $127 million was down 41 percent from the prior year. The decline was driven by increased raw material costs, lower price/mix and the effect of lower volume.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa\nFirst Quarter\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nTire Units\n14.7\n15.5\nSales\n$ 1,330\n$ 1,239\nSegment Operating Income\n78\n101\nSegment Operating Margin\n5.9%\n8.2%\nEurope, Middle East and Africa's first quarter 2018 sales increased 7 percent from last year to $1.3 billion, due to favorable foreign currency translation and improved price/mix, partially offset by reduced tire volume. Original equipment unit volume was down 14 percent, primarily driven by declines in the less-than-17-inch rim size segment. Replacement tire shipments were down 2 percent, driven by decreased industry demand in the consumer business.\nFirst quarter 2018 segment operating income of $78 million was down 23 percent from the prior year because of higher raw material costs, which more than offset improvements in price/mix, and lower volume.\nAsia Pacific\nFirst Quarter\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nTire Units\n7.6\n7.3\nSales\n$ 571\n$ 502\nSegment Operating Income\n76\n73\nSegment Operating Margin\n13.3%\n14.5%\nAsia Pacific's first quarter 2018 sales increased 14 percent from last year to $571 million primarily because of improved price/mix, favorable foreign currency translation and higher tire volumes. Tire unit volumes were up 4 percent. Original equipment unit volume was up 11 percent. Replacement tire shipments were flat.\nFirst quarter 2018 segment operating income of $76 million was up 4 percent from last year reflecting higher volume and reduced conversion costs, which were partially offset by higher raw material costs, net of price/mix improvements.\nTireHub\nOn April 16, 2018, the company announced an agreement with Bridgestone Americas, Inc. to form TireHub, LLC, a 50/50 joint venture that will combine Goodyear's company-owned wholesale distribution business and Bridgestone's tire wholesale warehouse business. The transaction is expected to close in June 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. In conjunction with this transaction, the Company expects to transition volume representing approximately 10 million units of annual sales – primarily to TireHub, but to other aligned distributors as well – beginning during the second quarter of 2018. Given the temporary disruption associated with the start-up of TireHub, the Company expects a near-term reduction in volume of up to 1.5 million units in 2018.\nFinancial Targets\nThe company reaffirmed its 2018 segment operating income guidance of $1.8 to $1.9 billion, excluding the TireHub transition, and confirmed its 2020 segment operating income target of $2.0 to $2.4 billion.\nShareholder Returns\nThe company paid a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share of common stock on March 1, 2018. The Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of 14 cents per share payable June 1, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 1, 2018.\nAs a part of its previously announced $2.1 billion share repurchase program, the company repurchased approximately 875 thousand shares of its common stock for $25 million during the first quarter. Since its inception, purchases under the program total 45 million shares for $1.3 billion.\nConference Call\nGoodyear will hold an investor conference call at 9 a.m. today.

Total Segment Operating Margin is Total Segment Operating Income divided by Net Sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Total Segment Operating Income and Margin are useful because they represent the aggregate value of income created by the company's SBUs and exclude items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes.\nThe most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to Total Segment Operating Income is Goodyear Net Income and to Total Segment Operating Margin is Return on Net Sales (which is calculated by dividing Goodyear Net Income by Net Sales).\nAdjusted Net Income is Goodyear Net Income as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for certain significant items. Adjusted Diluted EPS is the company's Adjusted Net Income divided by Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS are useful because they represent how management reviews the operating results of the company excluding the impacts of rationalizations, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation, asset sales and certain other significant items.\nIt should be noted that other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently and, as a result, the measures presented herein may not be comparable to such similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\nThe company is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of its forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, Total Segment Operating Income, to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, Goodyear Net Income, because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary components of Goodyear Net Income without unreasonable effort. Goodyear Net Income includes several significant items that are not included in Total Segment Operating Income, such as rationalization charges, other (income) expense, pension curtailments and settlements, and income taxes. The decisions and events that typically lead to the recognition of these and other similar non-GAAP adjustments, such as a decision to exit part of the company's business, acquisitions and dispositions, foreign currency exchange gains and losses, financing fees, actions taken to manage the company's pension liabilities, and the recording or release of tax valuation allowances, are inherently unpredictable as to if or when they may occur. The inability to provide a reconciliation is due to that unpredictability and the related difficulty in assessing the potential financial impact of the non-GAAP adjustments. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to the company's future financial results.\nSee the tables below for reconciliations of historical Total Segment Operating Income and Margin, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nSegment Operating Income and Margin Reconciliation Table\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nTotal Segment Operating Income\n$ 281\n$ 390\nRationalizations\n37\n29\nInterest Expense\n76\n87\nOther (Income) Expense\n37\n8\nAsset Write-offs and Accelerated Depreciation\n1\n8\nCorporate Incentive Compensation Plans\n4\n15\nIntercompany Profit Elimination\n(3)\n(3)\nRetained Expenses of Divested Operations\n3\n3\nOther\n13\n4\nIncome before Income Taxes\n$ 113\n$ 239\nUnited States and Foreign Tax Expense\n33\n70\nLess: Minority Shareholders Net Income\n5\n3\nGoodyear Net Income\n$ 75\n$ 166\nNet Sales\n$3,830\n$3,699\nReturn on Net Sales\n2.0%\n4.5%\nTotal Segment Operating Margin\n7.3%\n10.5%\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share Reconciliation Table\nFirst Quarter 2018\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority Interest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$ 113\n$33\n$ 5\n$ 75\n244\n$ 0.31\nSignificant Items:\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n38\n11\n27\n0.11\nDiscrete Tax Items\n(7)\n7\n0.03\nPension Standard Change\n9\n2\n7\n0.03\nTransaction Costs Related to TireHub\n4\n1\n3\n0.01\nHurricane Effect\n3\n3\n0.01\n54\n7\n--\n47\n$ 0.19\nAs Adjusted\n$ 167\n$40\n$ 5\n$ 122\n244\n$ 0.50\nFirst Quarter 2017\nIncome\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes\nTaxes\nMinority Interest\nGoodyear\nNet Income\nWeighted\nAverage Shares\nOutstanding-\nDiluted\nDiluted EPS\n(In millions, except EPS)\nAs Reported\n$239\n$70\n$ 3\n$166\n256\n$0.65\nSignificant Items:\nRationalizations, Asset Write-offs,\nand Accelerated Depreciation\nCharges\n37\n12\n25\n0.10\nDiscrete Tax Items\n2\n(2)\n(0.01)\n37\n14\n--\n23\n$ 0.09\nAs Adjusted\n$276\n$84\n$ 3\n$189\n256\n$ 0.74\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goodyear-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300635973.html\nSOURCE The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/goodyear-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300635973.html", "http://www.goodyear.com/corporate", "http://investor.goodyear.com/"], "published": "2018-04-25T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T17:54:33.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
