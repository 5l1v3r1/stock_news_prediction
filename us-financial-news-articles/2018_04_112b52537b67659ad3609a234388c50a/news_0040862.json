His lawyers could also not be reached. \nState lawyers initially decided not to prosecute Duduzane after his Porsche 911 sports car ploughed into a minivan taxi in Johannesburg, killing Phumzile Dube and seriously injuring two others, police said at the time. \nIn October, rights group Afriforum said it would privately prosecute Duduzane Zuma, if the public prosecutor did not. The NPA has since reversed its initial decision. \nDuring an inquest in 2014, Duduzane said his car hit a puddle and he lost control‚ veering into the taxi‚ which in turn smashed into a barrier, describing the incident as “tragic”. \nIt was not immediately clear when the case against Duduzane Zuma would be brought in court, Mfaku said.
