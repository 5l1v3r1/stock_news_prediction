I’m not trying to steer markets that finely,” he said. “As for the next one ... ‘wait and see’, I thought that’s what Mark (Carney) was saying.” (Reporting by Elisabeth O’Leary, writing by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T14:27:13.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
