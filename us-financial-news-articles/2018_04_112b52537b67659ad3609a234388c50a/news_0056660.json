(NYSE:PX) today reported first-quarter net income of $462 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.59. These results include transaction costs of $18 million after-tax and non-controlling interests, or 6 cents of diluted earnings per share, primarily related to the proposed merger with Linde AG. Excluding these costs, adjusted net income was $480 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.65, up 22% and 20% respectively versus prior year.\nPraxair’s sales in the first quarter were $2,999 million, 10% above the prior-year quarter. After adjusting for positive currency translation, sales grew 7%, driven by price attainment and higher volumes across all segments and end-markets.\nFirst quarter reported operating profit was $653 million, 15% above the prior-year quarter. Excluding transaction and other costs, adjusted operating profit was $672 million, 17% above prior-year quarter. Reported and adjusted operating profit margins were 21.8% and 22.4%, respectively, improving from 20.8% and 21.0% in the prior-year quarter. For the first quarter, EBITDA margin was 32.6% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.3%.\nThe company generated first-quarter operating cash flow of $688 million which included $65 million of foreign withholding tax payments. Capital expenditures were $325 million, dividends paid were $237 million and the company decreased net debt by $86 million.\nCommenting on the financial results, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Steve Angel said, “In the first quarter, Praxair employees delivered strong top-line and bottom-line growth resulting in a record $1.65 EPS. The 10% sales growth reflects solid recovery across all major end-markets and geographies, led by Asia and North America. As global industrial production rates continue to rise, we are well positioned to capture that growth and leverage it into higher operating margins.\n“In addition to organic growth, we started up several large projects and added significant new wins to our backlog. The strength of our backlog and potential for new opportunities should continue to deliver approximately 3% EPS growth per year over the next three to four years.\n“We continue to make progress on our merger with Linde and expect to close in the second half of the year. I look forward to bringing together two world-class, complementary organizations to create an even more valuable, high-performing industrial gas company.”\nFor second quarter 2018, Praxair expects diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, excluding transaction costs related to the proposed merger. The company’s effective tax rate is estimated to be in the range of 23% to 25%.\nFollowing is additional detail on first quarter 2018 results by segment.\nIn North America, first-quarter sales were $1,563 million, 7% above the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by higher price attainment and strong volumes in the manufacturing, chemicals and food and beverage end-markets. Operating profit of $406 million was 14% above the prior-year quarter.\nEurope sales grew 20% in the first quarter to $428 million or 3% excluding currency effects and higher cost pass-through. Underlying sales growth reflects increased business activity and higher pricing in Spain, Italy and Germany. First-quarter operating profit of $80 million rose 19% from the prior-year period.\nIn South America, first-quarter sales were $365 million, 2% above the prior-year quarter, excluding currency translation. Sales growth was driven mainly by price attainment and higher volumes to metals and healthcare end-markets. Operating profit was $54 million.\nSales in Asia were $476 million in the quarter, up 21% from the prior year. Excluding currency, sales grew 14% from the prior year, driven by 3% price, project start-ups and higher organic volumes in China, Korea and India. Operating profit was $104 million, 39% above prior-year quarter, reflecting strong operating leverage.\nPraxair Surface Technologies had first-quarter sales of $167 million, up 11% from prior-year quarter. Strong coatings demand from aerospace and price drove higher sales. Operating profit of $28 million, up 8% versus prior-year quarter, was impacted by new project ramp-up costs.\nPraxair, Inc. is a leading industrial gas company in North and South America and one of the largest worldwide. With market capitalization of approximately $40 billion and 2017 sales of $11 billion, the company employs over 26,000 people globally and has been named to the Dow Jones® World Sustainability Index for 15 consecutive years.

Accordingly, such costs have been reclassified to “Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost” in the income statement. Also, prior period full-year and quarterly results, including the income statement and segment operating profit, have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. There was no impact on previously reported net income or earnings per share.\nAttachments: Summary Non-GAAP Reconciliations, Statements of Income, Balance Sheets, Statements of Cash Flows, Segment Information, Quarterly Financial Summary and Appendix: Non-GAAP Measures.\nA teleconference about Praxair’s first-quarter results is being held this morning, April 26, 2018 at 11:00 am Eastern Time.
