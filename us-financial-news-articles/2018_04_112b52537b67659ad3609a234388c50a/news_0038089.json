Under the currency peg system, the HKMA is obliged to intervene if trading hits either end of the band. \nOn Sunday, Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said there was no need to worry about outflows of the local currency although he warned that people should not expect the low-interest rate envronment to last forever. \nHong Kong has raised its base rate charged through its overnight discount window twice in the past few months in lockstep with the Fed. The base rate now stands at 2.00 percent. \nThe city’s major banks have left their prime rates unchanged, although the HKMA has said it expects them to raise rates gradually. \nAs the former British colony pegs its currency to the dollar, its money market rates should mirror those of its U.S. counterpart, but the gap has now widened since the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates from ultra-low levels adopted during the 2008 financial crisis. \nHong Kong’s markets have remained flush with excess cash, keeping a lid on local currency interest rates. \nMost market participants do not see the current bout of weakness as a threat to the currency peg even though high liquidity stemming from Chinese and overseas investment into Hong Kong’s domestic markets is anchoring short-term interest rates and putting downward pressure on the currency. \nThe currency traded at 7.8499 against the U.S. dollar at 0923 GMT.
