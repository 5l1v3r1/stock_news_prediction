The Notes will pay interest quarterly in arrears at a rate of 4.875% per annum, and will mature on May 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. The Notes will be convertible into, at the Company's election, cash, common shares, or a combination of cash and common shares, as further described in the offering prospectus. The conversion rate for the Notes will initially be 52.8157 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.93 per common share, and is subject to adjustment under the terms of the Notes. The Company has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to an additional $22.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes to cover over-allotments.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds received from the offering of the Notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company continuously evaluates potential transactions that it believes will be accretive to earnings, enhance shareholder value or are in the best interests of the Company. Any funds received may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, which may include pursuit of other business combinations, the acquisition of vessels or related businesses, the expansion of its operations, repayment of existing debt, share repurchases, short term investments or other uses.\nIn connection with the Company's offering of the Notes, a subsidiary of the Company will enter into separate share lending agreements with each of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (or their respective affiliates) (the \"Share Borrowers\"), under which it will lend to the Share Borrowers a total of up to 7,000,000 of the Company's common shares. The borrowed shares are newly-issued shares issued in connection with this transaction and will be cancelled or held as treasury shares upon the expiration or early termination of the share lending arrangements.\nPurchasers of the Notes may separately sell up to 7,000,000 of the Company's common shares that they may borrow through the Share Borrowers. The Company expects that the selling shareholders will use the short position created by such sale to establish their initial hedge with respect to their investments in the Notes. Neither the Company, nor its subsidiaries, nor its shareholders will receive any proceeds from the sale of the borrowed shares.\nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering of the Notes.

These statements are based upon various assumptions, many of which are based, in turn, upon further assumptions, including Ship Finance management's examination of historical operating trends. Although Ship Finance believes that these assumptions were reasonable when made, because assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies which are difficult or impossible to predict and are beyond its control, Ship Finance cannot give assurance that it will achieve or accomplish these expectations, beliefs or intentions. Important factors that, in the Company's view, could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this presentation include the strength of world economies and currencies, general market conditions including fluctuations in charter hire rates and vessel values, changes in demand in the tanker market as a result of changes in OPEC's petroleum production levels and worldwide oil consumption and storage, changes in the Company's operating expenses including bunker prices, dry-docking and insurance costs, changes in governmental rules and regulations or actions taken by regulatory authorities, potential liability from pending or future litigation, general domestic and international political conditions, potential disruption of shipping routes due to accidents or political events, and other important factors described from time to time in the reports filed by the Company with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nSource:Ship Finance International Limited", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T16:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:57:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
