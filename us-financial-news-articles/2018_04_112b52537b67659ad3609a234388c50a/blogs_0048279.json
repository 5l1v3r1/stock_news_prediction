People in countries where political speech is oppressed don't want to be able to be identified easily,\" he said.\nCostolo said the data that is available, like tweets and tagged locations, is already made public by users. Third parties, including advertisers and universities, can use that information for research, like predicting cultural trends. While that type of data may not be the best for pulling advertising revenue, it may prove advantageous as regulations tighten, Costolo said.\n\"It's these other companies that are going to have to do more work and jump through more hoops to make sure they can comply with those regulations,\" Costolo said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T21:40:24.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
