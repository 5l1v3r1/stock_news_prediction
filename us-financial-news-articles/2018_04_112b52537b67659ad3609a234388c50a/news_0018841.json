He has gained the support of five parties and is currently well ahead in most opinion polls. \nAn Indo Barometer Survey conducted in late January gave Widodo 48.8 percent support, with Subianto at 22.3 percent and 28.9 percent undecided. \nWhile in office, Widodo has led a push to build infrastructure though annual growth in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, at about 5 percent, has yet to reach the 7 percent he pledged when campaigning in 2014. \nSubianto appeared to improve his political prospects last year after backing a successful challenge by former education minister Anies Baswedan to win the powerful post of Jakarta governor. \nBut the bitterly fought campaign to unseat the ethnic Chinese, Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a close ally of Widodo, exposed deep religious and ethnic divisions in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country.
