It plans to target mines that had previously been forced to shut because of a lack of investment.\n“There were many mines that closed because the operating environment was too tough,” Mason said, adding that Caledonia was evaluating a few mines.\n“With (new) capital they could produce far more gold.”\nOne stumbling block to M&A activity in Zimbabwe was the valuation gap between buyers and sellers, Mason said.\nLondon-listed Caledonia is also investing $4 million over the next 18 months to explore the area around Blanket in an effort to boost output to about 80,000 ounces a year by 2021, from 56,000 ounces last year.\nZimbabwe is emerging as the “last frontier for gold mining in Africa”, Mason said.\nGold output is falling in neighboring South Africa because of soaring costs while Tanzania’s top gold producer, Acacia Mining ( ACAA.L ), has also cut production after a row with government over taxes.\nCaledonia will probably increase its 49 percent stake in Blanket mine by buying the government’s 16 percent stake, Mason said.\nThe company is not alone in seeing new opportunities in Zimbabwe. A Cypriot investor signed a $4.2 billion deal in March to develop a platinum mine and refinery in Zimbabwe, which President Emmerson Mnangagwa said showed the country was “open for business”.\nAnalysts, however, have cautioned against the perception that investors are ready to flood Zimbabwe with capital, citing the short time the new government has been in power as well as concerns over foreign exchange restrictions.\nReporting by Zandi Shabalala; Editing by Pratima Desai and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T00:10:29.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
