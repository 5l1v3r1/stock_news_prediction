Possible candidates include Saab’s Gripen, Dassault’s Rafale, Boeing’s Super Hornet, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 and the Eurofighter, a joint project by Airbus, BAE and Leonardo.\n“If we want to keep defending the entire Finnish territory in a credible way, this is a necessity, especially as we do not belong to a military alliance,” defence minister Jussi Niinisto told a news conference.\nHe said performance of the jets would be the main criterion and Finland was committed to thorough talks with all plane makers.\nU.S. President Donald Trump suggested last year that Finland had already chosen Hornets, made by U.S. group Boeing, but Finland denied that.\nHelsinki is asking manufacturers to provide price quotations for the new jets by early 2019, and plans to make the final decision in 2021.\nFinland shares a 1,340km (833 miles) border and a difficult history with Russia. It has compulsory military service for all men and is one of six members of the European Union that have not also joined NATO.
