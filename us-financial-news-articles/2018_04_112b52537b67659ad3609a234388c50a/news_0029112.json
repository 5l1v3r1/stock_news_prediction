Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nSacha Saban, director of corporate governance, Legal and General Investment Management. Legal and General Investment Management Good morning. Asset-management firm Legal and General Investment Management will deploy the power of its shareholder votes to reinforce to corporate chiefs the message that climate risk matters, said Sacha Sadan, the firm’s director of corporate governance.\nLGIM is one of the largest asset managers in Europe, with nearly £1 trillion under management. One-third of the firm’s meetings in 2017 with leaders of its portfolio companies focused on climate change. After those meetings LGIM will vote against chairmen at companies that failed to disclose climate risk-mitigation strategies, said Mr. Sadan.\n“This will be the year we will vote against some of the people at companies that haven’t disclosed enough on climate risk…that haven’t shown how they will survive in a low-carbon economy,” he said. “Where we can we will divest those stocks.”\nThe firm continues to turn up the heat on companies to make sure they understand the implications of climate change—how they contribute to it and how they can benefit from it. LGIM last year supported 95% of shareholder resolutions on climate change, said Mr. Sadan.\nLGIM will publish a ranking next month of the “leaders and laggards” in corporate action on climate, said Mr. Sadan. “This will clearly tell [directors] why we are voting against them,” he said.\nBoard composition remains a central issue for LGIM after the firm increased its votes against directors in 2017, said Mr. Sadan.\n“We are looking at board quality, board independence and whether the board has the right talent,” he said. Information flows much faster than in the past, and the pressures on large global companies are much greater, so a board needs to have the skills to meet these challenges, he said.\nLGIM again will emphasize board independence, as Mr. Sadan said people who serve on a board for 15 years or more shouldn’t be considered independent. LGIM voted against the election or re-election of 2,807 directors last year, up from 2,362 in 2016.\n“We voted against more U.S. directors last year than ever before,” said Mr. Sadan.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nU.K. to dig into property ownership.
