Part of the Volkswagen Group since 1998, it employs more than 4,000 people.\nBentley is making concerted efforts to boost its sustainability. Its factory roof, for example, is covered by 20,815 solar panels. On its website, the business says that this roof can meet as much as 40 percent of the site's electrical needs and save an estimated 2,150 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T15:14:44.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
