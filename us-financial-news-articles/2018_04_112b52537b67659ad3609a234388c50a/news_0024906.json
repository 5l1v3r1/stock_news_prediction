Brazil is the world’s largest cane producer and processor.\nA technical body at Cade, the anti-trust regulator, signed off on the transaction in March, arguing it would not grant Yara a dominant foothold in any of the markets where it operates.\nYet Cade board member João Paulo de Resende argued that Cade should reconsider that ruling after state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA ( PETR4.SA ), known as Petrobras, announced it would mothball two fertilizer plants. The two plants account for about half of ammonia consumption in Brazil.\nNot only does the Petrobras decision change the parameters used to calculate market share in several fertilizer markets, it is also likely to alter dynamics in the ammonia market, he said.\nAmmonia is imported to Brazil mostly through a port terminal connected to the Piaçaguera industrial complex that would be acquired by Yara as part of the transaction, Resende added.\nReporting by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:34:52.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
