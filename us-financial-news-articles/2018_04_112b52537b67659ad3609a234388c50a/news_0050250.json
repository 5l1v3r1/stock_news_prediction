(NASDAQ:PTX), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced that it has agreed to participate in an investor group (collectively with Pernix, the “Investors”) that has entered into a “stalking horse” asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets of Orexigen Therapeutics, Inc. (“Orexigen”), including worldwide rights to Contrave® (naltrexone HCl / bupropion HCl), a prescription-only weight loss medication, for $75 million in cash.\nPursuant to a non-binding term sheet agreement between Pernix and the investor group (the “Term Sheet”), a newly formed special purpose vehicle (“SPV”) capitalized by the Investors has entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire Contrave and certain other Orexigen assets. Contrave is the most prescribed weight loss brand in the United States. The product was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September 2014. Contrave, known as Mysimba TM (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl prolonged release) in certain markets outside the U.S., is also marketed in 25 additional countries where it is distributed by a network of partners.\nPursuant to the Term Sheet, should the investor group complete this transaction, Pernix will receive a management fee equal to 5% of net sales derived by the SPV and reimbursement of certain shared services expenses at cost in exchange for assuming responsibility for product distribution in the United States and managing the SPV for an initial term of two years. Pernix would contribute 10% of the capital required to fund the purchase price, or $7.5 million, funded through a draw under its existing delayed draw term loan facility. In addition, the Term Sheet contemplates the issuance of two purchase options to Pernix to acquire up to 49.9% and 100% of the SPV at specified time periods and purchase prices.\n“We believe this transaction presents an attractive opportunity for Pernix to invest in a differentiated, market leading product and add to its portfolio of branded medications,” said John Sedor, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pernix. “The structure of this transaction enables Pernix to recognize immediate benefits in the form of a management fee and shared services reimbursement, while providing a path to an outright acquisition of Contrave over time that we believe has the potential to create significant shareholder value.”\nOrexigen has been a debtor pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since March 2018 and the asset purchase agreement constitutes a \"stalking horse bid\" in a sale process being conducted under Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As the \"stalking horse bidder\", the SPV will be entitled to a break-up fee and expense reimbursement if it ultimately does not prevail as the successful bidder at a subsequent auction for Contrave’s assets, currently scheduled for June 26, 2018. The sale itself is subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, completion of the transaction remains subject to higher or better offers at such auction, and customary closing conditions.\nAbout Pernix Therapeutics\nPernix Therapeutics is a specialty pharmaceutical business with a focus on acquiring, developing and commercializing prescription drugs primarily for the U.S. market.
