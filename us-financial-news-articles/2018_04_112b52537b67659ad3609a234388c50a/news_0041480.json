The rescue effort went on late into the night. \nThe accident happened where two flows of the river converge causing a powerful current, the CCTV broadcaster said. Most of those who went into the river were not wearing life jackets, media reported. \nTwo people had been detained in connection with the accident, Xinhua said. \nDragon boat racing is popular in various parts of Asia and the Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional holiday in China, this year on June 18.
