His $30 price target on US Steel and $3.25 target on AK Steel represent 17 percent downside and 31 percent downside, respectively, over the next 12 months.\nShares of AK Steel, which are down more than 13 percent since January, rose 4.2 percent Wednesday following the UBS note. US Steel's stock, up more than 8 percent this year, was up 5.2 percent Wednesday.\nChina's voracious demand for and production of steel puts Beijing \"in the driver's seat\" when it comes to global pricing power, UBS said. The country accounted for half of global production in 2017 versus 5 percent in the U.S.; China's steel exports alone are equivalent to the total of U.S. demand as well as half of the global seaborne market.\n\"Credit support is slowing in China putting downward pressure on construction growth and upward pressure on steel exports,\" he added. \"Moreover, the U.S. to import price spread should correct to more normalized levels, as additional clarity on trade protectionism, namely Section 232, materializes post May 1.\"\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:02:31.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
