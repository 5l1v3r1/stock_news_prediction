I live off my salary,\" Meade said.\nSecond-place Ricardo Anaya began campaigning on Friday.\nSilver-haired Lopez Obrador, a former Mexico City mayor, first ran for president in 2006. He said he would treat Trump's administration with respect but would demand the same for Mexicans.\nHis unconventional, and at times inconsistent, policy stances have sometimes led to comparisons with the U.S. president.\nThe 64-year-old candidate played to his leftist base, attacking the current government and saying he would suspend a $13 billion airport project he says is tainted by corruption.\nHe has promised to \"consult the people\" on reforms and plans to turn the presidential residence into a cultural center, sell the presidential plane and cut his salary in half.\nSandra Flores, 24, who was at Sunday's rally with her two children, said she and members of her family, including those living in California, supported Lopez Obrador.\n\"I voted for the president we have now and honestly I'm not satisfied,\" she said. \"(Lopez Obrador) will be able to stand up against what Trump is doing.\"\n(Reporting by Lizbeth Diaz in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Peter Cooney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:51:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
