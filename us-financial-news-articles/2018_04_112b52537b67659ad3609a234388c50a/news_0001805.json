The blast marked the first home run of the season for Martin, who clubbed 13 homers in 91 games in 2017.\nDiaz added a home run off Farquhar in the eighth to make it a two-run lead for Toronto.\nToronto’s comeback spoiled a strong outing by White Sox right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, who carried a no-hitter into the fifth. Curtis Granderson broke up the no-hit bid on an infield single that shortstop Tim Anderson failed to corral.\nLopez yielded one run on two hits in six innings. He walked two and fanned six.\nBlue Jays right-hander Seung Hwan Oh (1-0) earned the victory despite surrendering a solo shot in one inning of relief. Oh followed left-hander Jaime Garcia, who allowed one run in six innings in his Toronto debut.\nToronto closer Roberto Osuna pitched a scoreless ninth for his second save.\nChicago opened the scoring on a solo home run by Castillo in the fourth. On a 2-1 pitch, the journeyman catcher belted a 409-foot shot over the left-center-field wall for his first home run with the White Sox.\nToronto evened the score at 1 on a blast by Donaldson in the sixth. He tracked a fastball on the outside corner and lofted an opposite-field shot to right field for his first home run.\nDonaldson stared into the White Sox dugout and mock-whistled as he crossed home plate. The gesture reportedly was aimed at Chicago first base coach Daryl Boston, who blows a whistle when his team makes good plays on defense. Boston chuckled at Donaldson’s home run celebration.\nCastillo struck again in the seventh to give Chicago a 2-1 lead. His 389-foot blast marked his sixth career multi-homer game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T16:07:05.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
