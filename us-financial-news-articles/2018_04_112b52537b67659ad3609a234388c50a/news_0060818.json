The first quarter 2018 results include net gains primarily related to disposition activity of $135.3 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. FFO was $1.026 billion, or $2.87 per diluted share, as compared to $985.0 million, or $2.74 per diluted share, in the prior year period, an increase of 4.7%. Year-over-year increase in quarterly common stock dividend of 11.4%.\n\"We delivered strong results to start the year,\" said David Simon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Portfolio net operating income increased 4.8% over the prior year, driven by growth in operating income from our comparable properties and the accretive impact of our new developments, redevelopments, expansions and investments. Given our accomplishments this quarter and our current view for the remainder of 2018, today we are increasing our full-year 2018 guidance.\"\nU.S. Malls and Premium Outlets Operating Statistics\nReported retailer sales per square foot for the trailing 12-months ended March 31, 2018 was $641, an increase of 4.2%. Occupancy was 94.6% at March 31, 2018. Base minimum rent per square foot was $53.54 at March 31, 2018, an increase of 3.2% compared to the prior year period.

Comparable property NOI growth for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 2.3%.\nDividends\nToday, Simon's Board of Directors declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $1.95 per share. This is an 11.4% increase year-over-year. The dividend will be payable on May 31, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 17, 2018.\nSimon's Board of Directors also declared the quarterly dividend on its 8 3/8% Series J Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (NYSE: SPGPrJ) of $1.046875 per share, payable on June 29, 2018 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2018.\nDevelopment Activity\nThe Company recently announced transformational redevelopment plans for former Sears stores at five key locations. The properties involved are: Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). These redevelopments will significantly benefit the existing retailers in these destinations as well as the communities in which they operate. The projects will feature significant enhancements to the properties such as entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office as well as new retail brands. Construction is slated to commence on a number of these projects in 2018.\nDuring the first quarter, construction started on a transformational redevelopment at Southdale Center (Edina, MN), replacing a former department store with a Life Time Athletic, Life Time Sport and Work, specialty shops and restaurants.\nOn May 2, 2018, Premium Outlet Collection Edmonton IA (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) will open with 428,000 square feet of high-quality, name brand stores. Simon owns a 50% interest in this center.\nConstruction continues on three new development projects including:\nDenver Premium Outlets (Thornton, Colorado); scheduled to open in September 2018. Simon owns 100% of this project. Queretaro Premium Outlets (Queretaro, Mexico); scheduled to open in December 2018. Simon owns a 50% interest in this project. Malaga Designer Outlet (Malaga, Spain); scheduled to open in spring 2019. Simon owns a 46% interest in this project.\nConstruction also continues on significant redevelopment and expansion projects at other properties including Town Center at Boca Raton and Toronto Premium Outlets.\nAt quarter-end, redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, were underway at 28 properties in the U.S., Canada and Asia.\nDuring the first quarter, construction started on a 197,000 square foot upscale outlet center located in Cannock, United Kingdom, projected to open in spring 2020. Simon owns 20% of this project.\nFinancing Activity\nThe Company was active in both the unsecured and secured credit markets in the first quarter.\nDuring the quarter, the Company amended and extended its $3.5 billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. This facility can be increased to $4.5 billion during its term. The facility will mature on June 30, 2022 but at our sole option can be extended for an additional year to June 30, 2023. The pricing on the facility was reduced to LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points.\nWith regard to secured debt activity, we closed or committed on six mortgage loans totaling approximately $513 million, (U.S. dollar equivalent), of which Simon's share is $220 million. The weighted average interest rate and weighted average term on these loans is 3.39% and 4.6 years, respectively.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Simon had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity consisting of cash on hand, including its share of joint venture cash, and available capacity under its revolving credit facilities.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 1,473,588 shares of its common stock.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company currently estimates net income to be within a range of $7.33 to $7.43 per diluted share for the year ending December 31, 2018 and that FFO will be within a range of $11.95 to $12.05 per diluted share.\nThe following table provides the reconciliation for the expected range of estimated net income available to common stockholders per diluted share to estimated FFO per diluted share:\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018\nLow\nHigh\nEnd\nEnd\nEstimated net income available to common stockholders\nper diluted share\n$7.33\n$7.43\nDepreciation and amortization including Simon's share\nof unconsolidated entities\n5.00\n5.00\nGain upon acquisition of controlling interest, sale or disposal\nof assets and interests in unconsolidated entities, net\n(0.38)\n(0.38)\nEstimated FFO per diluted share\n$11.95\n$12.05\nConference Call\nSimon will hold a conference call to discuss the quarterly financial results today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, Friday, April 27, 2018.

Amounts included in Footnotes D below exclude our share of related activity for our investments in Klépierre and HBS Global Properties. For further information on Klépierre, reference should be made to financial information in Klépierre's public filings and additional discussion and analysis in our Form 10-Q.\n(C)\nThis report contains measures of financial or operating performance that are not specifically defined by GAAP, including FFO and FFO per share. FFO is a performance measure that is standard in the REIT business. We believe FFO provides investors with additional information concerning our operating performance and a basis to compare our performance with those of other REITs. We also use these measures internally to monitor the operating performance of our portfolio. Our computation of these non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures reported by other REITs.\nWe determine FFO based upon the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). We determine FFO to be our share of consolidated net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization, excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items, excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of, or any impairment related to, previously depreciated retail operating properties, plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures based upon economic ownership interest, and all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.\nWe have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires it to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment relating to, previously depreciated retail operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, equity instruments, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of operating performance, and is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.\n(D)\nIncludes our share of:\n-\nGains on land sales of $1.3 million and $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n-\nStraight-line adjustments increased income by $8.6 million and $10.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n-\nAmortization of fair market value of leases from acquisitions increased income by $1.4 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n with multimedia: releases/simon-property-group-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-and-raises-full-year-2018-guidance-300637806.html\nSOURCE Simon Property Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/simon-property-group-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-and-raises-full-year-2018-guidance-300637806.html", "http://investors.simon.com/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:58:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
