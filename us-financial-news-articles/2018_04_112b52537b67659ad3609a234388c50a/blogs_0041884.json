Such a situation could result in investors pulling out of developing countries to seek higher returns in the U.S.\nBut the growth story in emerging markets is one that cannot be ignored, Gareth Nicholson, head of fixed income at Bank of Singapore,\n\"Yes, it's going to be volatile, but you mustn't underestimate the growth in (emerging markets) at the moment,\" he said, noting that organizations such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have lifted their growth forecasts for those markets.\nNicholson argued that the Fed will not raise rates aggressively — creating a situation that many emerging nations can handle.\nOil prices, while climbing, won't go up very quickly either, he predicted, so the negative effect on those markets will be limited.\nGuang Niu | Getty Images A tourist guide holds an umbrella featuring a panda pattern in front of Tiananmen Gate in Beijing, China.
