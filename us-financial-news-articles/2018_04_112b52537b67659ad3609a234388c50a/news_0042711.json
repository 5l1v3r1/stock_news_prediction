It was Aguilar’s first homer of the season, an opposite-field shot to right-center. He was the first batter Tazawa faced in the game.\nTravis Shaw also homered for Milwaukee, his fourth of the season.\nMiami was led by rookie center fielder Lewis Brinson, who slugged a three-run home run. Brinson, who entered this series batting just .131 with no homers and one RBI, has three homers and six RBIs in this series, which culminates on Sunday.\nDerek Dietrich also homered for the Marlins, his second of the season.\nMiami starter Jose Urena, who is 0-3 this year after going 14-7 last season, took a no-decision after allowing four hits, two walks and four runs in five innings.\nMilwaukee starter Brent Suter also took a no-decision, allowing eight hits, one walk and five runs in five innings.\nMiami opened the scoring in the first inning with Dietrich’s solo homer. He pulled a low 1-2 pitch to right. And Brinson’s second-inning homer — a line drive to left-center — followed singles by Justin Bour and Cameron Maybin, giving Miami a 4-0 lead.\nShaw’s opposite-field homer in the bottom of the second put Milwaukee on the board. The Brewers kept it going in the fourth as Ryan Braun doubled, Shaw walked and Eric Thames bounced an RBI single to right. Eric Sogard’s RBI groundout cut Miami’s lead to 4-3.\nIn the fifth, however, Miami stretched its lead to 5-3. Starlin Castro lined a two-out single to left, advanced on a wild pitch in the dirt and scored on Brian Anderson’s opposite-field single to right.\nPinch-hitter Domingo Santana gave Milwaukee a lift in the bottom of the fifth, falling behind 0-2 before drawing a leadoff walk. He advanced to second on a Lorenzo Cain single and to third on a Christian Yelich fly out. Santana scored on a Ryan Braun sacrifice fly, cutting Miami’s lead to 5-4.\nMilwaukee tied the score in the eighth after Shaw and Thames drew two-out walks. Sogard then hit a shallow fly to left that Dietrich dropped for an error.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
