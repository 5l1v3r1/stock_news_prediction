It is set to more than double in size to 89.2 billion yuan by 2022.\nThe NDRC added property developments around theme parks, including residential and commercial buildings, would be more strictly controlled and must be separately approved rather than being “bundled in” with the park development itself.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T12:57:39.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
