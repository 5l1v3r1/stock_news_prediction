(NASDAQ: SRTS), a medical device company specializing in the non-invasive treatment of non-melanoma skin cancers and keloids with superficial radiation therapy (SRT), announced today that the Company is significantly expanding its global business with SRT to meet growing consumer demand for non-invasive, highly effective skin cancer and keloid treatments. Rick Golin, Executive Vice President of Oncology and International Sales, will spearhead this expansion, overseeing all international distributors. As part of this, he is facilitating recently signed new distribution agreements in markets that include Mexico, China, Germany, Cuba and Costa Rica, with more to come.\n\"Following our new partnership with Cellmark, the opening of our Tel Aviv office earlier this year, as well as Sensus' SRT-100 keloid treatment launch in China and market clearance in Mexico in late 2017, the Company's international efforts are moving full steam ahead in 2018, and our executive team is shifting to meet this growing demand for SRT,\" said Joe Sardano, Sensus CEO. \"Not only are we reaching new patients in these markets who want a less-invasive way to treat non-melanoma skin cancer and keloids without surgery for a better quality of life, we're also continuing to build relationships with innovative minds in several booming aesthetic markets, due to the recent launch of our new Sensus Laser Systems. This is the time to watch Sensus, as we are uniquely positioned to offer a range of solutions to patients so that they look and feel their best from head to toe.\"\nIn his new role, Golin will focus on strengthening the Company's global business position by contracting with more independent distributors and attending more key industry events to showcase and display Sensus' products to the marketplace worldwide.\n\"The market potential for non-invasive solutions for both oncology and aesthetics is vast—hardly a day goes by that we don't hear from a patient who is seeking out our treatments for his or her skin,\" added Golin. \"Given the simultaneous growth of Sensus' geographic footprint and product offerings, we're in a perfect position to meet this demand. We anticipate bringing Sensus' state-of-the-art, innovative SRT treatments to new territories and countries in the months and years to come, ultimately reaching more patients who are in need all over the world.\"\nAbout Sensus Healthcare\nSensus Healthcare, Inc., is a medical device company that is committed to providing non-invasive and cost-effective treatment for non-melanoma skin cancers and keloids.
