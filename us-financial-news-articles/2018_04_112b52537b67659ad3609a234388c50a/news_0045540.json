For the quarter ended March 30, 2018, net earnings were $566.6 million, or $0.80 per diluted share which represents a 16.0% year-over-year increase.\nNon-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.99. This represents a 16.5% increase over the comparable 2017 period. For the first quarter 2018, revenues increased 11.5% year-over-year to $4.7 billion, with non-GAAP core revenue growth of 5.5%.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter 2018 was $828.9 million, representing a 48% increase over the comparable 2017 period. Non-GAAP free cash flow for the first quarter 2018 increased 72% year-over-year to $691.4 million, representing a non-GAAP free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the first quarter 2018 of 122%.\nFor the second quarter 2018, the Company anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $0.88 to $0.91 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $1.07 to $1.10.\nFor the full year 2018, the Company now anticipates that diluted net earnings per share will be in the range of $3.62 to $3.69. The Company now expects its 2018 non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.38 to $4.45 versus previous guidance of $4.25 to $4.35.\nThomas P. Joyce, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are off to an outstanding start in 2018, with the first quarter coming in ahead of our initial expectations. We delivered 5.5% core revenue growth, mid-teens earnings per share growth and free cash flow that increased more than 70% year-on-year. This strong performance was broad-based, with four of our five platforms delivering mid-single digit or better core revenue growth — including 9.5% growth in Diagnostics, which was led by Cepheid. We also announced the acquisition of Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (\"IDT\"), a leading player in the highly attractive genomics consumables segment. We closed the IDT acquisition last week and are excited to welcome the IDT team to Danaher.\"\nJoyce continued, \"Our great start to 2018 is a testament to the power of the Danaher Business System, strong execution by the Danaher team and our focus on long-term value creation. Our performance in the quarter — combined with significant opportunities across the portfolio and our solid balance sheet — positions us well for strong performance in 2018 and beyond.\"\nDanaher will discuss its results during its quarterly investor conference call today starting at 8:00 a.m. ET.

The portion of GAAP revenue from continuing operations attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term \"core revenue growth\" to refer to the measure of comparing current period core revenue with the corresponding period of the prior year.\nDANAHER CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(continued)\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (GAAP) to Free Cash Flow from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP)\nThree Month Period Ended\nYear-over-Year\nIncrease\nMarch 30, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nFree Cash Flow from Continuing Operations ($ in millions):\nOperating Cash Flows from Continuing Operations (GAAP)\n$\n828.9\n$\n560.2\n48%\nLess: payments for additions to property, plant & equipment (capital\nexpenditures) from continuing operations (GAAP)\n(137.9)\n(158.6)\nPlus: proceeds from sales of property, plant & equipment (capital\ndisposals) from continuing operations (GAAP)\n0.4\n0.7\nFree Cash Flow from Continuing Operations (Non-GAAP)\n$\n691.4\n$\n402.3\n72%\nRatio of Free Cash Flow to Net Earnings ($ in millions):\nFree Cash Flow from Continuing Operations from Above (Non-GAAP)\n$\n691.4\n$\n402.3\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations (GAAP)\n566.6\n483.8\nFree Cash Flow from Continuing Operations to Net Earnings from\nContinuing Operations Conversion Ratio (Non-GAAP)\n1.22\n0.83\nDANAHER CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(continued)\nA\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical and forecasted periods ($ in millions) (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above):\nForecasted\nThree-Month Period Ended\nThree-Month\nPeriod Ending\nYear Ending\nMarch 30, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nJune 29, 2018\nDecember 31, 2018\nPretax\n$\n172.3\n$\n166.1\n$\n171.7\n$\n687.6\nAfter-tax\n137.0\n132.0\n136.5\n546.6\nB\nThis line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table. In addition, the footnote above indicates the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of each adjustment item by applying Danaher's overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment.\nC\nRepresents discrete income tax gains, primarily related to equity compensation-related excess tax benefits. On January 1, 2017, Danaher adopted the updated accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation, which requires income statement recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to equity compensation. We exclude from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS any excess tax benefits that exceed the levels we believe are representative of historical experience. In the first quarter of 2017, we anticipated $10 million of equity compensation-related excess tax benefits and realized $26 million of excess tax benefits, and therefore we have excluded $16 million of these benefits in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net EPS. In the first quarter of 2018, we anticipated $10 million of equity compensation-related excess tax benefits and realized $17 million of excess tax benefits. The benefit realized in excess of the amount estimated ($7 million) was offset by discrete income tax changes during the period and as a result there was no adjustment required in the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net EPS for the first quarter of 2018.\nStatement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nEach of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation's (\"Danaher\" or the \"Company\") results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to:\nwith respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; with respect to core revenue, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and with respect to free cash flow and free cash flow-to-net income ratio (the \"FCF Measures\"), understand Danaher's ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company's debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures).\nManagement uses these non-GAAP measures to measure the Company's operating and financial performance, and uses non-GAAP measures similar to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS and the FCF Measures in the Company's executive compensation program.\nThe items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons:\nWith respect to Adjusted Diluted Net EPS: We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition's purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net EPS, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. With respect to core revenue, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. With respect to the FCF Measures, we exclude payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the Company's capital expenditure requirements.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/danaher-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300632701.html\nSOURCE Danaher Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/danaher-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300632701.html", "http://www.danaher.com/"], "published": "2018-04-19T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:06:07.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
