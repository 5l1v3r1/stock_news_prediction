The CBI said the searches were conducted at seven locations and recovered some documents. \nThe police acted following a complaint from the Punjab & Sind Bank against Surya Pharmaceuticals, its two promoters and a Dubai-based company, alleging they had defrauded the banks and siphoned off funds through group companies, a police report reviewed by Reuters showed. \nReuters’ attempts to contact officials of Surya Pharmaceuticals and Punjab & Sind Bank officials through phone and email outside office hours remained unanswered. \nThe finance ministry had earlier asked all banks to step up vigilance following a $2 billion fraud in February at India’s second-biggest state-run lender Punjab National Bank.
