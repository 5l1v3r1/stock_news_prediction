Many farmers, it said, had no other way of controlling pests and that the result was more spraying and a return to older, less effective chemicals.\nThe use of neonicotinoids in the European Union has been restricted to certain crops since 2013, but environmental groups have called for a total ban and sparked a debate across the continent about the wider use of chemicals in farming.\nCampaign group Friends of the Earth described the decision of EU governments a “tremendous victory” for bees and for the environment.\n“The European Commission must now focus on developing a strong pollinator initiative that boosts bee-friendly habitat and helps farmers cut pesticide-use,” it said.\nBoth Bayer and Syngenta have challenged the 2013 partial ban at the European Court of Justice. A verdict is due on May 17. Slideshow (3 Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:27:19.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
