For cargoes for the second-half of May, SK paid a premium of $19 while Hanwha paid up to $16, which is the highest premium the company has paid for any naphtha grades since April 2014.\nDue to the shortage of condensate in Asia, competing South Korean refiners S-Oil and Hyundai Oilbank, which also operate condensate splitters in South Korea, have recently bought condensate from Norway.\nHowever, not all condensate splitters can process heavy full-range naphtha.
