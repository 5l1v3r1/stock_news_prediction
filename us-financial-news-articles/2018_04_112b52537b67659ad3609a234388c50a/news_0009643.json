Customers can also say, “Alexa, tell everyone…” and “Alexa, broadcast…” to make an announcement. \nAmazon (amzn) has been steadily releasing new Alexa features intended to be used across multiple Echo devices. \nIn August, for example, it released a feature that lets people assign their Echo speakers into certain “groups” intended to represent different places in their home, like the kitchen. From there, people can ask Alexa to play specific songs from different locations in their homes. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe company also debuted in March a feature that lets people use the Alexa digital assistant to send text messages or make video or audio calls across different devices like Android tablets or iPads, as long as they have the Alexa app installed.
