By UN estimates, there will be 2.1 billion people aged 60 and older in 2050. Meanwhile, all regions of the world, with the exception of Africa, will have populations where one quarter of individuals are aged 60 or older by the same time, the UN said. \nWith the older population increasing, its collective spending capacity is likely to follow suit. \"The consumer spending of aged adults will represent $15 trillion in 2020 and it's rising very quickly,\" Ahmadi said. \nAs for the specific areas in which he is investing, Ahmadi explained that CPR's Silver Age strategy currently looked at eight different areas, including the financials, health care and consumer sectors. \n\"What has been doing rather well over the course of the last six months have been financials, with no doubt, and the part of cyclical consumption, [specifically] leisure,\" he said. \nAmid heightened volatility in the markets this year, Ahmadi also added that thematic investing — which broadly refers to buying into areas the could benefit from long-term trends — was the way to go. \n\"It makes lots of sense in volatile markets to be exposed to a source of growth in a very steady way,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T06:44:19.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
