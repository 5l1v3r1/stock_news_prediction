Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, said in March that social media had played a “determining role” in Myanmar. \n“It has ... substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict ... within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,” he said. \nZuckerberg said Facebook was hiring dozens more Burmese-language speakers to remove threatening content. \n“It’s hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically,” he said, adding that Facebook was also asking civil society groups to help it identify figures who should be banned from the network. \nHe said a Facebook team would also make undisclosed product changes in Myanmar and other countries where ethnic violence was a problem.
