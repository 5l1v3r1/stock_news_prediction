Adam Schiff, said in a statement.\nThe report chided the FBI for “inadequate” notification to the victims of Russian hacking, which included the Democratic National Committee. It also criticized Trump’s campaign for its engagement with WikiLeaks, which released documents believed hacked by Russia.\n“The Committee also found the Trump campaign’s periodic praise for and communications with WikiLeaks - a hostile foreign organization - to be highly objectionable and inconsistent with U.S. national security interests,” it said.\nRussia has denied allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that it meddled in the election and Trump denies there was any collusion by his campaign. Investigations by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller and other congressional panels are still open.\nReporting by Tim Ahmann and Warren Strobel; Writing by David Alexander; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:57:27.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
