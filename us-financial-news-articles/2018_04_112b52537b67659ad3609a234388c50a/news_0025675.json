U.S. President Donald Trump called for the tariffs to protect U.S. metal makers from cheap imports. \nMarch aluminium exports were 22.2 percent higher than February’s 370,000 tonnes, customs said. Steel exports were up 16.6 percent from 4.85 million tonnes in February. \nChinese aluminium prices have been capped by strong supply, likely leading producers to seek better margins abroad where the metal is in demand, said Helen Lau, an analyst at Argonaut Securities. \n“You may see more exports from China in April because the global shortage will be worsened,” Lau added, referring to the U.S. sanctions on Rusal, one of the world’s top aluminium producers. \n“In case Russia flooded China with its cheap aluminium - as they have no alternative export destinations other than China ... then China would have to export,” Lau said. \nFor steel, prolonged environmental restrictions in some major Chinese steelmaking hubs have curbed supplies after mills were ordered to shut some production to reduce emissions. \nTraders and analysts expect more cities to impose restrictive environmental policies as part of Beijing’s campaign to curb air pollution, which may further rein in steel output and support domestic steel prices. \n“Prices for steel products in March were much higher than last year, which also dampened the incentives for exports,” said Xu Bo, an analyst at Haitong Futures. \nAverage spot prices for rebar last month were 3,905 yuan ($620.62) a tonne, compared to 3,743 yuan a tonne in 2017, according to data from consultancy Wind. \nFor more details, see \n($1 = 6.2921 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Tom Daly and Muyu Xu; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Richard Pullin", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T09:23:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
