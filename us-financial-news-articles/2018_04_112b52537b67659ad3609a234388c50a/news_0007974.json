Its shares have lost 12 percent year-to-date.\nTogether with SKion - which is owned by Susanne Klatten, one of the largest shareholders in luxury carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) - momentum holds 5.71 percent in Nordex, making them the second-largest investor after Spain’s Acciona ( ANA.MC ).\nNordex last week forecast a recovery in Germany, its largest market by sales, by 2020, helped by easing pricing pressure, efficiencies and an expected pick-up in demand.\n($1 = 0.8147 euros)\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:12:58.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
