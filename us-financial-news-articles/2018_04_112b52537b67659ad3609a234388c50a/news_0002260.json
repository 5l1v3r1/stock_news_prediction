It was the first time in three weeks that the rig-count fell.\nBaker Hughes published its North American rig count report on Thursday, one day earlier than usual, due to the Good Friday holiday on March 30.\nOil prices have generally been supported by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.\nLiquidity on Monday will be low as many countries, especially in Europe, will still be on Easter holiday.\n($1 = 6.2726 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Aaron Sheldrick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T04:37:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
