He declined to identify the factory where the accident happened. \nAn official at the state-run hospital in Horana confirmed the death toll. \n“Workers from a next-door garment factory were also affected by the gas and they are being brought to hospital,” said the hospital official, who declined to be identified. \n“They are still being brought in.” \nTelevision showed rescue officers wearing breathing apparatus, taking injured out of the factory and searching the ammonia tank for any other casualties.
