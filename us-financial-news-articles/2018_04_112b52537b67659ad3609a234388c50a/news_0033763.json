It was his second goal of the series.\nKyle Connor and Josh Morrissey assisted on Scheifele’s first goal, which allowed Winnipeg to hold a 1-0 edge in all four games of the series.\nWinnipeg scored first-period goals in both road games in the series after neither team posted a goal in the opening period of the first two games.\nHellebuyck was responsible for Minnesota’s second power play after he was called for slashing midway through the second period.\nYet earlier in the period it was Hellebuyck’s pad save of defenseman Matt Dumba’s shot that kept the blanking in place.\nThe Wild applied pressure in the third period, with six of the first seven shots on goal across 11 minutes. Yet the Jets perked up for a stretch and registered six consecutive shots on goal, causing Minnesota to scramble a bit.\nThis game was in stark contrast to an offensive-flowing Game 3 when the teams combined for eight goals as the Wild won for the only time in the series. That 6-2 outcome threatened to shift the momentum of the series, particularly with Hellebuyck pulled after two periods.\nThe Jets made a lineup change Tuesday with defenseman Tucker Poolman drawing an assignment for his Stanley Cup playoffs debut. Defenseman Tyler Myers was out of the Winnipeg lineup after sustaining an injury late in Game 3.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:20:58.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
