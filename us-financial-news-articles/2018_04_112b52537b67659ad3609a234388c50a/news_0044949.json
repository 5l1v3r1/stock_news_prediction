View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005108/en/\nSubsequent to the end of the first quarter, Regions announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Regions Insurance subsidiary and affiliates. Subject to regulatory approval, the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. In connection with management's decision to sell, the pending transaction meets the criteria for reporting as discontinued operations at March 31, 2018. Results of the entities being sold are reported in Regions' consolidated statements of income separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The company expects the transaction will result in an after-tax gain of approximately $200 million, and will generate Common Equity Tier 1 of approximately $300 million. Capital generated from this transaction at the time of closing is expected to be used to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to review and non-objection by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2018 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review.\n“We began 2018 with positive momentum, and our first quarter financial performance demonstrates our focus on sustainable growth is producing results,” said Grayson Hall, Chairman and CEO. “During the quarter, we grew loans and net interest income while continuing to prudently manage asset quality. In addition, we made progress related to our Simplify and Grow initiative with our recently announced organizational changes, which will further streamline our field structure while also deepening our commitment to support local customers and communities.”\nHall added, “Earlier this month, we also announced an agreement to sell our Regions Insurance subsidiary, which will allow increased focus on businesses where we can add the most value for our customers, associates and shareholders. This decision was an outcome of Regions' robust strategic planning and capital allocation process and aligns with our commitment to simplify our company and generate long-term benefits for all of our stakeholders.”\nSUMMARY OF FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS:\nQuarter Ended ($ amounts in millions, except per share data) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Income from continuing operations (A) $ 414 $ 320 $ 293 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax — 15 8 Net income 414 335 301 Preferred dividends (B) 16 16 16 Net income available to common shareholders $ 398 $ 319 $ 285 Net income from continuing operations available to common shareholders (A) – (B)\n$ 398 $ 304 $ 277 Diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations $ 0.35 $ 0.26 $ 0.23 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.35 $ 0.27 $ 0.23 First quarter 2018 results compared to fourth quarter 2017:\nReported net interest income and other financing income increased $8 million; net interest margin was 3.46 percent, up 9 basis points.

As a result, during the first quarter the company incurred $15 million of severance expense, as well as $3 million of expenses associated primarily with plans to consolidate between 30 and 40 branches during 2018. Including these branches, the company will have consolidated approximately 12 percent of its retail branch network since the end of 2015.\nIn addition, the company sold $254 million of residential mortgage loans during the first quarter of 2018 incurring $4 million in expenses associated with the transaction, which consisted primarily of performing troubled debt restructured loans. The company recognized $5 million in net charge-offs associated with the loan sale; however, the company also released approximately $21 million of loan loss allowance resulting in a $16 million net benefit to provision for loan losses.\nRegions also incurred a $4 million net impairment charge reducing the value of certain operating lease assets and recognized $4 million of leveraged lease termination gains during the quarter.\nLower than anticipated losses associated with certain 2017 hurricanes resulted in a reduction to the company's hurricane-specific loan loss allowance of approximately $30 million.\nTotal revenue from continuing operations\nQuarter Ended ($ amounts in millions) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Net interest income and other financing income $ 909 $ 901 $ 859 $ 8 0.9 % $ 50 5.8 % Reduction in leveraged lease interest income resulting from tax reform — 6 — (6 ) (100.0 )% — NM Adjusted net interest income and other financing income (non-GAAP) (1) $ 909 $ 907 $ 859 $ 2 0.2 % $ 50 5.8 % Taxable equivalent adjustment* 13 23 22 (10 ) (43.5 )% (9 ) (40.9 )% Adjusted net interest income and other financing income, taxable equivalent basis (non-GAAP) (1) $ 922 $ 930 $ 881 $ (8 ) (0.9 )% $ 41 4.7 % Net interest margin (FTE) 3.46 % 3.37 % 3.25 % Adjusted net interest margin (FTE) (non-GAAP) (1) 3.46 % 3.39 % 3.25 % Non-interest income: Service charges on deposit accounts $ 171 $ 171 $ 168 $ — NM 3 1.8 % Card & ATM fees 104 106 104 (2 ) (1.9 )% — NM Investment management and trust fee income 58 59 56 (1 ) (1.7 )% 2 3.6 % Capital markets fee income and other 50 56 32 (6 ) (10.7 )% 18 56.3 % Mortgage Income 38 36 41 2 5.6 % (3 ) (7.3 )% Bank-owned life insurance 17 20 19 (3 ) (15.0 )% (2 ) (10.5 )% Commercial credit fee income 17 18 18 (1 ) (5.6 )% (1 ) (5.6 )% Investment services fee income 17 14 16 3 21.4 % 1 6.3 % Market value adjustments on employee benefit assets** (1 ) 6 5 (7 ) (116.7 )% (6 ) (120.0 )% Securities gains (losses), net — 10 — (10 ) (100.0 )% — NM Other 36 20 15 16 80.0 % 21 140.0 % Non-interest income $ 507 $ 516 $ 474 $ (9 ) (1.7 )% $ 33 7.0 % Total revenue $ 1,416 $ 1,417 $ 1,333 $ (1 ) (0.1 )% $ 83 6.2 % Adjusted total revenue (non-GAAP) (1) $ 1,412 $ 1,413 $ 1,333 $ (1 ) (0.1 )% $ 79 5.9 % NM - Not Meaningful\n* Changes in corporate income tax rates effective in 2018 resulted in a decrease to the taxable equivalent adjustment.\n** These market value adjustments relate to assets held for certain employee benefits and are offset within salaries and employee benefits expense.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017\nTotal revenue was $1.4 billion on a reported and adjusted basis (1) , consistent with the fourth quarter.\nNet interest income and other financing income was $909 million. On an adjusted basis (1) , net interest income and other financing income increased $2 million over the prior quarter. Net interest margin was 3.46 percent, reflecting a 7 basis point increase over the prior quarter's adjusted basis (1) . Adjusted net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income primarily benefited from higher interest rates offset by higher funding costs associated with bank debt issued during the quarter. In addition, two fewer days in the quarter reduced net interest income and other financing income approximately $10 million, but benefited net interest margin by approximately 4 basis points.\nNon-interest income totaled $507 million, a decrease of $9 million or 2 percent. On an adjusted basis (1) , non-interest income decreased $3 million or 1 percent primarily due to decreases in capital markets and card & ATM fees, partially offset by an increase in mortgage income. Other non-interest income also reflects a $6 million increase to the value of an equity investment based on observable price transactions that occurred during the first quarter and recognized $7 million in net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments. Offsetting these gains, the company incurred $4 million of net impairment charges reducing the value of certain operating lease assets.\nCapital markets income declined $6 million or 11 percent from a record high fourth quarter, and seasonal declines in card & ATM fees resulted in a $2 million decrease reflecting lower interchange income. Mortgage income increased $2 million or 6 percent driven by increases in the market valuation of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017\nTotal revenue increased $83 million or 6 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted (1) total revenue increased $79 million or 6 percent.\nNet interest income and other financing income increased $50 million or 6 percent. Net interest margin increased 21 basis points. Net interest margin and net interest income and other financing income benefited from higher interest rates and prudent deposit cost management, partially offset by modest increases in funding costs and lower average loan balances.\nNon-interest income increased $33 million or 7 percent on a reported basis and $29 million or 6 percent on an adjusted basis (1) driven primarily by growth in capital markets and service charges, partially offset by lower mortgage income. Other non-interest income includes an increase to the value of an equity investment and net gains associated with the sale of certain low income housing investments during the current quarter.\nCapital markets income increased $18 million or 56 percent reflecting higher merger and acquisition advisory services, customer interest rate swap income, and fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers. Service charges income increased $3 million or 2 percent consistent with customer account growth; however, mortgage income decreased $3 million or 7 percent compared to the prior year consistent with lower production volumes.\nNon-interest expense from continuing operations\nQuarter Ended ($ amounts in millions) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Salaries and employee benefits $ 495 $ 479 $ 461 $ 16 3.3 % $ 34 7.4 % Net occupancy expense 83 82 83 1 1.2 % — NM Furniture and equipment expense 81 80 79 1 1.3 % 2 2.5 % Outside services 47 48 40 (1 ) (2.1 )% 7 17.5 % FDIC insurance assessments 24 27 27 (3 ) (11.1 )% (3 ) (11.1 )% Professional, legal and regulatory expenses 27 23 22 4 17.4 % 5 22.7 % Marketing 26 23 24 3 13.0 % 2 8.3 % Branch consolidation, property and equipment charges 3 9 1 (6 ) (66.7 )% 2 200.0 % Visa class B shares expense 2 11 3 (9 ) (81.8 )% (1 ) (33.3 )% Provision (credit) for unfunded credit losses (4 ) (6 ) 1 2 (33.3 )% (5 ) (500.0 )% Other 100 144 102 (44 ) (30.6 )% (2 ) (2.0 )% Total non-interest expense from continuing operations\n$ 884 $ 920 $ 843 $ (36 ) (3.9 )% $ 41 4.9 % Total adjusted non-interest expense (1)\n$ 862 $ 869 $ 838 $ (7 ) (0.8 )% $ 24 2.9 % NM - Not Meaningful\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017\nNon-interest expense totaled $884 million in the first quarter, a decrease of $36 million or 4 percent, driven primarily by a $40 million contribution to the company's charitable foundation during the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis (1) , non-interest expense totaled $862 million, a decrease of $7 million or 1 percent. Decreases in expense associated with Visa class B shares sold in a prior year, as well as lower FDIC assessments were partially offset by increases in salaries and benefits and professional fees. Excluding the impact of severance charges, the increase to salaries and benefits was driven primarily by seasonally higher payroll taxes partially offset by staffing reductions. Consistent with the company's efforts to simplify and streamline its organization, staffing levels are lower by approximately 350 positions since year-end and 735 positions since the first quarter of the prior year.\nThe company's reported first quarter efficiency ratio was 61.9 percent and 60.5 percent on an adjusted basis (1) , essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, and the effective tax rate was 23.6 percent.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017\nNon-interest expense increased $41 million or 5 percent in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of the prior year. On an adjusted basis (1) , non-interest expense increased $24 million or 3 percent primarily due to higher salaries and benefits and professional fees. Excluding the impact of severance charges, the increase to salaries and benefits was driven primarily by merit increases and higher production-based incentives, partially offset by staffing reductions.\nLoans and Leases\nAverage Balances ($ amounts in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Commercial and industrial $ 36,464 $ 35,689 $ 35,330 $ 775 2.2 % $ 1,134 3.2 % Commercial real estate—owner-occupied 6,435 6,543 7,139 (108 ) (1.7 )% (704 ) (9.9 )% Investor real estate 5,720 5,924 6,475 (204 ) (3.4 )% (755 ) (11.7 )% Business Lending 48,619 48,156 48,944 463 1.0 % (325 ) (0.7 )% Residential first mortgage* 13,977 13,954 13,469 23 0.2 % 508 3.8 % Home equity 10,041 10,206 10,606 (165 ) (1.6 )% (565 ) (5.3 )% Indirect—vehicles 2,248 2,177 2,108 71 3.3 % 140 6.6 % Indirect—vehicles third-party 1,061 1,223 1,835 (162 ) (13.2 )% (774 ) (42.2 )% Indirect—other consumer 1,531 1,400 937 131 9.4 % 594 63.4 % Consumer credit card 1,257 1,238 1,166 19 1.5 % 91 7.8 % Other consumer 1,157 1,169 1,113 (12 ) (1.0 )% 44 4.0 % Consumer Lending 31,272 31,367 31,234 (95 ) (0.3 )% 38 0.1 % Total Loans $ 79,891 $ 79,523 $ 80,178 $ 368 0.5 % $ (287 ) (0.4 )% Adjusted Consumer Lending (non-GAAP) (1) $ 30,047 $ 29,890 $ 29,145 $ 157 0.5 % $ 902 3.1 % Adjusted Total Loans (non-GAAP) (1) $ 78,666 $ 78,046 $ 78,089 $ 620 0.8 % $ 577 0.7 % NM - Not meaningful.\n* 2018 average residential first mortgage balances include the impact of a $254 million loan sale.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017\nAverage loans and leases increased $368 million to $79.9 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted (1) average loans and leases increased $620 million or 1 percent reflecting modest growth in the business and consumer lending portfolios.\nAverage balances in the consumer lending portfolio decreased $95 million to $31.3 billion. Adjusted (1) average consumer loans increased $157 million reflecting growth in residential mortgage, indirect-other consumer, indirect-vehicle, and consumer credit card, partially offset by continued declines in home equity.\nDespite the first quarter loan sale, average residential first mortgage balances increased $23 million. Average indirect-other consumer loans increased $131 million or 9 percent as the company continued to expand and grow its point-of-sale portfolio, and credit card balances increased $19 million or 2 percent consistent with an increase in active credit cards. Average indirect-vehicle loans increased $71 million or 3 percent, while home equity portfolio balances declined $165 million or 2 percent driven primarily by declines in home equity lines of credit.\nAverage balances in the business lending portfolio totaled $48.6 billion reflecting an increase of $463 million as growth in commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by declines in owner-occupied commercial real estate and investor real estate. Commercial and industrial loans grew $775 million during the quarter, led by growth in government & institutional banking, energy & natural resources, and technology & defense. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans decreased $108 million reflecting a slowing pace of decline, and investor real estate loans decreased $204 million driven by maturities and refinancing activity. The company is encouraged by increasing opportunities in 2018 as economic conditions and customer sentiment continue to modestly improve.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017\nDespite a 24 percent increase in total new and renewed loan production, average loans and leases declined modestly compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted (1) average loans increased $577 million or 1 percent.\nAverage balances in the consumer lending portfolio remained relatively stable. Adjusted (1) average consumer balances increased $902 million or 3 percent as solid growth in residential first mortgage, indirect-other consumer, indirect-vehicle, consumer credit card, and other consumer loans was partially offset by declines in home equity balances.\nAverage balances in the business lending portfolio decreased $325 million or 1 percent primarily due to elevated loan payoffs and pay downs as well as de-risking efforts within certain loan portfolios throughout the prior year, including decreases in direct energy loans, multi-family investor real estate loans, and medical office building loans. In addition, declines in owner-occupied commercial real estate loans reflect the competitive market and continued softness in loan demand from middle market and small business customers.\nDeposits\nAverage Balances ($ amounts in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Low-cost deposits $ 88,615 $ 90,125 $ 90,819 $ (1,510 ) (1.7 )% $ (2,204 ) (2.4 )% Time deposits 6,813 6,935 7,148 (122 ) (1.8 )% (335 ) (4.7 )% Total Deposits $ 95,428 $ 97,060 $ 97,967 $ (1,632 ) (1.7 )% $ (2,539 ) (2.6 )% ($ amounts in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 1Q18 vs. 4Q17 1Q18 vs. 1Q17 Consumer Bank Segment $ 57,146 $ 56,921 $ 56,243 $ 225 0.4 % $ 903 1.6 % Corporate Bank Segment 27,672 28,362 28,165 (690 ) (2.4 )% (493 ) (1.8 )% Wealth Management Segment 8,942 9,163 10,041 (221 ) (2.4 )% (1,099 ) (10.9 )% Other 1,668 2,614 3,518 (946 ) (36.2 )% (1,850 ) (52.6 )% Total Deposits $ 95,428 $ 97,060 $ 97,967 $ (1,632 ) (1.7 )% $ (2,539 ) (2.6 )% Comparison of first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017\nTotal average deposit balances decreased $1.6 billion to $95.4 billion in the first quarter reflecting continued optimization of the company's deposit portfolio reducing certain higher cost brokered and collateralized deposits. Average low-cost deposits represented 93 percent of total average deposits, and deposit costs increased to 21 basis points, while total funding costs remained low at 46 basis points in the first quarter.\nAverage deposits in the Consumer segment increased $225 million while average Corporate segment deposits decreased $690 million, or 2 percent driven primarily by seasonal declines. Average deposits in the Wealth Management segment declined $221 million or 2 percent and includes the impact of ongoing strategic reductions of certain collateralized deposits. Average deposits in the Other segment decreased $946 million or 36 percent driven primarily by the decision to reduce higher cost retail brokered sweep deposits that were no longer a necessary component of the company's current funding strategy.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017\nTotal average deposit balances decreased $2.5 billion or 3 percent from the prior year. Growth in average Consumer segment deposits was offset by strategic reductions in Corporate, Wealth Management, and Other segment deposits.\nAsset quality\nAs of and for the Quarter Ended ($ amounts in millions) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 ALL/Loans, net 1.05 % 1.17 % 1.33 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale 1.40x 1.44x 1.06x Net loan charge-offs as a % of average loans, annualized 0.42 % 0.31 % 0.51 % Adjusted net loan charge-offs as a % of average loans (non-GAAP), annualized 0.40 % 0.31 % 0.51 % Non-accrual loans, excluding loans held for sale/Loans, net 0.75 % 0.81 % 1.26 % NPAs (ex. 90+ past due)/Loans, foreclosed properties and non-performing loans held for sale 0.85 % 0.92 % 1.37 % NPAs (inc. 90+ past due)/Loans, foreclosed properties and non-performing loans held for sale* 1.02 % 1.13 % 1.57 % Total TDRs, excluding loans held for sale $ 996 $ 1,144 $ 1,364 Total Criticized Loans—Business Services ** $ 2,223 $ 2,456 $ 3,538 * Excludes guaranteed residential first mortgages that are 90+ days past due and still accruing.\n** Business services represents the combined total of commercial and investor real estate loans.\nComparison of first quarter 2018 to fourth quarter 2017\nBroad-based asset quality improvement continued during the first quarter. Non-performing, criticized and troubled debt restructured loans, as well as total delinquencies, all declined. Total non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, decreased 8 percent to 0.75 percent of loans outstanding, marking consecutive quarters at a new 10-year low. Business services criticized and total troubled debt restructured loans decreased 9 percent and 13 percent, respectively, and total delinquencies decreased 4 percent.\nNet charge-offs totaled $84 million or 0.42 percent of average loans compared to $63 million or 0.31 percent of average loans in the previous quarter. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily attributable to larger recoveries in the fourth quarter and approximately $5 million associated with the sale of primarily troubled debt restructured residential mortgage loans during the current quarter. Improving economic conditions drove improvements in credit metrics, particularly pay downs and payoffs of adversely rated loans. This improvement, combined with a $30 million reduction of hurricane-specific allowance and a $21 million reduction of allowance associated with the loan sale, resulted in a credit provision of $10 million. The allowance for loan and lease losses decreased 12 basis points to 1.05 percent of total loans outstanding. The resulting allowance for loan and lease losses as a percent of total non-accrual loans decreased 4 basis points to 140 percent.

Possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. The effects of a possible downgrade in the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating or outlook, which could result in risks to us and general economic conditions that we are not able to predict. Possible changes in market interest rates or capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital and liquidity. Any impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles, any repricing of assets, or any adjustment of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets due to changes in law, adverse changes in the economic environment, declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors. The effect of changes in tax laws, including the effect of Tax Reform and any future interpretations of or amendments to Tax Reform, which may impact our earnings, capital ratios and our ability to return capital to shareholders. Possible changes in the creditworthiness of customers and the possible impairment of the collectability of loans and leases, including operating leases. Changes in the speed of loan prepayments, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs, loan loss provisions or actual loan losses where our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover our eventual losses. Possible acceleration of prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to low interest rates, and the related acceleration of premium amortization on those securities. Loss of customer checking and savings account deposits as customers pursue other, higher-yield investments, which could increase our funding costs. Possible changes in consumer and business spending and saving habits and the related effect on our ability to increase assets and to attract deposits, which could adversely affect our net income. Our ability to effectively compete with other traditional and non-traditional financial services companies, some of whom possess greater financial resources than we do or are subject to different regulatory standards than we are. Our inability to develop and gain acceptance from current and prospective customers for new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and services to meet customers’ needs and respond to emerging technological trends in a timely manner could have a negative impact on our revenue. Our inability to keep pace with technological changes could result in losing business to competitors. Changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses, including legislation and regulations relating to bank products and services, as well as changes in the enforcement and interpretation of such laws and regulations by applicable governmental and self-regulatory agencies, which could require us to change certain business practices, increase compliance risk, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses. Our ability to obtain a regulatory non-objection (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) to take certain capital actions, including paying dividends and any plans to increase common stock dividends, repurchase common stock under current or future programs, or redeem preferred stock or other regulatory capital instruments, may impact our ability to return capital to stockholders and market perceptions of us. Our ability to comply with stress testing and capital planning requirements (as part of the CCAR process or otherwise) may continue to require a significant investment of our managerial resources due to the importance and intensity of such tests and requirements. Our ability to comply with applicable capital and liquidity requirements (including, among other things, the Basel III capital standards and the LCR rule), including our ability to generate capital internally or raise capital on favorable terms, and if we fail to meet requirements, our financial condition could be negatively impacted.

The risks and uncertainties related to our acquisition or divestiture of businesses. The success of our marketing efforts in attracting and retaining customers. Our ability to recruit and retain talented and experienced personnel to assist in the development, management and operation of our products and services may be affected by changes in laws and regulations in effect from time to time. Fraud or misconduct by our customers, employees or business partners. Any inaccurate or incomplete information provided to us by our customers or counterparties. Inability of our framework to manage risks associated with our business such as credit risk and operational risk, including third-party vendors and other service providers, which could, among other things, result in a breach of operating or security systems as a result of a cyber attack or similar act or failure to deliver our services effectively. Dependence on key suppliers or vendors to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms. The inability of our internal controls and procedures to prevent, detect or mitigate any material errors or fraudulent acts.

The effects of man-made and natural disasters, including fires, floods, droughts, tornadoes, hurricanes, and environmental damage, which may negatively affect our operations and/or our loan portfolios and increase our cost of conducting business. Changes in commodity market prices and conditions could adversely affect the cash flows of our borrowers operating in industries that are impacted by changes in commodity prices (including businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in the production of commodities), which could impair their ability to service any loans outstanding to them and/or reduce demand for loans in those industries. Our ability to identify and address cyber-security risks such as data security breaches, malware, “denial of service” attacks, “hacking” and identity theft, a failure of which could disrupt our business and result in the disclosure of and/or misuse or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary information, disruption or damage to our systems, increased costs, losses, or adverse effects to our reputation. Our ability to realize our adjusted efficiency ratio target as part of our expense management initiatives. Possible downgrades in our credit ratings or outlook could increase the costs of funding from capital markets. The effects of problems encountered by other financial institutions that adversely affect us or the banking industry generally could require us to change certain business practices, reduce our revenue, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise negatively affect our businesses. The effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of and/or misuse of confidential information or proprietary information, increase our costs, negatively affect our reputation, and cause losses. Our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends to stockholders. Changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies could materially affect how we report our financial results.

Non-interest expense (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the efficiency ratio. Net interest income and other financing income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income (non-GAAP). Non-interest income (GAAP) is presented excluding certain adjustments to arrive at adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP), which is the numerator for the fee income ratio. Adjusted non-interest income (non-GAAP) and adjusted non-interest expense (non-GAAP) are used to determine adjusted pre-tax pre-provision income (non-GAAP). Net interest income and other financing income (GAAP) on a taxable-equivalent basis and non-interest income are added together to arrive at total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis is presented excluding certain adjustments related to tax reform to arrive at adjusted net interest income and other financing income on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). Adjustments are made to arrive at adjusted total revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP), which is the denominator for the fee income and efficiency ratios. Regions believes that the exclusion of these adjustments provides a meaningful base for period-to-period comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the Company and predicting future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of Regions’ business. It is possible that the activities related to the adjustments may recur; however, management does not consider the activities related to the adjustments to be indications of ongoing operations. Regions believes that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the Company on the same basis as that applied by management.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans, or coverage ratio is an important credit metric to many investors. Much of the Company's energy exposure is collateralized and therefore requires a lower specific allowance. Adjusting the Company's total allowance for loan losses to exclude the portion attributable to energy and excluding non-accrual energy loans produces an adjusted coverage ratio that management believes could be meaningful to investors.\nTangible common stockholders’ equity ratios have become a focus of some investors and management believes they may assist investors in analyzing the capital position of the Company absent the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Analysts and banking regulators have assessed Regions’ capital adequacy using the tangible common stockholders’ equity measure. Because tangible common stockholders’ equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in any amount by federal banking regulations it is currently considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure and other entities may calculate it differently than Regions’ disclosed calculations. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess Regions’ capital adequacy using tangible common stockholders’ equity, management believes that it is useful to provide investors the ability to assess Regions’ capital adequacy on this same basis.\nThe calculation of the fully phased-in pro-forma \"Common equity Tier 1\" (CET1) is based on Regions’ understanding of the Final Basel III requirements. For Regions, the Basel III framework became effective on a phased-in approach starting in 2015 with full implementation beginning in 2019. The calculation includes estimated pro-forma amounts for the ratio on a fully phased-in basis. Regions’ current understanding of the final framework includes certain assumptions, including the Company’s interpretation of the requirements, and informal feedback received through the regulatory process. Regions’ understanding of the framework is evolving and will likely change as analysis and discussions with regulators continue. Because Regions is not currently subject to the fully-phased in capital rules, this pro-forma measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure, and other entities may calculate it differently from Regions’ disclosed calculation.\nA company's regulatory capital is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a company’s balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the prescribed risk-weighted percentage. The resulting weighted values from each of the categories are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator of certain risk-based capital ratios. CET1 capital is then divided by this denominator (risk-weighted assets) to determine the CET1 capital ratio. The amounts disclosed as risk-weighted assets are calculated consistent with banking regulatory requirements on a fully phased-in basis.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. In particular, a measure of earnings that excludes selected items does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders.\nManagement and the Board of Directors utilize non-GAAP measures as follows:\nPreparation of Regions' operating budgets Monthly financial performance reporting Monthly close-out reporting of consolidated results (management only) Presentation to investors of company performance\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005108/en/\nRegions Financial Corporation\nMedia Contact:\nEvelyn Mitchell, 205-264-4551\nor\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nDana Nolan, 205-264-7040\nSource: Regions Financial Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regions.com&esheet=51792255&newsitemid=20180420005108&lan=en-US&anchor=www.regions.com&index=1&md5=b5bb2865843dda3791d53947af85c74c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.regions.com&esheet=51792255&newsitemid=20180420005108&lan=en-US&anchor=www.regions.com&index=2&md5=fc038043df3ecd50ca18b9cc02dc5553", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005108/en/"], "published": "2018-04-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T16:26:44.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
