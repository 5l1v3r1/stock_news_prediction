(Profit taking has brought the currency back to $7,698 as of 9:00am ET, but it’s still up 11% so far for the day.) \nNobody seems quite sure what caused the surge, though there has been some speculation lately that institutional investors could increase demand, which could have led to the bullish turn. \nAnother theory is short sellers were responsible for the spike. Once Bitcoin crossed the $7,000 mark, that might have triggered a buying surge. \nRegardless of the reason, the bull market quickly spread to other cryptocurrencies, furthering the volatility for which the market is known . \nBitcoin Cash is up 9%. Ethereum is posting its own 11% gains this morning. And Litecoin is up 7%. And CoinMarketCap reports Ripple is seeing an 11% surge as well.
