REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo \nCLS, a major settler of trades in the foreign exchange market, said in a statement that the average daily traded FX volumes submitted to it reached $1.87 trillion (Â£1.31 trillion) between January and March, surpassing a previous high of $1.67 trillion in the first quarter of 2013. \nDaily volumes in March reached $1.855 trillion, down 4.8 percent on February but up on a year earlier. \nAs well as volatility, CLS attributed the rise in volumes to a trend of more buy-side firms like asset managers using its services. \nVolatility across financial markets spiked in February after years of being low. \nHowever, while volatility in other asset classes has remained elevated, driven in part by concerns about a possible U.S.-China trade war and a rise in interest rates, foreign exchange markets have been much quieter, with trading of key currency pairs stuck in narrow price ranges.
