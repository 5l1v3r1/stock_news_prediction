But what if that beer and whiskey came in the same glass instead?\nBudweiser and Jim Beam have teamed up to create a beer inspired by the popular order. Called Budweiser Reserve Copper Lager, the beer will be brewed with two-row barley and then aged on Jim Beam bourbon barrel staves, Esquire reports .\nThe process is to give the beer a “toasty oak aroma and nutty taste, with caramel and vanilla notes.”\nThe limited-edition beer is set to launch in September on the 85th anniversary of the repeal of Prohibition, but beforehand the brands plan to launch a “beer and a bourbon shot” promotion at bars across the country.\nAnd the beer certainly won’t be the only bourbon barrel-aged option on the market. Craft breweries have been making barrel-aged beers for quite some time, including Budweiser-owned Goose Island, which makes an exceptionally popular Bourbon County Stout each year .\nThe brands’ “beer and a bourbon shot” promotion starts rolling out to bars this month.", "external_links": ["https://www.esquire.com/food-drink/drinks/a19669667/new-budweiser-jim-beam-beer/"], "published": "2018-04-04T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T06:36:04.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
