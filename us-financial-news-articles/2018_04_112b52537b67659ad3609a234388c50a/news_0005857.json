The DAX (German stock index) logo is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI declined 0.8 percent, with industrials, consumer staples and financials the biggest weights. \nThe tech sector .SX8P dropped 1 percent, weighed by chipmakers after an overnight report that Apple plans to replace Intel chips in Macs with its own. \nThe index has fallen 8 percent in the past three weeks as anxiety grew over big tech companies with the focus on Facebook’s use of data, and regulation of Amazon. \nReports of Apple increasingly going down the “insourcing” route have dented shares in Apple suppliers around the world, most notably Europe’s Dialog Semiconductor ( DLGS.DE ) which has shed more than 60 percent in the past year. \nOn Tuesday ams led the falls, down 2.8 percent, while STMicro ( STM.MI ) declined 2.3 percent and Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) fell 1.7 percent. \nRisk appetite was poor across the board, as European investors followed U.S. and Asian investors to the exit after China retaliated against U.S. tariffs. \nOutside the tech sector, food services group Sodexo ( EXHO.PA ) was the worst-performing on the STOXX, down 3.8 percent after Goldman Sachs cut the stock to “neutral”, citing competition and cost inflation. \nAcquisition news also continued to move the European market. \nEurofins Scientific ( EUFI.PA ) shares fell 2.9 percent, the worst performers on the STOXX, after the firm acquired Lab Frontier in South Korea. \nBasic resources and oil & gas stocks were a rare bright spot, making gains as metals prices rose.
