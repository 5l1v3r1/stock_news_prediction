Higher bond yields, meanwhile, also reduce the attraction of non-yielding gold.\nSpot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,316.72 an ounce after on Wednesday, while U.S. gold futures settled down $4.90 at $1,317.90 an ounce.\n\"At these low (price) levels, the market could now attract some physical buying interest,\" said Peter Fung, head of dealing at Wing Fung Precious Metals in Hong Kong. \"The market has a very good (physical) support at around $1,310-$1,315.\"\nGold has been stuck in a trading range between about $1,360 and $1,310 since hitting a 1-1/2 year high of $1,366.07 in January. It has been supported by geopolitical uncertainty, which has fueled demand for gold as a safe haven, but has been prevented from moving higher by fears of rising U.S. interest rates that would push up bond yields and strengthen the dollar.\nU.S. GDP and inflation data on Friday could give new direction to prices, said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.\nStronger than expected economic growth or inflation would hurt gold by bolstering expectations of more rapid increases to interest rates.\nIn other precious metals, silver was flat at $16.52 an ounce after falling more than 1 percent on Wednesday. Platinum was down 0.2 percent at $903.99 and palladium was up 0.4 percent at $982.22.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T11:52:37.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
