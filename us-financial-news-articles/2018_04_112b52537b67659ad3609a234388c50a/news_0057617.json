He added that the proposal \"would have to be an initiative that the art fairs start.\"\nIt was, he explained, \"a little bit like a tax: you make a little more money, and you get taxed a little bit.\" He asked Mr. Glimcher, who was in the audience, whether he agreed, and Mr. Glimcher shouted back: \"Let's do it.\"\nIn a panel discussion on Thursday, the proposal was also embraced by Ms. Dee. She said that if 10 percent of the galleries in the Independent Art Fair — meaning five or six of them — were each asked to pay an extra $10,000 for their stand on top of a rental cost that typically runs in the tens of thousands, it would be \"a drop in the bucket\" for them. That money, distributed \"from the smallest stand up,\" would translate into 12.5 to 14 percent discounts on about 40 percent of the stands, she added.\n\"We are very happy to do it,\" she said. \"We have been talking about this for a long time with the galleries.\"\nThe global director of Art Basel, Marc Spiegler, who was on the same panel, said, \"In principle, it's great,\" so long as the stands were paid for and the fair made a profit. \"But the question is how many galleries at the top of the market are willing to subsidize the rest of the fair.\"\n\"We have no issue with the idea of trying to work more closely in terms of helping the younger galleries at the fair,\" he said, \"but the way to do that, the algorithm for figuring out how to do this, is difficult to reach.\" It was, he added, a question of \"how much and how many of the dealers at the top of the game\" were willing to participate.", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/arts/berlin-living-artists.html", "https://www.nytartleadersnetwork.com/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/arts/design/david-zwirner-expands-in-chelsea.html", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/arts/design/mona-lisa-instagram-art.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Farts&action=click&contentCollection=arts&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=6&pgtype=sectionfront", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/arts/berlin-gallery-weekend.html"], "published": "2018-04-27T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T21:25:41.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
