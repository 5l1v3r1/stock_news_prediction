The organization ended the year with a net operating loss of $62.7 million on full-year revenues of $12.5 billion, for a negative operating margin of 0.5% and a pre-tax net gain of $148.3 million. For the year, $11.2 billion of medical claim payments were incurred which represented 90 cents of every premium dollar going directly to cover health care costs. Additionally, Blue Cross paid more than $67 million in taxes, assessments and surcharges. Total member enrollment remained flat at 2.9 million members.\nAudited results include the consolidated financial statements for businesses operating under Aware Integrated Inc.

Both Prepaid Medical Assistance Program (PMAP), the state Medicaid program – and MinnesotaCare, the health program for low-income families – saw significant reductions in operational losses compared to 2016. Overall, Blue Plus reported an operating gain of $9.3 million on revenues of $2.4 billion for an operating margin of 0.4%. The reported net gain of $32.2 million for Blue Plus reflects investment income and capital gains on Blue Plus' specific portfolio of securities.\nThe performance of individual commercial products available through Blue Plus demonstrated early signs of stabilization for the year by generating positive operating results of $52 million on $298 million in revenue. This marks the first year of positive financial performance in the individual product segment following three consecutive years of losses incurred by Blue Cross that totaled more than $500 million.\nThe lines of business served by Blue Cross, which include small and large employers; and enrollees in Platinum Blue SM (Medicare Cost); and MedicareBlue SM Rx (Medicare Part D) had fully insured premium revenues of approximately $3.7 billion and an operating loss of $31.4 million – representing an operational improvement of more than $115 million compared to 2016.\n\"2017 was an important year to stabilize our commercial and government health business to establish the path for future growth and start 2018 with positive momentum,\" said Cain A.
