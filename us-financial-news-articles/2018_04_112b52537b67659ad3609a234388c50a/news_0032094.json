Martinez’s last homer came on Aug. 18 a year ago against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He missed the last five weeks of the season with a heart condition.\nJeimer Candelario supplied two hits and drove in the go-ahead run with a triple, and Leonys Martin had two hits and a run scored for the Tigers.\nDetroit starter Francisco Liriano (2-1) and four relievers recorded a combined 12 strikeouts. Liriano gave up two runs on five hits with three walks and seven strikeouts in five innings. Shane Greene pitched the ninth for his third save.\nTrey Mancini homered and Adam Jones added two hits and an RBI for the Orioles, who have lost four straight. Baltimore starter Andrew Cashner (1-2) gave up three runs on seven hits with three walks and five strikeouts in six innings.\nMartinez drilled his opposite-field shot after Nicholas Castellanos drew a leadoff walk in the second. The Orioles got one of those runs back on Mancini’s second homer this season, a one-out blast to left-center in the third.\nTigers left fielder Niko Goodrum prevented the Orioles from taking the lead in the fourth. Liriano issued a pair of walks during the inning and, with two out, Luis Sardinas lofted a long fly. Goodrum had trouble tracking it, then made a leaping grab near the wall to rob Sardinas of an extra-base hit.\nBaltimore knotted the score in the fifth. A single and a two-out walk put two runners on. Jones then singled to right to knock in Craig Gentry. Manny Machado was thrown out trying to advance to third on the play.\nDetroit regained the lead in the bottom of the inning. Martin reached on a one-out bunt single and scored on Candelario’s triple into the right-center gap.\nThe Tigers added an insurance run in the eighth when pinch-runner Victor Reyes scored on a wild pitch.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T10:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:07:03.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
