He added two more birdies, including his emphatic putt on the final green. \nMcIlroy, who threw away a four-shot lead in the final round at Augusta in 2011 when he was still chasing a maiden major, has since captured wins at each of golf’s three other blue riband events and is closer than ever to completing his collection. RYDER CUP REUNION \n“I feel like all aspects of my game are in really good shape, and I’m much more relaxed,” McIlroy said. \n“This isn’t my first time in this position now. I’ve been able to close the deal a few times before this, and I have that to fall back on tomorrow.” \nThe four-times major winner will play alongside Reed in the final round where the two will renew their duel from the 2016 Ryder Cup where they traded birdies in a scintillating stretch of oneupmanship that was soon deemed a classic. \nRickie Fowler, considered one of the world’s best players without a major title to his name, equalled McIlroy for the low round of the week with a seven-under 65 that left him alone in third place, five back of Reed. \nSpaniard Jon Rahm (65) eagled the par-five eighth during a flawless round that also included five birdies to sit alone in fourth place, six shots off the lead, and one shot clear of Swede Henrik Stenson (70). \nSitting a further shot back were twice winner Bubba Watson (68), England’s Tommy Fleetwood (66) and Australian Marc Leishman (73). \nTiger Woods, who began the day 13 shots behind Reed, failed to mount any sort of charge. The American opened with two bogeys en route to an even-par 72 that ended any slim hopes he may have had of slipping on the Green Jacket for a fifth time on Sunday. \nThe former world number one came into the week as one of the favourites after showing solid form this year in his comeback from injury but failed to conjure up any of the old magic he once seemed to produce on command at Augusta National. \n“It’s been scratchy this week. I just haven’t gotten it done,” Woods lamented. “I feel like I’m driving it better than I have all year, but I am not capitalising on it. And when I did miss, I missed in the wrong spots.” (Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T01:57:14.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
