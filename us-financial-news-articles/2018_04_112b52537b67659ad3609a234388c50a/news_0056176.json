Following the filing on March 15, 2018 of the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, management and the Fund’s external auditors reconsidered the accounting treatment of the sale of the 20,000 tonnes of zinc cathode to Glencore Canada in November 2017. As previously disclosed, the extra cathode had been produced because of the roasters, leaching plant and cell house operating at 70% of capacity during the second half of the year, while the zinc casting facility operated at 50% of capacity. The sale of cathode decreased the volume of inventory for the Fund and reduced the Fund’s working capital. The transaction had been reported as a sale but, following this reconsideration, the Fund has determined that a correction was required and the accounting treatment has been changed to reflect a financing transaction in light of the tolling requirement should Glencore Canada choose not to ship the cathode to another processing facility. Therefore, the Fund has restated its previously reported consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2017 and all related disclosures. The financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2016 are not affected by the restatement. The impact of the correction is as follows (in thousands of US dollars):\nConsolidated statement of financial position As reported Adjustments Restated Inventories 171,655 60,376 232,031 Prepaid and other assets 1,854 1,864 3,718 Deferred tax assets 12,453 (501 ) 11,952 Trade and other payables 26,835 (1,195 ) 25,640 Deferred revenues - 61,459 61,459 Net assets attributable to Unitholders and\nNon-controlling interest 156,333 1,475 157,808 Net assets attributable to: Priority Unitholders 123,002 1,106 124,108 Ordinary Unitholders 41,023 369 41,392 164,025 1,475 165,500 Non-controlling interest (7,692 ) - (7,692 ) 156,333 1,475 157,808 On the amended and restated consolidated statement of financial position, the restatement resulted in the increase in the reported inventories and an increase in deferred revenues reported. The trade and other payables were reduced reflecting the reduction of the transportation and distribution costs. Prepaid and other assets were increased reflecting the prepaid financing cost associated with the transaction.\nConsolidated statement of comprehensive loss As reported Adjustments Restated Sales 677,159 (59,062 ) 618,097 Transportation and distribution costs (13,503 ) 1,195 (12,308 ) Revenues 663,656 (57,867 ) 605,789 Raw material purchase costs 523,058 (51,700 ) 471,358 Net revenues less raw material purchase costs 140,598 (6,167 ) 134,431 Other expenses - Production 118,902 (7,728 ) 111,174 Depreciation 18,100 (948 ) 17,152 Loss before finance costs and income taxes (29,867 ) 2,509 (27,358 ) Finance costs, net 5,211 533 5,744 Loss before income taxes (35,078 ) 1,976 (33,102 ) Deferred income tax recovery (577 ) 501 (76 ) Loss attributable to Unitholders and Non-controlling interest (26,811 ) 1,475 (25,336 ) Decrease in net assets attributable to Unitholders and\nNon-controlling interest (27,522 ) 1,475 (26,047 ) Comprehensive loss (19,785 ) 1,475 (18,310 ) Decrease in net assets attributable to: Priority Unitholders (15,825 ) 1,106 (14,719 ) Ordinary Unitholders (5,275 ) 369 (4,906 ) (21,100 ) 1,475 (19,625 ) Non-controlling interest (6,422 ) - (6,422 ) (27,522 ) 1,475 (26,047 ) Comprehensive loss attributable to: Priority Unitholders (10,940 ) 1,106 (9,834 ) Ordinary Unitholders (3,645 ) 369 (3,276 ) (14,585 ) 1,475 (13,110 ) Non-controlling interest (5,200 ) - (5,200 ) (19,785 ) 1,475 (18,310 ) On the amended and restated consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, the restatement resulted in the reversal of the sales, transportation and distribution costs, raw material purchase costs, production expenses and depreciation associated with the cathode sale. In addition, a finance cost was recorded related to the transaction.\nConsolidated statement of cash flows As reported Adjustments Restated Operating activities Loss before income taxes (35,078 ) 1,976 (33,102 ) Adjustments to reconcile earnings before income taxes to cash\nused in operating activities Depreciation 18,100 (948 ) 17,152 Finance costs, net 5,211 533 5,744 Working capital adjustments Increase in inventories 12,340 (59,428 ) (47,088 ) Decrease (increase) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (6,542 ) (1,195 ) (7,737 ) Increase in deferred revenues - 61,459 61,459 Interest paid (4,578 ) (2,397 ) (6,975 ) Cash used in operating activities (43,868 ) - (43,868 ) On the amended and restated consolidated statement of cash flows, the restatement resulted in classification changes within some of the components of cash used in operating activities, however, there was no change to the reported cash used in operating activities.\nThe Fund will file on SEDAR the amended and restated consolidated financial statements and amended management’s discussion and analysis shortly.\nAnnual General Meeting Webcast and Dial-In\nWhen: April 27, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. E.T.\nTo access the webcast and view the slide presentation from the Noranda Income Fund website, please visit http://www.norandaincomefund.com/investor/presentations.php or click the link below:\nhttp://webcast.servicewebdiffusion.com/noranda-eng .
