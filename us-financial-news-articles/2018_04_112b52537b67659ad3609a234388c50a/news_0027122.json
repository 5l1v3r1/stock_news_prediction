Four of them detonated their explosive belts, killing the soldiers and wounding 15 others, it added.\nEgypt has been fighting an Islamist insurgency in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula since Sisi ousted Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, after popular protests against Mursi’s rule.\nSisi in November ordered the military to defeat militants in north Sinai within three months, after an attack on a mosque that killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such incident in the Arab world’s most populous country.\nThe military launched what it said was a major operation against the militants in February, a month before Sisi was re-elected in a vote featuring just one other candidate, a strong supporter of the president.\nReporting by Ahmed Tolba; writing by Arwa Gaballa; editing by Clelia Oziel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T12:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:06:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
