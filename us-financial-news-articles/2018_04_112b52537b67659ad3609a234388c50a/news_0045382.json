Incidents like these are likely to happen because they don’t pay attention to elements like safety.”\nPertamina, which has operations in the area, was providing equipment to help fight the fire. At least eight fire trucks had been deployed to try to douse the blaze.\nThe head of police in the area said the fire might have been sparked by a careless smoker.\nSlideshow (6 Images) “We suspect there was someone smoking,” said police official Wahyu Kuncoro.\nReporting by Reuters stringer in Banda Aceh; Additional reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T05:45:06.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
