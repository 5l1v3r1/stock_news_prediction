Its maternity wards were the most affected, a doctor at the hospital said.\nThe lowest paid nurse in Zimbabwe earns a gross monthly salary of $284 before allowances, according to Dongo.\nThe nurses want to be paid other allowances they say were promised by the government in 2010 but never honored. A majority of nurses were placed in lower grades making it harder for them to receive higher pay, he said.\nZimbabwe spends more than 90 percent of its annual budget on salaries and Mnangagwa’s government is seeking to curb the wage bill by a freeze on new hiring and cuts to the workforce.\nHealth Minister David Parirenyatwa said he could not immediately comment on the strike.\nReporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T19:34:50.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
