GLOBAL AMBITION \nAlexandre, who joined the group in 2008 to focus primarily on the establishment of the Merchant Banking division, had previously worked in investment banking and private equity in New York and London with Bear Stearns and Bank of America. \n“Rothschild & Co has grown into a global firm with three recognised and established businesses,” the 37-year-old, who has been Executive Deputy Chairman since March 2017, said. \nHe told the Financial Times that he was keen to see Rothschild expand in the United States, where it has failed to make much headway versus the major Wall Street banks. \nHowever, Rothschild was among the top five firms for mergers and acquisitions work in France during the first quarter of 2018, alongside Lazard, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, Thomson Reuters data shows. \nAnd investment bankers expect the French M&A sector to remain resilient, helped by last year’s election of President Emmanuel Macron, himself a former Rothschild banker, who has vowed to strengthen the economy. \nShares in Rothschild rose 3.2 percent on Tuesday, buoyed by Exane BNP Paribas starting coverage with an “outperform” rating. \n“The business is market sensitive, and Q1 2018 has been a more subdued environment. But M&A is picking up again, and we see good prospects for all threee businesses (M&A, fund management, merchant banking) in 2018 and the longer term,” Exane BNP Paribas said in a note. \nFounding father Amschel’s son Nathan Meyer Rothschild is reputed to have made a fortune buying British government bonds in anticipation of Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo.
