The Bank reported net income of $3.6 million or $0.52 per diluted common share for , compared to net income of $1.7 million or $0.25 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $3.1 million or $0.61 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net income, when comparing the three months ended December 31, 2017, was primarily due a decline in the Bank's provision for loan losses of $2.7 million. The increase of $531 thousand when comparing the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily due to an increase of the net-interest income, and a $277 thousand increase in non-interest income, partially offset with a $255 thousand in provision for loan losses and a modest increase in non-interest expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the quarter-ended March 31, 2018 are as follows:\nNet interest income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 increased $531 thousand or 5.7% over the same period in 2017. Non-interest income for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 increased $422 thousand, or 115.9% over the same period in 2017. Total net-income before income taxes for increased $603 thousand or 16.0% when compared to the same period in 2017. Net loans increased an additional $28.7 million from $958.4 million at December 31, 2017.\n\"We are pleased to report loan growth and positive earnings,\" stated Edward Dietzler, President/CEO.\nChairman Richard Gillespie noted that, \"The Bank began the fiscal 2018 by increasing net loans and recording an earnings level that exceeded the prior year. The Bank is progressing with its growth expectations, along with continuing its efforts to enhance shareholder value.\"\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets were $1.18 billion at March 31, 2018, a decline of $16.7 million or 1.4% when compared to $1.20 billion at the end of 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in total assets was a reduction of $50.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, related to a decline in deposit accounts connected with a cyclical reduction of municipal deposits. Loans increased $28.7 million, primarily in commercial real estate credits.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 decreased by $50.9 million, or 5.0% when compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in deposits consists of decreases of $76.3 million in interest checking, partially offset by a $16.8 million increase in money markets, increases of $9.3 million in time deposits and $2.9 million in savings accounts. In addition, during the quarter the Bank borrowed $30.3 million in short-term advances to fund the loan growth.\nTotal stockholders' equity increased $3.3 million or 2.0% when compared to the end of 2017. This increase was primarily due to earnings recorded during the first three months of 2018. The ratio of equity to total assets was 14.5%, 0.5% higher than year-end 2017.\nAsset Quality\nAt March 31, 2018, non-performing assets were $11.6 million, an increase of $1.6 million, or 16.4% when compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of one large credit placed on non-accrual during the quarter. Total troubled debt restructuring (\"TDR's) balance totaled $6.3 million at March 31, 2018, a decline of $88 thousand from year-end 2017. All TDR's are performing to their agreed upon terms.\nReview of Quarterly Financial Results\nNet interest income was $9.9 million for compared to $10.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from the previous quarter was a result of a decline in interest income of $198 thousand, or 1.5%, along with an increase in interest expense of $250 thousand. The net interest margin for the first quarter 2018 was 3.52%, declining 27 basis points, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily associated with the high level of average short-term assets maintained during the quarter. When comparing the same three month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, net interest income increased $532 thousand, which was primarily due to a higher volume of average earnings assets of approximately $147.9 million.\nThe provision for credit losses was $255 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The comparable amounts were $2.9 million and $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The primary reason for the provision in was due to an increase in the outstanding loans. The rate of allowance for credit losses to period end loans was 1.19% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.20% at December 31, 2017 and 1.20% at March 31, 2017, which reflects management's assessment of the credit quality in the loan portfolio.\nTotal non-interest income for increased $422 thousand, to $786 thousand, or 115.9%, when compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, and loan prepayment penalties. Total non-interest income, compared to the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reflected a small decrease of $14 thousand, primarily due to a lower level of fees generated on loans recorded between the two periods.\nTotal non-interest expense for increased $95 thousand, or 1.6% when compared to the same period in 2017. This increase was primarily due to increases in salaries and employees benefit expense and data processing expense, partially offset by a reduction in professional fees and FDIC deposit insurance. When comparing March 31, 2018 to the prior quarter, non-interest expense increased $562 thousand, or 10.2%, primarily due to an increase in salaries and employees benefits' expense and FDIC deposit insurance expense, partially offset by a reduction in professional fees expense and other operating expenses. The increase attributed to salaries and benefits expense was due to the hiring of new employees at the end of 2017 and early 2018 connected with the strategic initiatives, higher benefit cost and salary merit increases.\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Bank recorded income tax expense of $790 thousand, resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.1%, compared to $1.0 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 37.6% for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and compared to $678 thousand resulting in an effective tax rate of 18.0% for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The current effective tax yield for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was reduced as a result of the new corporate tax rate of 21.0% from the prior rate of 34.0%. With respect to the effective tax rate of 37.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, tax expense included a one-time excise tax related to the Bank's REIT subsidiary and the first quarter of 2017 effective tax rate was impacted by a tax benefit related to the exercise of warrants and stock options.\nAbout The Bank of Princeton\nThe Bank of Princeton is a community bank founded in 2007.
