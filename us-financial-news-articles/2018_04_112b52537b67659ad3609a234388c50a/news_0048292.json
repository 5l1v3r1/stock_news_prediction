(NYSE: SFE) (\"Safeguard\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and provided a business update regarding the achievement of developmental milestones for its 25 Partner Companies.\n\"The growth-stage, technology-driven businesses in Safeguard's portfolio continue to demonstrate revenue growth and achieve critical operational and strategic milestones,\" said Stephen T. Zarrilli , Safeguard's President and CEO. \"We are focused on monetizing our assets to return capital to shareholders and have made significant progress streamlining our business to create a leaner, more agile organization that reflects Safeguard's new operating model.\"\n2018 First quarter Highlights\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Safeguard's net loss was $6.2 million, or $0.30 per share, compared with net loss of $22.1 million, or $1.08 per share, for the same period in 2017. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company announced a series of management changes intended to streamline the Company's organizational structure and reduce operating costs, including the appointment of Brian J. Sisko as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective July 1, and David Kille as Chief Financial Officer, effective June 1. In connection with this, the roles of Chief Operating Officer and Corporate Controller have been eliminated. The management changes are part of aggressive cost-reduction initiatives that are expected to trim annual operating expenses to between $8 million and $9 million, excluding interest, depreciation, severance and stock-based compensation, compared to approximately $15.1 million in 2017. Partner Company Spongecell agreed to merge with privately held Flashtalking, a global platform for digital advertising management and analysis; Safeguard now holds a 10% equity position in Flashtalking. Nexxt, Inc., formerly Beyond.com , repaid a $10.5 million note received in connection with the Company's sale of its interests back to Nexxt for $26.0 million in March 2017. Deployed $4.0 million in follow-on funding to support seven existing Partner Companies.\nAGGREGATE PARTNER COMPANY REVENUE\nFor full-year 2018, aggregate Partner Company revenue is projected to be between $475 million and $500 million, which includes revenue for all Partner Companies in which Safeguard had an interest at January 1, 2018. Aggregate revenue for the same Partner Companies was $410 million and $344 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Aggregate revenue guidance for 2018 and prior years reflects combined revenue for Spongecell and Flashtalking.\nCHANGE IN STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nOn January 17, 2018, Safeguard announced a change in its business strategy and operations to increase shareholder value. Under the new strategy, Safeguard has ceased deploying capital into new Partner Company opportunities. It remains focused on managing and financially supporting existing Partner Companies, with the goal of pursuing monetization opportunities for Partner Company interests and maximizing net proceeds distributable to shareholders. The Company will consider initiatives including, among others: the sale of individual Partner Companies, the sale of certain Partner Company interests in secondary market transactions, or a combination thereof, as well as other opportunities to maximize shareholder value.\n\"We remain committed to supporting the needs of our existing Partner Companies and continue to maintain a deep belief in their underlying value proposition,\" Zarrilli said. \"We are encouraged by the market interest in our portfolio and are confident that the actions we are taking will deliver enhanced value for all Safeguard shareholders.\"\nPARTNER COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS\nThis section summarizes significant accomplishments by Safeguard's Partner Companies during the first quarter of 2018.
