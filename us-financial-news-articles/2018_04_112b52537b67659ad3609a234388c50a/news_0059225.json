Shares were trading as much as 7 percent up before the market open.\nBy late morning, shares were up fractionally from Thursday's close.\n\"As we go into the second half of the year, we have much tougher comps for our business after an outstanding second half of 2017,\" Swan said. \"And also the macroeconomic climate from our vantage point heading into the second half is not quite as clear as the growth we're anticipating in the second quarter.\"\nIntel announced Thursday it had hired Tesla's departing head of autopilot , Jim Keller. He will join Intel as senior vice president and lead the company's silicon engineering.\nBy mid-day Friday, Intel was up 15 percent on the year and more than 40 percent in the 12-month period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:17:35.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
