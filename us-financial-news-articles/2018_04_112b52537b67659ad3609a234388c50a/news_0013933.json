Iqbal was a preacher at the mosque.\nOn hearing Monday’s verdict, Iqbal - flanked by counter-terrorism police - told reporters the ruling was “unjust”.\nIndonesia’s parliament is currently deliberating revisions to anti-terrorism laws that would broaden the definition of terrorism and give police the power to detain suspects without trial for longer.\nThe changes would allow police to arrest people for hate speech or for spreading radical content, as well as those taking part in paramilitary training or joining proscribed groups.\nReporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:48:12.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
