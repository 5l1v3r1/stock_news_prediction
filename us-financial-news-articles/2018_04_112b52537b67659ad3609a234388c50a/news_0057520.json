GE’s life-sciences business, which had about $4.6 billion in revenue last year, sells lab supplies such as blood-collection kits as well as equipment for biotechnology drug production and research.\nThe unit could be worth more than $20 billion, according to analyst estimates and based on how much life-sciences businesses have fetched in recent deals.\nThe abortive approach by Danaher DHR, +1.28% is one of a number GE GE, +2.35% has received for various businesses recently as competitors seek to gain advantage from its weakness, and shows how the once-mighty company’s fortunes have fallen.
