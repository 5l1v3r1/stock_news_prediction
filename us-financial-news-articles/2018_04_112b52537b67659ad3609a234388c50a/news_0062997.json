It's tongue-in-cheek, kind of shocking, and it's not exclusive you can fit all Asian cultures under one roof with a name like this. We just decided to go for it,\" Kim told Asian American news site NextShark six months ago.\nA year ago she told the Argonaut, a local Los Angeles news outlet, that Yellow Fever means \"love of all things Asian\" and that public push back over the name had not been as drastic as expected.\nSome people on social media defended the news of the partnership with Whole Foods as part of a broader cultural trend.\n\"This is no more offensive than zabc naming an Asian sitcom Fresh of the Boat or FOB- which is considered racists,\" wrote Lorin Hart, who uses the Twitter handle zCubeProMH.
