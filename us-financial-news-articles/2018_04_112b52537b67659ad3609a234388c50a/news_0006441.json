Brandon Guyer drove in the first run of the game with an RBI single, and the bases were still loaded.\nSkaggs, though, escaped further damage by inducing a 1-6-3 double-play grounder from Yonder Alonso. Although Skaggs gave up just the one run, he had to make 32 pitches to get out of the inning, and it set the tone for his outing.\nSkaggs lasted just 4 2/3 innings, his 103rd and final pitch being hit to center field for an RBI single by Jason Kipnis, giving Cleveland a 2-0 lead.\nMeanwhile, Kluber held the Angels hitless until Andrelton Simmons bunted for a single with one out in the fifth. With two outs and Simmons on second, Ohtani got ahold of a 92 mph fastball on an 0-1 count and drove it over the fence in center field to tie the game.\nThe Ohtani homer was Kluber’s only blemish, as the reigning American League Cy Young Award winner got through seven innings, allowing the two runs on three hits and two walks. He struck out six.\nBoth bullpens were effective, keeping the game tied and sending it into extra innings.\nMcAllister (0-1) struck out the first batter he faced before Cozart ended the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T09:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:07:24.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
