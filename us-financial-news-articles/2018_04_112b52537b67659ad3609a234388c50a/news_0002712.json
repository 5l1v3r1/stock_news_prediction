The actions could be a tactic to get China to negotiate on trade practices. \n\"It's part of the process. I mean, I would take the president seriously on this tariff issue,\" he added. \"You know, there are carrots and sticks in life, but he is ultimately a free trader. He's said that to me, he's said it publicly.

Fears of a trade war led to major U.S. stock indexes diving on Wednesday morning , only to make up some of those losses throughout the day. \nKudlow called the stock market reaction to the moves \"mild\" and cautioned against overreacting to the moves. He contended the U.S. would not lose in a trade war with China. \nKudlow, a free-market advocate and longtime CNBC personality, started in his White House position this week. \nâ€” CNBC's Eamon Javers and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T18:42:15.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
