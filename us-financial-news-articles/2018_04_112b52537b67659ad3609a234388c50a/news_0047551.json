The Tender Offers are being made pursuant to a Tender Offer Memorandum, dated April 25, 2018 (the \"Tender Offer Memorandum\"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe Tender Offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on May 4, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated as described in the Tender Offer Memorandum (such time and date, as they may be extended, the \"Expiration Time\"). Holders of Notes who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) their Notes prior to the Expiration Time, or who deliver to the Information and Tender Agent a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in accordance with the instructions described in the Tender Offer Memorandum prior to the Expiration Time, will receive in cash, for Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase by the Company, U.S.$1,066.75 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2019 Notes, U.S.$1,074.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2020 Notes, and U.S.$1,295.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2037 Notes. The purchase price for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of each Series of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date or the Guaranteed Delivery Date pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures, and not validly withdrawn, is referred to herein as the \" Consideration \". In addition to the applicable Consideration, Holders whose Notes of a given Series are accepted for purchase will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes in accordance with the terms of their corresponding indentures governing the respective Series of the Notes to, but not including, the Payment Date. Interest will cease to accrue on the Payment Date for all Notes accepted in the Tender Offers, including those tendered through the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures. Any Notes not validly tendered or not accepted for payment pursuant to the Tender Offers will continue to accrue interest in accordance with the terms of their corresponding Indentures. No tenders will be valid if submitted after the Expiration Time. Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, including those Notes for which the guaranteed delivery procedures set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum are used, will be paid for through the Clearing Systems on a date promptly following the Expiration Date (such date, the \" Payment Date \"). The Company currently expects the Payment Date to be May 9, 2018, or the third Business Day in New York following the Expiration Time.\nThe Company has announced the Tender Offers as part of a refinancing transaction pursuant to which the aggregate Consideration will be derived from the concurrent offering or offerings (\" New Note Issuance \") of new debt securities (\" New Notes \") on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the New Notes Issuance or generate sufficient gross proceeds raised in the New Note Issuance, and thus, satisfy the Financing Condition (as defined in the Tender Offer Memorandum). If the Financing Condition is not satisfied in respect of all the Tender Offers due to a shortfall in gross proceeds from the New Note Issuance, then the Company will accept for purchase all Notes of each Series 2 tendered in accordance with applicable Acceptance Priority Levels, as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe following table shows the Notes included in the Tender Offers as well as the principal amount outstanding and the Consideration with respect to each series of Notes:\nTitle of Security\nCUSIP Number/ISIN\nNominal Amount\nOutstanding\nConsideration\n8.00% Notes due\nAugust 2019\nCUSIP: N54360 AE7,\nISIN: USN54360AE78\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068T AE7,\nISIN: US56068TAE73\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$750,000,000\nU.S.$1,066.75 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\n7.75% Notes due\nJanuary 2020\nCUSIP: N54360AF4,\nISIN: USN54360AF44\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068TAF4,\nISIN: US56068TAF49\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$1,250,000,000\nU.S.$1,074.00 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\n7.875% Notes due\nJune 2037\nCUSIP: N54360AD9,\nISIN: USN54360AD95\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068T AD9,\nISIN: US56068TAD90\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$500,000,000\nU.S.$1,295.00 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\nTendered Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time so long as they are validly withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Tender Offer Memorandum. The Tender Offer for each Series of Notes is independent of and not conditioned upon the Tender Offer for any of the other Series of Notes, meaning that the Company may, subject to applicable law, extend, re-open, amend and/or terminate the Tender Offer with respect any Series of Notes without affecting the Tender Offer for any of the other Series of Notes, and vice versa. Furthermore, the Company may, subject to applicable law, choose to reject or accept tenders with respect to any Series of Notes without rejecting or accepting, in whole or in part, tenders with respect to the other Series of Notes. The purchase of any Series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other Series of Notes. However, any Notes validly tendered in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be accepted for purchase by the Company based on the Acceptance Priority Levels, each as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe Company has engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc., The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Mandiri Securities Pte.

Any tender of Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers from a holder of Notes that is unable to make these representations will not be accepted. Each of the Company, the Dealer Managers and D.F. King reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to investigate, in relation to any tender of Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, whether any such representation given by a holder of Notes is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a result the Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such tender of Notes shall not be accepted.\nThe securities referred to herein have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws of the United States, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws.
