Some lamented what they saw as a selection process that needs more public scrutiny and input. Others question Mr. Williams’s economic views.\n reported Saturday that the New York Fed’s board of directors has recommended Mr. Williams to become the regional reserve bank’s president, succeeding William Dudley when he retires this summer.\nThe selection is subject to approval by the Fed’s Washington-based board of governors and doesn’t require Senate confirmation.\nMr. Williams’ supporters cite his extensive monetary-policy experience, including his record of influential research on key topics of debate. This expertise was appealing both to the New York Fed’s search committee and to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whose background is in finance and is the first Fed chief in more than 30 years without a Ph.D. in economics, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAlso\nThe Future of America’s Economy Looks a Lot Like Elkhart, Indiana April 13, 2018 Activists with the left-leaning Fed Up Campaign, however, denounced the pick. They say a more diverse set of central bank officials would take into greater account how the Fed’s policy decisions affect all the economy’s participants.\n“The search for the next New York Fed president began with commitments to diversity and gestures toward public engagement and has ended with the appointment of Williams, a white, male, Fed insider who had never been mentioned before,\" Fed Up’s director, Shawn Sebastian, said in a statement. “The process and the outcome necessitates starting over with a new slate of candidates and more public input,” he said in an interview.\nThe San Francisco Fed didn’t reply to a request for comment.\nThe Fed has had just three African-American governors in its more than centurylong history. Last year, it gained its first-ever black regional bank president in Raphael Bostic at the Atlanta Fed. Of the central bank’s 15 governors and regional bank presidents, all but three are male and all but two are white.\nMr. Bostic, who was a classmate of Mr. Williams when they were in graduate school at Stanford University, said in an interview, “he is smart. He has been an innovative manager, and he’s been a great colleague...The New York Fed would be very lucky to have him.”\nThe New York Fed leader is among the most influential U.S. central bank officials, playing a key role in crafting monetary policy and running the regional bank that oversees some of the nation’s biggest banks.\nSome critics challenge Mr. Williams on his economic judgment, saying he has erred in estimating how low unemployment could fall without fueling stronger price pressures. Joblessness has dropped to 4.1%, a 17-year low, and inflation remains below the Fed’s 2% target.\n“He has consistently underestimated how much lower the unemployment rate could sustainably go,” wrote Josh Biven in a note from the Economic Policy Institute , a left-leaning think tank that has worked with the Fed Up Campaign.\nThe selection process also has drawn fire. The members of each regional Fed bank’s board of directors who don’t represent private banks regulated by the Fed select the leader of the bank, subject to the Fed board’s approval. Hiring happens largely behind closed doors, and candidates for the job aren’t publicly announced.\nPeter Conti-Brown, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said central bankers and their allies claim “we get the best quality people” for the job, but it is a closed process.\nMr. Conti-Brown said one possible reform among several paths would be for Fed banks in search of a new chief to announce a short list of candidates, which could be done without any legal changes to the law that authorizes the Fed.\nWrite to Michael S.
