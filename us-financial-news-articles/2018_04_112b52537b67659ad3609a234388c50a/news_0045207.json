Banners displaying the NATO logo are placed at the entrance of new NATO headquarters during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman \nTwo decades of planning, construction and an additional year-long delay caused by technology problems now appear to be behind the Western alliance. \nIts international staff and 29 embassies should be rehoused by mid-June, ready for a NATO defence ministers’ meeting and then a two-day NATO summit of alliance leaders in July, which Trump is expected to attend, officials say. \nBut within the shiny glass and steel interlocking buildings, NATO allies will face familiar problems, including how to handle a newly assertive Russia and manage the collective defence of Europe. \nThe move was originally due to take place soon after the May 25, 2017 visit by the U.S. president and other Western leaders. Trump, a former property developer, praised the 1.17-billion-euro ($1.45 billion) building as beautiful but said he had refused to ask how much it had cost. \nNATO Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller said the move was about a year behind schedule. A board in the electrical system control room of the old NATO headquarters is seen during the move to the new building, in Brussels, Belgium April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman \n“I don’t think that’s bad for an enormous building project,” she told reporters but conceded that rainwater dripped into her office in NATO’s current headquarters during a recent heavy winter storm. \nThe delay has stemmed in part from an ambitious plan for a central IT system to act as a brain to run the building. That was complicated by contractor Lockheed Martin Corp’s deal to sell its IT services division in early 2016. \nLeidos Holdings Inc completed the job but “the handoff from one company to another was a factor,” Gottemoeller said. The building has 60,000 sensors helping control everything from the temperature of meeting rooms to secure-area doors. \nThe 4,200 staff will work in a total office space similar in area to the United Nations headquarters in New York. Except that to meet Belgian building requirements, the NATO HQ is only 32 metres (105 ft) tall at its highest point.

NATO officials shuttle between the two buildings, as delegations shift boxes and archives, on a special bus service dubbed “the magic carpet” by officials. \nNATO decided it needed a new home in 1999 because its headquarters in Brussels were only meant to be temporary. They were built in a hurry when the alliance was forced to leave Paris after France’s withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s military command in 1966. \nIn a throw-back to NATO’s origins in the Cold War, the new headquarters features two concrete panels made up of masonry from the Berlin Wall. \nIt also displays a piece of the wreckage from the 107th floor of one of the Twin Towers in New York, destroyed during the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States — the only time the alliance has activated its collective defence clause.
