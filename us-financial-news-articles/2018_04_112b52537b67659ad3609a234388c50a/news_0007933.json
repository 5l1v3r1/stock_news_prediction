(“ Movit ”) on the Aequitas NEO Exchange (“ NEO Exchange ”). The Company and Movit sought listing approval from the NEO Exchange in preparation for their announced transaction, that will result in a reverse takeover of Movit (the “Transaction ”).\nIn relation to the Transaction, Movit announced the submission of its filing statement dated April 3, 2018. A copy of the filing statement is available under Movit’s corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nEthereum Capital and Movit entered a binding agreement on March 22, 2018 pursuant to which the former will amalgamate with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the latter and continue as one corporation. The common shares will be listed on the NEO Exchange under the symbol “ETHC”. Movit will delist its shares from the TSX Venture Exchange following the closing of the Transaction.\nAt the annual and special meeting of Movit shareholders to be held on April 13, 2018, Movit shareholders will be asked, among other matters, to consider, and if deemed appropriate, to pass resolutions (collectively, the “ Transaction Resolutions ”) approving certain matters in connection with the Transaction, including (i) the continuance of Movit's corporate existence from British Columbia to Ontario (the “ Continuance ”); (ii) consolidation of the issued and outstanding Movit Shares on the basis of one post-consolidation common share for every 12.5 issued and outstanding common shares (the “ Consolidation ”); (iii) a change of name to “Ether Capital Corporation” (the “ Name Change ”); (iv) reconstitution of the board of directors (the “ Movit Board ”) with nominees of Ethereum Capital effective on the completion of the amalgamation; (v) adoption of a new by-law relating generally to its business and affairs (the “ By-law ”); and (vi) adoption of a share compensation plan (“ Share Compensation Plan ”). The Continuance, Consolidation and Name Change will require the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast at the meeting while the By-law and Share Compensation Plan will require approval of the holders of a simple majority of the votes cast.\nMovit’s Board of Directors have unanimously determined that the Transaction is in the best interests of Movit and determined to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the Transaction Resolutions. Holders of approximately 76% of the outstanding common shares of Movit entitled to vote at the meeting have entered into voting agreements with Movit pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their Movit shares for the Transaction Resolutions, subject to the right to terminate such voting agreements in certain circumstances.\nSubject to receipt of all approvals, the Transaction is currently scheduled to close shortly after the date of the annual and special meeting of Movit shareholders. Following the completion of the Transaction, Ethereum Capital will begin implementing its business plan which, as described in the filing statement, initially involves investing the majority of its available funds into Ether, the crypto asset native to the Ethereum platform.\nAbout Ethereum Capital\nEthereum Capital is a Toronto-based technology company whose objective is to become the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem.
