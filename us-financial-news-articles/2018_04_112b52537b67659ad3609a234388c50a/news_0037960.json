But the truce was violated within hours.\nIGAD, which was due to hold a new round of talks on April 26, and other international bodies have been seeking to resolve differences between the two sides, including working on the release of rebel leader Riek Machar.\nThe bloc said last month that Machar should be released from house arrest in South Sudan as soon as possible, but on condition on that he renounces violence.\nThis month’s talks were due to be held in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. But the bloc said they had been postponed, without giving a reason or setting a new date.\nCivil war erupted in December 2013, when troops loyal to President Salva Kiir clashed with forces loyal to Riek Machar, then the vice president. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the nation has faced dire food shortages.\nReporting by Denis Dumo Writing by Duncan Miriri Editing by Maggie Fick and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:19:32.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
