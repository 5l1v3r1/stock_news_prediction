Genish’s appointment is valid until May 4 when a whole new board will be voted on.\nDespite being a close ally of top shareholder Vivendi , Genish is well respected by all, including activist fund Elliot, given his track record as a telecoms veteran and dealmaker in Brazil. Nearly 98 percent of those present voted for Genish on Tuesday.\nReporting by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-24T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:44:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
