Boeing was last down 2 percent while Caterpillar was down 0.7 percent.\nThe S&P 500’s industrials sector also pared losses but was still down 0.2 percent in late afternoon trading.\nThe technology sector turned positive and was last up 0.6 percent, helped by Apple which turned positive and was last up 1.5 percent.\nChina’s tariffs on U.S. soybean exports led to bets that higher domestic reserves would lower food costs for meat producers such as Tyson Foods, Hormel, Sanderson Farms and Pilgrim’s Pride, helping those stocks.\nLennar jumped 9.3 percent to lead the percentage gainers on the S&P after the homebuilder reported quarterly revenue that beat estimates as it sold more homes at higher prices.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 30 new highs and 89 new lows.
