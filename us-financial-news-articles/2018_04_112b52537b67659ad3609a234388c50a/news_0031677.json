You will receive a full refund,” the airline wrote to passengers on its Facebook page on Sunday. “Flights will need to be purchased on another carrier. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.”\nStranded passengers flooded the carrier’s social media pages, complaining about the cancellations and the airline’s slow response to calls to its customer service line.\n“‘Inconvenience’ doesn’t even begin to describe the nightmare you left us in by REFUSING to help the 240 people you STRANDED in Cabo yesterday,” Facebook user Derek William wrote on Sunday. “I can assure you I will NEVER fly your airline again.”\nTwitter user Brandon Quote: : “They flew us down here and are ending their service to Los Cabo Mexico—they are not coming back to get us!” His message was retweeted 21 times and liked 34 times.\nSun Country made a fuller apology late on Monday, after the social media backlash.\n“We cannot apologize enough to those passengers who were hit by the one-two punch of an April snowstorm and the seasonality end-date of our winter schedule,” the airline’s Vice President of Marketing Kelsey Dodson-Smith said. “Our fleet was already allocated to fly other operations and unfortunately, we were unable to send additional aircraft to Los Cabos and Mazatlán without cancelling more flights causing further disruptions to more of our passengers.”\nBy Monday afternoon, the incident had attracted the attention of federal lawmakers, with Minnesota Senator Tina Smith writing to the U.S. Department of Transportation, demanding it investigate Sun Country’s “failures.”\nIn the letter, which the senator made public, she asks for an explanation of what is being done to ensure airlines implement cancellation policies that protect consumer interests.\nReporting by Alana Wise in New York; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T01:56:08.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
