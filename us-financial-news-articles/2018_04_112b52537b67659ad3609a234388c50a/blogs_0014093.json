However, less than half of the firm's typical survey sample has been collected so far.\n\"We believe chains that cater to lower-income consumers will see greater marginal demand improvement from individual income tax cuts than concepts catering to higher-income customers,\" Tarantino wrote.\nHe noted that Dunkin' Donuts , McDonald's , Texas Roadhouse and Jack in the Box , fit this profile. \nTarantino said he expects sales across the industry to continue to accelerate as weather issues dissolve and more consumers take advantage of their tax cuts and returns. \n\"We are optimistic about the outlook for restaurant stocks for the balance of 2018,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:37:52.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
