They are often ostracized, abused, assaulted by mobs, raped or enslaved by criminals in conservative countries, where homosexuality is a taboo, campaigners say.\nMore than 70 states criminalize same-sex relationships, with some applying the death penalty, according to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA) rights group.\n“It’s essential for activists and funders (both new and existing) to work closely together to bring about the change we all want to see,” said Bjorn van Roozendaal, programs director for ILGA-Europe.\nMost funding goes to Canada and the United States, which received $287 million in 2015 and 2016 combined, followed by sub-Saharan Africa, which received $54 million in the two year period, then western Europe with $38 million, the report said.\nThe biggest chunk of money - 57 percent - was used to address human rights for LGBT people, followed by 22 percent for health and wellbeing, the Global Philanthropy Project found.\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry; Editing by Claire Cozens and Katy Migiro.
