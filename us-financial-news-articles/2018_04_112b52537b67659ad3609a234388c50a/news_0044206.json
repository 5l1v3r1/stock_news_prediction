Both the peso and Brazilian real had posted strong gains against the greenback on Tuesday and Wednesday. Equities also rose across the region on those days as traders bought back into risky asset that they had previously exited. The peso fell 2.01 percent against the dollar just days after reaching its strongest level since September as investors banked on improved odds of a new North American Free Trade Agreement being signed. Traders in Mexico continue to be spooked by the strong performance in opinion polls by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. A late Wednesday poll by polling firm Mitofsky showed him pulling further ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election. \"The election and the recent opinion polls have started to worry the market,\" said Gabriela Siller, head of economic analysis at Banco BASE. In Brazil, markets continued to be unsettled by an extremely uncertain political outlook during an election year, with the tactics of the country's left still up in the air following the imprisonment of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the presidential front-runner who was jailed earlier in April for corruption. \"We see a technical correction after (Wednesday's movement),\" said Ricardo Gomes da Silva, director of brokerage Correparti Corretora. The real fell 0.27 percent. All other major currencies in the region were also down. Across the region, equities markets were mixed. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index, which had risen in morning trade, was virtually flat. Mexico's benchmark IPC stock index dipped 0.67 percent.
