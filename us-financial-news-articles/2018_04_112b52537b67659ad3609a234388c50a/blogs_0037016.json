REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin The FSB has said it needs such access to guard against security threats such as terrorist attacks. But Telegram said compliance would violate users’ privacy.\nTelegram’s founder and CEO, Pavel Durov, said the ban would damage the quality of lives of 15 million Russians and do nothing to improve Russia’s security.\n“The terrorist threat in Russia will stay at the same level, because extremists will continue to use encrypted communication channels - in other messengers, or through a VPN,” he said.\n“We consider the ban decision anti-constitutional and will continue to defend the right to secret correspondence for Russians.”\nDurov was a pioneer of social media in Russia but left the country in 2014. He has since been a vocal critic of the Kremlin’s policies on Internet freedom.\nTelegram is widely used in countries across the former Soviet Union and Middle East.\nAs well as being popular with journalists and members of Russia’s political opposition, Telegram is also used by the Kremlin to communicate with reporters and arrange regular conference calls with President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman.\nOn Monday, the spokesman’s office asked journalists who were previously subscribed to a chat in Telegram to switch to a chat that had been set up in a different messaging service, ICQ, which is part of the Russian Mail.ru technology group ( MAILRq.L ).\nEditing by Gareth Jones and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T12:23:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
