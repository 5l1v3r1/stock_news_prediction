When users try to open an expired e-mail, they’ll find an expired link to the message and will no longer be available for viewing.\nAccording to the report, which cited a TechCrunch tipster named Chaim, Gmail’s compose message pane will now also feature a lock with a clock in front of it. After composing an e-mail, users can click that lock and decide when the e-mail should expire. Recipients will then receive an e-mail that requires them to click a link and input their Google credentials to view the e-mail. According to the report, copy and paste and printing are not allowed in this mode. The new features aim at improving e-mail privacy by limiting a message’s access to the recipient for a specific period of time. However, since recipients are still able to screenshot a message, it’s not a guarantee of privacy.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nThe news comes after some outlets reported on leaks of a possible upcoming Gmail redesign .
