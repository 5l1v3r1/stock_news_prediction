(OTCQB:CRTN), a Delaware corporation (“Cartesian”), at a price of $0.40 per share (the “Offer Price”), net to the seller in cash, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated today. Offeror is a subsidiary of Cartesian Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”) and indirect subsidiary of Blackstreet Capital Holdings, LLC (“BCH”), run by Founder and CEO Murry Gunty.\nThe tender offer is being made pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated March 21, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Parent, Offeror and Cartesian.\nThe tender offer is not subject to any financing condition. The tender offer is subject to customary conditions to closing, including a condition that the number of shares validly tendered (and not properly withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the tender offer, together with the shares then owned by BCH and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, represents at least one share more than 50% of all shares then outstanding plus any shares to be issued for options that have been exercised.\nThe board of directors of Cartesian has determined that the offer is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of Cartesian and its stockholders and unanimously recommends that the stockholders of Cartesian tender their shares to Offeror.\nThe tender offer will expire one minute after 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 11, 2018, unless the tender offer is extended or earlier terminated (such time and date, as it may be extended, the “Expiration Time”). The tender offer will be extended in order to permit the satisfaction of the conditions of the tender offer; provided that Offeror will not be required to extend the tender offer beyond the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement or July 31, 2018. Offeror cannot extend the tender offer beyond such date without the prior written consent of Cartesian. There will not be a subsequent offering period for the tender offer. During any extension of the tender offer, all Shares previously validly tendered and not properly withdrawn will remain subject to the tender offer and subject to the rights of a tendering stockholder to withdraw such stockholder’s Shares. If Offeror extends the tender offer, Offeror will make a public announcement of such extension or provision by no later than 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on the next business day after the previously scheduled Expiration Time.\nThe Merger Agreement provides, among other things, that as soon as practicable following consummation of the tender offer and receipt of the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Cartesian’s common stock entitled to vote to approve the Merger Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable law) of specified conditions, Offeror will be merged (the “Merger”) with and into Cartesian, with Cartesian continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger and thereby becoming a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Parent.\nIn the Merger, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than Shares owned by (i) Cartesian or Merger Sub, which Shares will be cancelled and will cease to exist or (ii) any person who is entitled to and properly demands statutory appraisal of his, her or its Shares under Delaware law) will be automatically canceled and converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest thereon and less any applicable withholding taxes. Under no circumstances will interest be paid on the purchase price for Shares, regardless of any extension of the tender offer or any delay in making payment for Shares. As a result of the Merger, Cartesian will cease to be a publicly traded company and will become wholly owned by Parent.\nThe Offer to Purchase and the related Letter of Transmittal contain important information that should be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the Offer.\nComplete terms and conditions of the tender offer can be found in the Offer to Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and other related materials that are being filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 10, 2018. In addition, Cartesian is filing a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC relating to the Offer.\nCopies of the Offer to Purchase, Letter of Transmittal and other related materials are available free of charge at the SEC’s website ( www.sec.gov ) or by directing a request to Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., the information agent, depositary and paying agent for the tender offer, toll free at (855) 793-5068 or via email at shareholder@broadridge.com .\nAbout Blackstreet Capital Holdings, LLC\nBlackstreet Capital Holdings, LLC is a Chevy Chase, MD based diversified holding company run by Founder and CEO Murry Gunty.
