REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The company also reported revenue decline in the market data business, a focus area, sending its shares down 3.2 percent to $155.71 in morning trade.\nIn contrast, fellow-exchange operator Nasdaq Inc ( NDAQ.O ) on Wednesday reported a first-quarter profit and revenue that beat estimates on higher trading volumes.\nCME, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, said average rate per contract fell 3.4 percent to $0.706 in the first quarter ended March 31.\n“Rate per contract fell because there were higher volumes on lower priced products such as interest rate products,” said Sandler O’Neill analyst Richard Repetto.\nRevenue from market data and information services fell 2 percent to $94.9 million.\nArgus Research analyst Stephen Biggar blamed the drop to a decline in the number of screens obtaining the data.\nLike other exchange operators, CME has been looking to build its non-trading related businesses such as its market data and information services.\nCME said average daily volume (ADV) jumped 30 percent to an all-time high of 22.2 million contracts, which pushed clearing and transaction fees, CME’s biggest revenue stream, up 23 percent to $973.6 million.\nExchanges booked gains in the first three months of 2018 after global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities markets were roiled by an increase in volatility in February that extended into March.\nTotal revenue rose 19.3 percent to $1.11 billion, but missed estimate of $1.12 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nCME’s net income rose to $598.8 million, or $1.76 per share, from $399.8 million, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.86 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent.\nTotal expenses rose 12 percent to $368.1 million.\nReporting by Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:12:50.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
