The final installment payment for STI Esles II was made in December 2017 in advance of its delivery, and the Company paid $23.5 million as the final installment payment for the delivery of STI Jardins in January 2018.\nAs part of these deliveries, the Company drew down $21.5 million in December 2017 and $21.5 million in January 2018 from its 2017 Credit Facility to partially finance the purchase of these vessels.\nExplanation of Variances on the First Quarter of 2018 Financial Results Compared to the First Quarter of 2017\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded a net loss of $31.8 million compared to a net loss of $11.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The following were the significant changes between the two periods:\nTCE revenue, a Non-IFRS measure, is vessel revenues less voyage expenses (including bunkers and port charges). TCE revenue is included herein because it is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance irrespective of changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters, and pool charters), and it provides useful information to investors and management. The following table depicts TCE revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nFor the three months ended March 31, In thousands of U.S. dollars 2018 2017 Vessel revenue $ 156,446 $ 122,801 Voyage expenses (3,339 ) (2,532 ) TCE revenue $ 153,107 $ 120,269 TCE revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $32.8 million to $153.1 million, from $120.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was driven by the growth of the Company's fleet to an average of 128.0 operating vessels during the three months ended March 31, 2018 from an average of 92.9 operating vessels during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This growth was the result of the merger with NPTI, which resulted in the delivery of four vessels in June 2017 and 23 vessels in September 2017. In addition, the Company took delivery of eight vessels under its newbuilding program throughout 2017 and two vessels under its newbuilding program during the first quarter of 2018. The increase in TCE revenue resulting from the increase in the size of the Company's fleet was partially offset by a reduction in TCE revenue per day, which decreased to $13,331 per day during the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $14,408 per day during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This reduction reflects the challenging market conditions, driven by an unfavorable global supply and demand imbalance, that have persisted throughout 2017 and the first quarter of 2018.\nVessel operating costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $22.3 million to $70.4 million, from $48.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was the result of an increase in the average number of owned and bareboat chartered-in vessels for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to 118.6 vessels from 80.6 vessels for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This growth was the result of (i) the merger with NPTI, which resulted in the delivery of four vessels in June 2017 and 23 vessels in September 2017, (ii) the delivery of eight vessels under the Company's newbuilding program throughout 2017 and two vessels under the Company's newbuilding program during the first quarter of 2018, and (iii) the delivery of seven Handymax vessels under bareboat charter-in agreements, which operated for a portion of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and for the entire three months ended March 31, 2018. These additions were offset by the sales of two MR tankers in June and July 2017.\nVoyage expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $0.8 million to $3.3 million, from $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily the result of certain vessels acquired from NPTI that traded in the spot market during the first quarter of 2018 as these vessels transitioned technical managers or transitioned from trading crude oil to clean products.\nCharterhire expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $1.4 million to $18.0 million, from $19.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This decrease was driven by lower average daily base rates on the Company's time chartered-in fleet during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to an average of $14,035 per vessel per day from an average of $15,601 per vessel per day for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company's time and bareboat chartered-in fleet for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to an average of 19.4 vessels, (9.4 time chartered-in vessels and 10.0 bareboat chartered-in vessels) from an average of 15.6 vessels (12.3 time chartered-in vessels and 3.3 bareboat chartered-in vessels) for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The average daily base rate for the Company's bareboat chartered-in fleet was $6,797 per vessel per day for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $7,013 per vessel per day for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDepreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $13.0 million to $43.5 million, from $30.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by (i) the delivery of two LR2 and six MR vessels under the Company's newbuilding program during 2017, (ii) the delivery of the four LR1 vessels acquired from NPTI in June 2017, (iii) the delivery of eight LR1 and 15 LR2 vessels acquired from NPTI in September 2017, and (iv) the delivery of two MR vessels under the Company's newbuilding program during the three months ended March 31, 2018. These deliveries were offset by the sales of five MR vessels throughout 2017, of which three were leased back under bareboat charter-in operating lease arrangements.\nFinancial expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $17.8 million to $39.4 million, from $21.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in financial expenses was primarily a result of (i) increased interest expense incurred as a result of the assumption of $924.8 million of indebtedness as part of the Company's merger with NPTI ($118.3 million in June 2017 and $806.4 million in September 2017) and (ii) increases in LIBOR rates when compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nScorpio Tankers Inc. and Subsidiaries Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or Loss (unaudited) For the three months ended\nMarch 31, In thousands of U.S. dollars except per share and share data 2018 2017 Revenue Vessel revenue $ 156,446 $ 122,801 Operating expenses Vessel operating costs (70,430 ) (48,148 ) Voyage expenses (3,339 ) (2,532 ) Charterhire (18,012 ) (19,431 ) Depreciation (43,455 ) (30,502 ) General and administrative expenses (13,626 ) (11,910 ) Merger transaction related costs (264 ) — Total operating expenses (149,126 ) (112,523 ) Operating income 7,320 10,278 Other (expense) and income, net Financial expenses (39,418 ) (21,664 ) Realized loss on derivative financial instruments — (116 ) Financial income 385 52 Other expenses, net (81 ) (83 ) Total other expense, net (39,114 ) (21,811 ) Net loss $ (31,794 ) $ (11,533 ) Loss per share Basic $ (0.10 ) $ (0.07 ) Diluted $ (0.10 ) $ (0.07 ) Basic weighted average shares outstanding 307,905,015 162,711,256 Diluted weighted average shares outstanding (1) 307,905,015 162,711,256 (1) The dilutive effect of (i) unvested shares of restricted stock and (ii) the potentially dilutive securities relating to the Company's Convertible Notes were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.

(2 ) Freight rates are commonly measured in the shipping industry in terms of time charter equivalent per day (or TCE per day), which is calculated by subtracting voyage expenses, including bunkers and port charges, from vessel revenue and dividing the net amount (time charter equivalent revenues) by the number of revenue days in the period. Revenue days are the number of days the vessel is owned or chartered-in less the number of days the vessel is off-hire for drydock and repairs. (3 ) Vessel operating costs per day represent vessel operating costs divided by the number of operating days during the period. Operating days are the total number of available days in a period with respect to the owned or bareboat chartered-in vessels, before deducting available days due to off-hire days and days in drydock. Operating days is a measurement that is only applicable to our owned, finance leased or bareboat chartered-in vessels, not our time chartered-in vessels.\nFleet list as of April 24, 2018 Vessel Name
