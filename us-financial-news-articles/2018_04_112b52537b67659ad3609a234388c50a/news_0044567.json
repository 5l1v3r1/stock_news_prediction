The ruling wasn’t immediately made public.\nUnder the terms of the EU-Turkey deal , migrants and refugees arriving from Turkey must remain in detention centers on the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros, Kos and Rhodes until their asylum applications are reviewed.\nBut the backlog of applicants and the slow-moving Greek bureaucracy have left thousands of people trapped in overcrowded centers for months or longer. The court ruling is effective immediately but isn’t retroactive, so it won’t apply to the people already on the islands, only to new arrivals.\nGreek authorities have been reluctant to move large numbers of migrants to the mainland as they fear this would encourage more migrants. Around 16,000 migrants and refugees are currently languishing in reception centers on the Greek islands, nearly triple the centers’ capacity. The overcrowding has left many sleeping outside, while the dire conditions have left many exposed to disease and violence.\nAid groups say Greek officials have allowed the conditions to deteriorate to create a deterrent to other would-be migrants. Greek officials say they are trying to deal with the backlog of applications swiftly.\nThe court ruled on the Greek asylum service’s decision in May 2016 restricting migrants to the islands after a migrant aid group filed a complaint seeking its revocation.\nMigrants on the island of Samos in November.

While the Greek government cannot appeal the ruling, senior Greek officials say the asylum service plans to issue new orders designed to maintain the current regime.\nThe court ruling could endanger the EU-Turkey deal because that agreement requires Greek authorities to review migrants’ asylum applications at the point at which they enter the country. If their asylum application is rejected, they can be returned to Turkey or their country of origin. It isn’t clear whether Turkey would accept people back if they don’t come from the islands or whether European officials would allow Greece to move migrants to the mainland.\nMeanwhile, the ministry said it would submit in the coming days new legislation aimed at accelerating the process of reviewing asylum requests.\nThe number of migrants arriving in Greece has increased in recent weeks as the weather conditions are starting to improve and as tensions between Greece and neighboring Turkey rise. Around 2,500 people landed on the Greek islands in March, about 1,000 more than in the same period last year, according to the Migration Ministry’s figures. Around 120 people have arrived a day on average in April so far.\nGreek authorities are also concerned about the significant rise in arrivals from across the Greek-Turkish northeastern land border. According to police data, nearly 1,700 people were detained for illegal entry into the country after crossing the Evros River last month, compared with 262 people in March 2017.\nWrite to Nektaria Stamouli at nektaria.stamouli@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T00:59:17.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
