REUTERS/Staff/File Photo \nThe pan European STOXX 600 fell 0.45 percent by 0707 GMT, erasing only part of the 2.4 percent gain in the previous session and remained on track for a small weekly gain. \nTrump on Thursday directed U.S. trade officials to identify tariffs on $100 billion more Chinese imports, upping the ante in an already high-stakes trade confrontation between the world’s two largest economies. \nThe new warning however did not appear to change the prevailing view among investors that a full blown trade war that could threaten global growth is unlikely. \n“Markets will now watch both the rhetoric from Trump’s cabinet members and China’s response to assess whether risk of a trade war is materially higher,” said Credit Suisse in its investment daily. “We continue to see a trade war as unlikely”. \nHowever caution dominated, prompting investors into stocks like utilities seen as more resilient to possible trade escalations. French utility Suez ( SEVI.PA ) led the sector higher, further boosted by a bullish broker note. \nElsewhere among top movers was Dufry ( DUFN.S ), up 3.5 percent after the Swiss retail company proposed a higher than expected dividend, while Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) rose 2.2 percent after Italian state lender CDP said it would buy a stake of up to 5 percent in the telecoms company. \nTech stocks were a weak spot with chip makers like Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) generally lower following losses overnight in shares in Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ). \nThe South Korean tech giant tipped a surprise record first-quarter profit but market reaction was muted due to growing concerns that the semiconductor boom that has driven its earnings is about to end. \nThe trade-exposed auto sector was the leading sectoral loser.
