On behalf of the Board and everyone at Trevena, I thank Max for her exceptional leadership during her time at Trevena and her continued contributions through this transition period and as a director.”\nMr. Moulder continued, “At the same time, we are thrilled to have Carrie become Trevena’s next CEO.
