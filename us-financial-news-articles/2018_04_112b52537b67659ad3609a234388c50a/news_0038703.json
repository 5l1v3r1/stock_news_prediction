Cincinnati fell to an MLB-worst 2-11 with its sixth straight loss.\nWeaver (2-0) didn’t allow a hit until the fifth inning, when Devin Mesoraco reached on an infield single. In his next at-bat, Mesoraco ended Weaver’s night with a two-run homer to left-center, his first of the year.\nBut Weaver still turned in his third straight strong start. Over six-plus innings, the right-hander permitted four hits and two runs with a walk and seven strikeouts.\nCincinnati pulled within two runs in the eighth on Joey Votto’s RBI single, but he was picked off first for the inning’s third out. Bud Norris pitched the ninth to garner his second save, fanning pinch hitter Tucker Barnhart with the tying runs aboard to end it.\nTyler Mahle (1-2) matched Weaver pitch for pitch over the first five innings, with the exception of Molina’s second inning solo shot to right-center, his fifth of the season and second in as many nights.\nBut Mahle couldn’t hold it together in the sixth. Dexter Fowler led off with his second homer to right, followed by a Tommy Pham single and a Matt Carpenter double. Marcell Ozuna drove in Pham with an RBI single, and one out later, Molina dumped a two-run single into left-center.\nMahle lasted 5 1/3 innings, yielding nine hits and five runs. He walked none and fanned five.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:40:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
