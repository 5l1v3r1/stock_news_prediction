Hitler was born in Austria on April 20, 1889. \nFar-right merchandise, including T-Shirts with the slogan “I (heart) HTLR” were on sale at the event, as were toy tanks. \n\nFar-right supporter attends rock music festival \"Schwert und Schild\" (Sword and Shield) in Ostritz, Germany April 20, 2018.

They said they had arrested a 31-year-old who made an illegal “Heil Hitler” salute. \nGermany has strict laws on hate speech and symbols linked to Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled between 1933 and 1945. \nAlongside the festival for peace in the market square of Ostritz, which runs until Sunday and which some German media reported had more than 1,000 attendees on Friday, police said there would also be a cycling event to protest against the far-right on Saturday. \nMichael Kretschmer, premier of the eastern state of Saxony where Ostritz is located, said local residents and churches had organized the festival for peace of their own accord. \nHe added: “The fight against extremism is successful when it comes from the midst of society, when it is not prescribed but rather comes from the people themselves.” \nReporting by Reuters Television and Michelle Martin; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Ros Russell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T15:21:06.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
