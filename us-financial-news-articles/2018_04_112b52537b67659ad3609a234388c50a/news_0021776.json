He was joined at an award ceremony on Tuesday by relatives and officials. \nThe Guinness World Records title for the oldest man who ever lived is held by another Japan man, Jiroemon Kimura, who died in 2013 at the age of 116 years and 54 days. \nThe greatest authenticated age for any human is 122 years, 164 days by Jeanne Louise Calment of France, who died in 1997.
