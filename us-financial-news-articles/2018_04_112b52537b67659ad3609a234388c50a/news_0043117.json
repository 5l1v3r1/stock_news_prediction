The opposition is also contending provisions on campaign financing and access to media in the laws. \nRavalomanana, who was deposed in a 2009 coup, has teamed up with the man who succeeded him, Andy Rajoelina, to oppose the laws pushed by President Hery Rajaonarimampianina. \nHundreds of protesters gathered in the center of the capital early on Saturday to protest against the laws which were enacted by parliament earlier this month, before police fired dozens of teargas canisters at the crowd.

Ravalomanana was convicted by a court when he was in exile after the 2009 coup for a range of offences. \nHe has already said he will run in the election due before the end of this year though the precise date has yet to be set.
