Merck said last year it was looking to sell its consumer healthcare business, which has annual sales of about $1 billion, to help to fund its research into prescription drugs.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck declined to comment, while Mylan did not respond to requests for comment.
