Analysts on average expected 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company said net profit for the quarter slipped to $1.5 billion, or 91 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year ago due to expenses associated with a recently-announced collaboration deal.\nBristol-Myers now expects 2018 earnings of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, up from its prior view of $3.15 to $3.30.
