The formal proposal is expected to be unveiled in the coming weeks and has not been finalized. The Los Angeles Times first reported the plan earlier Friday.\nThe lengthy draft proposal is also expected to assert that a 1975 federal law preempts states from imposing emissions rules, but the administration is not expected to immediately propose revoking California's waiver under the Clean Air Act to set its own rules.\nAutomakers want changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. They want revisions to the Obama standards to make it easier and less costly to meet targets, which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks.\nThe Obama administrations rules, negotiated with automakers in 2011, were aimed at doubling average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.\nThe U.S. Transportation Department and EPA did not immediately comment on Friday but EPA said earlier this month it had determined the fuel rules through 2025 were not appropriate and would propose revisions.\nStanley Young, spokesman for the California Air Resources Board said: \"If enacted, this would harm peoples health, boost greenhouse gas pollution and force drivers to pay more money at the pump for years. It would also severely disrupt the U.S. auto industry, compromising its ability to succeed in a highly competitive global market that increasingly values innovative and efficient technologies.\"\nEarlier this week, two auto trade groups met with White House officials, including Christopher Liddell, a White House deputy chief of staff, to discuss the issue, a Trump administration official confirmed.\nAutomakers, including General Motors Co chief executive Mary Barra and Toyota Motor Corp, have repeatedly urged the Trump administration to try to reach agreement with California to maintain a national program.\nCalifornia Air Resources Board chief Mary Nichols told Reuters earlier this month the state was willing to make changes in the requirements to help automakers comply.\nA group of 12 state attorneys general have threatened to sue if the Trump administration reverses the Obama-era rules.\nOn Friday, nearly two dozen Democratic U.S. senators said they would oppose any effort by the Trump administration to rescind California's authority to set state vehicle emissions rules, according to a letter reviewed by Reuters.
