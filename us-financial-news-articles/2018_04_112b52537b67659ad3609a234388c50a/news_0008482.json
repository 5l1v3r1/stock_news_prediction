He said Pakistanis living overseas and declaring income or assets would pay a 2 per cent one-time penalty.\nPakistani politicians will be exempted from the amnesty, which will be effective until June 30.\n“This is some 2-1/2 months’ time you have to benefit from, and after that you will have to face the law,” the prime minister said.\nOnce the amnesty period expires, Pakistani authorities will use technology to identify and catch tax evaders.\nHe said only 1.2 million of Pakistan’a 208 million people filed income tax returns in the last year, and of them 500,000 paid zero taxes.\nAbbasi said the government was also reducing the tax rate to encourage people to voluntarily sign up. Tax rates on individuals vary in Pakistan, but can be as high as 30 percent for salaried individuals and 35 percent for non-salaried individuals.\nPakistan has one of the world’s lowest number of taxpayers as a percentage of the population.\nSuccessive governments have promised to rein in tax evasion and boost revenues but have faced fierce resistance to change, including from the many politicians and businessmen believed to be among those dodging payment.\nPakistan’s nearly $300 billion economy has recently been showing signs of vulnerability despite surging growth rates above 5 percent, the fastest pace in a decade.\nThe government has in recent months devalued the rupee, imposed tariffs on imported goods and sought to boost exports to reduce growing balance of payments pressures.\nA widened current account deficit has prompted analysts to suggest the country may need an International Monetary Fund bailout in the next 12 months.\nAbbasi said he was aware of the challenges.\n“We have been in a growth phase. There are current account challenges. We are tackling that,” he said.
