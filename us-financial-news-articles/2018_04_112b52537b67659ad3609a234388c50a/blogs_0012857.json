Here are his reasons why. \n• Cybersecurity stock Palo Alto Networks, from a fundamental perspective, has reported solid results and technically has reversed a major downtrend. On another technical note, the stock is showing improving relative strength. The stock has gained 34 percent this year. \n• Energy company Anadarko Petroleum has a strong free cash flow and is technically showing a multiyear ascending triangle, with the next resistance coming in at $74 per share. The stock is up nearly 10 percent this year, above $58 a share in Monday's premarket. \n• Piper Jaffray forecasts retail name PVH giving conservative forward 2019 guidance, and is a \"solid beat-and-raise story.\" From a technical picture, the stock has successfully retested uptrend support and is poised for a new leg higher. Shares have risen 14 percent this year. \nBottom line: Piper Jaffray is recommending a handful of stocks sharing strong technical and fundamental outlooks.
