And most of the people are elderly, women and children,” said Gum Sha Aung, an official of a coalition of Kachin-based humanitarian groups.\nThe United States embassy in Yangon said it was “deeply concerned” about intensified fighting in Kachin.\nIn a Twitter message on Friday, it urged the government and military to “protect civilian populations and allow humanitarian assistance” to those affected by the recent conflicts.\nA coalition of 32 groups in Kachin this week urged the United Nations Security Council to refer Myanmar to the international criminal court, citing recent deaths and displacement of civilians in Myanmar army operations.\n“Women, children, elderly people forced to flee their homes because of the relentless fighting in Kachin,” Mark Cutts, the head of a U.N. agency coordinating humanitarian affairs in Myanmar, said in a Twitter message on Thursday.\n“Local humanitarian organizations doing outstanding work trying to help. But when will this decades-old conflict end?”\nReaching a comprehensive peace deal with Myanmar’s ethnic minorities has been leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s stated top priority, but the Buddhist-majority country has seen the worst fighting with rebels in years since she took office in 2016.\nEnding the civil war, eclipsed in media coverage by the plight of nearly 700,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees who fled to neighboring Bangladesh, is key to further development of the resource-rich country.
