Putting in the dark, somehow I was able to make that,” Park said. \n“I think I was a little nervous because 18 is not my favourite hole. I made some good par saves there to just keep on playing. Finally, we’re playing a different hole tomorrow so I’m excited about that.” \nThe playoff will resume on the par-four 10th at 8 a.m. local time (1500 GMT) when the 31-year-old Lindberg will continue her quest for a first major triumph as well as a maiden LPGA Tour victory. NO NERVES \n“I wasn’t nervous at all in the playoff,” said Lindberg, who carded a closing 71 after starting the day with a three-shot lead. \nPark and Song shot matching 67s to join Lindberg one shot ahead of Thai Ariya Jutanugarn (65) and American Jessica Korda (66). \nLindberg, unaccustomed to such lofty heights, surprised many with her poise in the final round of a tournament she has led since Thursday. \n“The first few holes I was a little nervous but I settled down and I felt like I was back in business and I kept grinding all day,” she said. \n“These extra holes, of course I want to be out there beating the girls but it feels like I have nothing to lose. I’ve been fighting all day. This is just a bonus at the end.” \nThe Swede expects to be equally as calm on Monday. \n“(Park) is one of the best female golfers of all time. To have a chance to beat her in a playoff, I think I’m going to sleep great tonight and be ready to go in the morning.” \nPark added that a good night’s rest was key to her chances of emerging with the win. \n“I’m just going to have to relax well and go out early in the morning,” the 29-year-old said.
