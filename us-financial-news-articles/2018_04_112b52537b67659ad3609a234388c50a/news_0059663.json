That’s why we have such a geographically diversified portfolio, (...) when one market doesn’t have a good dynamic, another generally picks up,” Gault said.\nThe company released first-quarter results on Thursday, with sales growth of 3.4 percent for the whole group compared to the previous year, driven by the performance of Iberia (+6.4 percent), and France-Belgium (+3.1 percent), offsetting the Italian slowdown.\nThe company reiterated its outlook for 2018.\nKlepierre approached Hammerson after the British company had agreed an all-share offer to buy smaller rival Intu Properties ( INTUP.L ). Hammerson’s proposed 3.4 billion pound takeover of Intu was later scrapped.\nKlepierre had wanted to buy Hammerson without Intu Properties but finally abandoned its final 635 pence-a-share bid after Hammerson repeatedly stated that Klepierre’s offer undervalued it.\nThe group’s shares went down 9 percent after it approached Hammerson and back up more than 4 percent when it dropped the deal.\nAccording to Jefferies analysts, Klepierre might re-bid for the British peer in the coming months, but this time with a lower offer after Hammerson withdrew its bid on Intu.\n($1 = 0.7180 pounds)\nReporting by Manon Jacob in Gdynia; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:40:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
