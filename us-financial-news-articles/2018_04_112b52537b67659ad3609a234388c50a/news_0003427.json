All three lines of our businesses registered strong growth in the fourth quarter. As the Chinese economy regained growth momentum in 2017, increased infrastructure and residential property development together with the positive effects of supply-side reform and heightened policies of emission control, propelled strong demand for new trucks.\"\nMs. Jinrui Yu, SORL's Chief Operating Officer, added, \"Our growth significantly outperformed the on-road commercial vehicle market as our advanced commercial vehicle braking products continued to enable us to expand our customer base and grow our market share in China and abroad. For 10 consecutive years, we generated profits and our earning power has improved in 2017. With $33.8 million in net cashflow from operations, we achieved a significant increase from last year.\"\n\"We also invested over $26 million in property, plant and equipment in 2017 to further enhance our productivity and prepare ourselves to meet the growing demand for our products. As the market leader of braking products for on-road commercial vehicles in China, and braking systems are one of the most critical vehicle safety related components, we are well positioned for future growth,\" Ms. Yu concluded.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales increased by 43.4% to $123.0 million from $85.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from the Company's domestic OEM customers were $38.3 million, an increase of 73.3% from $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The strong year-over-year sales growth to the OEM market was mainly due to increased sales of new trucks, especially heavy-duty trucks.\nSales to China's domestic aftermarket increased 29.6% to $66.1 million, compared with $51.0 million in the same quarter of 2016. The increased sales in aftermarket segment were mainly attributable to the robust sales of new vehicles in the recent quarters, generating higher expiration of OEM warranties. Revenues from international markets increased 46.5% to $18.6 million, compared to $12.7 million in the same quarter of 2016 as the Company's global customer base continued to expand.\nThe gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 63.6% to $31.3 million from $19.1 million a year ago. Gross margin was 25.5% compared with 22.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, operating expenses increased to $28.2 million from $8.9 million in the same quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 23.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling and distribution expenses were $16.2 million, or 13.2% of quarterly revenues, compared with $9.2 million, or 10.7%% a year ago. Higher selling and distribution expenses were primarily due to the higher freight, packaging and compensation to the sales team for outperforming the market and increasing the Company's market share. General and administrative (\"G&A\") expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $8.5 million compared with negative $1.5 million a year ago. G&A expenses as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 6.9%. The negative G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 were mainly due to a large sum of aged receivables collected in the quarter which reversed bad debt provisions in the G&A expenses. The extraordinary 2016 fourth quarter G&A expenses makes year-over-year comparisons challenging in the 2017 fourth quarter. Research and development (\"R&D\") expenses were $3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, R&D expenses were 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 1.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFinancial expenses were $1.3 million, compared with $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncome before income taxes was $3.7 million compared with $10.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in income before income taxes reflected higher operating expenses compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe provision for income taxes was $0.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to a $1.6 million reversal in the fourth quarter of last year. The tax rate was 13.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 14.7% a year ago.\nNet income attributable to stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.9 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared with $8.3 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share a year ago.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nSORL's net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 increased 40.1% to a new record high of $390.5 million from the former annual record high of $278.7 million in 2016.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's sales to the domestic OEM market increased by 52.0% to $180.1 million from $118.4 million in 2016.

The bus market reported a unit sales decline in 2017.\nAftermarket sales increased by 37.2% to $138.4 million from $100.9 million in 2016. The increasing number of OEM warranty expirations from prior years' commercial vehicle sales helped drive aftermarket growth in 2017. International sales increased by 21.3% to $72.0 million compared with $59.4 million last year due to a growing international customer base.\nSORL's gross profit increased 38.2% to $104.2 million from $75.4 million in 2016 due to increased sales. Gross margin decreased to 26.7% from 27.0% in 2016 due primarily to price promotions to increase the Company's leading market position.\nSORL's operational expenses increased to $72.1 million from $52.8 million in 2016.\nSelling expenses increased by approximately $9.2 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher freight, packaging and commissions related to higher sales.

G&A expenses increased by $6.8 million in 2017 mainly due to higher sales. G&A expenses increased to 5.6% of sales revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 5.5% for the 2016 year.

The pretax income margin was 8.1% in the 2017 year compared with 8.8% in 2016.\nThe provision for income taxes was $4.7 million representing a 14.9% tax rate compared with $3.3 million, or a 13.3% tax rate in 2016.\nThe net income attributable to stockholders in 2017 was $24.3 million, compared with $19.2 million in 2016.
