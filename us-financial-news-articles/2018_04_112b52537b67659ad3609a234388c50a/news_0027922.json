We leave that where it is. The bottom line is, that’s all behind them. They are lean and mean and ready to get to the work.” \nWestinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba Corp which is to be bought by a unit of Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc , is one of the world’s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel and provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world’s 450 commercial reactors. \nPerry and Pradhan released a joint statement to “reaffirm their strong commitment to early and full implementation of our civil nuclear partnership, including the Westinghouse civil nuclear project”. They also said the two countries would deepen cooperation on oil and gas, power, renewable energy and coal. \n“In keeping with the shared objectives to provide a stronger business orientation to our energy cooperation, both sides noted with appreciation the growing investment of Indian companies in the United States and the beginning of oil and gas exports from the United States to India,” they said in the statement. \nThe United States under President Donald Trump has been looking to sell more energy products to India, the world’s third-biggest buyer of oil. \nPradhan said India wants to buy more U.S. crude oil “subject to reasonable pricing”. New Delhi has also sought U.S. companies’ participation in India’s strategic petroleum reserves. (Reporting by Nidhi Verma and Sudarshan Varadhan Writing by Krishna N.
