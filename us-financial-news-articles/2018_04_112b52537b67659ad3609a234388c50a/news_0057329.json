He’s not scared of taking his pants off, so he said get in there.”\nRose and Stenson combined to shoot seven-under 65 in the first round of the team event on Thursday.\nRose was more adventurous than American Talor Gooch, who found three alligators nearby after his ball found a bunker at the 18th hole.\nTwo of the reptiles responded to a nudge from a rake and returned to the adjacent pond, but the third would not budge, which led to a ruling.\nGooch was allowed a free drop in the bunker, but his ball plugged.\nHe considered that a reasonable outcome under the circumstances.\n“I chose life over a good lie in that situation,” he told Golf Channel.\nReporting by Andrew Both; Editing by Ian Ransom\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:12:14.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
