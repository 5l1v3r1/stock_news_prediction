As of today, Venezuela's crude production is half of that when Mr Chavez took office at the end of 1999,\" he said.\nThe drop is one of the largest in the \"history of oil,\" Birol said, adding that the country's production is expected to decline even further, although it was hard to tell how deep the cuts would go.\nAt the IEF, India's Energy Minister Dharmendra Pradhan called for \"reasonable\" oil prices after Brent rose above $71 to hit its highest since late 2014 on Tuesday. India is the world's third largest oil importer.\nBirol said: \"It's important for the global economy that we don't see a price spike. Last year we have seen a very strong, spectacular growth in the gas markets, but this is mainly a result of gas prices being on the low side.\"\nOil and gas producers should be wary of price spikes because it will lead buyers to find alternatives such as coal and renewables, Birol said.
