REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo The prosecutor said in a statement the recommendation to detain him or “take cautionary measures” was made due to the complexity of the case and because it believed Falciani was a flight risk, which had not previously been the case.\nA ruling from the High Court is expected later.\nOn Wednesday, Spanish police arrested the former employee of HSBC’s Swiss private bank who was convicted of industrial espionage after leaking clients’ tax information.\nThe police acted on an international detention and extradition order from Swiss authorities dated March 19.\nReporting By Jesús Aguado; editing by Paul E.
