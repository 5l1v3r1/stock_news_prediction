Other co-leaders on the course were Spaniard Rafael Cabrera Bello, Austrian Bernd Wiesberger and Australian Marc Leishman. \nSwede Henrik Stenson, Canada’s Adam Hadwin and Americans Charley Hoffman and Patrick Reed were also in a share of the lead but yet to start their second rounds. \nThree-times champion Phil Mickelson was two shots off the lead until a nightmare ninth hole where he made a triple-bogey seven that dropped him to three-over on the day. \nNorthern Irishman Rory McIlroy, who needs a win this week to complete the career grand slam of golf’s four majors, was among those sitting a shot off the lead after mixing two birdies with three bogeys through 10 holes. \nLate starter Sergio Garcia, whose 81 on Thursday was the worst opening-round score by a defending champion, remained at nine over par for the tournament after parring the first hole and faces a big uphill challenge to make the cut.
