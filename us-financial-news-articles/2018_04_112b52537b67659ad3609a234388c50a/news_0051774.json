REUTERS/Sergio Moraes/File Photo\nFIFA said that Del Nero had been investigated over “schemes in which he received bribes in exchange for his role in awarding contracts to companies for the media and marketing rights to various football tournaments.”\nThese included the Copa America, the Copa Libertadores — the South American equivalent of the Champions League — and the domestic Copa Brasil tournament.\nIn doing so, he violated ethics rules on bribery, offering and accepting gifts, loyalty, conflict of interest and general rules of conduct, FIFA said.\nDel Nero, a former member of FIFA’s executive committee, denied wrongdoing and told Reuters he would appeal.\n“Yes, I’ve seen the news from FIFA and I can only describe it as a big absurdity,” he said in a brief telephone conversation.\nIn a statement to Reuters, his lawyers said he had received the decision with “surprise and indignation”.\n“It’s important to emphasise that the investigation was not capable of producing any proof relating to his supposed involvement in corruption schemes,” it said.\nIt said the committee had made “innumerable procedural violations” which it described as “a clear affront to the most basic principles of defence and due legal process.” FILE PHOTO: President of Brazilian Soccer Confederation (CBF) Marco Polo Del Nero leaves a news conference after the announcement of the players for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil September 17, 2015.
