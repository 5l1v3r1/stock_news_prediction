XPO Logistics Inc. XPO -0.98% is the latest to join the digital fray, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, launching an online freight marketplace that comes with XPO’s list of shippers and carriers. The XPO Connect service comes as startups including Uber Freight push into freight brokerage with a digital drive they say can cut costs and make shipping more efficient. That has added urgency to the tech investments by existing operators. ARC Advisory Group’s Steve Banker wrote in a recent blog post that freight technology providers Omnitracs and Descartes Systems Group DSGX -1.04% are building software to speed up shipping connections. And big brokers like C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., CHRW -0.71% J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. JBHT 0.11% and XPO are adding online platforms they hope will be a bulwark against would-be disrupters.\nTyson Foods Inc. is trying to get its supply chain looking leaner and more digital. The largest U.S. meat producer is undertaking a big overhaul of its back-office systems to bring a more modern cast to the 83-year-old business. Chief Technology Officer Scott Spradley, who has Silicon Valley cred from his time at Hewlett-Packard Co. , tells the WSJ’s Steven Norton digitizing the company’s supply chain will help Tyson get more nimble and cut costs in a notoriously low-margin business. That means switching to a cloud-based enterprise resource planning system, as well as bringing in more analytics—including scoping out weather patterns and sports events—to better predict demand. The company has plenty of incentive to move faster, with rapid shifts in consumer buying patterns pressing big suppliers like Tyson to make adjustments on the shelves and in their operations.\nThe Trump administration is hoping to minimize the domestic impact of its more-aggressive trade policies. Whether the proposed help to the farm belt will reach more broadly across agricultural supply chains remains an open question, as the White House considers an aid package that could climb into the billions of dollars. The WSJ’s Bob Davis, Siobhan Hughes and Jesse Newman write the plan could tap Depression-era programs like the Commodity Credit Corp., which was created in 1933 to stabilize farm incomes. Still, many farm groups say they aren’t looking for price supports and other help, and would prefer unimpeded trade with China. The support could bolster American farmers in the short term, but it could also draw objections from producers and buyers in global markets. And the aid may not spur the farm production that pushes crops through shipping channels.\nCOMMODITIES Photo: Getty Images Rare earths may not be all that rare. Researchers in Japan have found hundreds of years’ worth of rare-earth metal deposits in the country’s waters, a potentially significant find given that China controls much of the world’s sourcing for minerals used in batteries and electric vehicles. The WSJ’s Mayumi Negishi reports the deposits were found in the Pacific Ocean seabed about 1,150 miles southeast of Tokyo. Extracting them would be costly, but Japan is anxious to get more control over next-generation technologies and is pressing its research. China’s grip on the minerals supply chain has long concerned many nations, particularly since they are used in weapons systems. It will take more than mining the minerals to change the supply chain, however: Many nations hold rare-earth deposits, but China dominates the field largely because it has businesses to process them for industrial applications.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Farmers are more interested in negotiation than mitigation. ’\n—Davie Stephens, vice president of the American Soybean Association, on potential federal support amid trade tensions.\nNumber of the Day 7.2% Year-over-year increase in the Cass Information Systems Inc. index for truckload costs in March, the largest increase since January 2015.\nIN OTHER NEWS Oil prices are trading at their highest levels since late 2014, pushing close to $70 a barrel .
