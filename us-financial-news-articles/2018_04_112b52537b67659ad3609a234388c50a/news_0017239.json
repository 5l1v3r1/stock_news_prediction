REUTERS/Adnan Abidi/File Photo The state-run Indian Railways shared the data with Reuters days after an incident in which the brakes on a 22-coach train carrying hundreds of passengers failed, letting it run freely in reverse for about 13 km (eight miles).\nThe railways has suspended several officials since the incident, and its chairman acknowledged that turning around the culture and image of a government behemoth that employed 1.3 million and ran around 22,000 trains daily was going to take time, despite the safety success seen in 2017/18.\nThe number of deaths and injuries last fiscal year ending March 31 was the lowest in at least 18 years for which data was provided. The worst was in 2002/03, when 1,400 people were killed or injured. The figure in 2016/17 was 607, the data show.\n“Safety is an end result. We need to focus on maintenance, and that also includes looking after the people,” Ashwani Lohani, who was brought in to helm the department last August after a spate of accidents led to a top-level shake-up, told Reuters in his office on Monday.\n“We have a tremendous inherent strength of our people ... But I don’t have a magic wand.”\nThe railways is in the midst of a $130 billion, five-year modernisation plan and is hiring nearly 90,000 people over the next few months to mainly fill positions left vacant by retirees.\nLohani said the world’s fourth-biggest rail network was trying to make it easier for all levels of employees to approach top officials via WhatsApp or other media so that grievances can be addressed immediately and human error can be minimised.\n“It is essential that the focus on safety must not be lost,” Lohani said in a recent posting on a railways WhatsApp group. “We are a 24x7 organisation and must be alert all the times.”\nHe also said the railways was considering bringing in local private companies to run new tourist trains and be involved in overhauling of some stations.\nThe railways has joint ventures with Alstom of France and U.S.-based General Electric for locomotive supply and maintenance.\nParked passengers trains are seen at a railway station in Mumbai, October 22, 2015.
