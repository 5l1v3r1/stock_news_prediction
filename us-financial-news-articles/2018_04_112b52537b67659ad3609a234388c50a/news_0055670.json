Well now is your chance to have some FLOTUS FUN and show us!\" the Madame Tussauds website states. Hector Retamal | Getty Images Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer stands next to waxworks of First Lady Melania Trump as well as the President at Madame Tussauds New York City in April 2018\nSpicer said the statue was convincing. \"I'm not kidding, I looked at a photo I had with the first lady before I left and I mean — it's pretty remarkable how lifelike it is, and the same thing with the president. It's impressive,\" Spicer said Wednesday, NBC News reported.\n\"She's a very gracious and fashionable woman,\" he added. \"I don't think the American people have fully appreciated the level of intellect she has and her political savviness.\" TWEET\nSpicer, who is promoting his book \"The Briefing,\" added that Melania was concerned about his next move after his resignation last July.\n\"I had an opportunity to go over and say goodbye and it really meant a lot… And she wanted to make sure she had an opportunity to sit down and talk for a little bit… 'How you doing, what's next, let me know what I can do to support,'\" he said.\nThe Times Square attraction is less than a mile from Trump Tower, and the waxwork will soon get closer to the family's current home as it moves to Washington at the end of May.
