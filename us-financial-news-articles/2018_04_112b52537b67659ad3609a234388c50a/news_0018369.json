The Houthis said they were targeting an Aramco facility in Jizan, but the company said its facilities there were operating “normally and safely”.\nThe company is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea, which is expected to become fully operational in 2019.\nAramco was not immediately available to comment on the missiles.\nThe Houthis say their missile attacks on the kingdom are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition.\nTheir news agency SABA said four people were killed, including a woman and a child, and 10 others wounded in two air strikes on Wednesday in the Razih district of western Saada province. There was no immediate comment from the coalition.\nSaudi Arabia and an alliance of Muslim states intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 to try and push back the Houthis after they drove the internationally-recognised government into exile in Riyadh.\nThe coalition has launched thousands of air strikes in Yemen which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians.\nThe United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the three-year-old war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid.\nThe coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.\nArms monitor Conflict Armament Research says it has evidence that the drones used on Wednesday and other Houthi kit were made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”.\nAdditional reporting by Katie Paul, Noah Browning and Rania El Gamal in Dubai and Marwa Rashad in Riyadh; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T10:35:40.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
