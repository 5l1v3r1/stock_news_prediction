Trea Turner and Matt Wieters each managed harmless singles off Ryu, who threw 58 of his 89 pitches for strikes.\nStephen Strasburg (2-2) pitched well enough to win on most nights. In seven innings, the right hander ceded only five hits and two runs, issuing two walks and striking out 10.\nHis two mistakes decided the game. In the second, Pederson pounced on a 1-0 fastball, powering it 415 feet over the wall in center to celebrate his 26th birthday with his first homer of the year.\nHernandez upped the margin to two in the seventh, pinch-hitting for Ryu and powdering a high, inside fastball well into the bleachers in left field for his second homer of the season.\nBellinger supplied insurance in the eighth with his third homer, drilling a 0-2 cutter from reliever Carlos Torres 409 feet to right field with Yasmani Grandal aboard following a walk.\nWashington (10-11) missed on its only real scoring threat in the third. Turner singled with one out before Bryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman drew two-out walks. But Moises Sierra got jammed by a 1-0 cutter and grounded to short to leave the bases loaded.\nThe Dodgers (9-10) failed on a decent scoring chance in the fifth. Yasiel Puig singled with two outs and swiped second base, but that allowed Strasburg to intentionally walk Max Muncy and take his chances with Ryu. A 2-2 curveball left Ryu at the plate with bat on shoulder as Strasburg headed for the dugout.\nLos Angeles wasted a better opportunity in the sixth. Chris Taylor singled, Corey Seager walked and Grandal was plunked to fill the bases with no outs. But Strasburg stranded all three by fanning Bellinger, Pederson and Matt Kemp.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:23:12.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
