The market reaction so far feels as if we are starting to see an end of its long rally since 2009. Investors could be thinking that the best time will be soon behind us,” he said.\nCreeping gains in U.S. Treasury yields are fuelling fears. The 10-year yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, has been driven steadily higher by a combination of concerns over inflation, growing debt supply, and rising Federal Reserve borrowing costs.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 3.003 percent on Tuesday and last stood at 2.992 percent.\nA break of its January 2014 high of 3.041 percent could turn investors even more bearish.\nFed Funds rate futures price have been constantly falling this month, pricing in a considerable chance of three more rate hikes by the end of this year.\nRising U.S. rates underpinned the U.S. dollar in the currency market.\nThe euro stood at $1.2234, not far from Tuesday’s low of $1.2182, a low last seen on March 1.\nThe dollar traded at 108.83 yen after having jumped to a 2 1/2-month high of 109.20 yen on Tuesday.\nOil prices slipped back from near 3 1/2-year highs as the talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron eased concerns Washington may reinstate sanctions against Iran, although Trump refrained from committing to staying in a 2015 nuclear deal.\nBrent fetched $74.02 a barrel, up 0.2 percent on the day. On Tuesday it rose to $75.47, its highest since November 2014. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude traded at $67.83, up 0.2 percent so far in Asia.\nWTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened to as much as $6.32, the most since Jan. 2, on rising U.S. production.\nReorting by Hideyuki Sano Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:57:44.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
