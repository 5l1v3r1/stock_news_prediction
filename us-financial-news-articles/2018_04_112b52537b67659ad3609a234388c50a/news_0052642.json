Some of the new smartphones were driving up semiconductors last year. Without the visibility of new phone models coming up, demand may not be as strong as last year,” Tan said.\nOn a month-on-month and seasonally adjusted basis, industrial production rose 0.3 percent in March after contracting a revised 2.6 percent in the month before. The median forecast was for an expansion of 0.5 percent.\nSingapore, along with other trade-reliant economies in Asia, has got a boost from strong global demand in 2017, particularly for electronics products and components such as semiconductors.\nSingapore’s full-year economic growth hit a 3-year high in 2017, thanks to its electronics production. The Monetary Authority of Singapore tightened policy for the first time in six years at its semiannual meeting earlier this month.
