Working Group on Business and Human Rights said it was concerned about “unreasonable and unwarranted restrictions” on affected communities.\nAfter its first visit to Thailand, the working group called on authorities to “end recurring attacks, harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders and community representatives.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
