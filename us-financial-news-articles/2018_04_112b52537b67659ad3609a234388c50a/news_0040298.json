(the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HONE), the holding company for HarborOne Bank (the “Bank”), announced net income of $2.3 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the prior quarter and net income of $2.7 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the same quarter last year.\nSelected highlights for the first quarter of 2018 include:\nNet interest margin increased to 3.26% from 3.07% for the prior quarter and 2.99% for the first quarter of 2017. Announcement of an agreement to acquire Coastway Bancorp, Inc. (“Coastway”) in an all cash transaction valued at approximately $125.6 million. Total commercial loans (including commercial construction) grew by 6% in the first quarter. Total deposits grew by 6% in the first quarter and amounted to $2.13 billion at March 31, 2018.\nAdditionally, effective April 3, 2018, the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary, Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC, became HarborOne Mortgage, LLC (“HarborOne Mortgage”). HarborOne Mortgage consolidates the Bank’s residential mortgage lending division with the legacy Merrimack Mortgage Company, LLC.\nThe increase in net income from the prior quarter primarily reflects a $692,000 increase in net interest income, a $2.1 million decrease in noninterest expense and a $726,000 decrease in income tax provision partially offset by a $2.8 million decrease in noninterest income.\nThe Coastway transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the stockholders of Coastway and required regulatory approvals.\nJames W. Blake, President and CEO stated, “We are excited as we start 2018, looking forward to welcoming the Coastway customers, employees and communities to HarborOne. We anticipate another robust year, despite a challenging residential mortgage market, with a continued focus on organic balance sheet growth and building commercial loan relationships.”\nNet Interest Income\nThe Company’s net interest and dividend income was $20.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $692,000, or 3.6%, from $19.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and up $2.7 million, or 15.4%, from $17.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The tax-equivalent interest rate spread and net interest margin were 3.07% and 3.26%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.90% and 3.07%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2.83% and 2.99%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe increase in net interest income from the previous quarter reflects an $876,000, or 3.7%, increase in total interest and dividend income and an increase of $184,000, or 4.2% in total interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily due to commercial loan growth that provided an increase in average outstanding loans of $57.7 million partially offset by decreases in the average balances of residential real estate and consumer loans. The yield on loans was 4.13% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 3.94% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in average interest-bearing deposits of $14.4 million with a 10 basis point increase in the cost of those funds offset by a decrease in average FHLB advances of $26.7 million and a 7 basis point decrease in total cost of borrowed funds.\nThe increase in net interest income over the prior year quarter is primarily due to growth in the Company’s average loan balances to $2.25 billion from $2.11 billion and an increase in the yield on loans to 4.13% from 3.78%, again primarily driven by commercial loan growth as well as higher rates on variable rate loans. Total interest and dividend income increased $3.5 million, or 16.5%, and total interest expense increased $843,000, or 22.7%, over the prior year quarter as a result of rising interest rates.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income decreased to $11.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down $2.8 million, or 19.8%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in mortgage banking income of $1.8 million as mortgage originations decreased 39.4% from the prior quarter. Changes in the mortgage servicing rights fair value amounted to a $1.0 million increase in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a $74,000 decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, other income decreased $760,000 as the prior quarter income included a $1.2 million reversal of contingent consideration for the HarborOne Mortgage earn out that was settled in full in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income decreased $105,000, or 0.9%, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The change in mortgage servicing rights fair value was an increase of $1.5 million, offset by a $1.6 million decrease in other mortgage banking income during the prior year quarter. Compared to the same quarter prior year, mortgage originations by HarborOne Mortgage decreased 13.9% in 2018 primarily as a result of higher residential mortgage interest rates, low housing inventories and reduced refinancing volume.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses were $27.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.1 million, or 7.1%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 due to decreases in compensation and benefits of $1.3 million, $490,000 in loan expense and $538,000 in other expenses. The decrease in compensation and benefits and loan expenses reflects the decrease in loan production volumes. The decrease in other expenses primarily reflects a fourth quarter expense accrual of $925,000 to freeze the director postretirement benefit plan that was partially offset by additional expenses in the first quarter related to the acquisition of Coastway.\nNoninterest expenses increased $3.2 million, or 13.1%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits of $1.4 million, marketing of $517,000, and other expenses of $962,000. The compensation and benefits and other expense increase reflects expenses related to the management and Board equity plans that were established in August 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes $974,000 in compensation and benefits related to the management’s equity plan expense and $392,000 in other expenses related to the Board’s equity plan. There were no such expenses in the first quarter of 2017. Also contributing to the increase in other expenses was $486,000 in expenses related to the Coastway acquisition.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe effective tax rate was 26.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, 49.2% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 35.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 resulted in significant changes to the U.S. tax code, including a reduction in the top corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in tax rate, the Company revalued its net deferred tax asset and recorded a one-time additional $243,000 tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2017 and reduced the effective tax rate in 2018.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $808,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, $760,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $265,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The provisions in these quarters were primarily due to commercial loan growth. Changes in the provision for loan losses are based on management’s assessment of loan portfolio growth and composition changes, historical charge-off trends, and ongoing evaluation of credit quality and current economic conditions. The allowance for loan losses was $18.9 million, or 0.84%, of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $18.5 million, or 0.84%, of total loans, at December 31, 2017 and $16.9 million, or 0.82%, of total loans at March 31, 2017. Net charge-offs totaled $434,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or 0.08%, of average loans outstanding on an annualized basis, compared to $204,000, or 0.04%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $349,000, or 0.07%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets were $17.2 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $18.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $23.5 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets were 0.63% at March 31, 2018, 0.69% at December 31, 2017 and 0.91% at March 31, 2017. The steady decline reflects the Company’s continued efforts to minimize nonperforming assets through diligent collection efforts, prudent workout arrangements and strong underwriting.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $50.7 million, or 1.9%, to $2.74 billion at March 31, 2018 from $2.68 billion at December 31, 2017. Net loans increased $37.8 million, or 1.7%, to $2.21 billion at March 31, 2018 from $2.18 billion at December 31, 2017. The net increase in loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to increases of $31.7 million in commercial real estate loans, $16.3 million in construction loans and $1.5 million in commercial and industrial loans partially offset by a decrease of $4.6 million in residential real estate loans and $6.2 million in consumer loans. Loans held for sale decreased $25.3 million, or 42.6%, to $34.1 million at March 31, 2018 from $59.5 million at December 31, 2017 due to the decrease in residential mortgage originations.\nTotal deposits increased $113.5 million, or 5.6%, to $2.13 billion at March 31, 2018 from $2.01 billion at December 31, 2017. Compared to the prior quarter, non-certificate accounts increased $27.5 million, term certificate accounts increased $89.3 million and brokered deposits decreased $3.3 million. The increase in certificate accounts was in part due to certificate promotions during the quarter. Borrowings were $226.4 million at March 31, 2018 and $290.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $344.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $343.5 million at December 31, 2017 and $332.7 million at March 31, 2017. The tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 12.17% at March 31, 2018, 12.35% at December 31, 2017 and 12.50% at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank exceed all regulatory capital requirements.\nAbout HarborOne Bancorp, Inc.\nHarborOne Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for HarborOne Bank, the largest co-operative bank in New England.
