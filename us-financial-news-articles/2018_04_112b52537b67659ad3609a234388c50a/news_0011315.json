REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nDetails of the lawsuit were not disclosed and a spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. \nThe LIA has previously brought lawsuits against two other investment banks in London courts, relating to trades carried out during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. \nIn 2016 the fund lost its legal battle against Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) after a seven-week trial relating to nine equity derivatives trades. \nBut in May 2017 Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) agreed to pay the LIA nearly 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to settle a long-running dispute.
