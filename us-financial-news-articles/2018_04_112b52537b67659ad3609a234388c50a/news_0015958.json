NordLB is not a takeover candidate,” he said. “The goal is to strengthen NordLB for the future and ensure its success, because our medium-sized businesses rely on it for financing.” \nOther possible options include bringing in private investors, although that would require changing the bank’s structure, the first source said. \nThe bank, which is due to report its 2017 earnings next week, declined to comment, as did the state’s municipally owned savings banks, the second largest shareholder block in NordLB. $1 = 0.8092 euros Reporting by Klaus Lauer; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T23:43:57.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
