REUTERS/Tyrone Siu \nThe appointment comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Taiwan’s business community to shun any idea of independence for the self-ruled island and promote peace and stable ties with the mainland. \nChen Chu, now the mayor of Taiwan’s southern city of Kaohsiung, takes charge on April 23, as dissatisfaction with some economic policies has pushed Tsai’s approval rating to its second lowest level since she took office in 2016. \n“We very much look forward to the important role of ‘Sister Chu’,” Tsai told a news conference.
