It’s about how you see yourself and who you are,” Schumer told Reuters Television. \n“There was this kind of strange backlash at the trailer and it just made me excited for those people to see the movie and realise that that’s not what we’re doing,” she added.

When she tumbles off an exercise bicycle, she falls unconscious and wakes to see herself as the woman she always wanted to be. \nAlthough her outward appearance has not changed, Renee is suffused with newfound confidence and charisma, lands a great job, finds a boyfriend and even enters a bikini contest. But she later realizes her appearance never changed at all and comes to understand that true self-esteem comes from within. \nSchumer, who chronicled her own issues with self-esteem in her best-selling 2016 memoir “The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo,” said she enjoyed playing the role. \n“Just living that out, playing that role, convincing myself that I was a supermodel - it was so fun. And yeah, I left feeling, I guess, the most confident I ever have,” she said.
