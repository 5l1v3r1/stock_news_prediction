It’s really nice to be standing with the best players in the world and be on the leaderboard,” Niemann told CBS television. \nHe was particularly pleased with his putting. \n“Before this week my game was really good. Just my putter wasn’t good enough. Starting this week, my putter was working really well,” Niemann said. \nNiemann was the world’s top-ranked amateur when he turned pro after missing the cut at the Masters two weeks ago. \nHe played on a sponsor exemption in San Antonio, and has accepted invitations to several other tournaments. \nCourtesy of his top-10 finish, Niemann also qualified for the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina in two weeks.
