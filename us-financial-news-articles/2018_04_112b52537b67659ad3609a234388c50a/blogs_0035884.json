United has close to 700 of the engines, the airline's chief operating officer said.\nFollowing Tuesday's engine explosion on Southwest Flight 1380, from New York to Dallas, Southwest said it would speed up ultrasonic testing of the engines and expected to complete the process within 30 days.\nThe engine had caught the attention of federal regulators before. The Federal Aviation Administration last year proposed more stringent testing of the engines after an uncontained engine failure in the summer of 2016 on a Southwest flight. CFM said it would send about 40 technicians to help Southwest with its inspection program.\nEngines are designed with special casings to prevent shrapnel and other debris from puncturing the fuselage. Such an event is rare but occurred on the 2016 flight, when debris punctured the Southwest plane, leaving a 16-inch-long hole, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T19:56:54.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
