ATRI's RAC developed the list of recommended research topics at its meeting held in Dallas in March and the ATRI Board vetted and approved that list at its meeting last week.\nThe research topics cover a wide array of critical industry issues including the impact that urban planning and \"smart city\" design have on truck operations, inconsistencies in CDL testing, and continuing research on the impact of autonomous technologies on the trucking industry.\nThe 2018 ATRI top research priorities are:\nUrban Planning and Smart City Design for Trucks – examining how and where truck freight delivery can be effectively incorporated into urban planning and smart city design approaches.\nAssessing the Consistency and Accuracy of CMV Crash Data – will identify ways to improve commercial motor vehicle crash data collection, quality review, data management and data submission at the local and state levels.\nRole and Impact of Government Regulations on Autonomous Vehicles – research will assess the positive and negative impact of regulations being promulgated at the state-level for identification of model legislation on how autonomous technologies and vehicles should be deployed.\nInconsistencies in CDL Testing – will review the range of requirements for CDL testing across states and identify best practices to develop an effective set of testing requirements.\nAutonomous Impacts on the Truck Driver – a detailed analysis of how autonomous truck technologies will change the operational environment and driving requirements for commercial drivers.\nBest Practices for Cannabis Intoxication Testing – exploring best practices in the U.S. and abroad, the research will benchmark recommended maximum intoxication levels and identify recommendations for driver sobriety testing.\nATRI is the trucking industry's 501(c)(3) not-for-profit research organization. It is engaged in critical research relating to freight transportation's essential role in maintaining a safe, secure and efficient transportation system.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atri-board-approves-2018-top-research-priorities-300623878.html\nSOURCE American Transportation Research Institute", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atri-board-approves-2018-top-research-priorities-300623878.html"], "published": "2018-04-04T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T03:33:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
