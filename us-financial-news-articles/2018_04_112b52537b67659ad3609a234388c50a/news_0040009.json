Li Xin, chief supervisor of China Orient Asset Management Co Ltd, would be named president of Huarong.\nHuarong hit the headlines this year after building up a 36 percent stake in a key unit of embattled private energy company CEFC China Energy which is acquiring a $9.1 billion stake in Russia’s oil major Rosneft.\nThe investigation into Lai makes him the latest in a long line of top Chinese executives coming under fire as China looks to rein in risks in the financial sector, targeting riskier lending practices and high levels of corporate debt.\nHuarong Investment Stock Corp Ltd and Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd - which also earlier suspended trading of their shares - will restart trading on Friday, the two Huarong units said in separate statements.
