The central bank last raised the two-week repo rate in February.\nMora indicated that the CNB was keeping one eye on ECB rates as it considered how much to raise its own rates.\n“Widening the differential could lead to an excessive crown strengthening, which would block us from further raising rates,” he said.\nMora also told the paper that the central bank was considering making two new recommendations to banks on mortgages - on limits for the debt-to-income ratio and debt-servicing-to-income - while it waits for a bill putting the limits into law to make its way through parliament in the next few months.\nA mortgage should not exceed eight times the annual salary of the applicant, while debt payments should remain below 40 percent of a disposable monthly income, Mora said.
