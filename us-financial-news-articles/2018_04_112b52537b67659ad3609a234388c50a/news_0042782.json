The bank said it has adjusted its preliminary results to account for an additional accrual of $800 million. \nThe bank said it would be required to submit, for review by its board, plans detailing efforts to strengthen compliance and risk management, and its approach to customer remediation. \nThe fine was split between two regulators of the lending industry. U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) imposed $500 million of the overall $1 billion fine. \nThe regulators said Wells Fargo agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. \nThe OCC’s penalty reflects a number of factors, including the bank’s failure to develop and implement an effective enterprise risk management program to detect and prevent the unsafe or unsound practices, and the scope and duration of the practices, it said in a statement. \n“While we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them,” Wells Fargo president and chief executive Timothy J. Sloan said in a statement. \nThe second regulator in the action, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said Wells Fargo broke the law in layering insurance on drivers and excessive fees on homeowners locking in home loan interest rates. \nThe CFBP said the bank will also have to refund customers. \nReuters had reported on Thursday that the bank was close to settling the record fine. \nLast Friday, Wells Fargo warned when reporting its preliminary quarterly results that it may restate results to reflect the final settlement.
