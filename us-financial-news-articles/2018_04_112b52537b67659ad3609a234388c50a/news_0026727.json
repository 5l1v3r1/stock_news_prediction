U.S. President Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida U.S. April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nRelations between Moscow and Washington are in focus after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Russia in early April, triggering a massive sell-off on Russian markets and raising global geopolitical tensions to a new level. \n“I can confirm that the United States has informed the Russian embassy that there will be no new sanctions for now,” TASS cited a source in the Russian foreign ministry as saying. \nInterfax, TASS and RIA agencies published similar reports at the same time, citing one source at the Russian foreign ministry. \nInterfax said the Russian embassy in Washington received a letter from the Trump administration, while RIA said it was a notification. \nThe reports moved the market, helping the rouble pair losses, and echoed previous statements by a senior U.S. administration official on Monday that Trump had delayed imposing fresh penalties.
