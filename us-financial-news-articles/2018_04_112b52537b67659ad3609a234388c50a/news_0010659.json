They died three days after Washington state authorities opened an investigation into allegations the children were being abused or neglected. \nOne of the missing children is 15-year-old Devonte Hart, who drew international attention after he was photographed hugging a white police officer at a rally months after the shooting of an unarmed young black man in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. \nThe California Highway Patrol is conducting the land search for the missing children and is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to enhance grainy video footage from a Fort Bragg, California business that may show Jennifer Hart a day before the crash. \nInvestigators say the SUV stopped at a scenic Pacific Ocean viewpoint at the edge of Highway 1, about 180 miles (290 km) north of San Francisco, then accelerated over the edge, leaving no skid marks or indications of a collision. \nPolice are trying to retrace the route the family took from their home in Woodland, Washington, around 500 miles (805 km) from the crash site.
