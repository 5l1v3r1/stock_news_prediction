It is not about regime change,” May said in a statement minutes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced the strikes. \nMay later told reporters that the Western missiles had struck a chemical weapons storage and production facility, a chemical weapons research centre and a military bunker involved in chemical weapons attacks. \nBy launching strikes without prior approval from parliament, May dispensed with a non-binding constitutional convention dating back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. She said speed was essential and that military action was in the national interest. “RIGHT AND LEGAL” \n“It was both right and legal to take military action,” May said, adding that she would update parliament on Monday. Related Coverage Western missile attack on Syria was 'right and legal', May says \nMay made clear the strike was a specific response to the Douma attack, which killed up to 75 people, including children. \nShe dismissed as “grotesque and absurd” a claim by Russia, which joined the war in 2015 to back Assad, that Britain had staged the Douma attack. \nHer office issued a statement detailing what it said was the legal justification for military action, saying Assad had used chemical weapons since 2013 and the blocking of United Nations action by Russia and other allies of Syria left no alternative to “truly exceptional” use of force. \n“Such an intervention was directed exclusively to averting a humanitarian catastrophe caused by the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons, and the action was the minimum judged necessary for that purpose,” Downing Street said. \nMay referred to last month’s nerve agent attack on former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury, which Britain has blamed on Russia. Moscow has denied any involvement. \n“We cannot allow the use of chemical weapons to become normalised – either within Syria, on the streets of the UK or elsewhere,” May told reporters in Downing Street. \nShe said almost a century of global aversion to the use of chemical weapons had been eroded in Douma and Salisbury.
