Tess will find a pool of planets like that.”\nTESS’s mission is to monitor and catalogue over 200,000 stars in space for signs of other existing planets. The spacecraft will scan our solar neighborhood looking for stars that exhibit “temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits,” which is a sign that a previously undiscovered planet may be crossing in front of a star, NASA’s website explains.\nWe're set to launch our new planet-hunting spacecraft, @NASA_TESS .

The launch is scheduled for Monday, April 16 at 6:32 p.m. ET at Space Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\nTESS’s predecessor, the Keppler Space Telescope , is a planet-hunting space telescope that was launched by NASA in 2009. The Keppler Telescope did the legwork for TESS by surveying the Milky Way Galaxy to determine how many Earthlike planets may be near us, according to NASA’s website.\nNow it’s TESS’s turn to take Keppler’s discoveries one step further and narrow down the possible contenders for the next Planet Earth.\nBut if NASA’s newest satellite doesn’t find the next habitable planet, don’t worry — you can always make a reservation at Aurora Station, the world’s first luxury space hotel .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NASA/status/985575606426525696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-tess-telescope-launches-on-spacex-rocket-monday/", "https://t.co/zd4I6rqiam", "https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov/", "https://twitter.com/NASA_TESS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/overview/index.html", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://t.co/mpkAzeKJTJ"], "published": "2018-04-16T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T23:43:17.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
