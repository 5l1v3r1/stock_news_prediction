Drivers of the food delivery service Ele.me begin their morning shift after an internal security check in Beijing, China, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nAlibaba and affiliate Ant Small & Micro Financial Services Group Co Ltd currently own approximately 43 percent of Ele.me, and the latest deal will value the startup a $9.5 billion (6.75 billion pounds), said Alibaba in a statement. Slideshow (4 Images) \nEle.me, which roughly translates as “Hungry?”, is part of a fast-growing and competitive e-commerce market in China driven by consumers eager to use smartphones to make purchases from groceries to cinema tickets. \nIn August Ele.me bought major rival Baidu deliveries from Baidu Inc ( BIDU.O ). For Alibaba, the latest acquisition enlarges the e-commerce firm’s food delivery empire, which also includes delivery platform Koubei, as it competes with Meituan Dianping, backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ). \nAlibaba and Meituan are both investing heavily in offline services, including deliveries, mobile payments and unstaffed stores, to tap a wider demographic as China’s online commerce market shows signs of slowing. \nEle.me will continue to operate under its own brand following the acquisition, said Alibaba, but will combine some functionalities with Koubei. \nAs part of the deal Alibaba will install Alibaba Vice President Wang Lei as chief executive at Ele.me, while the current chief executive and founder of Ele.me will become chairman and serve as a special advisor to Alibaba on new retail strategies.
