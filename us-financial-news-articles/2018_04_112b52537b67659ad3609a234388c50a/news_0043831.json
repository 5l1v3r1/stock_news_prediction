If this change proves to be persistent, the key rate level envisaged by neutral monetary policy will be higher,” the central bank’s analysts said in a monthly report on economic trends.\nThe central bank, which will hold its next board meeting on rates on April 27, has previously said it plans to lower its key rate to a “neutral” range of between 6-7 percent this year, down from a current level of 7.25 percent.\nThe analysts said inflationary risks had increased in April, in part because of geopolitical tensions, but also due to a sharp weakening of the rouble, higher wage growth and uncertainty about future tax policies in Russia.\nInflation is likely to be the first economic indicator to feel the impact of the sell-off in Russian markets, triggered by the latest wave of sanctions that could also cap an economic recovery this year.\nRussian real wages increased 6.5 percent year-on-year in March and the rouble has lost more than 5 percent against the dollar since the new sanctions were imposed.\nA weakening of the rouble by between 5-10 percent could add up to 1 percentage point to inflation in the next 6-12 months, the central bank analysts said.\nBut they said inflation was only seen rising towards the central bank’s target of 4 percent in the second half of the year. Russian annual inflation totalled 2.4 percent in March.\nReporting by Jack Stubbs, Polina Nikolskaya and Elena Fabrichnaya; Editing by Andrey Ostroukh and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:15:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
