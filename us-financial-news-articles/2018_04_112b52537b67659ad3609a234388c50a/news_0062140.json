WYNN 0.46% , filed a defamation lawsuit this week against a former Wynn Resorts employee, alleging that he smeared Mr. Wynn by spreading false accusations of alleged sexual misconduct in media reports.\nJorgen Nielsen, a former artistic director of the Wynn Las Vegas salon, was Quote: d by name in two articles about Mr. Wynn and the casino company in The Wall Street Journal earlier this year. The articles detailed allegations from people who have worked at Wynn Resorts that would amount to a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn, and managers’ practice of ignoring or dismissing their complaints.\nMr. Wynn resigned in February as chairman and CEO of Wynn Resorts after the Journal published the first article, in January. He said at the time of his resignation that he couldn’t be effective in an environment in which “a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts.” In a statement for the first Journal article, which reported Mr. Wynn had paid $7.5 million in 2005 to a manicurist who told others he forced her to have sex, Mr. Wynn said the idea that he ever assaulted a woman was “preposterous.”\nThe lawsuit alleges the Journal’s reporting set off an “open season” on Mr. Wynn, “where truth and context were ignored, and his guilt was presumed based only on unproven accusations.”\nMr. Nielsen said he was unaware of the lawsuit and declined to comment further.\nMr. Wynn’s lawsuit cites the two Journal articles, as well as an ABC News piece that also Quote: d Mr. Nielsen.\nA spokeswoman for Dow Jones, publisher of the Journal, said: “We stand by our reporting.” A spokeswoman for ABC News declined to comment.\nIn the lawsuit, filed in state court in Nevada, Mr. Wynn said the articles included “false and defamatory” statements by Mr. Nielsen, who told the Journal he and others made efforts to report Mr. Wynn’s alleged misconduct to high-level company executives. “Nobody was there to help us,” Mr. Nielsen told the Journal.\nMr. Wynn alleges that Mr. Nielsen’s statements were motivated by an effort to create “workplace issues” for Mr. Wynn as he was “embroiled in a highly contentious and public litigation with his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn. ” The lawsuit describes Mr. Nielsen as Ms. Wynn’s longtime personal hairstylist.\nAccording to the lawsuit, Mr. Wynn sent Mr. Nielsen a letter in March, “to afford him an opportunity to mitigate the harm he had caused by retracting his false statements.” Mr. Nielsen hasn’t retracted his statements, according to the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit says Mr. Wynn seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\nWrite to Rebecca Davis O’Brien at Rebecca.OBrien@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T03:11:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
