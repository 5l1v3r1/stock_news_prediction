Product licenses and subscription services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $25.0 million versus $30.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, a 17.9% decrease. Product support revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $74.4 million versus $70.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, a 5.5% increase. Other services revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $23.6 million versus $21.3 million for the first quarter of 2017, a 10.7% increase.

MicroStrategy did not capitalize any software development costs during the first quarter of 2018 or 2017.\nIncome from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.7 million versus $20.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.7 million, or $0.15 per share on a diluted basis, as compared to net income of $15.6 million, or $1.34 per share on a diluted basis, for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, which excludes share-based compensation expense, was $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 versus $24.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The tables at the end of this press release include a reconciliation of income from operations to non-GAAP income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. An explanation of this non-GAAP measure is also included under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measure” below.\nAs of March 31, 2018, MicroStrategy had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $695.5 million, as compared to $675.2 million as of December 31, 2017, an increase of $20.3 million. As of March 31, 2018, MicroStrategy had 9.4 million shares of class A common stock and 2.0 million shares of class B common stock outstanding.\nMicroStrategy also announced that the term of its 2005 share repurchase program (“2005 Repurchase Program”), which had been scheduled to expire on April 29, 2018, has been extended until April 29, 2023. As of March 31, 2018, MicroStrategy had repurchased an aggregate of 3,826,947 shares of its class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $345.3 million under the 2005 Repurchase Program, and $454.7 million of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock remained available for repurchase pursuant to such program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by MicroStrategy’s management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The 2005 Repurchase Program may be funded by using MicroStrategy’s working capital, as well as proceeds from any credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements into which MicroStrategy may enter in the future.\nMicroStrategy uses its own software across the Company and has created an interactive dossier with quarterly financial performance data. Dossiers organize content into chapters and pages via an eBook-like modern interface. The “MSTR Financials” dossier is comprised of two chapters: “Q1 2018 Financials”, which includes the current quarter’s consolidated financial statements, and “Historical Financials”, which includes consolidated financial statements dating back to 2015.

This financial measure is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and, as a result, this financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure internally to help understand, manage and evaluate business performance and to help make operating decisions. MicroStrategy believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis because it excludes a significant non-cash expense that MicroStrategy believes is not reflective of its general business performance. In addition, accounting for share-based compensation arrangements requires significant management judgment and the resulting expense could vary significantly in comparison to other companies. Therefore, MicroStrategy believes the use of this non-GAAP financial measure can also facilitate comparison of MicroStrategy’s operating results to those of its competitors.\nAbout MicroStrategy Incorporated\nMicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) is a worldwide leader in enterprise analytics and mobility software.
