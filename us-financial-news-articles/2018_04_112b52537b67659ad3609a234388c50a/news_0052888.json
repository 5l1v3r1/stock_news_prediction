Hegge will become U.S. country manager.\nJohn Knight, Statoil’s head of global strategy and business development, who is based in London, will be replaced by Al Cook, an executive in the international development and production division, who was once chief of staff to BP CEO Bob Dudley.\nTim Dodson remains Statoil’s head of exploration.\n“The changes in top management and our business area structure will strengthen our ability to deliver ... as we develop as a broad energy company”, chief executive Eldar Saetre said in a statement.\nIn March, Statoil said it was changing its name to Equinor to reflect its move to become a broad energy company.
