Analysts had expected sales growth of around 24 percent.\nKering’s sales figures no longer include sportwear firm Puma , which it is set to spin off to its shareholders by mid-May, or Stella McCartney and skate clothing firm Volcom, at varying stages of parting ways with the group.\nThe group’s star label, Gucci, has continued to stump expectations of a slowdown against a tough comparison base. The brand’s like-for-like revenues expanded 49 percent year on year in the quarter, speeding up from the previous three months.\n“Throughout the year there should be a progressive normalisation,” Chief Finance Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix told journalists, adding that the pace of sales growth at Gucci would nevertheless remain very high.
