In the image, there are two products. One is a dongle device that was eventually released and was a 4K ultra high-definition version of Fire TV.\nThe second is a cube-shaped device that has not been unveiled yet. This could be Fire TV Cube.\nFrom the image, it looks like Fire TV Cube might have Amazon's Alexa voice assistant built in. Current versions of Fire TV require Alexa to be activated by people speaking to a remote control.\nFire TV is a product that allows viewers to access on-demand services including Netflix and Amazon's own Prime Video service.\nIn more evidence that the product could be coming to market, Endgaget posted an image of an Amazon manual sent to them by a reader. It was delivered with the reader's ethernet adapter to show how to connect that device to a Fire TV Cube.\nAmazon has been pushing further into hardware in recent years and has been boosting the capabilities and availability of Alexa.
