It has hit royal critics with record jail terms, prompting concern from the United Nations, which has repeatedly urged amendment of a law critics say is sometimes used as a political tool to silence enemies.\nAt least 94 people have been prosecuted for lese-majeste since the coup. As many as 43 people have been sentenced, according to data from the iLaw group, which monitors royal insult cases.\nThe laws protecting members of the royal family from insult limit what all news organizations, including Reuters, can report from Thailand.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T11:08:37.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
