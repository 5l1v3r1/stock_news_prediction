I’ll just try to nail it in the next few days.”\nSpieth acknowledged he would probably would need further improvement to have a chance of a second green jacket, but was optimistic.\n“I’ve made some big strides from my last couple of tournaments so I’m very excited for what next week holds,” he said.\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Nick Mulvenney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T04:42:34.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
