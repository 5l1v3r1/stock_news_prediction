(“Superior”) announced today that Superior Plus Energy Services (“SPES”), a subsidiary of Superior Plus LP, has entered into a definitive agreement with Sunoco LP to sell the wholesale refined fuels business and refined fuel terminal assets located in New York for total cash consideration of US$39.8 million (approximately Cdn. $51.4 million), plus net working capital at closing (the “Transaction”). The Transaction is subject to customary purchase price adjustments, closing conditions and is expected to close in April 2018. Superior also closed on the sale of certain retail distillate assets in Pennsylvania today to another third-party for total cash consideration of approximately US$16.0 million (approximately Cdn $20.7 million).\n“The sale of these wholesale and retail distillate assets is consistent with our goal to streamline our product offerings, reduce our heating oil and distillate business exposure and grow our U.S. business by investing in retail propane distribution assets,” stated Luc Desjardins, Superior’s President and CEO. “The proceeds from the sale of these assets allows us to repay debt which can be redrawn to fund acquisitions of retail propane assets consistent with our corporate strategy while maintaining our earnings guidance for 2018.”\nThe assets to be sold to Sunoco LP are part of SPES’ wholesale refined fuels operations across five states in the northeast U.S. and includes three pipeline connected terminals located in New York.\nSuperior confirms that, assuming completion of these divestitures, its guidance for 2018 of Adjusted Operating Cash Flow per share of $1.65 to $1.95 and Adjusted EBITDA of $295 million to $335 million remains unchanged.\nAbout Superior Plus Corp.\nSuperior consists of two primary operating businesses: Energy Distribution includes the distribution of propane and distillates, and supply portfolio management; and Specialty Chemicals includes the manufacture and sale of specialty chemicals.\nFor further information about Superior, please visit our website at: www.superiorplus.com or contact: Beth Summers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Tel: (416) 340-6015, or Rob Dorran, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer, Tel: (416) 340-6003, E-mail: investor-relations@superiorplus.com , Toll Free: 1-866-490-PLUS (7587).\nForward Looking Information\nCertain information included herein is forward-looking, within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.

Readers are cautioned that it is not a defined performance measure under IFRS and cannot be assured. Superior’s calculation of AOCF may differ from similar calculations used by comparable entities. AOCF represents cash flow generated by Superior that is available for, but not necessarily limited to, changes in working capital requirements, investing activities and financing activities of Superior.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before taxes, depreciation, amortization, finance expense and certain other non-cash expenses, and is used by Superior to assess its consolidated results and those of its operating segments.
