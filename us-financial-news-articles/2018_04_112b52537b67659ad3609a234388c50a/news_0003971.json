Banners and bangers. Pints and pyros”, read the message which urged supporters to show City “exactly what money can’t buy”. \nA similar “coach greeting” was created by Liverpool fans before the all-English semi-final with Chelsea in the Champions League in 2005, won by the Merseyside club. \nAsked what he felt about the prospect of such a welcome, City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne said: “I expect nothing less. I like to play at big stadiums and big crowds - it’s what it’s all about.

There is a lot of passion in football and if you see the passion in the crowd you have to try to manage it,” added the Belgian. \nCity manager Pep Guardiola said he hoped the Liverpool fans would keep their welcome within limits.

The fans cannot be too much in front of you. Here the streets are narrow. We will see. Hopefully it’s going to go well and Liverpool fans can show their history speaks for itself.” \nJuergen Klopp, Liverpool’s German manager, said he was happy with the planned show of strength from fans. \n“It’s wonderful, it’s great, it shows everything, it shows the passion. As long as it happens in a legal way, I’m completely fine with it,” Klopp said.
