REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The multi-billion dollar memory industry has flourished due to demand from smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips to store a massive amount of data.\nWestern Digital and Seagate Technology PLC control most of the world’s hard disk drive market. Western Digital said average selling prices in the third quarter rose 14.3 percent to $72 from a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $63, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.\nThe company’s shares rose about 3 percent following the release of its earnings, but slipped after Chief Executive Officer Stephen Milligan warned that the company’s margins are “normalizing” due to an expected drop in NAND prices.\nThe company forecast current quarter adjusted profit in the range of $3.40 and $3.50 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $3.29, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe data-storage device maker’s net income fell to $61 million, or 20 cents per share for the third quarter ended March 30, after booking a $1.04 billion charge for interest and other expenses. Last year, it earned $248 million, or 83 cents per share.\nNet revenue rose to $5.01 billion from $4.65 billion.\nExcluding one-time items, the company reported a profit of $3.63 per share.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $3.30 per share and revenue of $4.93 billion.\nReporting by Sonam Rai and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T23:42:24.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
