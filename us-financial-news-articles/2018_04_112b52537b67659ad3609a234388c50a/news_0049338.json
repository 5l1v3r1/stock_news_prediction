Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Atletico Madrid v Real Betis - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - April 22, 2018 Real Betis' Dani Gimenez saves a shot from Atletico Madrid's Fernando Torres REUTERS/Juan Medina \nDiego Simeone’s Atletico moved 11 points behind Barcelona with four games remaining and the unbeaten leaders need one more point to win the title. \nWith the Europa League semi-final first leg at Arsenal on Thursday in mind, Simeone rotated key players and Betis tried to take advantage. \nJavi Garcia missed two excellent chances and Cristian Tello struck the post for the visitors, who extended their club record run of games without conceding a goal to six. \nHowever, Atletico’s defensive resilience ended Betis’ run of six wins in a row as they recorded their 11th consecutive home clean sheet.

The result left Girona ninth and Espanyol 16th in the standings, 11 points clear of the relegation zone.
