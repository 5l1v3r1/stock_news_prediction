But to Cramer, who saw very little overlap in the two businesses, this seemed like \"pure tit-for-tat.\"\nQualcomm makes cellphone technology, while NXP develops chips for cars in the vein of autonomous driving, connected vehicles and collision avoidance, he said.\n\"It's totally arbitrary. It's totally capricious. That's the point, which is why this had such a devastating impact on a key leadership group: the semiconductor stocks,\" Cramer said.\nAlready under pressure from a slowdown in cellphone manufacturing , the semiconductor sector was hit with another leg down from the Qualcomm-NXP snag.\nThe pain spread to potential acquirers like Broadcom , Intel and Texas Instruments , potential takeover targets like Analog Devices , Integrated Device Technologies and Skyworks Solutions , and in-betweeners like Nvidia and Micron .\nOn the second day of the selling spree, sellers even targeted semiconductor equipment makers like KLA-Tencor , Applied Materials , ASML Holding and Lam Research .\n\"The semis are a leadership group, no doubt about it, so the tone was just plain jarring,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"The problem is, in a trade war with China, there simply aren't enough publicly-traded winners,\" he continued. \"It's mostly steelmakers like Nucor , which gave a pretty great forecast ... or aluminum play[s] like Alcoa , because the whole point is to protect these industries from unfair Chinese competition. But there are a lot of publicly traded losers.\"\nWATCH: Cramer addresses inflation concerns, marketwide pain show chapters Cramer: A trade war with China produces a lot of losers and not enough winners      21 Hours Ago | 11:11 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Broadcom, Nvidia and Nucor. \nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
