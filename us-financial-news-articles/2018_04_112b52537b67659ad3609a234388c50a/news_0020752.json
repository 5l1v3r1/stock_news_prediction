When annualized, this distribution represents an approximate 7.5% yield based on the closing price for Viper's common units on April 9, 2018.\n\"During the first quarter, Viper achieved strong quarter over quarter production growth due to increased activity levels across our asset base and accretive acquisitions closed in the quarter, leading to a record distribution. As recently announced, Viper’s proposed tax status election to a taxable entity will expand our investor base and allow us to continue to consolidate the highly fragmented minerals market. Viper offers investors a unique value proposition as the only exclusively onshore focused high growth E&P income vehicle, with a 7.5% current yield that will continue to grow with Diamondback and Permian Basin production,\" stated Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer of Viper’s general partner.\nThis release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).
