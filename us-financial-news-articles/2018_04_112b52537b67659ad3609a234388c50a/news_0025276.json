Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during a news conference about the state of the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie \nTrudeau cited investor confidence as one reason to help Kinder Morgan Canada, part of Kinder Morgan Inc ( KMI.N ), which plans to almost triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to the Pacific province of British Columbia. \nThe company, unhappy about moves by the British Columbia government to impede the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project on environmental grounds, is threatening to walk away unless it receives sufficient clarity about the path ahead by May 31. \n“I have instructed the minister of finance to initiate formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan, the result of which will be to remove the uncertainty overhanging the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project,” Trudeau told reporters, calling the line “a vital strategic interest to Canada.” \nTrudeau, speaking after an emergency summit with the premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, said “we are actively pursuing legislative options that will assert and reinforce the government of Canada’s jurisdiction in this matter.” \nHe declined to give details on exactly what the ruling Liberals had in mind to end an impasse that is prompting investor unease and could threaten his political future. \nBoth the federal and Alberta governments have already suggested they could take a stake in the project.

Federal officials complain this is a time-wasting tactic. \n($1=1.2598 Canadian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T16:44:01.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
