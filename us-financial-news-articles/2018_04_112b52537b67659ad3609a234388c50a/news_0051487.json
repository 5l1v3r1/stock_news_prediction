Lynch 3 Min Read\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday defended his decision not to appoint a second special prosecutor to investigate Republicans’ concerns about the FBI by noting that Special Russia probe had already taken on “a life of its own.” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions waits to testify before a Senate Appropriations Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee hearing on the proposed budget estimates for the Justice Department, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\nSpeaking to a U.S. House appropriations panel during a routine budget hearing, Sessions told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed to “be disciplined and stay within our classical procedure and rules” before rushing to hire more special counsels.\n“I do not think we need to willy-nilly appoint special counsels,” he said, after listening to a laundry list of frustrations aired by West Virginia Republican Congressman Evan Jenkins.\n“As we can see, it can really take on a life of its own.”\nSessions has often found himself in the crosshairs of wrath because of his decision to recuse himself from overseeing the probe into whether Trump’s colluded with Russia.\nTrump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia, has called the probe a “witch hunt,” lamented tapping Sessions as attorney general, and mused about whether to fire Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the probe due to Sessions’ recusal.\nTrump’s ire was further provoked more recently after the FBI raided the office and home of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\nIn an interview on “Fox and Friends” early Thursday, Trump hinted he might get more aggressive in trying to shake up leadership at the Justice Department, saying: “I’ve taken the position - and I don’t have to take this position and maybe I’ll change - that I will not be involved with the Justice Department.”\nRepublicans frustrated by the Mueller probe have since launched investigations into other matters such as the FBI’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation and whether the Justice Department committed abuses when it applied to a special court for a warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, a former Trump national security campaign adviser.\nIn response to those concerns, Sessions asked U.S. Attorney John Huber of the District of Utah to independently review the issues, rather than hiring a special prosecutor.\nOn Thursday, Sessions staunchly defended the FBI, calling its director, Christopher Wray a “man of integrity,” and warned lawmakers not to “smear everybody” at the department.\nAt the same time, he said, he understands why some Americans - and Trump - may be frustrated.\n“I think the American people are concerned and the president is concerned,” Sessions said.\n“He is dealing with France and North Korea and Syria and taxes and regulations and border and crime every day.”\n“This thing, he continued, “needs to conclude.”\n(The story was refiled to fix a typographical error in the headline to make it “says” instead of “say”) Reporting by Sarah N.
