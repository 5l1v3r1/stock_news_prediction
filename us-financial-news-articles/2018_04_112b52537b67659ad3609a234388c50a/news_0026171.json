They are then put in handcuffs and marched out.\nOther customers, including a middle-aged white man, try to intervene. The white man tells police the pair have done nothing wrong, that they are allowed to be there, and that the officers are only trying to remove them because they are black, which an officer denies.\n“Does anyone else in this place think this is ridiculous?” the white man asks. Other customers can be heard agreeing with him.\nThe Philadelphia Police Department said on Friday evening that an internal investigation was underway and it would not comment until that was complete.\nIn a post on Twitter on Saturday, Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said it was sorry for what took place.\n“We apologize to the two individuals and our customers and are disappointed this led to an arrest. We take these matters seriously and clearly have more work to do when it comes to how we can handle incidents in our stores,” Starbucks said.\n“We are reviewing our policies and will continue to engage with the community and the police department to try to ensure these types of situations never happen in any of our stores.”\nMelissa DePino, an author who posted video of the arrest, said she was told later on Thursday that the two men, both real estate brokers, were released without charge.\nShe said staff at the Starbucks called police because the two men had not ordered anything while waiting for a friend to arrive. She said white customers were “wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.”\nThe identity of the two arrested men was not immediately clear and they could not be reached for comment.\nPolice departments across the United States have come under criticism for repeated instances of killing unarmed black men in recent years, which activists blame on racial biases in the criminal justice system.\nReporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Daniel Wallis and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T21:21:54.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
