But it rebounded after minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting showed policymakers felt that the U.S. economy would firm further and that inflation would rise in the coming months.\nThe index was down 0.04 percent at 89.547.\n\"These minutes have a hawkish lean,\" said Collin Martin, director for fixed income at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, in New York.\n\"To us, the Fed will continue to raise rates at a gradual pace here. We will see two or three more rate hikes this year,\" he said.\nEarlier on Wednesday, data showed U.S. core Consumer Price Index rose 2.1 percent in March, the largest advance since February 2017, after increasing 1.8 percent in February.\n\"The inflation numbers today and yesterday were actually pretty supportive of the dollar,\" said Silicon Valley Bank's Trang.\nThe growing tensions between the United States and Russia over new punitive sanctions and the conflict in Syria sent the ruble to its lowest levels since 2016, before the Russian currency recovered some ground. The greenback was down 0.68 percent against the ruble.\nThe Hong Kong dollar fell to a 33-year low on Wednesday, inching closer to the lower end of the monetary authority's targeted trading band as the interest rate gap between U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar widened further.\n(Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York; Editing by Dan Grebler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T22:47:30.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
