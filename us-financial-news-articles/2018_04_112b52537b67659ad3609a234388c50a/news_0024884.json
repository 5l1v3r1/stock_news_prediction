Bidders are hoping to strike a deal to it at a valuation of 3.9-4.2 billion including debt or 11-12 times earnings. \nTechem is expecting to report 2018 adjusted EBITDA of 350 million euros on sales of 796 million, the sources said. \nMacquarie and the bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. \nCVC is the former owner of Techem rival Ista, which the buyout group sold to Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure last year. \nTechem conducted a 1.75 billion euro leveraged loan refinancing in July 2017 that comprised a 1.6 billion euro term loan and a 150 million revolving credit facility. It had net leverage of 4.7 times EBITDA and gross leverage of 5 times core earnings (EBITDA). \nIn an unusual move it was offered with portability to enable the financing to stay in place in the event of a sale. The portable financing also provided for an extra 1 billion euros of debt to be raised on top of the term loan in the event of a sale, without requiring lender approval. \nThat would push leverage as high as 5.5 times through the senior and 7.5 times in total. \nThe additional financing could include senior loans and subordinated debt. \nEven if Techem’s leverage rises as high as 7.5 times, some bankers are working on new and even more ambitious debt packages for the company, which would replace the portable financing. \nBankers are working on debt financing for Techem in excess of 8.0 times EBITDA, which would take total debt to around 3 billion euros.
