Amazon Web Services (AWS) contributed meaningfully to the revenue ‎growth, having generated $5.4 billion in the three months to March 2018, ‎up 49 percent relative to the same quarter a year ago. ‎\nAnalysts at Saga Nagoya Securities added in a note to clients: ‎‎\"Despite price cuts, Amazon delivered a strong set of results on all fronts, but a staggering array of investments could weigh on profits in the second half of 2018.\"‎\n‎The fast-growing division's revenue has soared in recent years as ‎more businesses are moving their computing ‎operations to the cloud. This trend helped offset declines in operating profit at certain segments in the last few months.\nThe cloud-computing service, which is now a multi-billion-dollar ‎business, accounts for a majority of Amazon's operating profit.\nAmazon's management mentioned that it will hike the price of its annual ‎Prime membership to $119 from $99. The company lowered subscription ‎fess last year in order to cannibalize more expensive competition. ‎\nAmazon's stock price surged from $1208 at the beginning of the year to ‎around $1599 by March 2018. Since then it has fluctuated between ‎‎$1,400 and $1,500.‎\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-revenues-jump-43-in-q1-says-saga-nagoya-securities-300638129.html\nSOURCE Saga Nagoya Securities", "external_links": ["https://snscredit.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-revenues-jump-43-in-q1-says-saga-nagoya-securities-300638129.html"], "published": "2018-04-27T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:12:33.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
