Ganfeng is also a second-phase offtaker.\nPilbara Minerals is jointly investing in a downstream chemical facility in South Korea with Posco to tap the local battery market, with commissioning expected in late 2019, Brinsden said.\n“From our point of view we’re opening up a new supply chain to take the concentrate into South Korea, as opposed to just China,” where similar joint ventures are planned, he added.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:32:30.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
