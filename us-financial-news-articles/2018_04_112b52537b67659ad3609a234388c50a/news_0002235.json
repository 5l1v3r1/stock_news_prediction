In a wide-ranging conversation, Cook also lambasted Facebook's management of customer data. \"We could make a ton of money if we monetized our customers. If our customers were our product,\" Cook said. \"We've elected not to do that.\"\nApple, of course, makes money from selling products (iPhones, Macs, accessories, etc.) and services (iCloud). Facebook, on the other hand, is free, so it relies heavily on digital advertising — though the company's knowledge of its users' preferences makes Facebook a lucrative place to advertise.\nCook pushed for increased regulation of Facebook and other sites that build profiles based off personal data, too. \"I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation,\" the Apple CEO said. \"However, I think we're beyond that here.\"\nCook's comments stood out because they came amid renewed criticism of Facebook following revelations that consulting firm Cambridge Analytica harvested personal data from 50 million Facebook users.\nBut Zuckerberg's business model is still coming under fire\nZuckerberg may be right — that Facebook's advertising-supported model allows anyone to access the tool. But the company's challenge right now is convincing users that it's using customers' data responsibly. The Cambridge Analytica mess has increased the clamor for Facebook to be more transparent about what kind of user data they're gathering, and how they're using it. Facebook has apologized for it, and the company took out a full page op-ed last weekend that called the debacle \"a breach of trust.\"\n\"I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time,\" Zuckerberg wrote. \"I promise to do better for you.\"\nThe Cambridge Analytica fallout and the company's failure to crack down on misinformation and Russian propaganda accounts in America's 2016 election have also intensified calls for tighter regulation of Facebook and other social media companies.\nAt an October congressional hearing, a Facebook representative said that about 146 million people may have been exposed to the Russian misinformation effort online through posts on Facebook and Instagram. (Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted 13 Russians and three online troll factories related to the Russian propaganda campaign pushed through social media.)\nWhen it comes to regulation, Zuckerberg might also be starting to agree with Cook. \"I actually am not sure we shouldn't be regulated,\" the Facebook CEO told CNN last week. \"I think in general technology is an increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more, what is the right regulation rather than 'Yes or no, should it be regulated?'\"\nZuckerberg will also probably get grilled on Capitol Hill about all of this. He's likely to testify in April, where he'll face a barrage of questions about what Facebook is doing to crack down on fake news and protect its users' privacy.\nYou can listen to his full appearance on The Ezra Klein Show here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:37:00.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
