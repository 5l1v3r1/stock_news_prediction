This will protect both China and partner governments from entering into agreements that will cause financial difficulties in the future.”\nThe calls from Mr. Mnuchin, however, could increase the urgency with which the IMF and World Bank work to bring transparency to China’s efforts.\nThe IMF and World Bank should work together to “obtain more comprehensive debt data from member countries, to more clearly flag data deficiencies in debt sustainability analyses, and to enhance debt sustainability through strengthened use of debt limits and non-concessional borrowing policies,” he said.\nWrite to Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T06:24:37.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
