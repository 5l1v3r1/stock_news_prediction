(Reuters) - Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were among the early third-round starters who set out at rainy Augusta National on Saturday looking to conjure up something special and work their way into contention at the U.S. Masters.\nTiger Woods of the U.S. walks up to the 18th green during second round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 6, 2018.

Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, who needs a win this week to complete the career grand slam, and world number four Jordan Spieth are both a further shot adrift.\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T18:45:44.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
