SpaceX did not elaborate about testing to be done.\nAs part of the planned mission, SpaceX will launch NASA’s new Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, satellite that will be used to search for new planets. The spacecraft will monitor the brightness of over 200,000 stars in order to see if any get dimmer, which could indicate that they have orbiting planets, according to NASA.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nStanding down today to conduct additional GNC analysis, and teams are now working towards a targeted launch of @NASA_TESS on Wednesday, April 18.\n— SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 16, 2018\nNASA considers its TESS space mission to be a successor to the Kepler Space Telescope, which was launched in 2009.\nLast week, SpaceX was reported to be raising $507 million in new funding in a round that would value it at $25 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T02:53:04.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
