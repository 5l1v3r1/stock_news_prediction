We could see their spreads widening. But we plan to hold them until maturity, allowing for widening spreads at certain phases,” Maegawa explained. \nThe company expects the growth in global economy to continue and stock prices to rise further, and anticipates that the Nikkei average will rise to 23,800 by next March from around 22,200 on Thursday. \nMaegawa, however, added that financial markets are likely to be volatile. \n“Since the start of this year, market volatilities have risen. I do think this year will see rises in volatilities every time a big incident happens,” he said, noting uncertainties on U.S. trade policy and geopolitical developments. \nThe investor also plans to start investment in alternative assets, with an eye on long-term assets, such as infrastructure funds. $1 = 107.39 yen Reporting by Hideyuki Sano, Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T12:06:23.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
