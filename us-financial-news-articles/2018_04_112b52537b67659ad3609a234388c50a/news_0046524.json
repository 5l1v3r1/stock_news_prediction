Jerry Brown, to show that the United States remains committed to the Paris climate accord despite President Donald Trump's plan to withdraw from the agreement.\nIn a statement late Sunday, Bloomberg Philanthropies said further donations would be made if the U.S. fails to pay its share of the budget in 2019.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:38:46.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
