The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury bond yields hit 43.2 basis points, the lowest level since August 2007. \n“Even with the bad weather in March, the data has really strengthened, supporting the view that the Fed will most likely have to hike rates in June,” said John Herrmann, director of U.S. rates strategies at MUFG Securities in New York. \nEuropean shares advanced, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.8 percent. Germany’s Deutsche Boerse DAX index closed 1.57 higher. \nOil prices steadied as investors took profit on last week’s rally and amid concern over the potential for supply disruptions. \nBrent crude futures settled at $71.58 per barrel, up 0.22 percent. \nU.S. crude oil futures settled up 0.45 percent at $66.52 per barrel. \nIn China, stocks in Shanghai closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp hurt tech stocks. \nIn addition, data showed that March industrial output in China missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed. However, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. \nU.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal drove aluminum prices to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed most gains. Rusal accounts for 6 to 7 percent of global aluminum supply.
