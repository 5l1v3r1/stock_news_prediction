When accessing the project via a web browser, people can view the ancient temples and other relics from multiple angles, and zoom in so they can see the site’s innards like they are walking through them.\n“With modern technology, we can capture these monuments in fuller detail than ever before, including the color and texture of surfaces and the geometry captured by laser scanners with millimeter precision in 3D,” Coughenour wrote. “These detailed scans can also be used to identify areas of damage and assist restoration efforts.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nOutside researchers and academics can also apply to download CyArk’s source historical wonder data to be used for their own research, Coughenour wrote while citing Google’s cloud computing service as a way to help the process of obtaining the data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T05:54:41.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
