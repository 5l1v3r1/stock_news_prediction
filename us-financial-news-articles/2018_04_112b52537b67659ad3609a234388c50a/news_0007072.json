Founded in 1961, INCITS is the guiding force for global and U.S. information and communications technology standards.\n“We’re excited to have CA Technologies join the INCITS Executive Board and support our mission to promote the effective use of Information and Communication Technology through standardization. Our goal is to achieve this in a way that balances the interests of all stakeholders, increases global competitiveness and proposes new initiatives,” states Lynn Barra, vice president of INCITS Standards Operations.\nThe INCITS Executive Board focuses on standards for emerging technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, as well as standards for storage, processing, transfer, display, management organization and retrieval of information.\nDomestically, INCITS creates new American National Standards and, globally, INCITS serves as the U.S. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, which is responsible for international standardization in the field of Information Technology. Using these roles, INCITS provides members direct entry into the U.S. and global standards area, and provides a strong platform to design the foundation for globally accepted, highly interoperable products.\n“The acceleration of change in IT -- notably in areas such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, AI, and Cyber Security, to name a few -- requires active participation to assure interoperability and compatibility with globally deployed solutions,” states Paul Lipton, vice president, Industry Standards and Open Source, CA Technologies. “This opportunity enables CA to demonstrate its commitment to advancing INCITS projects, shaping the market, and further contributing to the direction of essential open standards in order to facilitate digital transformation in the age of the modern software factory.”\nJoining the INCITS Executive Board is the latest example of CA’s commitment to both open standards and open source. For example, CA also holds leadership roles in other open standards and open source consortia, such as OASIS, OMG, DMTF, and Eclipse Foundation, where it also serves on the Board of Directors. CA is also a member of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Cloud Foundry Foundation, OpenAPI Project, and the Open Mainframe Foundation, and others.\nCA is a significant force in creating synergies between internationally-recognized open standards organizations and innovative open source communities. For example, the company’s re-election to the OASIS Board of Directors has enabled CA to contribute to the development of the newly-launched OASIS Open Projects initiative, which is focused on maintaining these synergies.\nAbout CA Technologies\nCA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) creates software that fuels transformation for companies and enables them to seize the opportunities of the application economy.
