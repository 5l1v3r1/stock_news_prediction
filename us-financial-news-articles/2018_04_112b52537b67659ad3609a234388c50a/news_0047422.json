His solo art exhibit at New York’s ACA Galleries opens April 26. He spoke with Marc Myers.\nI was supposed to be named Slate. My dad’s older brother, Joe, picked it out. He was a college football star and a handsome guy. He thought it would be cool.\nBut immediately after I was born, the doctor saw I had spina bifida. It’s a birth defect where the spinal cord has a hole in it. In 1951, most babies with the defect didn’t have much of a chance.\nMy parents renamed me John, after my great-great grandfather. This way, if I died, there would be some sort of lineage.\nJohn Mellencamp at age 16 outside his parents’ house in Indiana. Photo: John Mellencamp The hospital’s neurological surgeon operated on me successfully. After, he told my parents, “You can take him home, but he’ll likely die.”\nMy parents never talked about my operation or spina bifida. I found out in school when I was 12. In class, the kid behind me asked about the big scar across my neck. When I looked in the mirror at home, there it was. My parents only told me it was an operation. I finally met the surgeon who operated on me in 2014.\nI grew up in Seymour, Ind. The first place we lived was on Fifth Street. It was nothing special—just a small one-story home they built for vets returning from World War II. My two brothers and I lived in the basement. My father, Richard, fixed up a section for us with wood paneling and ugly linoleum on the concrete floor.\nWe had triple bunk beds. I was the middle kid, so I got the middle bunk. There was a TV, and the windows were at ceiling level.\nMy mother, Marilyn, was a homemaker. Later, she delivered mail to keep busy. She was very pretty, and had been a runner-up in the Miss Indiana pageant in ’46. She loved to paint and did so each day, in between dealing with us. My dad created a studio space for her in the basement, too. When I was little, I’d paint on top of her work. That pissed her off.\nWhen I was 12, we moved to the Rapp house. It was about 6 miles north in a small town called Rockford, home of the nation’s first train robbery in 1866.\nThe Rapps were a wealthy family who moved out years earlier. Their grandmother stayed, so the house was dilapidated when my father bought it. I spent my teenage years as cheap labor for my father, fixing up the place. My two brothers and I worked hard and fast so we’d have time for ourselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T05:23:49.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
