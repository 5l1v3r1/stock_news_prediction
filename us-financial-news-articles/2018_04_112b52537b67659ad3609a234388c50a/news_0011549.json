Pressed about the issue after his speech, Powell told a business luncheon it was not clear whether the threatened tariffs would actually materialize and how big an effect they might have.

Prices for interest rate futures have suggested that investors expect the Fed to do just that. \nPowell’s comments on Friday bolstered that view. He said there were many signs that the job market was nearly at full strength and only a few indicators pointed to weakness.

Bernstein \n“I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further,” Powell said. \nHe said Fed policymakers discussed inflation “thoroughly” at their meeting in January and that he believed inflation will be influenced by the labor market over time, meaning that a tight labor market could fuel faster price gains.
