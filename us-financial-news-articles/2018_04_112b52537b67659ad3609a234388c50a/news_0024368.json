Windows, Mac and Linux users are now being encouraged to instead use Google’s web apps, and it’s only logical that those interfaces are now getting upgraded to include the functionality that would otherwise be lost. \nThat functionality includes native offline support, which Google said would be part of Gmail on the web by June. \nUsers of the Gmail mobile app will already be familiar with the “smart reply” feature that scans the incoming message for wording that demands a response, then suggests responses to save the user from having to type them in. That too is now coming to Gmail’s web service. \nAnother new feature for the web app will be the ability to “snooze” emails, so that they reappear later at a set time.
