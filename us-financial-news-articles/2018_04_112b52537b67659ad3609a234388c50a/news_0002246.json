In October 2017 Fuhua Gulei registered a joint venture with the Taiwanese company to manage and operate the complex, according to Fujian Petrochemical Group’s website.\nRepairs to the fire damage are almost complete and the splitter has been expanded to 110,000 bpd, the source said.\nThe splitter processes condensate into naphtha, which is then used to produce paraxylene, a chemical used in making polyester fibre and plastics.\nFuhaichuang is seeking to buy condensate, fuel oil and mixed xylenes for the plant’s restart, the sources said.\n“Dragon was out in the market seeking condensate and fuel oil, but it’s not clear if the new management has got that much expertise running the plant,” said one of the sources.\nDragon Aromatics’ splitter used to run mostly on Iranian South Pars condensate but Iran has reduced exports since late last year after selling excess supplies in storage and as it started up its own new splitters.
