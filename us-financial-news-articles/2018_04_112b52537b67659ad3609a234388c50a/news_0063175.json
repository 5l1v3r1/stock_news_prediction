REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The justices let stand a 2016 federal appeals court ruling against Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc, which had successfully challenged at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office a patent it was accused of violating. The appeals court said the patent had been wrongly reviewed in a proceeding reserved for business-related patents.\nAfter patent licensing firm Unwired Planet LLC sued Google in Nevada federal court in 2012 claiming infringement of a patent for restricting access to a cellphone’s location data, Google challenged the patent’s validity in a covered business method (CBM) review, a proceeding uniquely meant for checking the validity of business and finance-related patents.\nThe patent office reviews, conducted by its in-house Patent Trial and Appeal Board, have become a quick and cheap way for companies that are prime targets for infringement suits, such as such as Google and Apple Inc, to try to invalidate patents.\nOn April 24, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to a similar review proceeding known as inter partes review.\nGoogle said Unwired Planet’s patent was eligible for a CBM review because cellphone location information can be used to sell ads. In 2015, the board agreed and canceled several parts of the patent, saying they should not have been granted legal protection.\nUnwired Planet appealed. In 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the highest U.S. patent court, rejected the board’s broad view of the types of patents eligible for CBM review, prompting Google’s appeal to the Supreme Court.\nUnwired Planet’s parent company is Inception Holdings, LLC, according to court papers.\nAlso on Monday, the Supreme Court denied a number of other appeals that had also challenged the constitutionality of the patent review process.\nThe Supreme Court on Monday took up another case involving Google, an internet privacy dispute concerning an increasingly common form of settlement in class action suits that funnels money to unrelated third parties and charities instead of to people affected by the alleged wrongdoing.\nReporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:00:24.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
