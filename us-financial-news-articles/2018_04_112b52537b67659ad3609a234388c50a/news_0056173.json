The viral disease is estimated to infect about 3.2 million Americans and can lead to liver failure.\nA jury in federal court in San Jose, California, awarded Merck $200 million in March 2016 after finding Sovaldi and Harvoni infringed two of its patents.\nA judge threw out the verdict later that year, ruling the patents were unenforceable based on the company’s conduct. She noted that, in the process of applying for one of the patents, Merck used confidential information it obtained in 2004 while discussing a possible partnership with Pharmasset Inc, a company Gilead bought in 2011.\nThe judge also said a Merck in-house lawyer testified untruthfully in a deposition and at trial about his participation in a confidential call with Pharmasset personnel.\nMerck appealed the ruling, saying there was no “deliberately planned and carefully executed scheme by Merck to defraud or deceive.”\nBut the appeals court said in Wednesday’s ruling that the lower judge had sufficient reason to conclude that the Merck patents were “tainted” by misconduct and should not be enforceable.\nIn February a federal judge in Delaware overturned a different jury verdict requiring Gilead to pay $2.54 billion for infringing another Merck patent relating to the hepatitis C drugs.\nThe verdict had been the largest ever in a U.S. patent case, but the judge ruled Merck’s patent was invalid because it did not meet a requirement that it disclose how to make the treatment it covered without undue experimentation.
