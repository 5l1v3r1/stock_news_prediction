It's a moral issue. This is a moral issue,\" Cook says.\nDACA, which stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, gives legal status to children who immigrated to the United States before they were 16 and are accepted to the program, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Website . President Donald Trump rescinded DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 , but as of February, DACA was forced by federal court order to re-open cases for renewals . As the DACA cancellation became mired in federal courts, the Washington Post reported in March that Trump may be open to a short-term deal on DACA in exchange for movement on his effort to build a wall between the United States and Mexico. However, on Monday, Trump tweeted \"DACA is dead.\"\nDACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime! \nAs the future of DACA continues to be negotiated, Apple executive Cook came down hard in favor of protecting so-called \"dreamers.\"\n\"This is one that goes to the core of who we are as Americans,\" he says.\n\"Who among us would think that it's the right thing to do to kick somebody out of this country when they came here when they were 1, 2, 3 years old, that have only known this country as their home, that know no other country as their home.\n\"This just doesn't make any sense,\" says Cook.\nDACA should never have been revoked, says Cook .\nThis was not the first time Cook stood up for DACA. In early September, he tweeted his support for the 250 Apple employees who are \"dreamers.\"\n250 of my Apple coworkers are #Dreamers. I stand with them. They deserve our respect as equals and a solution rooted in American values. \n#Dreamers contribute to our companies and our communities just as much as you and I. Apple will fight for them to be treated as equals. \nThe same month, in an interview at the Bloomberg Global Business Forum , Cook said the United States ought to be doing everything it can to keep smart people here, including DACA participants.\n\"If I were a world leader, my goal would be to monopolize the world's talent,\" Cook said. \"Smart people create jobs. ... I'd have a very aggressive plan, not to just let a few people in, but I'd be recruiting.\"\nDon't miss: \nApple CEO Tim Cook: 'The world is full of cynics and you have to tune them out' Apple, Google CEOs demonstrate true leadership with this simple, free action 3,100 Google employees to CEO Sundar Pichai: 'Google should not be in the business of war' show chapters Watch Tim Cook honor Steve Jobs with emotional address      1:23 PM ET Tue, 12 Sept 2017 | 03:22 Like this story?
