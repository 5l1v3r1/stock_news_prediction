He said that he would only support the tax cuts if banks were excluded. \nOn the same day that the government faced a fresh challenged to its proposal, the heads of Australia’s biggest banks and financial services operators admitted that they were wrong to resist the Royal Commission inquiry into their operations for so long. \nThe heads of major banks ANZ, NAB, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac all said the Royal Commission was now necessary to expose and eliminate a pattern of high and unnecessary charges to customers, misconduct and instances of one company, AMP, admitting that it lied to the corporate regulator at least 20 times. \nAll banks and financial services business, plus the government, had long refused to support the creation of the inquiry, arguing that regulations in place were strong and that there was no need for it. \n“Clearly, I was wrong,” ANZ chief executive Shayne Elliott told the Weekend Australian. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull established the Royal Commission only after several junior members of its coalition partner, the Nationals Party - which represents rural and regional areas - threatened to revolt over the issue. \nThe government plans to resume negotiations for its proposed tax cuts, worth $35.6 billion, when parliament next sits in May. \nThe Royal Commission is due to release its interim report in February 2019. However, there have been calls for the inquiry to be extended, following the extent of the revelations of wrongdoing.
