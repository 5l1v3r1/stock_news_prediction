And the few occasions central bankers have spoken in such settings have only added to investor confusion, they add. \nFor example, bonds sold off sharply in mid-January after RBI Deputy Governor Viral Acharya warned state banks against excessively piling up on government debt. In the comments, made to a meeting of bond traders, he also indicated there would be no relaxation for banks on how they account for trading losses. \nA subsequent easing of bond accounting rules announced on April 2, which allows banks to spread their losses, surprised investors and sent yields to a four-month low. \nThe RBI did not have an immediate comment on Reuters’ queries for this story. \n“There is no reason for the madness in yields,” said a chief dealer at a large state-run bank, who did not want to be named. “But no public sector bank is confident of taking a bet on bonds.” \nSovereign bond yields have risen 130 basis points since July - the steepest rise since the currency crisis sell-off during June to December 2013. \nThe yield spike in 2017 was due to inflationary fears. While those factors have eased in 2018, market anxiety hasn’t. \nThe 10-year benchmark bond volatility index has been around 8.35 since January, compared with 7.63 from July to December, according to Thomson Reuters data. The daily average volume of bonds traded also fell to around 300 billion rupees in 2018 from 500 billion rupees during July-December 2017. \nConsequently, banks have also raised their lending rates by as much as 20 basis points, which could delay a revival of credit growth key to a sustainable investment recovery. \nEven foreign investors, who have been bullish on Indian debt, are turning wary. \nBarclays’ Das Gupta said while foreign investors are happy with a new increased investment limit, they don’t want to increase their positions until volatility and uncertainty settles.
