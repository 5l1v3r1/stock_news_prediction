During House's deep career at Sony, he was widely credited with making PlayStation a household name through global leadership and savvy marketing tactics. House's expertise was critical in developing marketing and communication strategies for the launch of each console, including the record-breaking success with the latest PlayStation 4 model. Additionally, he was pivotal in Sony's digital media expansion with PlayStation Network, the largest console gaming service on the planet.\n\"As an avid traveler for both business and pleasure, I've seen firsthand the value that emerging technology can add to the hotel experience,\" said House. \"I was thrilled when the team approached me to join the advisory board. KEYPR has shown a cutting-edge approach to marketing, and I am eager to further support the next phase of their vision as they expand beyond B2B, and build relevance and deep affinity with the end user.\"\nKEYPR provides hotels with a custom mobile guest app, digital key, in-room tablets, and a staff-facing hotel management system (GEMS速), tying the key elements together into one platform for a truly seamless guest experience.

And, I am personally delighted to work with him again.\"\nHouse joins hospitality industry veterans such as Simon Turner, former President of Global Development at Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Matthew Hart, former President and COO of Hilton Hotels Corporation, and Richard Haddrill, Executive Vice Chairman of Scientific Games Corporation to further solidify KEYPR's place as the industry's premier technology platform.\nAbout KEYPR\nKEYPR速 is a cloud-based guest experience and management platform for hotels, casinos and residential properties.
