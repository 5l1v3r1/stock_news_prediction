It said Renova would have to make up the difference, should Sulzer later place the shares with other investors for a lower price than it paid for them. \n“We want to make a profit on these shares,” the CEO told the Swiss newspaper, adding he did not need to raise capital in order to finance the transaction with Vekselberg. \nSulzer shares have tumbled around 16 percent since the sanctions were announced. Shares of other Swiss companies in which Renova owns sizable shares, including OC Oerlikon and Schmolz & Bickenbach, have also fallen. \nThose companies have said they did not expect sanctions to impact their operations.
