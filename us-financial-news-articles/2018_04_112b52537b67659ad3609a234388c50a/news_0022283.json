They held them high and tried to take legal action against Uber,” Cade chief economist Guilherme Resende said in a telephone interview. “Over time, however, they began to offer discounts and cheaper options.” \nHe cited evidence showing the drop in cab app rides was more dramatic in regions that Uber had entered more recently. \nResende defended loosening regulations on cab-hailing apps, potentially allowing them to charge variable tariffs and not be subject to rules governing street cabs. \n“It doesn’t make sense have different rules for different apps,” he said. “The discussion should not aim at a stricter regulation of Uber, but at looser regulations for cabs, beginning with apps.” \nBrazil’s President Michel Temer last month signed a bill regulating car-hailing apps with loose requirements, in contrast with other countries where Uber faces strong legal restrictions.
