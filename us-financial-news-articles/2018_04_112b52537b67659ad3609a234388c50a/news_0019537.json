A source said at the time he had only accepted VW’s offer after being passed over for the job of BMW CEO. \nBut any hopes of becoming VW CEO were seen depending on whether he could secure backing from executives, and from labour representatives who occupy half the 20 supervisory board seats. \nWinterkorn gave him the task of slashing 5 billion euros ($6 billion) a year in costs at the brand within two years, which resulted in clashes with Volkswagen’s powerful labour bosses who said he was using the emissions scandal as a pretext to push through job cuts. \nManagement and labour leaders agreed in late 2016 to cut 30,000 jobs via natural attrition at the VW division in exchange for a commitment to avoid compulsory redundancies in Germany until 2025, a deal that still left profitability lagging rivals. \nLast year, powerful labour chief Bernd Osterloh changed tack, telling a German newspaper that the dispute with Diess over how to implement reforms at the brand has been laid to rest and that the two sides aimed to “enter calmer waters”.
