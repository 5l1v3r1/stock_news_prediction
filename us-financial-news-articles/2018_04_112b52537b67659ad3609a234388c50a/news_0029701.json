In January, he had dismissed as “slander” accusations that Chilean bishop Juan Barros had covered up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor Father Fernando Karadima. \nBarros told Chilean media at the meeting of Church leadership that “the pope always seeks the best for everyone.” Barros was appointed bishop of Osorno, in southern Chile, by Pope Francis in 2015. \nOsorno parishioners said on Wednesday that specific measures, including the resignation of Barros, were needed to restore confidence in the Church. \nThe pope’s letter followed a visit to Chile by one of the Vatican’s most experienced sexual abuse investigators, Archbishop Charles Scicluna. \nScicluna’s 2,300-page report prompted Francis to summon Chile’s bishops to Rome for a meeting. He did not say when it would take place. \n“We will meet with the pope and we will propose to him a plan of renovation for the Church,” Silva said on Thursday.
