(AP) â€” Authorities have arrested a suspect in the brutal stabbing death of a 75-year-old retiree more than three decades ago in Southern California.\nPolice in Escondido say technology led to new analysis of fingerprints from the apartment where Richard Finney was stabbed 31 times in 1986.\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune reported Monday that Nathan Eugene Mathis faces a charge of murder and an allegation that he used a knife in the attack. The 62-year-old retired security guard pleaded not guilty last week.\nInvestigators haven't named a possible motive or said whether the defendant and the victim knew each other.\nGina Turi Curry, Finney's granddaughter, tells the newspaper she burst into tears when police informed her of the arrest.\nInformation from: The San Diego Union-Tribune, http://www.utsandiego.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T06:55:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
