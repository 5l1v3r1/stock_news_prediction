The elections were initially slated for November 2019.\nThe rally in Turkish assets appeared “to reflect hopes in the market that (the election) will reduce political uncertainty,” William Jackson of Capital Economics said in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n“However, we think there are reasons for caution. For one thing, there is a risk that policy is loosened ahead of the vote in order to shore up support for the AK Party,” he said.\nErdogan and his ruling AK Party have governed Turkey for the last decade and a half, transforming a poor, sprawling country at the eastern edge of Europe into a major emerging market. Turkey’s rapid growth, however, has been accompanied by increased authoritarianism, with a security crackdown since a 2016 failed coup leading to the arrest of tens of thousands.
