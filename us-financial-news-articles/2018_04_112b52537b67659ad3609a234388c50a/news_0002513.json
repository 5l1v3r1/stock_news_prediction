Facebook hasn’t done a great job of explaining the problems they’ve had.”\nOther “FANG” members were also lower. Facebook was down 1.96 percent, while Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet were down between 3 percent and 4 percent. The technology index was down 2.7 percent.\nTesla shares pared some early losses after a report that the electric car maker’s crucial Model 3 sedan production would be a big jump from earlier numbers but could still fail to meet the company’s 2,500 per week target.\nAt 12:55 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 502.3 points, or 2.08 percent, at 23,600.81.\nThe S&P 500 was down 58.35 points, or 2.21 percent, at 2,582.52, falling below its 200-day moving average for the first time since during a market sell-off in early February.\nThe Nasdaq Composite was down 167.98 points, or 2.38 percent, at 6,895.47. The index was down 0.20 percent for the year.\n“Failure to hold the 200-day (moving average on S&P 500) has put downward pressure on the market,” said Ryan Larson, head of U.S. equity trading, RBC Global Asset Management in Chicago.\n“As fundamentals tend to take a back seat, technicals are a few of the indicators that people hold on to in period of extreme volatility.”\nAmong a few bright spots, Humana jumped 4.4 percent Reuters reported Walmart was in early-stage talks with the health insurer about developing closer ties, with acquisition discussed as one possibility.\nWalmart fell 3.8 percent. UnitedHealth rose 1.6 percent, one of the two Dow Industrials trading higher in the session.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers for a 3.74-to-1 ratio on the downside and for a 3.63-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P 500 index showed two new 52-week highs and 25 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 134 new lows.
