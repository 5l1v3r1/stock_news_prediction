Its economy is gradually recovering. Gross domestic product grew 1.4 percent last year. \nGilibert said the EIF supports innovative companies active in sectors including artificial intelligence, fintech, big data. Its loan guarantees are risk sharing instruments, enabling banks on the ground to choose eligible firms. \nUnder the so-called InnovFin agreement, NBG will provide loans at favourable terms to innovative SMEs for two years. The EIF’s support for innovative Greek companies is expected to generate a portfolio of 100 million euros of loans. \nThe second agreement, COSME, will allow NBG to provide 500 million euros of loans to around 1,900 small businesses in Greece over three years. \nEaSI microfinance guarantee, the third facility, will provide 40 million euros of loans to 3,400 micro-borrowers, very small companies which have difficulties in accessing credit across the country. \n“With today’s financing agreements, the Juncker Plan continues to support Greek companies tangibly and help them grow,” said EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos. \n“More than 5,000 will benefit from loans, making Greece the top beneficiary of the European Fund for Strategic Investments relative to GDP.” \nThe investment plan for Europe, known as the Juncker Plan, focuses on boosting investment to generate jobs and growth in the European Union via smarter use of financial resources. $1 = 0.8091 euros Reporting by George Georgiopoulos.
