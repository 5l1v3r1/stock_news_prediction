REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe British arm of French utility EDF ( EDF.PA ) said the rise was due to higher costs associated with supplying electricity, echoing comments made by rival Centrica ( CNA.L ), which announced its rise on Tuesday. \n“EDF Energy continues to face pressures with energy, policy and the costs of installing smart meters all increasing significantly since last summer,” it said in a statement. \nEDF said its average electricity standard electricity price would rise by 2.7 percent equating to a 1.4 percent rise for “dual fuel” customers taking both gas and electricity from the company on its standard variable tariff. \nThe rise will add 16 pounds ($22.65) taking its average standard dual fuel bill to 1,158 pounds a year, EDF said. \nBritain’s government has asked industry regulator Ofgem to put a price cap on the most widely used standard tariffs to combat what it has called “rip off” energy prices. \nHowever the cap will not come into effect until the end of the year at the earliest, Ofgem said. \n($1 = 0.7064 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:22:16.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
