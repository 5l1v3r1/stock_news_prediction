They wed in a pageant-packed ceremony at Westminster Abbey in April 2011 and are treated as global celebrities. \nThe couple now live at Kensington Palace and last year William gave up his day job as an air ambulance pilot to concentrate full-time on royal duties on behalf of his grandmother, having faced some criticism from British newspapers who dubbed him “workshy Wills”. \nHe has been determined to play a hands-on role in bringing up his children while also protecting their privacy, an issue close to his heart after the death of his mother, Princess Diana, in a 1997 Paris car crash as her limousine sped away from pursuing paparazzi. \n“I think he takes on a lot more engagements than he used to,” said royal biographer Claudia Joseph. \n“But compared to members of the general public who have full-time jobs, he still has some time off to look after the children, to give them their baths, to put them to bed and I think he’ll continue to do that,” Joseph said. \nThe British royals are rarely out of the media glare, but the baby arrives at a time when the Windsors have particularly been in the limelight. \nOn Saturday William joined the queen and other senior royals, with the exception of Kate, as the monarch celebrated her 92nd birthday at a televised concert.

MEDIA SPOTLIGHT \nWhile interest in their third child has been more muted than with the birth of their first, large numbers of photographers and broadcasters from around the globe massed outside the hospital, along with some dedicated royal fans. \n“We’ve been coming out doing this for 21 years,” said John Loughrey, 63, from south London, who was wearing a Union Jack onesie and hat and holding a baby doll adorned with a crown. He said he had been camped outside the hospital for 15 days. \n“We were here for George and Charlotte and we’ll be there for the royal wedding too,” he said, referring to Harry and Markle. \nHowever, not everyone in Britain is so enamored. \n“Congratulations to William and Kate but it is a private matter and if people are happy for them then fine but I think the media should just move on and talk about something more important,” Graham Smith, chief executive officer of the anti-monarchist campaign group Republic, told Reuters. \n“The monarchy is about births, deaths and marriages and these events remind us how this system works and highlights again the inequality of those born into royalty and those born into poverty.” \nOne consequence of the birth is that some existing members of the royal family are pushed to the periphery, and this has led to calls for the monarchy to be pared down. \n“One of the problems all members of the royal family have is they start quite close to the throne and gradually as time goes on they go further and further away,” royal historian Hugo Vickers said. \n“It’s very easy to talk about a bloated royal family but it’s not really fair because the queen has an enormous amount of requests of things to do and her family are there to support her.” Slideshow (19 Images) \nThe birth also gives Kate’s own family another cause for celebration after it was reported by British media on Sunday that her sister Pippa, who is married to a wealthy financier, was pregnant with her first child.
