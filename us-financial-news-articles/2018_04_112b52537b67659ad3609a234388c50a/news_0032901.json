He did not elaborate.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the U.S., British, and French strikes in Syria his country will continue “to move against Iran in Syria.”\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi in Amman; Additional reporting by Nayera Abdullah in Cairo, Yara Bayoumy in Washington and Maayan Lubell in Jerusalem; Editing by Leslie Adler, Peter Cooney and Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T01:44:49.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
