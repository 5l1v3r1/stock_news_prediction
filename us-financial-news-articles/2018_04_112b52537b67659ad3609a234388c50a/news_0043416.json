Analysts were expecting an increase of 2.6 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus.\nReported sales were 3.11 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), just shy of the 3.12 billion in analystsâ€™ consensus.\nThe company stood by its 2018 forecast, which calls for revenue up 13 to 14 percent, with like-for-like sales up 2 to 3 percent. That would be an improvement from sales that were flat in 2017, due to a spate of issues from a product failure to a cyber attack.\n($1 = 0.7111 pounds)\nReporting by Martinne Geller Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:07:53.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
