It is home to roughly half the world’s remaining 900 mountain gorillas and was the subject of an Oscar-nominated documentary film in 2014.\nThe dense forests near the Rwandan and Ugandan borders witnessed some of the fiercest fighting during civil wars around the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease. It has also been troubled by periodic insurrections since then.\nReporting By Aaron Ross Editing by Tim Cocks\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:33:56.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
