REUTERS/David Gray \nThe 22-year-old, who had set a Commonwealth Games record in the semi-finals on Thursday, finished fast but was unable to catch compatriot Emma McKeon in the final few strokes as the hosts completed a clean sweep of the medals. \nMcKeon set a Commonwealth record of 56.78 seconds to beat Groves, whose 57.19 was faster than the time she swam on Thursday. Brianna Throssell took the bronze. \n“I’m very emotional right now,” Groves said. “This has validated everything I’ve been through, and all the hard work I’ve done. \n“To be up there one, two, three with the girls, it really doesn’t get better than this.” Swimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Women's 100m Butterfly Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 6, 2018 - Silver medalist Madeline Groves reacts on the podium. REUTERS/David Gray \nFriday’s result followed the silver she won in the 200m butterfly at the Rio Olympics, when Spain’s Mireia Belmonte beat her by 0.03 seconds and her career, it seemed, was only going up. \nInstead, it came crashing down around her in 2017. \nWhile training in the United States, Groves was notified she had breached anti-doping whereabouts rules for the third time in a 12-month period and she faced the possibility of a two-year ban.
