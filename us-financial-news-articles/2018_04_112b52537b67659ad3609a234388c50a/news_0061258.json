He has thrown 24 consecutive scoreless innings against the Brewers.\nMilwaukee starter Junior Guerra (2-1) made his third straight strong start, allowing one run on three hits with six strikeouts and two walks in six innings. Guerra retired eight of the first nine batters he faced before surrendering a pair of two-out hits in the third inning.\nAlbert Almora Jr. singled to left field and Baez followed with a double to give the Cubs a 1-0 lead. It was the first earned run Guerra had allowed since his season debut on April 11.\nChicago got to Brewers reliever Oliver Drake in the seventh inning. Ben Zobrist led off the inning with a single and advanced to third on a ringing double by Jason Heyward. La Stella followed with a bloop single into shallow left field, bringing home Zobrist and Heyward.\nThe Cubs will go for a four-game sweep on Sunday. Tyler Chatwood is slated to start for Chicago. The Brewers will counter with Zach Davies.\nMilwaukee entered the series having won eight in a row, but have struggled to figure Cubs pitching. The Brewers were blanked by Kyle Hendricks in a 1-0 loss Thursday and managed only four hits in Friday’s 3-2 loss. They had even less success against Quintana.\nMilwaukee’s Domingo Santana reached on an error by Baez with one out in the seventh inning. But Quintana caught Santana leaning toward second base and picked him off.\nThe Brewers announced Friday that first baseman Eric Thames will miss six to eight weeks after undergoing surgery on his injured left thumb. Thames leads Milwaukee with seven home runs.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T17:44:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
