And at the same time we will look to free up capacity for growth by pulling back from those areas where we are not sufficiently profitable,” he said, without providing details.\nDeutsche Bank late on Sunday named retail specialist Sewing as its CEO, signalling a possible retreat from almost three decades of empowering investment bankers at Germany’s largest lender.
