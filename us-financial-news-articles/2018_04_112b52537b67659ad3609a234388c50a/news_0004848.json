They’ve stolen the land, built this country on stolen wages, built this country on the blood and bones of our people.\n“And it’s about time that history is acknowledged and about time that the royal families who are responsible for it all - that they come down here and get at our level and ask to be here on our country. That’s what needs to happen.”\nAboriginals inhabited Australia at least 50,000 years before Britain’s “First Fleet” sailed into Sydney harbor in 1788 and declared the land unoccupied.\nThere are about 700,000 aboriginal Australians in a population of 23 million, but they suffer disproportionately high rates of suicide, domestic violence and imprisonment, tracking near the bottom in almost every economic and social indicator.\nThe demonstration was organized by a coalition of indigenous rights groups under the banner of “Stolenwealth Games”.\nThe activists said on their Facebook page that they would set up a protest camp in central Gold Coast “to resist colonial activity and authority.”\nProtesters are expected to demonstrate outside Carrara Stadium during the opening ceremony.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T10:39:34.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
