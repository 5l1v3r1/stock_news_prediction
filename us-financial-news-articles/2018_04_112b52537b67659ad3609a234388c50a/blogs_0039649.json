Fighting in 2014 put the main international airport out of service.\nRada, a security group aligned to Libya’s internationally recognized government that controls the airport, said the rockets were fired by men loyal to a militia leader known as Bashir “the Cow” Khalfalla, a group it has clashed with before and which it blames for regular nighttime shelling of Mitiga.\nItaly and Turkey reopened their embassies in Tripoli last year. U.N. envoy Ghassan Salame is now based in the city, where he held a series of meetings on Thursday and attended an art exhibition with Prime Minister Fayez Seraj in the evening. French Ambassador Brigitte Curmi was also in the capital, holding talks with Libyan officials.\nWhen asked whether elections would be held this year, Salame said after meeting Foreign Minister Mohamed Taher Siyala: “Sure. We promised this the U.N. Security Council.” He did not elaborate.\nThe United Nations launched a new round of talks in September in Tunis between the rival factions to prepare for elections in 2018, but divisions have so far prevented any accord.\nReporting by Tripoli newsroom; writing by Ulf Laessing and Aidan Lewis; editing by Andrew Heavens and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T02:00:10.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
