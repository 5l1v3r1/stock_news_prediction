On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were trading down 0.6% at $67.98 a barrel.\n“We are seeing some renewed dollar strength…which is really the main driver,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. The geopolitical risk to supply that has buoyed prices in recent days has mostly now been priced in, “allowing some profit-taking to occur,” Mr. Hansen added.\nDollar-denominated commodities like oil tend to have an inverse relationship with the U.S. currency. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 of its peers, was up 0.4% Monday morning.\nPrices had oscillated between losses and gains Friday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers outside the cartel gathered in Jeddah to discuss their efforts to limit crude output. The group of oil producers including Saudi Arabia—the de facto head of OPEC—and Russia committed to keeping a tight grip on output for the rest of this year and perhaps in 2019.\nBut President Donald Trump weighed in via Twitter, blaming OPEC for “artificially high” oil prices. Mr. Trump’s tweet sent oil prices tumbling before they ultimately recovered at the end of the trading day.\nOPEC and 10 producers outside the cartel have been holding back crude output by 1.8 million barrels a day since the start of last year, part of a coordinated effort to rein in a supply glut that had weighed on prices since late 2014 and boost prices.\nCrude prices rose more than 50% in the second half of 2017. In recent weeks, prices have surpassed three-year highs , helped both by the OPEC cuts and geopolitical risk to supply emanating largely from the Middle East.\n“The market is artificially tight but it is the oil market reality of today,” according to Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. “They [OPEC and Russia] are cutting, oil demand is strong, inventories are going down and prices are moving higher,” Mr. Schieldrop wrote in a note Monday.\nThe BP Eastern Trough Area Project oil platform in the North Sea. Oil prices have surpassed three-year highs recently, helped by OPEC cuts and geopolitical risk to supply emanating largely from the Middle East.

ICE gasoil, a benchmark for diesel fuel, changed hands at $644.00 a metric ton, up 0.5% from the previous settlement.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-7895?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-04-23T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:02:17.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
