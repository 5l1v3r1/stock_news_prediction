We will continue to do that as the concept evolves.\n“Our game has a history of innovation and we have a duty to look for future growth for the health and sustainability of the whole game.”\nThe ECB members voted overwhelmingly in favour of a new city-based competition last year, with matches to be played in a five-week window in the middle of the summer.\nSouthampton, Birmingham, Leeds, London, Manchester, Cardiff and Nottingham have been selected as venues for the tournament, with Lord’s and the Oval each playing host to a London-based team.\nThe tournament will feature aligned competitions for both men’s and women’s teams sharing a common format, brands and team identities.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru,; Editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:38:47.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
