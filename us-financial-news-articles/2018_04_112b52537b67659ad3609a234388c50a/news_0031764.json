Hunt Transport Services Inc., JBHT 6.19% which benefited from a tight trucking market that boosted pricing and offset rising costs in some of its truck and rail operations.\nJ.B. Hunt’s revenue jumped 20% over the three-month period a year ago, to $1.95 billion, the company reported Monday, beating consensus estimates of $1.89 billion by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That helped push the net profit up 15% from a year ago, to $118.1 million.\nEarnings per share were $1.07, up from $0.92 for the same period in 2017 and in line with expectations.\nThe Lowell, Ark.-based carrier is a top U.S. provider of intermodal service, managing the transport of goods by road and rail. A shortage of truck capacity has helped the sector, as manufacturers and retailers hunt for alternative ways to ship cargo long distances.\nLast month, average pricing for intermodal carriers jumped 5.8% year-over-year, the 18th straight month of increases, according to the Cass Information Systems Inc. CASS 2.22% index for intermodal pricing. Cass said its separate measure of freight shipments was up 11.9% in March over the same month a year ago, extending an unusually strong first quarter for domestic freight demand.\nAlso in Logistics...\nJ.B.

Hunt’s intermodal revenue rose 14% in the first quarter, to $1.07 billion, as load volumes increased 6% year-over-year. Operating income in the segment was up 20%, although rate increases and other gains were partially offset by problems with rail congestion and increased driver wages and recruiting costs.\n“Intermodal profitability came in better than expected,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon wrote in a Monday research note, adding that J.B. Hunt “remains uniquely positioned to benefit from a tighter truck transportation market.”\nJ.B. Hunt’s stock was up 6% in early afternoon trading on Monday, at $119.53 per share.\nThe shortage of truck capacity also boosted results at J.B. Hunt’s brokerage unit, where the operating profit nearly doubled to $9 million on a 41% gain in revenue. Revenue per load surged 34% on pricing gains in the spot market, where shippers book last-minute transportation.\nThose results bode well for C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc., the largest U.S. freight broker, KeyBanc Capital Markets transportation analyst Todd Fowler wrote in a Monday research note. C.H. Robinson is scheduled to report first-quarter numbers next month.\nLike other carriers, J.B. Hunt in recent months has grappled with challenges including bad weather and difficulty recruiting drivers in the tight labor market . Operating income in its dedicated contract services unit, which includes home delivery of bulky goods, fell 9% year-over-year in the first quarter, to $41 million.\nRevenue in J.B. Hunt’s trucking segment, its smallest unit, fell 1% to $92.7 million. While revenue per load and rates per loaded mile were up, the division’s fleet shrank by about 10% compared to the same period in 2017 while recruiting and other driver-related costs rose.\nWrite to Jennifer Smith at jennifer.smith@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T03:57:00.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
