Used with a Varian TrueBeam ® , Edge ® and Clinac ® C-series medical linear accelerators, the Calypso system and Anchored Beacon transponder detects even slight movements of a tumor and helps clinicians deliver lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) more precisely.\nThe Calypso system works by implanting the Anchored Beacon transponders in small airways within or near the tumor target. The Anchored Beacon transponders feature five small \"legs\" that provide stable fixation to prevent the transponder from moving. The transponders emit non-ionizing electromagnetic signals that are tracked in real-time and used to keep a treatment beam on target.\nThe Calypso System is the only device on the market that delivers real-time, continuous (25 Hz update rate), 3D tumor position information, improving confidence that the prescribed dose has been delivered to the tumor.\n\"The 510(k) clearance of the Anchored Beacon transponder expands the application of the Calypso system platform,\" said Ed Vertatschitsch, vice president, Global Portfolio Solutions, Varian. \"Using the Calypso system and Anchored Beacon transponder, clinicians can deliver dose to lung tumors with increased confidence and accuracy.\"\nFor more information on the Calypso system, visit www.varian.com/calypso .\nAbout Varian\nVarian is a leader in developing and delivering cancer care solutions, and is focused on creating a world without fear of cancer.
