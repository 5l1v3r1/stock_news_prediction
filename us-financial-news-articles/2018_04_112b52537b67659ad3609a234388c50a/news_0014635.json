(NASDAQ:ARCT), a leading RNA medicines company, today announced that upon the recommendation of the Executive Committee of the Board, the Board of Directors of Arcturus approved postponing the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) previously scheduled for May 7, 2018.\nIn making its determination, the Board considered, among other things, the uncertainty regarding the agenda for the meeting due to a recent petition from Joseph E. Payne, former President and CEO of Arcturus, to the courts in Israel to require changes to the proposals to be voted on at the EGM. The Board also considered the uncertainty regarding the necessity of the proposal related to the independent auditor for the Company’s 2017 financial statements. Both of these sources of uncertainty are the direct result of Payne’s actions that continue to harm Arcturus shareholders.\nPayne inexplicably waited almost three weeks after the agenda for the EGM was publicized to make a court filing to attempt to change the agenda of the Extraordinary General Meeting, which Payne demanded be held. This is another example of Payne’s efforts to disrupt the Company’s positive momentum and compromise our ongoing initiatives to drive shareholder value.\nIn addition, the uncertainty regarding the audit firm would not exist if Payne and his associates had voted sensibly at Arcturus’ February EGM, instead of deliberately voting in opposition to the best interests of all other shareholders and against how Payne voted on the proposal in his capacity as a Director. The Executive Committee of the Board intends to reschedule the EGM when it can provide shareholders with certainty regarding the agenda for the meeting.\nAs previously noted, there is an ongoing investigation into Payne’s actions as well as into the background of his proposed nominees.\nIn contrast to Payne’s vindictive campaign of self-interest and interference, the Executive Committee is dedicated to doing what is necessary to protect Arcturus and the interests of all of its shareholders and other stakeholders. As evidenced by the recent actions to terminate Payne for cause and continued efforts to hold Payne accountable for his reckless and disruptive campaign, the Executive Committee is committed to ensuring management accountability, oversight and successful execution of Arcturus’ strategy.\nIf investors have any questions, please contact the Company’s proxy solicitor:\nMORROW\nSODALI\n509 Madison Avenue\nSuite 1608\nNew York, NY 10022\nStockholders Call Toll Free: (800) 662-5200\nE-mail: ARCT@morrowsodali.com About Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd.\nFounded in 2013 and based in San Diego, Arcturus Therapeutics Ltd.
