Its older treatments only treat about 45 percent of patients.\nVertex also said it was beginning late-stage trials of a second triple combination CF treatment.\nVertex said income attributable to the company fell 15.1 percent to $210.3 million in the first quarter, because of higher research and development expenses and unsold inventory.\nExcluding one-time items, Vertex earned 76 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nVertex’s revenue fell 10.3 percent to $640.8 million.
