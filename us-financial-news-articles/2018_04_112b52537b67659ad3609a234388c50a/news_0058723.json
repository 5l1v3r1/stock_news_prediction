He scored the tying run on a single by Nomar Mazara.\nAfter A’s starter Kendall Graveman walked Joey Gallo, Kiner-Falefa came through with a single to right-center field, scoring Mazara with the eventual winning run.\nJesse Chavez, Alex Claudio and Chris Martin shut out the A’s over the next three innings to retain the one-run lead before Ronald Guzman gave Rangers closer Keone Kela a two-run cushion with an RBI single that scored Kiner-Falefa in the eighth.\nKela recorded his fourth save with a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out two.\nChavez (1-0), who relieved starter Doug Fister with two outs in the fifth inning, threw 1 1/3 innings and was credited with the win.\nAll told, Chavez, Claudio, Martin and Kela faced 13 batters over the final 4 1/3 innings, and only one reached base. A throwing error by third baseman Kiner-Falefa put Marcus Semien on second to start the eighth inning against Martin.\nHowever, Martin got hot-hitting Jed Lowrie to fly out to center field, which resulted in a double play when Delino DeShields threw out Semien trying to advance to third base.\nGraveman (0-5) became the American League’s first five-game loser, allowing three runs and six hits in six innings. He walked four and struck out seven.\nDavis’ homer came off Fister in the third inning. It followed a single by Semien and gave Oakland a 2-0 lead.\nJuan Centeno’s fielder’s choice grounder scored Gallo, who had singled, to get the Rangers within 2-1 in the fourth.\nFister went 4 2/3 innings, allowing two runs on four hits. He walked three and struck out three.\nGallo went 3-for-3 and Guzman finished with a pair of hits for the Rangers, who completed a six-game homestand with a 2-4 record.\nSemien had two of Oakland’s four hits, a pair of singles, as the A’s saw a three-game road win streak come to an end.\nThe Rangers out-hit the A’s 8-4.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:27:08.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
