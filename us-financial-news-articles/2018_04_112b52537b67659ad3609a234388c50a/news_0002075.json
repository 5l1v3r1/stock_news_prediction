Her break comes in the midst of a devastating backlash against a tweet in which she mocked teenage mass-shooting survivor and gun-safety activist David Hogg.\nIngraham said the break was pre-planned. As Variety notes , however, another Fox News host who recently went on a planned vacation in the midst of a major controversy, Bill O’Reilly, never returned to the network.\nIngraham’s show has lost nearly a dozen major advertisers in recent days, including Johnson & Johnson , Liberty Mutual Insurance, Stitch Fix, Hulu, Nestle, Wayfair, TripAdvisor, and Rachael Ray’s Nutrish pet-food brand. The advertiser exodus came after a tweet in which Ingraham appeared to mock Hogg for being rejected by several colleges he applied to. Hogg responded by encouraging his own followers to contact Ingraham’s advertisers.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nIn a statement, Wayfair said that “the decision of an adult to personally criticize a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values.” According to Variety , IBM was the only “blue chip” advertiser to appear during Ingraham’s Friday show.\nHogg, a high school senior, has been among the most prominent survivors-turned-activists pushing for stricter gun control following the deaths of 17 of his classmates in a mass shooting. That has made him an uncomfortable but seemingly irresistible target of rage from conservatives and gun-rights absolutists, including some who have gone so far as to paint him as a fraudulent “crisis actor.”", "external_links": ["http://thehill.com/homenews/media/380851-wayfair-pulling-ads-from-laura-ingrahams-show", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/laura-ingraham-apologizes-to-parkland-survivor-after-advertisers-boycott-her-show/", "http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/laura-ingraham-vacation-tv-advertising-1202740828/"], "published": "2018-04-01T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T00:01:46.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
