It did not immediately provide an explanation for the diversion.\n“We are in the process of transporting customers and crew into the terminal,” Southwest said in a statement.\nA passenger on the flight described feeling the aircraft drop.\n“All of a sudden, we heard this loud bang, rattling, it felt like one of the engines went out. The oxygen masks dropped,” the passenger, Kristopher Johnson told CNN. “It just shredded the left-side engine completely ... it was scary.”\nTodd Baur, who identified himself as the father of a passenger from the plane, told Philadelphia’s NBC-10 that a female passenger was injured when she was partially sucked into a window near the afflicted engine.\nThe aircraft’s maker, Boeing, said on Twitter that it was aware of the incident and was “gathering more information.”\nThe plane’s engines are made by CFM International, a French-U.S. venture co-owned by Safran and General Electric, which was not immediately available for comment.\nA spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment.\nReporting by Peter Szekely; Additional reporting by Tim Hepher in Paris; Editing by Scott Malone and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T20:11:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
