Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester United vs Manchester City - Old Trafford, Manchester, Britain - December 10, 2017 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho at the end of the match Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine \nFollowing City’s 3-0 humbling by Liverpool in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday, Jose Mourinho’s side will be hoping to inflict a second successive defeat on Pep Guardiola’s men this week. \nHere is what the fans say about their respective clubs: \nMark Bent, Manchester City season ticket holder \n“This Premier League season has been an amazing adventure and it’s been much better than we could have imagined. \n“I thought Manchester City would win the league this year, but even I didn’t expect us to be so far ahead at this stage of the season and talking about being crowned champions in April.

I have been following City for many years, through the lower divisions and back to the top, so it is a dream to be able to secure the title against them in front of a home crowd. \n“It will be a special atmosphere inside the Etihad on Saturday and no doubt the best of the season so far. I’m sure United will look to slow the game down and frustrate us as much as they can. This game can’t come quickly enough. \n“I think Pep Guardiola and the players will be looking to win it in style so I am going to predict that City will win 3-0 this weekend. If we get an early goal then I think we will go on to win with a decent margin.

Whatever happens in the Champions League is a bonus, I just hope he stays with us for a very long time!” \nPaul Ansorge, Co-host, Rant Cast \n“Manchester City are obviously going to win the Premier League title, but if they could not do it against us, that would be nice. Time and time again football throws up incredible narratives and coincidence. \n“With my most optimistic head on, I think City will field a weakened side and Jose Mourinho will feel so determined to prevent them winning the league against us, that the game will finish in a 1-1 draw. It’s pathetic that wild optimism comes down to a one-all draw, but that’s where we are now. \n“This season we’ve been really incompetent, it’s not just about Mourinho setting up defensively. Generally speaking United have just been bad in big games this season. What I think we’ll see this weekend is a fully parked bus, reminiscent of United’s game at Anfield. \n“Think about the stakes, United have nothing to win and everything to lose. All that is at stake is humiliation. “Even if there was more at stake, after having been frustrated by Mourinho’s approach, demeanour, behaviour, lies, nonsense and terrible man management, I actually think that in this instance he is probably right to play a very defensive space limiting style against City. \n“You can try to do what Liverpool did and press hard and early – but no one has managed to do that against them at home. Manchester United don’t have the personnel or the drilling to do that. \n“We don’t press as a collective and Mourinho is firmly committed to that low block and defending their own half and own space, rather than getting in the face of the opposition. \n“Obviously playing against a team that has been drilled by Pep Guardiola for two seasons in possession football, you’re not going toe-to-toe with them in trying to keep the ball - that would be madness.” Editing by Pritha Sarkar", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T23:20:27.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
