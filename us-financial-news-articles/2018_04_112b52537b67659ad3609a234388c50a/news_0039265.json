I think it's impossible, frankly, which is why so many mom-and-pop hardware stores have gone under despite their often superior personal touch,\" Cramer said. \"It's why even arch-rival Lowe's is losing in the two-way national race, because the contractors of the world don't have time to go to Lowe's anymore.\"\nCramer sees the trend stretching beyond Home Depot. He attributed CSX's profit boost to increased efficiency at the railroad operator, much of which stemmed from tech improvements.\n\"Here's the bottom line: tech isn't just FANG , for heaven's sake, my acronym for Facebook , Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet ,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"It's about the companies that employ tech to trounce the competition in the information technology field. It's about the railroads or it's about a big orange chain store called Home Depot. With tech, if you live without it, you wither on the vine.\"\nWATCH: Cramer on how tech helps retailers survive show chapters Cramer applauds Home Depot's tech-centered push: 'Tech isn't just FANG' 20 Hours Ago | 14:05 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, Amazon and Alphabet.\nCorrection: This story has been updated to reflect that Matt Carey is Home Depot's chief information officer.\nQuestions for Cramer?\nCall Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC\nWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?
