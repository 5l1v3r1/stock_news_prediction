So were at least three of their six adopted children, Markis, 19, Jeremiah, 14 and Abigail, 14, police said.\nThe bodies of their three other children, Hannah 16, Devonte 15 and Sierra 12, were not recovered as of early Monday, but officials believed all the children, who were black, were in the vehicle along with their parents.\nPolice said they searched the family’s home in Woodland, Washington, about 500 miles north of the crash site, but found no suicide note.\nThe Washington State Department of Social and Health Services said it opened an investigation into the family for potential child neglect or abuse after a complaint on March 23.\nNeighbors Dana and Bruce DeKalb told the Oregonian newspaper that Devonte had asked them for food for himself and his siblings after his parents withheld it as punishment. The DeKalbs did not respond to requests for comment.\nSarah Hart was convicted of misdemeanor domestic assault of Abigail in 2011 in Minnesota. Court documents show the child told a teacher, “Mom hit me.”\nReporting by Rich McKay, additional reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Eric Meijer and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T09:54:31.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
