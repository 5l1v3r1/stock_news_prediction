REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nThousands of workers from the Caribbean were invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, but some of their descendants have been caught up in a tightening of immigration rules. \nIn some cases they have been denied health services, prevented from working or even threatened with deportation Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at a news conference to mark the end of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at Marlborough House in London, Britain, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \n“The UK will do whatever it takes, including where appropriate payment of compensation, to resolve the anxieties and problems which some of the Windrush generation have suffered,” May said in a speech to Commonwealth leaders. \n“These people are British, they are part of us, they helped to build Britain and we are all the stronger for their contributions,” she added. \nBritain has already voiced regret in a letter to the 12 countries involved, the first of whose workers arrived in 1948 on the “Empire Windrush” ship from Jamaica.
