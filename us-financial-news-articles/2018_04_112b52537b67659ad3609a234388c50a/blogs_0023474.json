The amount of synergy expected by CBS is well below that of Viacom. \nThe main obstacle to the rejoining of the network and owner of Nickelodeon and MTV is a growing distrust between Redstone and Moonves. As CNBC previously reported , Moonves wants to pick his own management team if he is to head the combined entity and favors Joe Ianniello, chief operating officer of CBS, as his key lieutenant. Redstone, however, wants Bob Bakish, the current CEO of Viacom, as No. 2.

National Amusements, founded by Redstone's father, Sumner, owns an 80 percent of each company. \n\"The industry and the marketplace know Leslie Moonves' record and we think it speaks for itself,\" CBS said in a statement in response to this story. show chapters", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T16:43:05.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
