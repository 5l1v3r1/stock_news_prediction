I think we showed in our performance that we learned from last year,” Leinster captain Johnny Sexton said in a pitchside interview, referring to another last four clash in Dublin a year ago when they lost to Scarlets in the Pro14. \nScarlets outclassed Leinster in that semi-final on the way to their first Pro14 championship, but the hosts were in no mood for a repeat performance. \nAfter Leigh Halfpenny kicked the Welsh province into an early 3-0 lead, Leinster struck at the first opportunity. \nThe tournament’s top try scorers created a huge overlap and when Fergus McFadden lacked the gas to make it over in the corner, James Ryan, a revelation at lock for Ireland during his first Six Nations campaign, drove over from the resulting ruck. \nRyan was one of seven new faces in the pack compared to the eight who got outmuscled by the Welsh forwards last year and most of them had a go at trying to get over the Scarlets line for the second try before Cian Healy made it across. \nHalfpenny tried to keep Scarlets in touch but every time he replied with three points, Leinster added another seven, doing so for the third time on the halftime whistle as more ferocious pressure up front created space for Garry Ringrose to find McFadden with a brilliant long pass for a 24-9 lead. \nScarlets, playing in their first European Cup semi-final in 11 years, simply had no answer and the onslaught continued in the second half with man of the match Scott Fardy effectively killing off the game with try number four on 50 minutes. \nWhile they were hardly allowed to play any rugby, Scarlets were nevertheless a shadow of the exciting side that topped a group containing three-times champions Toulon. \nAnother try seemed inevitable and this time it was Sexton who scored to move past the 600-point mark in Europe. \nFormer Leinster lock Tadhg Beirne grabbed a consolation try at the death for Scarlets as the hosts eased into their first final since 2012, the only time two Irish teams have competed for the title. \nIt could be another all-Irish affair in Bilbao on May 12 if Leinster’s old rivals Munster can beat France’s Racing 92 in Sunday’s second semi-final. \n“We came up against the best side in Europe today and they completely strangled us,” Scarlets captain Ken Owens said. “It’ll take a very good side to beat them.” Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T20:19:35.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
