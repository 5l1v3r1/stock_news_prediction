It has tried to buy Sainsbury’s before with other partners.\nSupermarkets' market share graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2cZQkWZ\nBritain’s big grocers, including No. 4 player Morrisons , have been losing share to German discounters Aldi and Lidl and must also deal with growing demand for internet grocery shopping and the march of Amazon.\nTesco last month moved to strengthen its grip on the UK food sector, completing the 4 billion-pound purchase of wholesaler Booker.\nBernstein Research said in a research note the Tesco-Booker deal made Sainsbury & Asda fall further behind on scale.\nTogether their combined market share would slightly surpass Tesco’s market share, which would drive buying synergies, it said in the note.\nThe source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, did not comment on whether the deal would dilute QIA’s stake in Sainsbury’s or the size of its potential stake in the combined group.\nQIA’s chief executive was recently quoted as saying the fund has not been liquidating foreign assets to support the Gulf state’s banking system since other Arab countries imposed an embargo on Qatar last June.\nSheikh Abdullah bin Mohamed bin Saud al-Thani said the fund, with assets unofficially estimated at about $300 billion, did not need to sell foreign assets to raise cash, and indeed was about to announce “the deal of a lifetime”.
