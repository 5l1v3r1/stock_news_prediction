The S&P 500 fell 0.58 percent to 2,619.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.61 percent to 6,964.33.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility jumped to more than 1-week high to 19.41 points.\nViacom rose 1.94 percent after the media company reported better-than-expected quarterly results.\nTwitter reversed course to trade down 4.9 percent after reporting its second profitable quarter and topping Wall Street estimates for revenue and monthly active users.\nFacebook which is set to report after market closes on Wednesday, was down 1.55 percent.
