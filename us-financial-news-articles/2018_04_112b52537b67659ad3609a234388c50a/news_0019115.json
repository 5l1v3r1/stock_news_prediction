That means the way is free for the parties to extend it.” \nAhold hasn’t actually made up its mind yet, he said but “we are convinced it won’t conflict with the law if we decide to extend” the agreement. \nAhold Delhaize’s position has also been challenged by Dutch shareholders’ association VEB, which spoke out against management’s position at the annual meeting. \n“In all the years (since 2003) you’ve misled shareholders into believing that they actually had a say in extending the option. We regret this and consider it poor governance,” the VEB’s Jasper Jansen said. \nAhold Delhaize has said it will allow discussion of the matter, but no vote. \nIn 2016, the company briefly put an extension of the takeover defence on the agenda for that year’s annual meeting, but retracted it after shareholder corporate governance advisory group Glass Lewis advised a “no” vote. \nBerjal, whose fund holds less than 1 percent of Ahold Delhaize’s shares, said she had the support of investors owning at least 10 percent of the company’s shares, and that they would pool legal costs, if necessary. \n“We believe management has done a really good job,” she said referring to the integration of Delhaize, which Ahold purchased for 9.3 billion euros ($11.5 billion) in 2015. \n“I trust them. But I don’t want them to do nothing (become complacent) because they are protected.” \n($1 = 0.8076 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:37:24.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
