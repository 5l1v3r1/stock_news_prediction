Bloomberg News/Angel Garcia Good morning. The ethical use of artificial intelligence will be critical as the technology becomes more prominent, the European Commission said on Wednesday, outlining a strategy that advocates for a unified approach and increased investment from government and the private sector.\nThe commission pledged to produce ethics guidelines for the use of AI by the end of this year; a panel of experts the commission began to assemble last month will do the work. Ethical use of AI could be a competitive advantage for the European Union, said the commission. “Artificial intelligence may raise new ethical and legal questions, related to liability or potentially biased decision-making,” it said. “New technologies should not mean new values.”\nThe commission recommended the EU spend at least €20 billion ($24.3 billion) between now and the start of 2021 to support AI research and innovation, with an additional €20 billion a year after that. The investments are meant to spur additional spending through public-private partnerships. The EU lags behind North America and Asia in its AI investments, said the commission.\nThe EU is putting its money where its mouth is on AI, which is fostering disruption of the kind seen when electricity was commercialized, said Andrea Bonime Blanc, chief executive of GEC Risk Advisory and co-author of the new book “The Artificial Intelligence Imperative.”\nThe commission’s announcement underscores the importance of public-private partnerships to support new technology development, she said. “It also confirms what the Europeans do best, identifying and connecting public policy to key environmental, social and governance issues, risks and opportunities by focusing on the social impacts and ethical implications and business opportunities that AI presents,” said Ms. Bonime Blanc.\nOrganizations must understand AI will disrupt them and should look for ways to integrate AI into their strategies, she said. “Governments must provide not only leadership on AI in terms of vision but incentives for R&D to empower the development of new technologies,” said Ms. Bonime Blanc.\nThe commission needs to implement a strategy that fosters trust in the use of AI systems by organizations and people while providing regulatory oversight that isn’t so severe it stifles innovation, said Liam Benhan, vice president of government and regulatory affairs for IBM Europe.\nThat means making understandable how AI systems operate, what data such systems are using to reach their conclusions and why those particular data sets were chosen—all of which falls under the topic of “explainability,” said Mr. Benham. The panel also will have to determine how to root out bias from AI systems.\n“The EU will be asking big questions about what it will take to make an AI system trustworthy and accountable,” said Mr. Benham. “The bottom line is if people or companies don’t trust AI systems they are going to be very reluctant to take them up.”\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nCanada seeks to boost money-laundering compliance.
