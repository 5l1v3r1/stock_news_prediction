It has cut the rate twice this year by a total of 75 basis points.\nAnnual inflation in the oil-rich Central Asian nation accelerated to 6.6 percent in March from 6.5 percent in February. But the central bank said it could slow later this year because of low inflation in countries with which Kazakhstan trades, weak domestic consumption and low global food prices.
