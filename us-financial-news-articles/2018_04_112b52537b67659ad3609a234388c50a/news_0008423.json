More than 80 percent of the arrivals are women and children, with many in poor health, said the IFRC.\n“Most arrive exhausted, traumatised and with limited personal belongings,” said Robert Kwesiga, secretary general of the Uganda Red Cross Society.\n“Their children lack even the most basic clothing.”\nThe influx has placed “unprecedented strain” on health facilities not used to accommodating refugees, the IFRC said.\nPeople are sleeping back-to-back in makeshift hangars as reception centres along the shore of the lake are overwhelmed, according to medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, which said the risk of a measles outbreak in the camps is also high.\nThe United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) expects at least 200,000 refugees to reach Uganda from Congo’s Ituri region this year, after clashes between the Lendu and Hema people ended 15 years of relative peace in the area.\nCongo is also dealing with its worst cholera outbreak in decades, which killed more than 1,000 people last year.\nAs of last month, cases in the capital Kinshasa were declining but the situation remained “alarming”, according to the World Health Organization.\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Katy Migiro.
