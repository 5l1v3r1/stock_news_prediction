First quarter 2018 revenue was up approximately 7 percent compared to non-GAAP revenue in the first quarter of last year, which excluded the one-time impact from a change in revenue recognition to the \"sell-in\" method from the \"sell-through\" method. First quarter 2018 revenue was approximately flat as compared to revenue in fourth quarter of 2017.\n\"We delivered strong revenue and margin performance in the first quarter. We are seeing an upwards inflection in long-term demand for our products, driven by strengthening engagement with our customers on their long-term strategic projects and broad-based acceptance of our products for automotive and industrial markets,\" said Keith Jackson, president and CEO of ON Semiconductor. \"Along with robust revenue performance, we continue to deliver impressive margin performance driven by solid execution, improving mix, and operating leverage. We continue to make strong progress towards our target financial model.\"\n\"Sustained demand has put pressure on the semiconductor industry's supply chain. We are pro-actively investing in our operations to further strengthen our industry leading cost structure and to ensure supply for our customers.\"\nFirst Quarter Results (GAAP)\n(in millions, except per share data)\n1Q 2018 1Q 2017* Year-Over-\nYear Change\n4Q 2017* Sequential\nChange\nRevenues $ 1,377.6 $ 1,436.7 (4 )% $ 1,377.5 — % Gross Profit $ 517.4 $ 503.1 3 % $ 516.5 — % Operating Income $ 185.7 $ 183.1 1 % $ 167.5 11 % Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation $ 139.6 $ 78.2 79 % $ 529.9 (74 )% Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.31 $ 0.18 72 % $ 1.22 (75 )% Diluted Share Count 444.2 425.8 4 % 433.3 3 % First Quarter Results (Non-GAAP)\n(in millions, except per share data) 1Q 2018 1Q 2017* Year-Over-\nYear Change\n4Q 2017* Sequential\nChange\nRevenues $ 1,377.6 $ 1,281.6 7 % $ 1,377.5 — % Gross Profit $ 517.4 $ 453.9 14 % $ 516.5 — % Operating Income $ 216.7 $ 168.9 28 % $ 211.1 3 % Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor Corporation $ 170.7 $ 114.3 49 % $ 167.3 2 % Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.40 $ 0.27 48 % $ 0.39 3 % Diluted Share Count 431.6 425.8 1 % 429.9 — % First Quarter Key Cash Flow Items\n(in millions) 1Q 2018 1Q 2017* Year-Over-\nYear Change\n4Q 2017* Sequential\nChange\nCash Taxes $ 19.1 $ 18.4 4 % $ 18.9 1 % Operating Cash Flow $ 226.5 $ 208.5 9 % $ 224.3 1 % Free Cash Flow $ 127.0 $ 155.8 (18 )% $ 48.6 161 % * Prior period amounts have been adjusted for the retrospective adoption of ASU 2017-07 - “Improving the presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost” (“ASU 2017-07”).

SECOND QUARTER 2018 OUTLOOK\nBased on product booking trends, backlog levels and estimated turns levels, the Company anticipates that total revenue in the second quarter of 2018 will be approximately $1,405 to $1,455 million. The outlook for the second quarter of 2018 includes anticipated stock-based compensation expense of approximately $24 million to $26 million. Net cash paid for income taxes is expected to be $11 million to $15 million.\nThe following table outlines ON Semiconductor's projected second quarter of 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP outlook.\nTotal ON Semiconductor\nGAAP\nSpecial\nItems ***\nTotal ON Semiconductor\nNon-GAAP****\nRevenue $1,405 to $1,455 million $1,405 to $1,455 million Gross Margin 37.0% to 39.0% 37.0% to 39.0% Operating Expenses $333 to $351 million $28 to $32 million $305 to $319 million Other Income and Expense (including interest expense), net $32 to $35 million $8 to $9 million* $24 to $26 million Diluted Share Count ** 445-447 million 13 to 15 million 432 million * Convertible Notes, Non-cash Interest Expense is calculated pursuant to FASB's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 470: Debt. ** Diluted share count can vary as a result of, among other things, the actual exercise of options or vesting of restricted stock units, the incremental dilutive shares from the Company's convertible senior subordinated notes, and the repurchase or the issuance of stock or convertible notes or the sale of treasury shares. In periods in which the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $18.50, the non-GAAP diluted share count and non-GAAP net income per share includes the impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with our 1.00% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $18.50 and $25.96, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.00% convertible notes. In periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $20.72, the non-GAAP diluted share count and non-GAAP net income per share includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.625% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $20.72 and $30.70, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.625% convertible notes. Both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted share counts are based on the Company’s stock price as of Apr. 29, 2018. *** Special items may include: amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up; purchased in-process research and development expenses; restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill impairment charges; gains and losses on debt prepayment; non-cash interest expense; actuarial (gains) losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; and certain other special items, as necessary. These special items are out of our control and could change significantly from period to period. As a result, we are not able to reasonably estimate and separately present the individual impact or probable significance of these special items, and we are similarly unable to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures. The reconciliation that is unavailable would include a forward looking income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows in accordance with GAAP. For this reason, we use a projected range of the aggregate amount of special items in order to calculate our projected non-GAAP operating expense outlook. **** We believe these non-GAAP measures provide important supplemental information to investors. We use these measures, together with GAAP measures, for internal managerial purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when taken together with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures that we also provide in our releases, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names.

Management does not consider the effects of these items in evaluating the core operational activities of ON Semiconductor. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally to make strategic decisions, forecast future results and evaluate ON Semiconductor’s current performance. In addition, we believe that most analysts covering ON Semiconductor use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate ON Semiconductor's performance. Given management’s and other relevant use of these non-GAAP measures, ON Semiconductor believes these measures are important to investors in understanding ON Semiconductor’s current and future operating results as seen through the eyes of management. In addition, management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in enabling them to better assess changes in ON Semiconductor’s core business across different time periods. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered alternatives or necessarily superior to GAAP financial data and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures, even if they have similar names.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income before interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense and special items. We use the adjusted EBITDA measure for internal managerial evaluation purposes, as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons and as a performance metric for the vesting/release of certain of our performance-based equity awards. SEC Regulation G under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and other federal securities laws regulate the use of financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We believe this measure provides important supplemental information to investors. However, we do not, and you should not, rely on non-GAAP financial measures alone as measures of our performance.\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nThe use of non-GAAP revenue allows management to evaluate, among other things, the revenue from the Company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of special items such as the impact of the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales implemented in the first quarter of 2017. In addition, non-GAAP Revenue it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nThe use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin allows management to evaluate, among other things, the gross margin and gross profit of the Company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally speaking, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up and the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales. In addition, it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of revenue of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Operating Margin\nThe use of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin allows management to evaluate, among other things, the operating margin and operating income of the company’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally speaking, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up, the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales, amortization and impairments of intangible assets, third party acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring charges and certain other special items as necessary. In addition, it is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nNon-GAAP Net Income Attributable to ON Semiconductor and Diluted Earnings Per Share\nThe use of non-GAAP net income attributable to ON Semiconductor and diluted earnings per share allows management to evaluate the operating results of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis, independent of non-cash items including, generally, the amortization and impairments of intangible assets, expensing of appraised inventory fair market value step-up, the impact from the change in revenue recognition on distributor sales, restructuring, gains and losses on debt prepayment, non-cash interest expense, actuarial (gains) losses on pension plans and other pension benefits, third party acquisition and divestiture related costs, tax impact of these items and other non-GAAP adjustments and certain other special items, as necessary. In addition, these items are important components of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process, as they are used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, setting targets and forecasting future results. Management presents these non-GAAP financial measures to enable investors and analysts to understand the results of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses and, to the extent comparable, to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies in our industry.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe use of free cash flow allows management to evaluate, among other things, the ability of the Company to make interest or principal payments on its debt. Free cash flow is defined as the difference between cash flow from operating activities and capital expenditures disclosed under investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Free cash flow is not an alternate to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. It is an important component of management’s internal performance measurement and incentive and reward process as it is used to assess the current and historical financial results of the business and for strategic decision making, preparing budgets, obtaining targets and forecasting future results. Management presents this non-GAAP financial measure to enable investors and analysts to evaluate our revenue generation performance relative to the direct costs of operations of ON Semiconductor’s core businesses.\nDiluted Share Count\nIn periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $18.50, the non-GAAP diluted share count includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.00% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $18.50 and $25.96, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.00% convertible notes.\nIn periods when the quarterly average stock price per share exceeds $20.72, the non-GAAP diluted share count includes the anti-dilutive impact of the Company’s hedge transactions issued concurrently with the 1.625% convertible notes. As such, at an average stock price per share between $20.72 and $30.70, the hedging activity offsets the potentially dilutive effect of the 1.625% convertible notes.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180429005041/en/\nON Semiconductor\nKris Pugsley, 312-909-0661\nCorporate/Media Communications\nkris.pugsley@onsemi.com\nor\nParag Agarwal, 602-244-3437\nVice President Investor Relations and Corporate Development\ninvestor@onsemi.com\nSource: ON Semiconductor Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180429005041/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&esheet=51797353&newsitemid=20180429005041&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&index=1&md5=06f8c4e1416a189454121e067055c543", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&esheet=51797353&newsitemid=20180429005041&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onsemi.com&index=2&md5=6d537727de2bdc5bd1c6b6f2dc0a2bba"], "published": "2018-04-29T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T22:41:12.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
