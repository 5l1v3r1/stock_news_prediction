We want to find a good reform path together,” one of the participants said on Wednesday. \nMerkel’s remarks to her parliamentary bloc tread a careful line between Macron’s drive for bold euro zone reform and her conservatives’ push to retain scrutiny of any EMF such that German taxpayers do not end up funding profligate states.
