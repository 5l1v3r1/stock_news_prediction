The European Central Bank is stuck in a corner. If they look to normalise rates, the euro will just shoot up and they’re finding it hard to successfully talk down the euro,” said Ion-Marc Valahu, fund manager at Geneva-based firm Clairinvest.\nThe French survey echoed a similar finding in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, with data on Tuesday also showing that German business confidence had deteriorated for a fifth consecutive month in April.\nFrench industrial morale has edged lower after hitting a 17-year high in January.\nEconomic and business morale have hit multi-year highs since President Emmanuel Macron’s election last year, but analysts warn that a strong euro is making it harder for European firms to sell their goods overseas.\nFrench tyre maker Michelin said this week that the strong euro had contributed to a decline in its revenues during the first quarter of this year. Its shares fell by more than 1 percent on Tuesday.\nFor details from INSEE: here\nFor a graphic: reut.rs/2DErm7G (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta Editing by Richard Lough and Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T11:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T00:57:05.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
