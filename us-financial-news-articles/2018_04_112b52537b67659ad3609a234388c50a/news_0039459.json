But the agency said there was a risk of SOEs’ financial strength materially worsening to the point that it could hurt state finances.\nS&P cautioned against the same issue last month and the government has said it would monitor liquidity risks of SOEs, especially those in construction and power sectors.\nThere were also safety concerns that led to the government suspending a number of road and rail construction projects for a short evaluation earlier this year.\nAmong the projects expected to be dropped are railways in Kalimantan and South Sumatra and several airport and sea port projects in Java.\n“There are projects that have land (acquisition) problems, investor problems, and even there are problems related to the feasibility of the project itself,” Transportation Minister Budi Karya Sumadi told reporters.\nNasution said the next government was welcome to reassess and resume the projects, if deemed necessary.\n$1 = 13,772 rupiah Reporting by Agustinus Da Costa and Gayatri Suroyo; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:27:49.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
