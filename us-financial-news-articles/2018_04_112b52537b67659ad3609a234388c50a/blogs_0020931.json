Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testimony before Congress sent the social media giant's stock to two-year highs and took a number of technology names up with it. \n\"Here's the bottom line: when we look at the world and the stock market, we have to recognize that what matters right now is that the president of China and the president of the United States get along and there will be no war, trade or otherwise,\" Cramer concluded. \nAnd, although he admitted that market-watchers will soon be swamped with concerns about interest rates and earnings shortfalls, the \"Mad Money\" host argued that the pent-up demand for stocks remains constant. \n\"The idea that we could have earnings cut by the government ... is something that no one expected from Trump a few months ago, and today we got a sense that maybe we're back to the joyful days of 2017 when you just bought stocks and watched them go higher,\" Cramer said.
