The Warriors made 15 of their 31 3-point attempts, while the Spurs shot just 4-for-28.\nIguodala finished with 14 points, while JaVale McGee and David West added 10 apiece for Golden State, which won its 11th consecutive home playoff game.\nAldridge, held to 14 points in Game 1, rebounded with 11-for-21 shooting and 12-for-12 accuracy from the foul line.\nPatty Mills had 21 points, Rudy Gay and Gasol 12 apiece, and Manu Ginobili 10 for the Spurs, who had the worst road record in the regular season among all the playoff teams.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:14:57.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
