Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “believes,” “expects,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “intends,” “trends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects” or “anticipates” or similar expressions that concern our strategy, plans, expectations or intentions. Any and all statements made relating to the expectations for our anticipated benefits from recent acquisitions, the macroeconomic outlook for our markets, potential acquisition activity, our estimated and projected earnings, margins, costs, expenditures, cash flows, sales volumes and financial results are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual results may differ expected. We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and, of course, it is impossible to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.\nIn light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that the results or conditions described in such statements or our objectives and plans will be achieved. Important factors could affect our results and could cause results to differ expressed in our forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the factors discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017. Such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov .\nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006931/en/\nMr. Noel Ryan\nVice President, Investor Relations\nSummit Materials, Inc.\nnoel.ryan@summit-materials.com\nSource: Summit Materials, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.summit-materials.com%2F&esheet=51796593&newsitemid=20180426006931&lan=en-US&anchor=investors.summit-materials.com&index=1&md5=0380c70e77465c302ccd42e72cce3074", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51796593&newsitemid=20180426006931&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=3&md5=0f4d2363de41a065091a1c9e0511e770", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.summit-materials.com&esheet=51796593&newsitemid=20180426006931&lan=en-US&anchor=www.summit-materials.com&index=2&md5=492140dd2afaa8530519dd554977afe5", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006931/en/"], "published": "2018-04-27T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:35:12.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
