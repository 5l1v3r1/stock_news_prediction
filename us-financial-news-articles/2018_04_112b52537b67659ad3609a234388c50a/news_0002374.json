Such statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results, our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations, products and services; and other statements identified by words such as \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"estimated,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"projection,\" \"outlook\" or words of similar meaning. Such forward-looking statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of our management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond our control. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements. SiriusXM is providing non-GAAP information on a prospective basis that excludes certain items because of the nature of these items and the impact they have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends. We believe investors find these Non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating our core trends because they provide a direct view of our underlying contractual costs. This information should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for or superior to, our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, SiriusXM's Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures by other companies. SiriusXM does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA guidance to Net income or Free cash flow guidance to Net cash provided by operating activities because it does not provide guidance for the reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA to Net income, which includes the provision for income taxes, interest expense and other income, nor does the Company provide guidance for the reconciling items between Free cash flow to Net cash provided by operating activities, which includes additions to property and equipment. As items that impact Net income and Net cash provided by operating activities are out of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, the Company is unable to provide such guidance as the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, a reconciliation to Net income and Net cash provided by operating activities is not available without unreasonable effort.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: our substantial competition, which is likely to increase over time; our ability to retain subscribers or increase the number of subscribers, which is uncertain; our ability to profitably attract and retain subscribers as our marketing efforts reach more price-sensitive consumers is uncertain; the security of the personal information about our customers; interference to our service from wireless operations; we engage in substantial marketing efforts and the continued effectiveness of those efforts are an important part of our business; consumer protection laws and their enforcement; our failure to realize benefits of acquisitions or other strategic initiatives; unfavorable outcomes of pending or future litigation; the market for music rights, which is changing and subject to uncertainties; our dependence upon the auto industry; general economic conditions; existing or future government laws and regulations could harm our business; failure of our satellites would significantly damage our business; the interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems; rapid technological and industry changes; failure of third parties to perform; our failure to comply with FCC requirements; modifications to our business plan; our indebtedness; our studios, terrestrial repeater networks, satellite uplink facilities or other ground facilities could be damaged by natural catastrophes or terrorist activities; our principal stockholder has significant influence over our affairs and over actions requiring stockholder approval and its interests may differ from interests of other holders of our common stock; we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules; impairment of our business by third-party intellectual property rights; and changes to our dividend policies which could occur at any time. Additional factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and available at the SEC's Internet site ( http://www.sec.gov ). The information set forth herein speaks only as of the date hereof, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update any forward looking statements as a result of developments occurring after the date of this communication.\nSource: SiriusXM\nInvestor Relations contact:\nHooper Stevens\n212-901-6718\nhooper.stevens@siriusxm.com\nChris Leal\n212-584-5236\nchris.leal@siriusxm.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-to-announce-first-quarter-2018-results-300623417.html\nSOURCE Sirius XM Holdings Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-to-announce-first-quarter-2018-results-300623417.html", "https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2095409-1&h=4026414469&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siriusxm.com%2FLogosAndPhotos&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siriusxm.com%2FLogosAndPhotos", "http://www.siriusxm.com/LogosAndPhotos"], "published": "2018-04-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T19:10:40.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
