The UK houses some of the biggest pharma companies out there, so naturally it’s going to be involved,” London Capital Group’s Lawler said. \nLikewise shares in British bus and rail operator FirstGroup jumped around 7 percent after a takeover offer from U.S. private equity firm Apollo Global Management, while Playtech was up 8.5 percent after it bought a stake in Italian betting and gaming firm Snaitech for 846 million euros ($1.05 billion). \nA series of well-received earnings updates also added fuel to British mid caps. \nShares in retailer Dunelm rose 10.8 percent after it reported a jump in third-quarter online sales which boosted revenue growth. \nBritish retailers have come under pressure as they have grappled with the popularity of online shopping at a time when consumers are cutting back on spending due to a rise in inflation. \nTravel group Saga was another gainer, up 6.4 percent, after reporting a small rise in full-year pretax profit, while Greene King rallied 9 percent after the pub operator said that it saw annual pretax profit largely in line with market estimates.
