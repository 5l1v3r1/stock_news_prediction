U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues new “waivers” to suspend them on May 12, although it is unclear how fast they would go into effect.\nReporting by Arshad Mohammed; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T23:00:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
