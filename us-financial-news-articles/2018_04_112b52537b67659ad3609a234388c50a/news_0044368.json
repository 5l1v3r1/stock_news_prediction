The distribution primarily represents oil production during the month of January 2018 and natural gas production during December 2017.\nThe following table displays underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month net profits interest calculations.\nUnderlying Sales Volumes Average Price Oil Natural Gas Oil Natural Gas Bbls Bbls/D Mcf Mcf/D (per Bbl) (per Mcf) Current Month 59,699 1,926 397,208 12,813 $ 60.77 $ 2.87 Prior Month 58,843 1,898 480,736 16,025 $ 55.79 $ 2.73 Oil cash receipts for the properties underlying the Trust totaled $3.6 million for the current month, an increase of $0.3 million from the prior month distribution period as a result of an increase in the realized wellhead price compared to the prior month. The realized wellhead price increased $4.98 per Bbl as a result of a 9.5% increase in the NYMEX oil price to $63.61.\nNatural gas cash receipts decreased from $1.3 million in the prior distribution period to $1.1 million in the current month due to a decrease in natural gas volumes, partially offset by an increase in the realized natural gas price. In the prior month distribution calculation, natural gas volumes included multiple periods of natural gas receipts from one well in the Haynesville from the time it came online in September 2017 through November 2017.\nTotal direct operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation expenses, were $2.3 million, a decrease of $0.5 million from the prior month. Capital expenditures increased the net profits attributable to underlying properties by $50,000 due to actual expenditures in prior months being lower than anticipated, resulting in capital adjustments during the current month that increased net profits. Total direct operating expenses and capital expenditures relate to expenses incurred in February 2018.\nAbout Enduro Royalty Trust\nEnduro Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Enduro Resource Partners to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain of Enduro Resource Partners’ properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis.
