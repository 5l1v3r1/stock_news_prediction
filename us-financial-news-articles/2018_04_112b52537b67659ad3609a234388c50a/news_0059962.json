The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Integrated Circuitry Investment Fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nCDB Capital Corp will be the main manager for both the first and second funds, and will invest in the new round, according to one of the people with direct knowledge. Potential investors in the second fund include local government-backed funds and state-owned enterprises, the person said.\nCalls to CDB Capital, the investment arm of China Development Bank, went unanswered on Thursday. The firm did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\nA fourth person said the new fund would focus on three areas: memory chips, integrated circuit design and compound semiconductors such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride.\nChina is hoping to develop local chip technology following the blocking of several high-profile deals for foreign chip firms in the United States and Europe over national security concerns.\nSome earlier estimates have said the second semiconductor fund would raise between 150-200 billion yuan. The sources said this was off the mark and that people were often prone to overestimating the size of the fund to “make it sound scary”.\nThe United States Trade Representative referenced China’s semiconductor roadmap, which includes national funding, in a report that authorized U.S. President Donald Trump to levy up to $100 billion in tariffs against China.\nThe Big Fund has previously invested in some 50 companies in the chip industry, including Hong Kong-listed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp and Yangtze Memory Technologies, a 3D NAND flash chip maker.\n($1 = 6.3232 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Julie Zhu and Kane Wu in HONG KONG and Cate Cadell in SHANGHAI; Writing by Adam Jourdan; Editing by Philip McClellan", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:41:06.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
