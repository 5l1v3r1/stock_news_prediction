Argentina in 1992 blocked imports of U.S. pork, citing concerns over a parasite common in hogs raised outdoors. Most U.S. hogs now are raised indoors. \n\"It's going to be a little slow out of the gate, like every market is. But I think it can really develop into something,\" said meat analyst Brett Stuart, president of Global AgriTrends. \nLast year, Argentina imported $114 million worth of pork, with 88 percent from Brazil, Stuart said. \nA drought in Argentina also provided U.S. farmers with unexpected export opportunities. Soybean buyers in Argentina earlier this week purchased 240,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans, the most in 20 years, after drought cut the crop. \nU.S. imports in Argentina could expand the trade imbalance between the two countries. Argentina had a trade deficit of about $3.1 billion with the United States in 2017, according to government statistics. \nThe United States in May reopened its market to Argentina lemons for the first time in 15 years. However, Argentina has yet to export one lemon to the United States. \nThe United States upheld steep duties on imports of biodiesel from Argentina, penalties that brought such shipments to a virtual halt.
