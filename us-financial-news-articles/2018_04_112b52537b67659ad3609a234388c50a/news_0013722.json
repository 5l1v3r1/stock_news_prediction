The group includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council.\nApril 1\nChina increases tariffs by up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products, from frozen pork and wine to certain fruits and nuts, escalating the dispute in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel. The tariffs were slated to take effect on April 2.\nApril 3\nTrump raises the stakes, proposing 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing’s intellectual property practices. The products represent about $50 billion of estimated 2018 imports.\nApril 4\nChina announces it will impose additional tariffs of 25 percent on 106 U.S. goods including soybeans, autos, chemicals, some types of aircraft and corn products and other agricultural goods. The products targeted by the tariffs were worth $50 billion in 2017, according to a separate statement from the commerce ministry.\nIn Washington, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders notes the tariffs did not go into effect immediately and says she hopes China will change its “unfair trade practices” in a way that will avoid the need for the Trump administration to move forward with announced import tariffs.\nApril 5\nThe World Trade Organization says China sought consultations with the United States, the first step in a WTO dispute, over Washington’s announced tariffs on the $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.\nThe notification to the Geneva-based watchdog triggers a 60-day deadline for the two sides to settle the complaint or face litigation at the WTO by a neutral panel of arbitrators.\nTrump says he has instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China. In a statement, he announces the U.S. Trade Representative has determined that China “has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property.” (Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T04:57:04.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
