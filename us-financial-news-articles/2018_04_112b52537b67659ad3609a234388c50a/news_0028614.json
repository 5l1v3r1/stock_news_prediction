I see a lot of birdies around this course if the weather stays like this so hopefully I can make them.” \nLocal favourite and world number four Jon Rahm started the second round a shot behind Dunne but finished four off the pace with a 68 as he was left cursing a poor showing on the greens, although he remained optimistic about the weekend. \n“It’s a little bitter-sweet just because my ball-striking felt amazing,” said Rahm. \n“I was just getting a little frustrated that I didn’t make putts. I had so many close calls, so many putts that I hit close that just didn’t go in, it’s just incredibly frustrating.” \nWarren also slipped four shots behind Dunne in a four-man group with Rahm, Englishman Robert Rock and Swede Henric Sturehed, while holder Andrew Johnston carded a four-under to finish five shots back in a six-way tie for ninth. \nJohnston, nicknamed ‘Beef’, got the day’s biggest cheer by unearthing Rahm’s ball in long grass on the 15th, sparing the Spaniard a return to the tee as he was awarded a free drop. \nEnglishman Andy Sullivan recovered from a 75 in the first round by carding a 63, the joint-best score on Friday along with that posted by German Macel Schneider, who opened with a 76. \nSullivan and Schneider were just shy of the best ever score at the Spanish Open, Wayne Riley’s 61 in 1988, and their low rounds ensured they made the cut, set at three-under-par.
