Prior to Robby, Nanavati served in Marketing and Partnerships at Apple, and he has built two successful venture-backed startups. Nanavati holds a BSc in Engineering, Computer Systems and Economics from Purdue University.\nWorking with co-founders CEO Rui Li and CTO Dheera Venkatraman from MIT with PhDs in robotics, Nanavati will orchestrate the broader view of Robby to use AI-empowered self-driving robots to change the way goods are moved around and between people, stores and warehouses.\nRobby Technologies introduced the most complete self-driving robots for last-mile delivery in 2016, with its roots from the prestigious YCombinator program. Since then, Robby's first-generation robots have traveled 4000-plus miles and served hundreds of customers across California. Initial customers of Robby have included logistics and delivery companies such as Doordash, Instacart and Postmates.
