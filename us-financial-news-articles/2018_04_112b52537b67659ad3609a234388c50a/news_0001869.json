REUTERS/Umit Bektas “We reached the highest number in our history in exports, $15.1 billion,” Zeybekci said.\nThe Turkish Exporters’ Assembly (TIM) also said in a statement on Sunday that the country’s exports rose 11.5 percent year-on-year in March to exceed $15 billion for the first time.\nIt said exports in the last 12 months had risen 10.5 percent to around $160 billion.\nData from Turkey’s official statistics institute on Friday showed exports stood at $13.18 billion in February. They also showed Turkey’s trade deficit had widened 54.2 percent year-on-year to $5.76 billion.\nTIM President Mehmet Buyukeksi said the assembly was aiming for exports to exceed $170 billion at the end of the year.\nZeybekci also said he expected tourism revenues to reach $51-52 billion in 2018 from around $26 billion in 2017.\nTourism, a major source of funding to plug Turkey’s persistent current account deficit, is recovering from a sharp downturn caused by bomb attacks, diplomatic disputes and a failed coup.\nForeign arrivals surged over 27 percent in 2017 to 32.4 million, largely boosted by Russian tourists after Turkey patched up a rift with Moscow, concerns over security eased and the sector offered discounts to attract customers.\nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen and Behiye Selin Taner; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:28:08.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
