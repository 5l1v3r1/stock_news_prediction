TT News Agency/Jonas Ekstromer via REUTERS/File Photo\nThe prestigious Academy has become embroiled in allegations of sexual misconduct by the husband of one of its members and is reeling over the admission that the names of some prize-winners - the subject of intense speculation and on which many people place bets - were leaked in advance.\n“The Swedish Academy wants to inform that Sara Stridsberg told the academy on April 27 that she wishes to leave her duties as a member,” the committee said in a statement, giving no further details.\nEarlier this month, Academy chief Sara Danius stepped down and four other members also announced their withdrawal from the board in the wake of the controversy. The Swedish Academy's Permanent Secretary Sara Danius and academy member Sara Stridsberg leave the Swedish Academy after a meeting, in Stockholm, Sweden April 12, 2018. Danius said to journalists that she would leave her position and the Swedish Academy immediately.

The committee’s selections fascinate and often baffle literature lovers the world over.\nThe 2016 award to American folk singer and troubadour Bob Dylan sharply divided opinion over whether a popular musician should be given an award that had been largely the domain of novelists and playwrights.\nThe financial crimes unit of the Swedish police said on Friday it had begun an investigation into the Swedish Academy, but gave no further information.
