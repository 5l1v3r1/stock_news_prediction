They will have the potential to be weapons of terror,” the researchers said, citing effective bans on previous arms technologies.\n“We urge KAIST to follow this path, and work instead on uses of AI to improve and not harm human lives,” they said.\nAI is the field in computer science that aims to create machines able to perceive the environment and make decisions.\nThe letter, also signed by top experts on deep learning and robotics, was released ahead of next Monday’s meeting in Geneva by 123 U.N. member countries on the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons, which critics describe as “killer robots”.\nWalsh told Reuters there were many potential good uses of robotics and artificial intelligence in the military, including removing humans from dangerous task such as clearing minefields.\n“But we should not hand over the decision of who lives or dies to a machine. This crosses a clear moral line,” he said. “We should not let robots decide who lives and who dies.” (Reporting by Andrea Shalal Editing by Alison Williams)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:11:52.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
