All new houses in Robson’s Sun Lakes, Ariz., improvement are Energy Star-certified, a federal measure of excessive energy effectivity that takes under consideration such options as insulation, constructing supplies and window varieties. \nRobson communities additionally design their landscaping and golf programs to scale back water runoff and evaporation, and have their very own wastewater-treatment crops that reclaim and reuse water. According to the corporate, using reclaimed water reduces the price of irrigating the golf course and group landscaping for every group by 50%. \nEnvironmentally pleasant designs have develop into essential to compete, says \nMarshall Gobuty, \ndeveloper and majority proprietor of Mirabella, a 55-plus group underneath development in Bradenton, Fla. To that finish, Mr. Gobuty and different builders are more and more pursuing so-called LEED certification, an official stamp of approval from the U.S. Green Building Council that claims a constructing or improvement meets the council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design requirements. LEED certification requires assembly an extended listing of circumstances, together with proximity to transportation, water effectivity, energy utilization and sustainable supplies. \nMirabella has acquired LEED certification for all the 90 villas it has constructed thus far (out of a complete 160 to be constructed.) Energy-efficient options within the villas embrace LED lighting, double-pane vinyl home windows and in depth insulation. For the final 25 houses to be constructed, there additionally can be a group charging station for electrical automobiles and photo voltaic panels. \nMahesh Ramanujam, \npresident and chief government of the U.S. Green Building Council, says his group has seen a gentle uptick in 55-plus communities in search of LEED certification in recent times. Last yr, 24 developments acquired LEED certification, and 16 are already within the course of thus far this yr, he says. Mr. Ramanujam says his group expects that the variety of tasks being licensed will double annually over the subsequent 5 years. \nLEED-certified tasks see a mean 25% discount in energy prices, says Mr. Ramanujam. \nAt Mirabella, Mr. Gobuty says LEED certification has added 12% to 14% to every licensed residence’s value. But, once more, within the firm’s view, that additional value pays for itself. All however 22 of the venture’s deliberate 160 villas have been bought. \nMr. Gobuty says he’s additionally creating a 55-plus group in Ellenton, Fla., that may function 600 net-zero-energy houses, a kind of residence that’s largely energy-self-sufficient. In net-zero-energy houses, the whole quantity of energy utilized in a yr roughly equals the quantity of energy created on website—principally by means of use of photo voltaic panels. Thus, in concept, relying on the utility, residents of net-zero-energy houses might not should pay an electrical invoice. \nMeanwhile, it isn’t simply 55-plus communities which are specializing in inexperienced living. There can also be a rising motion in senior housing generally known as cohousing, by which householders have their very own models however share a standard living area and different assets. Currently, there are a few dozen senior cohousing communities within the U.S., based on the Cohousing Association of the U.S. \nCharles Durrett, \na Nevada City, Calif., architect who focuses on cohousing models, says “living lighter on the planet” is an enormous objective for each senior cohousing group he encounters. \nAt \nVillage Hearth Cohousing , \nunderneath development in Durham, N.C., houses shall be clustered on 15 acres, preserving 10 acres of inexperienced area. \nPat McAulay, a member of that group, says that though boomers have all the time valued environmental sustainability, “lots of us ended up strolling the traditional company path. \n”Cohousing,” Ms. McAulay says, “gives us the chance to go back to those things that were really important to us when we were younger. It gives us a chance to redeem ourselves.” \nMs. Halpert is a author in Michigan.
