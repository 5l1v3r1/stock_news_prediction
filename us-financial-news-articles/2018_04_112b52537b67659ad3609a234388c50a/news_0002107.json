We accomplished our goals for the year in revenue, cash sales, international expansion, and customer fulfillment growth, and our ERP implementation, and made significant strides in new brand development and enhanced course delivery capabilities. Of prime importance, we also successfully extended the term of the 2013 License Agreement with RDOC and settled litigation where we received a net amount from the settlement of $4.3 million,” said Anthony Humpage, Legacy Education Alliance CEO. “As we embark on our 25 th year of service, we are thrilled to continue our leadership as a provider of practical, high-quality, and value-based educational training on the topics of personal finance, entrepreneurship, real estate, and financial markets investing strategies and techniques. We continue to experience growing traction with international expansion as evidenced by continued strong growth in our Other Foreign Markets segment. Our goals for 2018 and beyond are continued expansion in the delivery of courses and training offerings that meet the evolving needs of the digitally connected consumer, which we expect will yield margin enhancements, and cost efficiencies with improved digital and online course delivery of our branded offerings. We also expect to begin realizing the benefits of our completed implementation of our new ERP system, which we have long anticipated will drive efficiencies in the operational sales, marketing, accounting/finance and customer service areas of the business. We expect our cash sales will continue to increase throughout 2018, through broader brand development and traction and improved sales and marketing strategies in new markets, which we envision driving improved shareholder value throughout the year. We will continue to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, and 2018 key strategic initiatives with cash on hand and cash provided by our operations,” Mr. Humpage concluded.\nFY 2017 VERSUS FY 2016 RESULTS\nRevenue was $97.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $89.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $8.5 million or 9.5%. The increase was due to increased attendance (i.e. fulfillment) of $6.9 million or 9.2% and the increase in recognition of revenue from expired contracts of $2.0 million or 13.9%, partially offset by the decline in recognition of revenue of $0.4 million, due to the change in our revenue recognition policy with regards to DVD fulfillment. Cash sales were $99.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $86.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $12.4 million or 14.3%. The increase in cash sales was driven primarily by a $5.4 million increase in our Other Foreign Markets segment, a $4.5 million increase in our North America segment and a $2.5 million increase in our U.K. segment.\nTotal operating costs and expenses were $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $86.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $9.2 million or 10.6%. The increase was due to a $6.2 million increase in direct course expenses, a $2.3 million increase in general and administrative expenses, including one-time expenses of $0.8 million for our ERP implementation and related consulting costs of $0.4 million, a $0.4 million increase in royalty expense and a $0.3 million increase in advertising and sales expenses.\nNet income was $4.3 million or $0.19 per basic and $0.18 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net income of $3.9 million or $0.18 per basic and $0.17 per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase in net income of $0.4 million or 10.7%. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted by the increase in revenue primarily due to increased attendance (i.e. fulfillment) of $6.9 million or 9.2% and by the increase in other income of $4.0 million, partially offset by the increase in operating and income tax expenses. Net income was negatively impacted by a $2.9 million increase in income tax expense or $0.14 per basic and $0.13 per diluted common share year over year.\nCASH FLOW AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a period-over-period increase of $7.0 million. This increase was primarily the result of an increase in current liabilities for deferred revenue in 2017 as a result of increased cash sales and the proceeds received from the settlement of litigation.\nOur consolidated capital structure as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 100.0% equity.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nLegacy Education Alliance, Inc. will hold a conference call on Wednesday, April 4, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nTo listen to the conference call, interested parties within the U.S. should dial 1-800-281-7973 or 1-323-794-2093 for international calls, approximately 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.
