The news was initially reported by Bloomberg .\nNeither company disclosed details of the transaction, but one report p u t the value of the deal at $400 million.\nNaked Hub was established in 2015 by developer Grant Horsfield as part of luxury resort firm Naked Group. The company has 10,000 users across 24 locations, WeWork said in a blog post .\nWeWork CEO Adam Neumann said the deal was part of incorporating cities into the working space, as well as buildings. Naked Hub has locations in Shanghai, where it is headquartered, Beijing and Hong Kong.\n\"In Naked Hub, we have found an equal who shares our thinking about the importance of space, community, design, culture, and technology,\" Neumann said. \"Together, I believe we will have a profound impact in helping businesses across China grow, scale, and succeed.\"\nWeWork faces competition from the likes of Belgian firm Regus and U.S. firm Carr. There are also several apps in the market that let workers find office space through an on-demand service.\nLast year, SoftBank announced a $4.4 billion investment in WeWork , backed by both the Japanese firm and its technology-focused Vision Fund. WeWork has been driving expansion into Asia, where demand for co-working spaces is expected to grow significantly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T12:07:58.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
