The U.S. led the draws but was also aided by draws in Singapore,” said U.S. bank Morgan Stanley.\nBeyond OPEC’s supply management, crude prices have also been supported by an expectation that the United States will re-introduce sanctions on OPEC-member Iran.\nOne of the factors that has somewhat held back prices from rising even further has been rising U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.54 million barrels per day, making the United States the world’s second biggest producer of crude oil behind only Russia, which pumps almost 11 million bpd.
