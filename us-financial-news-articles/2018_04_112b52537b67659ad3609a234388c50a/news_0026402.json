Crew Group Inc., Qualcomm Inc. and Xerox Corp. She is often hired to advise companies facing litigation over mergers and acquisitions, as well as in securities actions, governance-related disputes and commercial lawsuits.\nShe’s currently representing Williams Co s. in litigation over a failed merger with rival pipeline operator Energy Transfer Equity LP. A Delaware judge ruled in 2016 that ETE could back out of its merger agreement with Williams Cos., and now the companies are in a dispute over a related breakup fee Williams says it is owed.\nMs. Goldstein, who started at Kirkland on Friday, also represented Barnes & Noble in a successful court battle in 2010 to uphold the company’s creation of a “poison pill” that prevented outside investors from acquiring 20% or more of the bookseller’s shares.\nCravath, among the most elite law firms in the country, is one of few remaining that continue to pay partners according to seniority rather than how much work they bring in. Proponents say such a lockstep system fosters collegiality, but it faces challenges in a legal market now built more around star partners that control large books of business.\nKirkland has hired two other Cravath partners in recent years. Cravath in 2016 also lost M&A partner Scott Barshay to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP\nMs. Goldstein joined Cravath in 1987 and in 1994 became the youngest partner ever at age 30.\nMs. Goldstein led Cravath’s litigation department from 2010 until 2016, around the time that deal lawyer Faiza Saeed took over as presiding partner of the firm from Allen Parker, now general counsel at Wells Fargo & Co .\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:53:30.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
