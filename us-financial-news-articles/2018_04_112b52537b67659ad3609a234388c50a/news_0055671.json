Adjusted profit came to 96 cents per share, beating Wa;; Street's per-share expectations by 2 cents, according to Zacks Investment Research.\nRevenue rose 4 percent to $12.56 billion, also topping forecasts, thanks to robust sales of the snacks that PepsiCo makes. Sales from the company's Frito-Lay business in North America rose 3 percent to $3.61 billion.\nCoca-Cola, which released earnings earlier this week, was also able to strengthen drink sales in North America through new products like sugar-free drink in skinny colorful cans.\nPepsiCo stuck to its full-year earnings projections for $5.70 per share, which is roughly in line with analyst expectations.\nShares of PepsiCo Inc., based in Purchase, New York, slipped less than 1 percent before the opening bell Thursday.\nElements of this story were generated by Automated Insights ( http://automatedinsights.com/ap ) using data from Zacks Investment Research.
