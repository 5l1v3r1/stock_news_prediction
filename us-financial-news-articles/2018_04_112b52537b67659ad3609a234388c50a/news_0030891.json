He had been a managing director since December 2009. \nFrost was among the bankers at Morgan Stanley advising Unilever Plc after the Anglo-Dutch household goods company became a takeover target of consumer products peer Kraft Heinz Inc early last year. \nHe also advised Mars Inc in its $9.1-billion acquisition of animal-hospital chain VCA Inc last year.
