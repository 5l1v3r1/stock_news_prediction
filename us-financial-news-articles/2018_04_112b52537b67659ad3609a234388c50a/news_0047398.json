Campaign posters of local candidates are seen ahead of the parliamentary election, in Baghdad, Iraq, April 14, 2018. REUTERS/Khalid Al-Mousily \nIn an audio message released late on Sunday, the militant group’s spokesman accused Iraq’s Shi’ite-led government of being a proxy of Iran and warned that anyone who runs or votes in the May 12 election would be targeted. Iraqi officials have said polling stations will be well protected. \n“We warn you Sunnis of Iraq of these people (Shi’ites) taking power. Polling stations are a target for us, so stay away from them,” said Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajer. \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory in December over Islamic State, which seized a third of Iraq in 2014, but the hardline Sunni militants have reverted to insurgency tactics following the crumbling of their self-declared caliphate.
