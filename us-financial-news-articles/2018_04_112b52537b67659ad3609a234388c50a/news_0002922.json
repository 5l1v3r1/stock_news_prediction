That should increase additional credit available to 7.8 billion rials ($20.3 billion) from 5.2 billion rials, the central bank said.\nThis may do little to boost lending immediately; Oman’s Ubhar Capital noted actual adequacy ratios of all eight listed commercial banks were already several percentage points above the floor.\nBut it said that including other regulatory demands on banks’ capital, the move would ease future pressure on banks at the lower end of the spectrum to raise additional capital.\nLIQUIDITY Other steps aimed to encourage banks to exchange their excess funds with each other, and therefore use available liquidity in the economy more efficiently, rather than sitting on the money.\nBanks can count deposits obtained from other local banks towards their own deposit bases; this should give them more room to lend while obeying a regulatory requirement to limit credit they extend to 87.5 percent of deposit bases.\nThe central bank removed restrictions on how risks related to claims on governments and central banks are weighted in banks’ portfolios. Ubhar Capital said this would lift banks’ calculations of their capital adequacy ratios.\nPrudential limits for banks’ exposure in all currencies for various short-term maturities were increased, in order to let banks manage their liquidity gaps more efficiently — a step which could help to bring down interbank lending rates.\n“This would give banks more flexibility to utilise credit lines available to them with their foreign and local correspondents at a reasonable cost,” the central bank said.\nThe ceiling for banks’ credit exposure to non-residents and placement of their funds abroad was raised to 75 percent of their local net worth from 50 percent to help them better finance “local projects of national importance”.\nIn another move to ease lending conditions, announced last week, the central bank allowed commercial banks to factor in their local interbank money market positions when calculating deposit bases.
