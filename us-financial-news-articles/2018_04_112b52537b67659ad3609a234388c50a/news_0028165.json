Ltd. and Avic International Holding Corporation. \n“Indeni’s contribution to the national petroleum demand in Zambia has, since 2005, been less than 50 percent and this will progressively reduce if nothing is done to increase the production capacity of the plant,” the IDC said. \nWith a design capacity of 1.1 million tonnes per annum and a current output of 850,000 tonnes per annum, Indeni’s production was far short of Zambia’s combined demand of petrol and diesel currently in excess of 1.7 billion litres per annum, it said.
