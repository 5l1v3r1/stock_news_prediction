Journalists use their accreditation cards to prove their identity at other news events.\nThe ministry did not define “fake news” but said complaints about it in print would be referred for determination to the Press Council of India, with suspected cases on television going to the National Broadcasters Association.\nThe term “fake news” has in the past few months become part of the standard repertoire of leaders in several countries to describe media reports and organisations critical of them.\nThe Indian ministry did not mention digital media, although Smriti Irani, the information and broadcasting minister, had earlier said the government would try to frame rules for digital media too.\n“What is (the) guarantee that these guidelines will check fake news?” opposition Congress party leader Ahmed Patel asked in a tweet.\n“Or is it an attempt to prevent genuine reporters from reporting news uncomfortable to the establishment?”\nThe government’s decision also set off alarm bells in Indian media organisations.\nShekhar Gupta, a former editor of the Indian Express newspaper, said it was “a breathtaking assault on mainstream media”, and urged journalists to resist it.\n“This is an attack on the freedom of the press. The draconian order could be misused against genuine journalists,” said Gautam Lahiri, president of the Press Club of India.\n“The government should immediately withdraw this order,” he said, adding that journalists would hold a protest later on Tuesday.
