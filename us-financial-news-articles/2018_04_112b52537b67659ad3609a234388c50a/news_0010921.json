Tavares, whom the Islanders selected with the first overall pick of the 2009 draft, is scheduled to reach free agency on July 1.\nKevin Hayes scored for the Rangers, who have lost eight of 10 (2-6-2). Goalie Ondrej Pavelec made 20 saves.\nHayes put the Rangers ahead 4:25 into the first. Mats Zuccarello set up the goal by dishing to Brady Skjei, whose shot from just inside the blue line bounced off the back boards and to Hayes, who tucked it into the right corner of the net.\nThe Islanders took advantage of a pair of Rangers turnovers to take the lead in the second.\nHickey scored the tying goal, which was set up when Mathew Barzal picked up the loose puck near the right faceoff circle in the Rangers’ zone and skated around the back of the net before reversing course and heading back. He eventually dished to Hickey, whose shot sailed past four players and into the net at the 4:55 mark.\nBeauvillier netted the game-winner fewer than three minutes later. Andrew Ladd swiped the puck from Paul Carey deep in the Rangers’ zone before Brock Nelson picked it up and passed to Beauvillier, who exchanged the puck with Ladd before beating Pavelec in the left corner at 7:27.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:51:55.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
