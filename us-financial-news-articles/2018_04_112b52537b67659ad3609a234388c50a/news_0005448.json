But stocks erased those declines in afternoon trading, as some analysts said knee-jerk selling on worries that protectionist trade policies could slow global economic growth might have been overdone. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 195 points, or 0.8%, to 24228, after dropping as much as 510 points in the opening minutes of trading. The S&P 500 climbed 1%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%.\nDespite initial unease that trade policies could result in higher costs for manufacturers of everything from computer chips to smartphones, leading to a slowdown in corporate activity, some investors said the tariff announcements seem more like negotiating tactics. \n“When people think about it a little bit more, they think it’s not done yet, it’s not played out and it’s only affecting a small part of the economy,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based Globalt Investments. “You do have a lot of skittishness in the market, and people wanting to be on top if there is a change.”\nChina’s tariffs would place 25% duties on major American exports to China including airplanes, autos and soybeans, covering 106 categories of products and affecting $50 billion of goods. The announcement came hours after the Trump administration unveiled plans to impose tariffs of 25% on Chinese products worth $50 billion in addition to the levies introduced on steel and aluminum last month. Retaliatory Chinese levies on U.S. pork and fruit went into effect earlier this week.\nAerospace giant Boeing fell 1.9%, while heavy-machinery firm Caterpillar dropped 0.6%. Some technology firms like semiconductor maker Nvidia , which slid 1%, also took a hit. Microchips are traded heavily between the U.S. and China.\nRecent trade worries have come as unease over stricter regulation and data privacy have dragged down highflying technology and internet stocks that led the market higher in recent months. Facebook shares fell 1.1% after lawmakers said founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg will appear at a House Committee hearing to answer questions on the firm’s handling of user data on April 11.\nSome investors are still concerned that too much of the market’s gains in recent years has been concentrated in a few stocks. Microsoft , Nvidia and the so-called FAANG stocks of Facebook, Amazon.com , Apple , Netflix and Google parent Alphabet are responsible for roughly half the market’s gains since the 2013 “ taper tantrum ,” said Barry Bannister, head of institutional equity strategy at Stifel Nicolaus. \n“That’s a pretty narrow market,” he said. “We’re seeing several things come together at one time. It’s not just trade tensions.”\nStill, widespread selling of big technology and internet stocks moderated Wednesday, with Apple and Netflix climbing. \nSome investors are looking ahead to first-quarter earnings season, which begins in earnest next week . Some think robust profit growth can give stocks a boost moving forward.\nHome builder Lennar and auto retailer CarMax were among the best performers in the S&P 500 Wednesday after reporting earnings. \nPresident Trump says China is forcing U.S. companies to transfer their technology secrets to China. WSJ's Shelby Holliday tells you how. Illustration: Adele Morgan The threat of higher interest rates around the world has also hung over global markets during the recent bout of volatility. Investors are awaiting Friday’s jobs report for the latest reading on the U.S. economy and clues about whether the Federal Reserve will raise short-term borrowing costs two or three more times this year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up to 2.790%, according to Tradeweb, from 2.784% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall. \nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.5%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng declined 2.2%. \nChinese indexes, which closed before the news out of Beijing, appeared unfazed by Washington’s announcement late Tuesday. Shanghai’s composite index ticked down 0.2%.\n—Kenan Machado, Liyan Qi and Lingling Wei contributed to this article.\nMore Analysis: Even After a Tumble, the Stock Market’s Price Isn’t Right Where China’s Tariffs are Hitting Markets Hardest Stock-Picking Comeback is Under Pressure Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T08:39:34.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
