I had to keep a very strong rhythm, trying to keep close to (Ferrari’s Kimi) Raikkonen, to make sure that Sebastian didn’t get close enough, and in the end we did a real...I’m speechless.”\nBefore Sunday, Force India, fourth overall last season, had scored one point and were languishing near the bottom with Williams.\nIn one jump, thanks to Perez’s haul of 15 points, they leapt from ninth to sixth.\nPerez said the result was the fruit of many things coming together but he had no illusions about Force India’s true status.\n“I think our battle is not here, to be honest, it’s the midfield and finally we got plenty of points today with this podium, that we can close up the gap to the cars ahead, to the Renaults,” he said. “I think we were definitely the fourth-best team this weekend.”\nWhile Perez enjoyed his eighth career podium finish, French team mate Esteban Ocon retired on the opening lap after a collision with Raikkonen.\n“I have to say that between the two of them, at the end of the first lap I was feeling rather disappointed. I thought we were in for another difficult day,” Force India deputy principal Bob Fernley told Reuters.
