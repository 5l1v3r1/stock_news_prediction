Baird in Milwaukee.\nBlackRock gained 2.8 percent after the asset manager’s profit rose more than expected. Reports from JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo will kick off the earnings season in earnest on Friday.\nAnalysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.5 percent from a year ago, the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“The market is finally starting to build on itself, earnings are coming. This is the real risk-on type of rally,” Antonelli said.\nAt 12:53 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.52 percent at 24,556.29. The S&P 500 gained 1.12 percent to 2,671.73 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.23 percent to 7,156.18.\nTreasury yields and investor sentiment were also boosted by an upbeat U.S. initial jobless claims report that pointed to sustained labor market strength.\nEight S&P sectors were higher, with the technology sector’s 1.6 percent gain giving the biggest boost to the market.\nOne notable laggard among techs was Facebook. Its shares fell 1 percent following a 5.3 percent gain in the past two days when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on the data privacy scandal.\nDelta Air Lines reported quarterly results that topped estimates in several key metrics, sending its shares 2.84 percent higher and also boosting other airline stocks.\nBed Bath & Beyond shares dived more than 18 percent after the company’s full-year profit forecast missed estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 1.50-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq, for a 2.17-to-1 ratio.
