This supplemental financial measure is not required by GAAP, nor is the presentation of this financial information intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with Asure's earnings results as determined in accordance with GAAP. However, for the reasons described below, management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of Asure's business. Asure's management believes that it is important to provide investors with these same tools, together with reconciliation to GAAP, for evaluating the performance of Asure's business, as it may provide additional insight into Asure's financial results. See the \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income/(Loss) to EBITDA Excluding One-Time Expenses\" table included in this press release for further information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures are presented because management believes they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and others in the evaluation of companies.\nEBITDA, excluding one-time expenses, is calculated by adding income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense to net earnings and excluding certain expenses that management believes to be one time in nature and are not expected to recur on a dollar or per share basis. EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings and other consolidated earnings data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of Asure's profitability.\nGuidance\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA Excluding One-time Expenses:\n$000s Fiscal 2018 Net Income (Loss) $ (1,200 ) to $ (2,000 ) Interest 8,000 to 8,500 Tax 500 to 1,000 Depreciation and Amortization 2,750 to 3,300 Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles 6,750 to 7,800 Stock Compensation 700 to 900 EBITDA 17,500 to 19,500 One-time expenses 2,500 to 3,500 EBITDA excluding one-time expenses $ 20,000 to $ 23,000 About Asure Software\nAsure Software (NASDAQ:ASUR), headquartered in Austin, Texas, offers intuitive and innovative solutions designed to help organizations of all sizes and complexities build companies of the future.
