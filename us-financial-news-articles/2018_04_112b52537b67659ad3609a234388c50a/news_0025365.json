It had been sighted taking off from a base in Syria and was intercepted after it crossed into Israeli territory, the Israeli military said. \nIsraeli planes then struck an Iranian installation in Syria from which, the Israeli military said, the unmanned aircraft had been operated. \nAn F-16, one of at least eight Israeli planes that had been despatched, was hit by a Syrian anti-aircraft missile and crashed in northern Israel.
