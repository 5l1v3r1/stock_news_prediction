Neither did representatives for Mattel in Mexico. \nThe Frida Kahlo Corporation, in an emailed statement, said: “It will continue its activities within the framework of respect for the law and in the exercise of its constitutional rights.” \nThe corporation maintains it received the rights to the artist from Kahlo’s niece Isolda Pineda. \n“Since the relatives of Isolda Pineda have not put forward their claim, within the period established by law and as indicated by the judge, these precautionary measures must be declared unsubstantiated in the coming hours,” the corporation said. \nKahlo’s image and her extensive body of work have been widely commercialized as the artist’s popularity has grown. \nSince her death in 1954, Kahlo, who was married to Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, has been regarded as one of the greatest painters of the 20th century for her moving and intimate self -portraits, reflecting her personal experience of pain and isolation. \nMattel’s Barbie also drew the family’s ire because it lacks the artist’s signature unibrow, which has become a symbol of her feminist stance.
