Israel dismissed the charge. \nThe photographs of the suspects are based on descriptions by witnesses, police chief Mohamad Fuzi Bin Harun told reporters. \nThey show two light-skinned suspects who may be European or Middle Eastern. Both men are about 180 cm with sturdy builds, the police chief said, according to a recording of his comments heard by Reuters. \nBoth suspects are on a high-powered, dark-coloured motorbike which could be a BMW or a Kawasaki. Both are carrying backpacks and have on dark jackets and helmets. \nThe photos showed one suspect wearing a helmet and glasses. \nA forensic examination found that the victim died of multiple injuries to his head and body. Fourteen bullets were found. \n“We will send some of the bullets collected to our analysis experts to determine what kind of weapon was used in this heinous killing,” Mohamad Fuzi said. \nHe said they were not sure whether the men were still in Malaysia. \n“We cant close off our exits and we don’t have any other information apart from the photofit,” he said. \nDeputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said on Saturday the suspects were believed to be Europeans with links to a foreign intelligence agency. \nIsraeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman dismissed claims of Mossad’s role in the murder and said it was likely that Batsh was killed as part of an internal Palestinian dispute. \nBatsh’s family has requested for his body to be buried in Gaza. \nMossad has been accused of several high-profile killings involving Palestinians around the world, although Israel has consistently denied the accusations. \nThe spy agency was accused of executing the murder of Hamas military commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in his hotel room in Dubai in 2010. In 2016, Hamas blamed Mossad for the killing of a Tunisian national it described as one of its drone experts. \nIn recent weeks, tensions have been running high at the Gaza-Israel border as Palestinians have ramped up protests demanding the right to return to homes that are now in Israel. \nIsrael’s use of live fire, killing at least 35 Palestinians, has drawn international criticism. Israel says it is protecting its borders and takes such action when protesters come too close to the border fence. \nIn another mystery killing of a foreigner in Kuala Lumpur, two women, an Indonesian and a Vietnamese, are on trial for murdering the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un by smearing his face with VX, a banned chemical weapon, at the airport in February last year. \n(The story changes “release” to “releases” in headline) Reporting by Praveen Menon and Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Nick Macfie", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T09:25:29.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
