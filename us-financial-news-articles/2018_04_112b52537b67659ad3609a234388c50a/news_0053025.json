S&P 500 e-minis were down 7.25 points, or 0.28 percent, with 203,956 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 10.75 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 71,813 contracts.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility jumped to more than 1-week high to 18.56 points.\nComcast fell 1.9 percent after the U.S. cable company submitted a $31 billion offer for pay-TV group Sky , challenging an already agreed but lower takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox.\nViacom rose 1.23 percent after the media company reported better-than-expected quarterly results.\nTwitter jumped 4.2 percent after reporting its second profitable quarter and topping Wall Street estimates for revenue and monthly active users.\nFacebook which is set to report after market closes on Wednesday, was edged up 0.5 percent.
