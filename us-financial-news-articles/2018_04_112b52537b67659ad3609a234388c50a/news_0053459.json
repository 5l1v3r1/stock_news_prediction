However, von Koskull said he remained confident that net profit would grow in 2018 compared to 2017.\nBoth interest income and commission income, the two most important income lines, were lower year-on-year and below market expectations. Total revenue was boosted by 135 million euros due to a revaluation of a loan portfolio.\nOperating profit for the period was 1.07 billion euros ($1.31 billion) compared with a mean forecast for 1.00 billion seen in a Thomson Reuters poll and a year-ago 1.10 billion.\nNet interest income, which includes income from mortgages and loans to companies, fell to 1.05 billion euros from 1.20 billion a year ago, lower than the expected 1.08 billion.\nCommission income fell to 770 million euros from 866 million a year ago, lower than the expected 825 million.
