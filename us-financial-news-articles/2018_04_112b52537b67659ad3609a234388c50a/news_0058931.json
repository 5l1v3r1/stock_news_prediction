Red Bull said the car was not seriously damaged.\nThe Dutch driver, whose season has been littered with collisions, ended up sixth fastest but still quicker than Ferrari’s championship leader Sebastian Vettel who was 10th but without setting a representative time.\nThe German, winner of the first two races, was 2.2 seconds off the pace.\nTeam mate Kimi Raikkonen, 15th fastest, spent much of the session in the garage with Ferrari working on a power unit problem.\nMexican Sergio Perez was third for Mercedes-powered Force India, 0.833 slower than Bottas, with French team mate Esteban Ocon fifth in a promising sign for a team with only one point so far this season.\nWilliams, the only team yet to score, also showed signs of improvement with Russian Sergey Sirotkin eighth.\nVettel leads Hamilton by nine points in the championship, with the Briton still chasing his first win since last October’s U.S. Grand Prix.\nVerstappen, who collided with Vettel in China two weekends ago in a race the Dutchman could have won, had told reporters in Baku that he planned to drive faster but with more control in future.\nThat resolution was immediately tested when he locked up while braking, with the virtual safety car then deployed as the car was retrieved.\nVerstappen remained a spectator for the rest of the sunny afternoon session.
