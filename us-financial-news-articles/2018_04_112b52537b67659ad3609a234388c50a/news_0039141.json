REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo Spokesmen for the Justice Department and its inspector general’s office declined to comment to Reuters, as did a spokeswoman for McCabe. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington could not be immediately reached.\nSuch a referral does not automatically mean charges will be filed, and it would be up to the U.S. attorney’s office to evaluate the referral and decide whether to prosecute McCabe.\nThe referral, first reported by CNN and the Washington Post, comes nearly one week after the inspector general said it had concluded that McCabe had misled investigators over a decision to break with the FBI’s standard policy and inform a journalist about a probe into the Clinton Foundation in 2016.\nMcCabe, a frequent target of criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump, was fired last month just hours before he was set to retire.\nReporting by Sarah N.
