When the Smith family was confronted with head lice for the first time, and traditional solutions failed, she turned to a proven medical device solution and was so impressed with it that she started a clinic in her hometown.\n“When one of my daughters had head lice, we had to remove her immediately from school until she was nit-free,” Lynn said. “That meant missed work for me, and when treatment after treatment failed, the expenses mounted, my daughter couldn’t go to school, and I couldn’t work. It was extremely frustrating.”\nResearch led her to a Lice Clinics of America treatment center 40-minutes away in Newton. She brought her family of five, and it turned out that three of them had head lice, including Lynn. “Initially I was overwhelmed thinking, how are we going to deal with this? Then they used the AirAllé® medical device, and we were lice-free in two hours.”\nLynn was so impressed she opened Lice Clinics of America - Lowell, located in Chelmsford on the Lowell line, to provide screening, diagnosis, and treatment for people infested with head lice using the AirAllé device. The AirAllé is the only FDA-cleared Class I medical device that kills both head lice and lice eggs using controlled heated air to dehydrate the bugs and their eggs (nits). The device is clinically proven to kill live lice and more than 99 percent of eggs.\n“I have seen first-hand how the many advances that technology has made in the healthcare industry that have truly have made a significant difference in peoples’ lives,” she said. “I’m excited to be a part of that story.”\nMost treatments using the AirAllé take about an hour, and the treatment is guaranteed to be effective. The device has successfully treated more than 350,000 cases of head lice worldwide.\nThe Lowell clinic is located at 1 Courthouse Lane Suite # 7 in Chelmsford, and is open seven days per week, by appointment only. The clinic is managed by Lynn’s sister Peggy Milisci, and daughter Micayla Milisci.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences™, Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nAttachment:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/24957d64-f0d5-4451-8495-20b47e0fe4d3\nLynn Smith Lice Clinics of America 978-649-7577 info@liceclinicslowell.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/24957d64-f0d5-4451-8495-20b47e0fe4d3/en", "http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/24957d64-f0d5-4451-8495-20b47e0fe4d3", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bZvF-cKxAbjVyqIQz1SJZMbsvLxafwexcaWmX95KeOXSy481yz8mj8-FqdgMpv-dSwq8TOdGE25cuQLhgDyGDiXC6NvVvIO2sHEpIh9eypNr4z6OChneIxEfkgQ5Nm9FheYzh3dvTg-UaE7IRZzO2d080Ht-QjW5HaJ_UocyRJCU2lk8ZFBm0uK1_Y9etFljpgZ7kmZTo8h6iGQg2V2XMCjAHIUO54wbd_rcjs_JjfLddsg776ORV6BF9E9tmzcwZTX_Uecs_NvDcgcj08BTJg=="], "published": "2018-04-03T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T00:31:09.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
