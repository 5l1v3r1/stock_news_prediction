Many in our athletic coverage ( Lululemon , Under Armour , and Nike ) have called out international as a main component of growth, particularly driven by China.\"\nThe analyst increased his price target to $16 from $13, implying little change from Friday's closing price of $16.10 over the next 12 months.\nTrussell's first-quarter earnings per share estimate of negative 6 cents is a penny short of Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet data, while his 2019 year-end forecast of positive 34 cents is better than consensus.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T15:58:33.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
