Local governments have been ordered to pay back fees that have been illegally collected from renewable companies.\nTwo grid companies in northwest China are currently being sued by an environmental group for failing to maximise purchases of renewable power, causing more than 100 million yuan ($15.80 million) in lost earnings.\nChina wasted 41.9 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of wind power in 2017 as a result of poor grid connectivity, 12 percent of total wind generation. Wasted solar amounted to 7.3 billion kWh, 6 percent of total generation.\nIn data published this week, the NEA said the situation improved somewhat in the first quarter of 2018, with wind curtailment at 8.5 percent and solar at 4.3 percent.\nThe government is cutting the subsidies available to renewable energy providers after costs have declined over the last decade, but it is looking for other ways to encourage clean energy projects.\nThe NEA said in the notice that it would encourage financial institutions to increase the credit available to renewable energy developers, and would also encourage the issuing of green bonds.\nAuthorities are also now ironing out the details of a mandatory renewable energy quota system that will compel grid firms and big power consumers to acquire a minimum proportion of electricity from clean sources.
