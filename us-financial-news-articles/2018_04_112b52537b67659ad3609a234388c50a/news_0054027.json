I played my best game of the week, but against a top level player,” Nadal told reporters.\n“It’s a good victory against a powerful rival on this surface. I maintained a high intensity throughout the game.”\nGreek 19-year-old Tsitsipas stormed into his first ATP final by beating Spain’s world number 11 Pablo Carreno Busta 7-5 6-3.\n“Tomorrow will be a difficult match against a young player as they always have something special,” added Nadal of his next opponent, who like the Spaniard has reached the final without dropping a set.\nTsitsipas had pulled off the biggest win of his career on Friday by upsetting world number seven Dominic Thiem and was the underdog against Carreno Busta, who is ranked 52 places above him. FLYING START\nThe youngster got off to a flying start as he broke his opponent in the second game and marched into a 4-1 lead. The Spaniard hit back with a break to level at 5-5 but wasted a chance to break again and lost his serve to concede the set.\nTsitsipas, ranked 63rd, broke the 27-year-old for a third time to pull 4-2 ahead in the second and eventually served out the match, collapsing to the ground in elation as he won on his second match point when Carreno Busta hit beyond the baseline.\nTsitsipas becomes the first Greek player to reach an ATP final since 1973 when Nicholas Kalogeropoulos made the final of the now defunct Des Moines Open.\nHe is also the youngest player to reach the Barcelona final since Nadal did so in 2005 aged 18.\n“I have watched millions of his matches on clay. I know the way he is playing and, I think, the way he is going to play against me,” Tsitsipas said.\n“I was preparing for this match already, 10 years (ago). I’m going to go out there, enjoy it and play my best.” (Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ken Ferris and Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T23:37:25.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
