(f/k/a Mantra Venture Group, Ltd.) (the \"Company\") (OTC:SGSI), reported financial results for the 7 month transition period for the new financial year ended December 31, 2017. Roger Ponder, CEO of the Company stated, “Revenue exceeded $5.8 million for the 7-month transition period of our new fiscal year, despite the negative impact of two hurricanes on our Florida and Puerto Rico operations last fall. Revenue in our AW Solutions subsidiary exceeded $10 Million for the calendar year. Results of our newly acquired ADEX Corp subsidiary are not reflected in these numbers. However, revenues for that operation exceeded $20 Million. Our pipeline of sales opportunities continues to grow, putting us in a great position to show strong year-over-year organic growth in 2018.\"\nMr. Ponder continued: “In addition to organic growth of current operations, we continue to vigorously pursue strategic, accretive acquisition opportunities to further improve long-term shareholder value.”\n7 Month Transition Period 2017 Financial Results:\nRevenue for the 7 months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $5.9 million, compared to $0.0 million for the comparable 7 months of 2016. This was the result of increased revenue derived from our AW Solutions acquisition.\nGross profit was 13% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 0% for 2016.\nThe Company had a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $(1.8) million for the seven months ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $(0.9) million for the comparable period of 2016. The increase in net loss during the seven months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the comparable period of 2016 resulted from an increase in selling general and administrative expenses of $0.3 million and an increase in salaries and wages of $1.3 million which were offset by an increase in gross margin of $0.7 million. The increases in salaries and wages and selling, general and administrative expenses were a result of our acquisition of AW Solutions subsidiary in April 2017.\nOur loss from operations of our AW Solutions subsidiary was only $0.1 million, and is unadjusted for the impact from the two hurricanes. Our loss from operations included our corporate overhead of $1.1 million, which included accounting and legal fees related to the acquisition of AW Solutions and legal fees related to our redomicle of the company in the United States from Canada.\nOur operating results for the 7 month transition period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are summarized as follows:\nSeven month transition period\nEnded December 31, 2017 Seven month transition period\nEnded December 31, 2016 Statement of Operations Data: Revenues $ 5,872,457 $ 0 Gross profit 769,105 0 Operating expenses 1,969,698 269,677 Loss from operations (1,200,593 ) (269,677 ) Total other income (expense) (631,543 ) (656,429 ) Net Income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (1,832,136 ) (926,106 ) Balance sheet data for transition period ended December 31, 2017: Cash $ 28,893 Accounts receivable, net 1,473,377 Total current assets 1,543,333 Goodwill and intangible assets, net 2,872,917\nTotal assets 4,505,340 Total current liabilities, excluding derivative liabilities 6,182,628\nDerivative liabilities 4,749,712 Stockholders' (deficit) equity (6,427,000 ) About Spectrum Global Solutions:\nSpectrum Global Solutions operates through its subsidiaries AW Solutions, ADEX Corp and Mantra Energy Alternatives.
