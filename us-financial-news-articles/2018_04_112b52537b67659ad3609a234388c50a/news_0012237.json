Ian Cartwright/Handout via REUTERS Researchers said on Monday the middle bone of an adult’s middle finger found at site called Al Wusta is the oldest Homo sapiens fossil outside of Africa and the immediately adjacent eastern Mediterranean Levant region, as well as the first ancient human fossil from the Arabian peninsula.\nWhile the Nefud Desert is now a veritable sea of sand, it was hospitable when this individual lived - a grasslands teeming with wildlife alongside a freshwater lake.\nOur species first appeared in Africa roughly 300,000 years ago. Scientists previously thought Homo sapiens departed Africa in a single, rapid migration some 60,000 years ago, journeying along the coastlines and subsisting on marine resources, said anthropologist Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Germany.\nThis fossil of an intermediate phalanx bone, 1.2 inches (3.2 cm) long, suggests our species exited Africa far earlier.\n“This supports a model not of a single rapid dispersal out of Africa 60,000 years ago, but a much more complicated scenario of migration. And this find, together with other finds in the last few years, suggests ... Homo sapiens is moving out of Africa multiple times during many windows of opportunity during the last 100,000 years or so,” Petraglia said.\nA researcher works on surveying and mapping of the Al Wusta site in the Nefud Desert in Saudi Arabia in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters April 9, 2018. Klint Janulis/Handout via REUTERS The discovery also shows these people were moving across the interior of the land, not coastlines, Petraglia added.\nNumerous animal fossils were discovered, including hippos, wild cattle, antelopes and ostriches, University of Oxford archeologist Huw Groucutt said. Bite marks on fossilized bones indicated carnivores lived there, too.\nStone tools that hunter-gatherers used also were found.\n“The big question now is what became of the ancestors of the population to which the Al Wusta human belonged,” Groucutt said.\nResearchers look over excavations at the Al Wusta site, Saudi Arabia in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters April 9, 2018.

Did this population die out? Did it survive further south in Arabia, where even today there are mountainous areas with quite high rainfall and coastal regions which receive monsoonal rains?” Groucutt added. “Or did the drying environment mean that some of these people were ‘pushed’ further into Eurasia, as part of a worldwide colonization?”\nThe research was published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.\nReporting by Will Dunham; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T00:04:01.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
