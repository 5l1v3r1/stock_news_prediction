Existing capacity must comply with the new restrictions by Dec. 1.\nFirms that do not meet the new requirements will be subject to punitive measures, including production restrictions, fines and even closures, the document said.\nGuangdong is the location of the 9-million tonne per annum Zhanjiang steel base run by the Baowu Iron and Steel Group. The province produced 28.9 million tonnes of crude steel last year, up 24.7 percent compared to 2016.\nIt is also the home of several major petrochemical complexes and saw total refining volumes reach 51.8 million tonnes in 2017, up 3.1 percent on the year. Cement production also rose 7.7 percent last year to 157.85 million tonnes.\nThe province is a major part of the Pearl river delta, which was one of the few regions to meet China’s national 35-microgram air quality standard in 2017. The environment ministry does not expect the country as a whole to reach the standard until 2035.\nAverage PM2.5 throughout China reached 43 micrograms per cubic meter last year, but stood at as high as 65 micrograms in the heavily industrial northern region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Northern China has already imposed its own “special emissions restrictions” on local enterprises this year.\nChina is currently drawing up a new three-year action plan to tackle pollution after completing all its air quality targets for the 2013-2017 period, but experts have warned that the war on smog is now set to get harder as the country tries to tackle rising ozone levels.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T12:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T12:49:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
