Interest rates are also moving higher. And at some point there is a question how much longer this economic expansion can continue to grow.”\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, finished above 3 percent as the supply of government debt surged due to a revenue shortfall following the massive tax overhaul.\nShares of Boeing rose 4.2percent after the company posted better-than-expected profits amid strong commercial airliner sales, leading it to raise its forecasts after a record 2017.\nHowever, Twitter fell 2.4percent after the social media company said it expects a slowdown in revenue growth and increasing costs, putting a damper on its otherwise upbeat earnings report.\n“It’s not a mystery why these things are happening,” Baumohl said. “Just imagine what would happen if trade tensions picked up. How would that affect Caterpillar? How would the roughly half of S&P 500 stocks that depend on overseas sales?”\nOn Tuesday Caterpillar fell 6.2 percent despite its earnings beat, when investors were spooked by the company’s warning of higher costs.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 59.7 points, or 0.25 percent, to 24,083.83, the S&P 500 gained 4.84 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,639.4 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.62 points, or 0.05 percent, to 7,003.74.\nFacebook was up in after-market trading after the social media company reported revenue that beat Wall Street expectations.\nComcast rose 2.7 percent after the largest U.S. cable company confirmed its $31 billion bid for Sky on the heels of its better-than-expected earnings report.\nSo far, 31 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, 81.2 percent of which came in above consensus estimates. Analysts now expect first-quarter earnings growth of 22 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nOf the 11 major S&P 500 sector indexes, Real Estate, Technology, and Financials ended the session in negative territory.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.37-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.67 billion shares, compared to the 6.75 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2018.
