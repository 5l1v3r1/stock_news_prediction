REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun \nYad Vashem’s “Gathering the Fragments” drive was launched in 2011 and since then the museum has collected some 124,000 artefacts from 11,000 individuals, spokesman Simmy Allen said. \nHe was speaking before the beginning on Wednesday of Israel’s annual Holocaust commemorations, which are officially opened at Yad Vashem.

Last year, the museum received more than 800 objects. \n“We do not turn anything down. Everything is catalogued, and we either take the item itself or, if the family prefers to keep it, scan it instead,” Allen said. \nMany survivors leave items to Yad Vashem in their wills. Living donations are made in the belief that the artefact can be best preserved by the museum. \n“One woman agreed to give us her child’s doll, from the period, on the understanding she would be allowed to come to Yad Vashem a few times a year - just to be with it,” he said.
