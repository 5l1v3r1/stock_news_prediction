Barnes allowed a double to Lindor, who was thrown out at home by second baseman Devon Travis on an infield single by Jose Ramirez.\nZach McAllister (0-2) entered the game in the seventh for Cleveland, replacing Dan Otero, who pitched two clean innings. Randal Grichuk worked a leadoff walk, stole second and took third on a groundout by Travis.\nAndrew Miller replaced McAllister. Grichuk was out at home on pinch hitter Pearce’s groundout to first. Pearce took second on a passed ball and scored on Hernandez’s double to left.\nToronto closer Roberto Osuna pitched the ninth in a non-save situation and retired the side in order with two strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:36:59.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
