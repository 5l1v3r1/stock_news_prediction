Vietnam and four other countries also say they have rights in the sea, believed to have rich deposits of oil and gas. \nVietnam’s coast guard could open fire to “protect sovereignty and sovereign rights in defence and security situations,” said the draft, released on the website of the law making body, the National Assembly. \nThe coast guard could open fire to warn ships operating illegally in Vietnam’s waters if they did not heed its request to halt illegal activities, it added. \nVietnam now allows coast guard officials to open fire only if their lives and safety are threatened, or in the pursuit of offenders and ships at sea who might otherwise escape, or to protect citizens whose lives are at risk. \nThe United States has given Vietnam 12 patrol boats to strengthen the Southeast Asian’s nation maritime surveillance and protection capability. Japan has provided six used patrol boats and promised six new ones. \nVietnam is the country most openly at odds over parts of the disputed South China Sea with China, its biggest trade partner with which it has traditional ties through the Communist parties ruling both single-party countries. \nJust last month Vietnam halted an oil drilling project off its southeastern coast by Spanish energy firm Repsol, following pressure from China.
