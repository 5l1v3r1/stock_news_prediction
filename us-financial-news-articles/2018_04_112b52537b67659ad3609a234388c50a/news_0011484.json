In selecting a white man and long-time Fed insider, they said the search was “exhaustive and inclusive,” published a timeline of the process, and highlighted Williams’ engagement with local communities and international partners.\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell had a bigger hand than predecessors in stressing the need to select someone with monetary expertise, according to people familiar with his role in the process. That suggests Williams, 55, could in effect become the face of the current policy of “gradual” U.S. interest-rate hikes, even as the New York Fed president’s traditional role as financial markets expert could diminish.\nReporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:09:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
