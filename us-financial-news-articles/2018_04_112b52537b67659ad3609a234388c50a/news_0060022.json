Fiscal 2018 third quarter sales increased 20% to a record $3.75 billion compared with $3.12 billion in the prior year quarter. Net income increased to a record $366.1 million compared with $238.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 third quarter earnings per share were also a record at $2.70, compared with $1.75 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted for business realignment expenses and CLARCOR costs to achieve, earnings per share were $2.80, an increase of 33% compared with $2.11 in the prior year quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $904.8 million or 8.6% of sales, compared with $789.3 million or 9.2% of sales in the prior year period, or 11.8% excluding a discretionary pension contribution in fiscal 2017. A reconciliation of earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share and cash flows from operations to cash flows from operations excluding a discretionary pension contribution is included in the financial tables of this press release.\n“We achieved record performance this quarter, supported by broad-based demand improvement across our key end markets and regions,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Tom Williams. “Organic sales increased 8% growing faster than the overall market and positive order trends continued as orders grew 11%. Segment operating margin performance was strong and adjusted EDITDA margins increased 120 basis points to 17.6%. Industrial North America incremental margins were impacted by higher sales volume, which required us to run consolidating plants for longer than expected. Our productivity metrics for these plants improved as the quarter progressed and we expect steady improvement in Industrial North America incremental margins as plant closures continue during the rest of calendar year 2018. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making.”\nSegment Results\nDiversified Industrial Segment: North American third quarter sales increased 25% to $1.8 billion, and operating income increased 23% to $280.7 million compared with $227.4 million in the same period a year ago. International third quarter sales increased 23% to $1.4 billion, and operating income increased 34% to $205.3 million compared with $153.0 million in the same period a year ago.\nAerospace Systems Segment: Third quarter sales increased 4% to $598.4 million, and operating income increased 33% to $106.7 million compared with $80.0 million in the same period a year ago.\nParker reported the following orders for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, compared with the same quarter a year ago:\nOrders increased 11% for total Parker Orders increased 11% in the Diversified Industrial North America businesses Orders increased 8% in the Diversified Industrial International businesses Orders increased 17% in the Aerospace Systems Segment on a rolling 12-month average basis\nOutlook\nFor the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, the company has increased guidance for earnings from continuing operations to the range of $7.76 to $7.96 per share, or $9.95 to $10.15 per share on an adjusted basis.\nFiscal 2018 earnings are adjusted for expected business realignment expenses of approximately $50 million and CLARCOR costs to achieve of approximately $45 million, while savings remain as previously forecasted. A reconciliation of forecasted earnings per share to adjusted forecasted earnings per share is included in the financial tables of this press release.\nWilliams added, “We expect record performance in fiscal year 2018 that will serve as a solid foundation for us to achieve new five year targets that include 19% total segment operating margins and a greater than 10% compound annual growth rate in adjusted earnings per share by fiscal year 2023.”\nNOTICE OF CONFERENCE CALL : Parker Hannifin's conference call and slide presentation to discuss its fiscal 2018 third quarter results are available to all interested parties via live webcast today at 11:00 a.m. ET, on the company's investor information web site at www.phstock.com .

However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. All exclude acquisitions until they can be reflected in both the numerator and denominator. Aerospace comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations. The total Parker orders number is derived from a weighted average of the year-over-year quarterly % change in orders for Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International, and the year-over-year 12-month rolling average of orders for the Aerospace Systems Segment.\nNote on Non-GAAP Numbers\nThis press release contains references to (a) earnings per share and segment operating margins without the effect of business realignment charges, CLARCOR costs to achieve, U.S. Tax Reform adjustments, the gain on sale and writedown of assets, net, and acquisition-related expenses; (b) the effect of business realignment charges, CLARCOR costs to achieve, U.S. Tax Reform adjustments, the gain on sale and writedown of assets, net, and acquisition-related expenses on forecasted earnings from continuing operations per share; (c) and cash flows from operations without the effect of a discretionary pension contribution. The effects of business realignment charges, CLARCOR costs to achieve, U.S. Tax Reform adjustments, the gain on sale and writedown of assets, net, acquisition-related expenses and discretionary pension contribution are removed to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in earnings per share, segment operating margins and cash flows from operations on a comparable basis from period to period. This press release also contains references to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before business realignment charges, CLARCOR costs to achieve, U.S. Tax Reform adjustments, the gain on sale and writedown of assets, net, gain on sale of a product line and acquisition-related expenses. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, we believe that it is useful to an investor in evaluating the results of this quarter versus one year ago.\nForward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks. These statements may be identified from the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “may,” “should,” “could,” “potential,” “continues,” “plans,” “forecasts,” “estimates,” “projects,” “predicts,” “would,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “targets,” “is likely,” “will,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions, and include all statements regarding future performance, earnings projections, events or developments. It is possible that the future performance and earnings projections of the company, including its individual segments, may differ materially from current expectations, depending on economic conditions within its mobile, industrial and aerospace markets, and the company's ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance.\nAmong other factors which may affect future performance and earnings projections are: economic conditions within the company’s key markets, and the company’s ability to maintain and achieve anticipated benefits associated with announced realignment activities, strategic initiatives to improve operating margins, actions taken to combat the effects of the current economic environment, and growth, innovation and global diversification initiatives. Additionally, the actual impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may affect future performance and earnings projections as the amounts reflected in this period are preliminary estimates and exact amounts will not be determined until a later date, and there may be other judicial or regulatory interpretations of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that may also affect these estimates and the actual impact on the company. A change in the economic conditions in individual markets may have a particularly volatile effect on segment performance. Among other factors which may affect future performance of the company are, as applicable: changes in business relationships with and purchases by or from major customers, suppliers or distributors, including delays or cancellations in shipments; disputes regarding contract terms or significant changes in financial condition, changes in contract cost and revenue estimates for new development programs and changes in product mix; ability to identify acceptable strategic acquisition targets; uncertainties surrounding timing, successful completion or integration of acquisitions and similar transactions, including the integration of CLARCOR; the ability to successfully divest businesses planned for divestiture and realize the anticipated benefits of such divestitures; the determination to undertake business realignment activities and the expected costs thereof and, if undertaken, the ability to complete such activities and realize the anticipated cost savings from such activities; ability to implement successfully capital allocation initiatives, including timing, price and execution of share repurchases; availability, limitations or cost increases of raw materials, component products and/or commodities that cannot be recovered in product pricing; ability to manage costs related to insurance and employee retirement and health care benefits; compliance costs associated with environmental laws and regulations; potential labor disruptions; threats associated with and efforts to combat terrorism and cyber-security risks; uncertainties surrounding the ultimate resolution of outstanding legal proceedings, including the outcome of any appeals; competitive market conditions and resulting effects on sales and pricing; and global economic factors, including manufacturing activity, air travel trends, currency exchange rates, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. The company makes these statements as of the date of this disclosure, and undertakes no obligation to update them unless otherwise required by law.\nPARKER HANNIFIN CORPORATION - MARCH 31, 2018 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME (Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31, Nine Months Ended March 31, (Dollars in thousands except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net sales $ 3,749,591 $ 3,119,139 $ 10,484,915 $ 8,533,074 Cost of sales 2,825,008 2,383,790 7,926,956 6,534,280 Selling, general and administrative expenses 420,595 392,036 1,234,729 1,051,583 Interest expense 54,145 42,057 160,833 109,649 Other (income), net (19,984 ) (13,807 ) (41,953 ) (90,468 ) Income before income taxes 469,827 315,063 1,204,350 928,030 Income taxes 103,697 76,216 496,363 237,545 Net income 366,130 238,847 707,987 690,485 Less: Noncontrolling interests 141 174 442 378 Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 365,989 $ 238,673 $ 707,545 $ 690,107 Earnings per share attributable to common shareholders: Basic earnings per share $ 2.75 $ 1.79 $ 5.32 $ 5.17 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.70 $ 1.75 $ 5.22 $ 5.09 Average shares outstanding during period -
