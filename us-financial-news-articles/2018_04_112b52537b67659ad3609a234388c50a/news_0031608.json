The immigration department informed her about deportation proceedings against the nun, she said. \n“We condemn her unjust detention and the deportation proceedings initiated against her,” Reyes said. “She is no criminal or undesirable alien. She has long been in the Philippines helping the poorest of the poor.” \nFox is the superior of the Notre Dame de Sion in the Philippines, a congregation of Catholic nuns. She also told her lawyer, Sol Taule, the government would deport her, Reyes told Reuters. \nFox had been involved with human rights missions in Mindanao, looking into the plight of indigenous people and farmers, leftwing lawmakers said, almost a year after President Rodrigo Duterte imposed martial law on the southern island of Mindanao. \nThe immigration bureau confirmed the Fox’s arrest but declined to issue any statement until after the investigation is complete. Fox was unavailable for comment. \nLeftist lawmakers have vowed to hold a congressional inquiry into the deportation of foreign human rights advocates. \n“The immigration department is barking at the wrong tree on this one. Helping the poor is not a crime and joining peace activities to advocate peasant welfare and human rights is not against the law,” the lawmakers said in a statement, calling for her immediate release.
