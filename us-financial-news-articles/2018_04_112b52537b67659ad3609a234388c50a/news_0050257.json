The watchdog said it had found a recruitment message posted on Alibaba's official Weibo account in 2013 that described its female workers as \"goddesses.\"\n\"They are independent but not proud, sensitive but not melodramatic. They want to be your co-workers. Do you want to be theirs?\" read the advertisement.\nHuman Rights Watch said the message was still visible on Alibaba's website as of February this year. A spokesperson for Alibaba said the company will enforce \"stricter reviews\" of job ads.\nThe report cited a number of other tech companies, including Tencent, as having advertised jobs for men only.\n\"These incidents clearly do not reflect our values,\" said a Tencent spokesperson. \"We are sorry they occurred and we will take swift action to ensure they do not happen again.\"\nHuman Rights Watch warned gender discrimination was \"getting worse\" as the number of Chinese women in the workforce is down 2.5 percent compared to 10 years ago.\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked China in 100th place out of 144 countries for parity on gender pay.\nChina has officially banned gender discrimination in the workplace, but enforcement is low.", "external_links": ["https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/04/23/only-men-need-apply/gender-discrimination-job-advertisements-china"], "published": "2018-04-23T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T19:38:40.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
