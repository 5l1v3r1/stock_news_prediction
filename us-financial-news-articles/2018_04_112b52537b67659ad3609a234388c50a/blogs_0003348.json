REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini Police using footage from surveillance cameras tracked him down and rewarded him by helping him get legal permission to stay in the country.\nAn Italian Carabinieri police captain who worked in the neighborhood, Nunzio Carbone, was his godfather, or sponsor, at Saturday’s baptism service.\nCarbone and his fellow policemen helped Ogah get his immigration papers. The Nigerian now works as a stockman at a warehouse for a charity organization.\nThe other newly baptized at the service came from Albania, Peru, Italy and the United States.\nFrancis has made defense of migrants a key part of his papacy.\nSlideshow (8 Images) On Sunday, the pope ends Holy See services by celebrating an Easter Mass and then delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (“to the city and the world”) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.\nReporting By Philip Pullella; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T00:45:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
