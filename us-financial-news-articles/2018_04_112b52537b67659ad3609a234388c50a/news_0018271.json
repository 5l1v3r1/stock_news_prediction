An earlier pre-inquest hearing had been told traces of a rare and deadly poison from the gelsemium plant had been found in his stomach.\nNO FEAR The inquest resumed on Tuesday having been adjourned since last June. No reason was given for the delay.\nIt resumes at as relations between Britain and Russia hit a post-Cold War low over the poisoning of former double agent Sergei Skripal last month. Prime Minister Theresa May has said Russia behind the killing though Russia has denied any involvement.\nIn the Perepilichny case, however, British police said there was no evidence of foul play.\nThe inquest was told that Perepilichny had been involved in litigation with a company called Dzhirsa, which was set up by Dmitry Kovtun, one of the two men who Britain says was responsible for killing Alexander Litvinenko in 2006. Kovtun has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Litvinenko murder.\nDzhirsa was suing Perepilichny over a 3 million dollar loan, and a collection of at least three cases about alleged guarantees, worth around 3 million pounds.\nA verdict finding in Perepilichny’s favor was given by a Russian court a month before he was found dead, Moxon Browne said.\nPerepilichny’s widow has said she did not believe her husband had been murdered, and on Tuesday the court heard written testimony from other family members who said that he had not expressed fear for his life.\nThe inquest continues on Wednesday.\nAdditional reporting by Michael Holden, writing by Estelle Shirbon and Alistair Smout; editing by Kate Holton/Guy Faulconbridge\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T06:47:15.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
