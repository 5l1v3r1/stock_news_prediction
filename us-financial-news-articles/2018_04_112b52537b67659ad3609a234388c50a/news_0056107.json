Full inclusion would mean China would dwarf many large emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India.\nFund mangers widely expect full China inclusion by MSCI would lead to $300-$400 billion in foreign inflows.\n“The historical exclusion of these securities has led to a vast under-investment in China,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at KraneShares, a New York-based asset manager focused on China.\n“The (full) inclusion will likely take several years, meaning this is a long term strategy. So this is more than just a one-time event.”\nKraneShares this month kicked off a two-week roadshow across eight U.S. cities, pitching A-share opportunities to U.S. investors ahead of the June inclusion.\nNew York-listed KraneShares Bosera MSCI China A Share ETF has already seen its assets under management (AUM) explode nearly eight-fold over the past year thanks to the inclusion announcement.\nOther foreign investors who take a long-term approach to China include J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which plans to double coverage of China A-shares to 250 by the end of 2018.\nMa Jun, general manger of hedge fund manager Shanghai Solon Investment Co, said that increased investment from global institutions will add depth and breadth to China’s stock market, which is now dominated by retail investors.\nBut some local investors caution against being too bullish on China’s notoriously volatile markets.\nXu Xiaoqing, managing director of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Preston Group, reminded investors of the painful bursting of a bubble in blue-chip stocks earlier this year, in the wake of a surge in valuations triggered by MSCI’s announcement of the China inclusion last June.\n“For foreign investors, those A-shares to be included into MSCI indexes won’t generate obvious market-beating returns over the long run,” she said.\n(For more details on MSCI’s inclusion plans, see ) ($1 = 6.3109 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch; Editing by Vidya Ranganathan and Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:24:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
