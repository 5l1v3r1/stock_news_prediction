Cegertec has a rich 60-year history and are established leaders in power, industrial, building, and infrastructure. The 250-person firm has a central office in Chicoutimi, Quebec; additional offices are located in Quebec City, Montreal and, soon, in Beauce’s St-Georges. The transaction is expected to close on May 25, 2018.\n“The acquisition of Cegertec is a sign of our continuing commitment to grow our expertise and diversify our operations in the Quebec market. Cegertec will expand our geographic presence throughout the province,” says Isabelle Jodoin, Stantec’s senior vice president, Quebec. “The firm, which is recognized for its solid client relationships and technical excellence, greatly complements Stantec’s existing Quebec team, both with respect to markets and geographic presence. Our clients will now have access to a larger, comprehensive pool of resources, and a wide array of expertise and services under one banner, thanks to a combined team of 1,500 employees in Quebec.”\nCegertec’s team has carried out engineering and project management in Quebec, elsewhere in Canada, and in the United States, for industrial, aluminum, mining, and power clients, as well as for municipal and government clients.\n“We are excited to join Stantec. We share a similar culture and complementary services and operations,” says Serge Savard, Cartier’s vice president operations, finance, and administration. “We are also proud to soon be part of a strong, well-established team in Quebec, where we can bring our power, industrial, building and infrastructure expertise. We look forward to providing a wider range of services to our clients thanks to Stantec’s market diversity.”\nAbout Stantec\nCommunities are fundamental.
