If it stalls now around 3 percent, then risk appetite will come back, but when it moves that quickly it’s bound to have an effect.”\nEmerging European markets such as Poland and Russia opened stronger after a weak performance in Asia, with some hefty falls on Chinese and Indonesian bourses.\nChinese mainland shares tumbled almost 2 percent and Hong Kong fell 1 percent as a U.S. probe into Chinese tech company Huawei over potential sanctions violations rattled tech stocks and increased jitters over U.S.-China trade relations.\nIndonesian shares racked up a fifth day of losses, down 2.7 percent to October lows as investors continued to unwind dollar-denominated carry trades, with the rupiah hitting its lowest level since January 2016.\nSoutheast Asia’s largest economy is vulnerable to sudden capital flight from its sovereign bond market due to high foreign ownership, which could weaken the rupiah further.\nSouth Korea outperformed its regional peers, gaining 1.1 percent after Samsung Electronics posted a record quarterly profit. Its shares gained 3.5 percent, while those of SK Hynix rose nearly 5 percent.\nPositive growth data underpinned, with South Korean first quarter GDP growth of 1.1 percent, helped by booming exports.\nCurrencies delivered a mixed performance, with Russia’s rouble the biggest faller, down 0.7 percent ahead of Friday’s central bank meeting. The bank is expected to pause in its easing cycle after the rouble took a pounding in the wake of U.S. sanctions.\nRussia’s central bank also said it would bail out Asian-Pacific Bank and revoke the licences of two other banks as it continues with a clean-up programme in the sector.\nTurkey’s lira struggled for direction after Wednesday’s modest gains when the central bank raised its top interest rate by a bigger-than-expected 75 basis points.\nHammarlund said he expected the lira to remain under pressure unless the government stopped stimulating the economy to generate excessive domestic demand.\n“If inflation stays high and the current account deficit stays wide, investors will demand a higher return for investing in Turkey. They would have needed to do something a bit bigger to really strengthen the lira,” he said.\nThe South African rand bucked the trend, firming 0.2 percent off a three-month low.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1140.94 +0.67 +0.06 -1.51\nCzech Rep 1124.82 +3.15 +0.28 +4.33\nPoland 2267.90 +10.90 +0.48 -7.85\nHungary 38089.83 +39.86 +0.10 -3.27\nRomania 9047.58 +41.48 +0.46 +16.69\nGreece 830.24 +4.31 +0.52 +3.47\nRussia 1138.41 +0.79 +0.07 -1.39\nSouth Africa 50367.07 +132.22 +0.26 -4.12\nTurkey 06801.71 -599.67 -0.56 -7.40\nChina 3075.85 -42.12 -1.35 -6.99\nIndia 34581.14 +79.87 +0.23 +1.54\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.44 25.45 +0.05 +0.35\nPoland 4.23 4.23 -0.15 -1.35\nHungary 313.18 312.98 -0.06 -0.85\nRomania 4.65 4.64 -0.15 +0.56\nSerbia 117.96 118.06 +0.08 +0.37\nRussia 62.81 62.41 -0.64 -8.20\nKazakhstan 328.25 326.06 -0.67 +1.39\nUkraine 26.23 26.25 +0.08 +7.30\nSouth Africa 12.39 12.43 +0.31 -0.30\nKenya 100.20 100.00 -0.20 +2.89\nIsrael 3.58 3.59 +0.12 -2.90\nTurkey 4.07 4.08 +0.12 -6.95\nChina 6.33 6.32 -0.06 +2.83\nIndia 66.75 66.91 +0.24 -4.38\nBrazil 3.48 3.48 +0.01 -4.94\nMexico 18.86 18.85 -0.07 +4.18\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 322 -1 .11 7 83.20 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; graphic by Karin Strohecker; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-04-26T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T12:24:46.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
