The so-called core CPI rose 2.1 percent year-on-year in March, the largest advance since February 2017, after increasing 1.8 percent in February.\nIn morning trading, the U.S. 10-year yields were down at 2.760 percent, from 2.797 percent late on Tuesday.\nOn the front end of the curve, U.S. 2-year yields dipped to 2.286 percent, compared with 2.315 percent on Tuesday.
