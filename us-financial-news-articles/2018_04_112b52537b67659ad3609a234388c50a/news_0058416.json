They agreed the signs of weakness were not dramatic enough to warrant a slowdown in its policy normalisation, on which there is now broad consensus on the Governing Council, the sources added.\nThey said a decision on future moves would likely be communicated in June or July, with September only an outside possibility as it was too close to the tentative end date of asset buys.\nAn ECB spokesman declined to comment.
