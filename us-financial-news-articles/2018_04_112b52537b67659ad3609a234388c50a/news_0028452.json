WPP chairman Roberto Quarta will meanwhile serve as executive chairman until a new CEO is found.\n\"What you could get with a new CEO is, given where the WPP share price performance has been — it has significantly underperformed peers over the last 12 months by quite a considerable amount — so I'd expect that a new CEO would look to close that gap,\" he said, adding that one way to do this would be to sell certain company assets like WPP's market research arm, which Sorrell always staunchly defended but whose numbers didn't indicate concrete benefit.\nStill, the development does leave the company's future on shaky ground. \"(Sorrell's) got to be recognized,\" Whittaker said. \"You look at how he's built that group over the past 30 years, despite last year's share price and recent news he's done a fantastic job, he's literally Mr. WPP,\"\nWhether WPP does well or not in this next phase depends on how smooth the transfer of power is, Nusseibeh reiterated. \"And the issue they have, as with all service industries, is that all service industries depend on the leadership of the CEO, and it's not an easy thing to take that out of the equation.\"\nshow chapters London Advertising CEO: ‘Feel sorry’ for Sorrell as he quits WPP 10 Hours Ago | 04:20", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:14:38.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
