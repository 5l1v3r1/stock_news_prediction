Apr 1, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; John Isner of the United States celebrates celebrates after his match against Alexander Zverev of Germany (not pictured) in the men's singles final of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports \nThe 32-year-old American was tiring noticeably in the second set but won the ninth game to go up 5-4. \nThe moment inspired Isner, who changed to a yellow shirt and won that set and the next for his first victory over Zverev. \n“I couldn’t have scripted this,” said the 14th seed in a courtside interview after winning every service game.

After 32 years it will move to a new facility next year. \nIt also capped a successful weekend for American tennis with U.S. Open champion Sloane Stephens claiming the women’s title on Saturday.
