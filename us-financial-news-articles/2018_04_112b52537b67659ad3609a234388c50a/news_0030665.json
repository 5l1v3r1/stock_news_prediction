REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo Reuters reported on Saturday that Geneva-based Mercuria Group has agreed to take an interest in the oil refining system of ChemChina. The deal, if completed, would be the first time a global trading house has gained a stake in a Chinese refinery company.\nChemChina also said on Monday that it would raise its stake in Mercuria’s global trading operations, according to a statement on its website. It did not give further details.\nThe Swiss trader on Monday also issued a statement on its website confirming the cross-investment expansions, adding that details of the transaction would be completed this year.\nChemChina already holds a 12 percent stake in Mercuria, one of the world’s largest oil traders, and will remain a minority investor in the trading company.\nChemChina operates the country’s largest refinery system outside of the state-owned majors such as PetroChina. ChemChina has a total processing capacity of 530,000 barrels per day, including three plants in Shandong province.\nThe deal, agreed in Beijing on Saturday, would give Mercuria its first stake in crude refining to go alongside its interests in oil transport, storage and upstream operations.\nReporting by Aizhu Chen in Beijing; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T11:20:21.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
