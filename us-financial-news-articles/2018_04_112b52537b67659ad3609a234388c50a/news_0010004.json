All three players made emotional apologies upon their return to Australia and have since accepted their bans.\nCricket Australia have also come under fire during the crisis but Peever said he was not considering his own position, nor would the board be reviewing the conduct of long-standing chief executive James Sutherland.\n“Speaking on behalf of the board, this has happened on our watch, we accept responsibility. The review will help us understand what that means,” he added.\nCricket - South Africa v Australia - Fourth Test - Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - April 1, 2018 Australia players REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko “James Sutherland’s position is not under review, he continues to have the full support of the board... James is an outstanding executive who again in this crisis has done an outstanding job.\n“We’re all going to come under the microscope... but circumstances like these are not the time for witch hunts. I know people in these circumstances call for everyone to be sacked. Clearly, that isn’t going to solve any problems.”\nFormer test batsman Rick McCosker will lead a panel of two current and two former players in drawing up the charter, which is expected to address issues such as sledging of opponents as well as outright cheating.\nWho will lead the independent review has yet to be decided, Peever added, but Cricket Australia are determined not to hurry the process.\n“The board is committed to the review being completed as expeditiously as possible, but we are also committed to getting it right,” he said.\n“We will therefore take whatever time is necessary to ensure we fully understand the expertise required to conduct such a review.”\nCricket Australia suffered a hefty financial blow as a result of the cheating with one major sponsor, Magellan Financial Group, pulling out of a multi-million three-year deal after just a year.\nCricket - South Africa v Australia - Fourth Test - Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg, South Africa - April 3, 2018 Australia coach Darren Lehmann at the end of the series REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko Peever, the former managing director of mining giants Rio Tinto, said he did not, however, think the crisis would lessen the value of the rights to Australian cricket during the ongoing negotiations over a new broadcasting deal.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:53:04.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
