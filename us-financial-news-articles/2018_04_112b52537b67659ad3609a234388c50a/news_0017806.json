We have a dialogue that could potentially lead to an agreement, but there is much work left to be done,” government-appointed mediator Nils Dalseide told reporters. \nBoth trade unions and employers must make further concessions if they want to prevent a strike, he added. \nIf a strike breaks out, it is expected to idle aluminium smelters, fertilizer plants, ship yards and chemical factories, although the output of oil and gas from western Europe’s largest producer will initially be spared, unions have said.
