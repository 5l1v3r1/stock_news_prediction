(NYSE:KMX) today reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. Year-over-year highlights include:\n•\nNet sales and operating revenues increased 0.8% to $4.08 billion in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, net sales and operating revenues increased 7.8% to $17.12 billion. •\nUsed unit sales in comparable stores declined 8.0% in the fourth quarter, while they increased 2.0% for the fiscal year. •\nTotal used unit sales fell 3.1% in the fourth quarter, while they rose 7.5% for the fiscal year. •\nTotal wholesale unit sales increased 8.9% in the fourth quarter and 4.3% for the fiscal year. •\nCarMax Auto Finance (CAF) income increased 21.9% to $101.1 million in the fourth quarter. For the fiscal year, CAF income increased 14.1% to $421.2 million. •\nIn the fourth quarter, net earnings declined 20.0% to $122.1 million and net earnings per diluted share declined 17.3% to $0.67. * In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“2017 Tax Act”), net earnings for the current year’s fourth quarter were reduced by $32.7 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. Net earnings were also increased by $20.8 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, primarily due to the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate. * Net earnings for the current year’s quarter were reduced by a one-time discretionary bonus of $8.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share net of taxes, paid to eligible associates. •\nFor the fiscal year, net earnings increased 5.9% to $664.1 million and net earnings per diluted share increased 10.4% to $3.60. Net earnings for the full fiscal year were reduced by the fourth quarter items noted above. Fourth Quarter Business Performance Review\nSales . Total used vehicle unit sales declined 3.1% and comparable store used unit sales fell 8.0% versus the prior year’s fourth quarter. The comparable store sales performance primarily reflected lower store traffic and relatively flat conversion, as well as a tough comparison as we lapped our strongest prior year performance. “We’re disappointed in our fourth quarter comparable store unit sales performance, which we believe was partly affected by macro pricing factors resulting in a softer sales environment,” said Bill Nash, president and chief executive officer.\nTotal wholesale vehicle unit sales increased 8.9% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, largely driven by the growth in our store base and an increase in our appraisal buy rate.\nOther sales and revenues decreased 4.5% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Extended protection plan (EPP) revenues declined 2.4%, primarily due to the decline in used unit sales. The $5.0 million reduction in third-party finance fees reflected shifts in our sales mix by finance channel, including a decline in our Tier 2 and an increase in our Tier 3 sales.\nGross Profit . Total gross profit decreased 4.5% versus last year’s fourth quarter, to $536.7 million. Used vehicle gross profit fell 2.5%, largely the result of the 3.1% decline in total used unit sales. Used vehicle gross profit per unit was similar at $2,147 compared with $2,134 in the prior year period. Wholesale vehicle gross profit increased 9.8% versus the prior year’s quarter, primarily driven by the 8.9% increase in wholesale unit sales. Wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit was comparable at $946 versus $938 in the prior year period. Other gross profit declined 24.2%, reflecting a decrease in service profits, together with the noted changes in EPP revenues and net third-party finance fees. Service profits were affected by the reduced leverage of service department costs resulting from the decrease in comparable store used unit sales. In addition, approximately half of the total one-time discretionary bonus was paid to service department associates.\nSG&A . Compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, SG&A expenses increased 6.1% to $408.8 million. Factors contributing to the increase included the 11% increase in our store base since the beginning of last year’s fourth quarter (representing the addition of 19 stores), partially offset by a decrease of $8.6 million in stock-based compensation expense. In addition, approximately half of the total one-time discretionary bonus was included in the current quarter’s SG&A. SG&A per used unit was $2,397 in the current quarter, up $207 year-over-year, largely reflecting the deleverage associated with the decline in comparable store used unit sales. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense reduced SG&A per unit by $47.\nCarMax Auto Finance . (1) Compared with last year’s fourth quarter, CAF income increased 21.9% to $101.1 million. The increase resulted from the combined effects of a decline in the provision for loan losses and the growth in average managed receivables, partially offset by a lower total interest margin percentage. The provision for loan losses declined 16.7% to $38.6 million, compared with $46.4 million in the prior year quarter. The prior year’s provision was affected by rising loss experience during fiscal 2017 and an update in our assumptions used in determining the loan loss allowance, while losses in the current year’s quarter were generally consistent with expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ending managed receivables was 1.11% as of February 28, 2018, flat with the allowance percentage as of November 30, 2017, and down from 1.16% as of February 28, 2017. Average managed receivables grew 9.4% to $11.54 billion. The total interest margin percentage, which reflects the spread between interest and fees charged to consumers and our funding costs, was 5.6% of average managed receivables compared with 5.7% in last year’s fourth quarter.\nInterest Expense . Interest expense rose to $19.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from $16.4 million in the prior year’s fourth quarter. The increase principally reflected a reduction in capitalized interest and higher interest rates in fiscal 2018.\n(1)\nAlthough CAF benefits from certain indirect overhead expenditures, we have not allocated indirect costs to CAF to avoid making subjective allocation decisions.\nIncome Taxes . The effective tax rate increased to 41.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 from 37.0% in the prior year’s fourth quarter. The current year’s fourth quarter effective tax rate was affected by an $11.9 million increase in tax expense as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, including:\n•\nThe $32.7 million increase in tax expense associated with the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset, which increased the fourth quarter effective tax rate by 15.6 percentage points. •\nThe $20.8 million decrease in tax expense primarily resulting from the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate, which reduced the fourth quarter effective tax rate by 9.9 percentage points. In future quarters, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will generally be around 25%.\nStore Openings . During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we opened four stores. We entered two new television markets (Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and Portland, Maine) and we added two stores in existing television markets (Boston, Massachusetts and Denver, Colorado).\nShare Repurchase Activity . During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $127.8 million pursuant to our share repurchase program. As of February 28, 2018, we had $1.02 billion remaining available for repurchase under the current authorization.\nFiscal 2019 Capital Spending Plan\nWe currently plan to open 15 stores in fiscal 2019 and between 13 and 16 stores in fiscal 2020. Of the 15 stores we plan to open in fiscal 2019, 10 are in metropolitan statistical areas having populations of 600,000 or less, which we define as small markets. This is an increase from fiscal 2018, when 6 out of our 15 store openings were in small markets. We estimate capital expenditures will increase to approximately $340 million in fiscal 2019.\nSupplemental Financial Information\nAmounts and percentage calculations may not total due to rounding.\nSales Components\nThree Months Ended February 28 Years Ended February 28 (In millions)\n2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Used vehicle sales $ 3,429.2 $ 3,450.3 (0.6 )% $ 14,392.4 $ 13,270.7 8.5 % Wholesale vehicle sales 527.2 465.9 13.2 % 2,181.2 2,082.5 4.7 % Other sales and revenues: Extended protection plan revenues 82.0 84.0 (2.4 )% 336.4 305.5 10.1 % Third-party finance fees, net (14.1 ) (9.1 ) (54.2 )% (49.9 ) (38.4 ) (29.9 )% Other 59.8 58.9 1.6 % 260.2 254.9 2.1 % Total other sales and revenues 127.7 133.8 (4.5 )% 546.7 522.0 4.7 % Total net sales and operating revenues $ 4,084.2 $ 4,050.0 0.8 % $ 17,120.2 $ 15,875.1 7.8 % Unit Sales\nThree Months Ended February 28 Years Ended February 28 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Used vehicles 170,572 176,017 (3.1 )% 721,512 671,294 7.5 % Wholesale vehicles 99,226 91,143 8.9 % 408,509 391,686 4.3 % Average Selling Prices\nThree Months Ended February 28 Years Ended February 28 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Used vehicles $ 19,925 $ 19,435 2.5 % $ 19,757 $ 19,586 0.9 % Wholesale vehicles $ 5,076 $ 4,910 3.4 % $ 5,102 $ 5,106 (0.1 )% Vehicle Sales Changes\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28\nYears Ended\nFebruary 28 2018 2017 2018 2017 Used vehicle units (3.1 )% 13.4 % 7.5 % 8.3 % Used vehicle revenues (0.6 )% 11.7 % 8.5 % 6.7 % Wholesale vehicle units 8.9 % (1.2 )% 4.3 % (0.7 )% Wholesale vehicle revenues 13.2 % (7.9 )% 4.7 % (4.8 )% Comparable Store Used Vehicle Sales Changes (1)\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28\nYears Ended\nFebruary 28 2018 2017 2018 2017 Used vehicle units (8.0 )% 8.7 % 2.0 % 4.3 % Used vehicle revenues (5.6 )% 7.1 % 2.9 % 2.7 % (1)\nStores are added to the comparable store base beginning in their fourteenth full month of operation.
