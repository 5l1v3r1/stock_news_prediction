Anticipating such a move, the company has already said it favors new legislation that would make social networks disclose who is behind political ads, much as TV and radio stations must already do.\nTighter regulation of how Facebook uses its members' data could affect its ability to attract advertising revenue, its lifeblood. Facebook shares closed up 0.5 percent on Monday. They are still down almost 17 percent from highs hit in January, amid a broader tech selloff, partly because of investor concerns about regulation.\nPRIVACY ISSUES\nZuckerberg traversed Capitol Hill on Monday surrounded by police and trailed by packs of reporters ahead of his scheduled appearance before three congressional committees on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nZuckerberg held meetings with the top Republican and Democratic senators on the Commerce and Judiciary committees that will question him on Tuesday in a joint meeting. He faces further grilling from the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday.\nOn Monday, he was pictured in one photo showing his mobile device to Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee. He did not respond to questions from reporters as he entered and left the building.\nNelson told reporters after the meeting: The message I wanted to convey to him is that if we dont rein in the use of social media, none of us are going to have any privacy anymore.\"\nHe met Senator John Thune, the Commerce Committees Republican chairman, later in the day. He also met Chuck Grassley, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman, and the leading Democrat on that committee, Dianne Feinstein.\nTop of the agenda in this week's hearings will be Facebook's dealings with Cambridge Analytica, a London-based company that counts U.S. President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign among its past clients, or go-betweens. Cambridge Analytica has disputed Facebooks estimate of the number of affected users.\nLawmakers are also expected to press Zuckerberg closely on the 2016 election, which he anticipated in his written testimony.\n\"Its clear now that we didnt do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm...\" he said. \"That goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\"\nZuckerberg's testimony said the company was \"too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and were working hard to get better.\" He vowed to make improvements, adding it would take time, but he was \"committed to getting it right.\"\nFacebook disclosed in September that Russians under fake names had used the social network to try to influence U.S. voters in the months before and after the 2016 election, writing about inflammatory subjects, setting up events and buying ads.\nIn February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies with interfering in the election by sowing discord on social media.\nThe company's data practices are under investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.\nONLINE INFORMATION WARFARE\nZuckerberg said in his testimony that Facebook's major investments in security \"will significantly impact our profitability going forward.\"\nFacebook has about 15,000 people working on security and content review, rising to more than 20,000 by the end of 2018, Zuckerberg's testimony said. \"Protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits,\" he said.\nAs with other Silicon Valley companies, Facebook has been resistant to new laws governing its business, but on Friday it backed proposed legislation requiring social media sites to disclose the identities of buyers of online political campaign ads and introduced a new verification process for people buying issue ads, which do not endorse any candidate but have been used to exploit divisive subjects such as gun laws or police shootings.\nThe steps are designed to deter online information warfare and election meddling that U.S. authorities have accused Russia of pursuing, Zuckerberg said on Friday. Moscow has denied the allegations.\nA Facebook official confirmed that the company had hired a team from the law firm WilmerHale and outside consultants to help prepare Zuckerberg for his testimony and how lawmakers may question him.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson and Dustin Volz Editing by Damon Darlin and Bill Rigby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T14:13:21.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
