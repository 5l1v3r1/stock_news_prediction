Neither source gave a timeline. \nGoldman Sachs declined to comment on the issue when contacted by Reuters. A Saudi aviation authority spokesman was not immediately available for comment. \nSAVC Chairman Faisal Hamad al-Sugair had said in December that the goal was for airports in the kingdom to be “corporatised”, or turned into private companies, in 2018 and that privatisation would follow later. \nOfficials have highlighted transport as a priority sector for privatisation, however the process has taken time to get underway. The kingdom had said in November 2015 it expected to begin privatising airports in the first quarter of 2016. \nThe airport privatisation plan is expected to move faster than those for more complex sectors such as healthcare and electricity, one of the sources said. \nThe Saudi government has said that it planned to raise about $200 billion through its privatisation programme in coming years, in addition to some $100 billion through the planned sale of a stake in national oil giant Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE.
