Lonstroff was not available to comment immediately.\nSlovenia has provided financial incentives to various companies in recent years as it seeks to attract foreign investment to boost economic growth and create jobs. They included Canadian car parts maker Magna International and Japanese electrical equipment producer Yaskawa, which are both building factories in the country.\nThe ministry said the 4.8 million euros of aid for Lonstroff would be split into 910,000 euros made available this year and another 3.89 million a year later.\nThe figure includes financial help of 657,000 euros that was approved by the government last week. The rest was approved by the Ministry of Economy.\n“New investments such as this one are a proof of Slovenia’s economic revival under the mandate of this government,” Prime Minister Miro Cerar said in a statement after the economy ministry signed a financial incentives contract with Lonstroff on Wednesday.
