A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!\"\nDonald Trump tweet\nDaniels' lawyer, Michael Avenatti shot back on Twitter, noting a recent FBI raid on Trump's personal attorney's office, saying it uncovered \"EXISTING documents and recordings showing con job after con job pulled on REAL people and very REAL American citizens (who didn't know it).\"\nHe added that Trump was a \"completely unhinged, undisciplined opponent who is prone to shooting himself in the foot.\"\nMichael Avenatti tweet\nAvenatti has increased a $100,000 reward to $131,000 for information leading to the man's identification. The figure could be a reference to the $130,000 that Daniels says she received from Trump's lawyer attorney, Michael Cohen, just before the 2016 election for her silence. Daniels is seeking to invalidate the nondisclosure agreement.\nThe case took on new significance last week when FBI agents raided Cohen's office, looking for information on topics including the payment to Daniels.\nTrump answered questions about Daniels for the first time recently, saying he had no knowledge of the payment made by Cohen and didn't know where Cohen had gotten the money. The White House has consistently said Trump denies the affair.\nAfter Daniels first alleged on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" several weeks ago that she had been threatened, a lawyer for Cohen demanded that she publicly apologize to his client for suggesting Cohen was involved. Daniels responded by filing a revised federal lawsuit accusing Cohen of defamation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T15:25:28.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
