With one of the most recognizable and relatable brand names in the industry, recent developments indicate the company is doing all that it can to ensure its widespread success.\nThere are a few prerequisites for a retail branding company to succeed. Chief among them is having distinctive, recognizable, and relatable brands. Having an effective distribution network is also essential to meet the demand created by marketing the distinctive brands. Offering more brands to supplement the flagship brand, thereby increasing revenue and the chances of success, is probably a good idea as well. In the ever-evolving, fast-growing legal cannabis market, International Cannabrands is checking all the boxes.\nCalifornia Expansion\nInternational Cannabrands recently announced the proposed acquisition of La Vida Verde, an established California-based producer and distributor of cannabis extracts and edibles. LVV’s existing product lines include Skunk Feather Cannabis and a variety of premium edibles and oils made with organic, non-GMO ingredients. The company’s focus on all natural products dovetails nicely with the JuJu Royal commitment to premium, all natural products informed by the Rastafarian culture’s holistic regard for all life.\nThe initial stages of the deal include International Cannabrands acquiring 51% of La Vida Verde at close, with the remaining 49% to be acquired within two years. LVV brings with it a very talented executive team who will remain in charge following the acquisition. CEO Eric Hara is a renowned chef and food formulator who is largely responsible for making the company’s edible lines tasty, healthy and effective. President Bryce Berryessa sits on a number of California cannabis industry boards, founded a successful dispensary in Santa Cruz, and co-founded other successful and award winning extract and edible brands prior to La Vida Verde.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, International Cannabrands will have significantly expanded its retail product offerings, especially in the explosive edibles and extracts sector. Though flower remains the dominant delivery method for cannabis, extracts and related products have been rapidly gaining market share as the industry matures and consumers are exposed to alternative delivery mechanisms like vaping, shatter, concentrates, and edibles.\nThe deal also crucially expands the reach of the JuJu Royal product line, opening up more distribution in California. Though the brand already has exposure in the state, more is definitely better in the world’s largest legal recreational cannabis market, projected to exceed $5 billion annually by 2019.\nOther Initiatives\nInternational Cannabrands currently distributes the JuJu Royal brand in Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Colorado and Puerto Rico with its CBD product line being distributed throughout the US, as well as in Europe and the Middle East. The company has a distribution and production agreement with Maricann, an established licensed producer in Canada. And the company has established a distribution agreement for the United Kingdom and Europe. With the global recognition of the Marley name, the global approach makes a lot of sense for International Cannabrands.\nThe company also has plans to launch its own Julian Marley branded stores. In terms of familiarity and positive associations, the Julian Marley name on a store could be a great advantage for attracting consumers when compared to more generic store names and brands. In a scaled-down but similar idea, International Cannabrands is developing its ‘store within a store’ concept where dispensaries and retail locations dedicate a whole section of the store to the Julian Marley JuJu Royal brand. Cathedral City Care adjacent to Palm Springs, is the first in what the company hopes are many such locations to employ the concept, giving the brand much higher visibility than simply sharing shelf space with other products. Since the opening of Cathedral City the company has opened two additional store within stores in Coachella and Los Angeles\nOverall, International Cannabrands is demonstrating a far-reaching plan to penetrate a variety of emerging cannabis markets. People the world over recognize the Marley name as a representation of all that is good about cannabis culture, and the company is moving forward along a number of fronts to get its products squarely in front of those people. This latest proposed acquisition is an important step in that process, a major step forward in one of the most lucrative markets in existence.\nPlease follow the link to read the full article: http://www.cannabisfn.com/julian-marley-brand-expands-california-distribution-looks-acquire-cannabis-products-company/\nAbout CFN Media\nCFN Media (CannabisFN) is the leading agency and financial media network dedicated to the global cannabis industry, helps companies operating in the space attract investors, capital, and publicity.
