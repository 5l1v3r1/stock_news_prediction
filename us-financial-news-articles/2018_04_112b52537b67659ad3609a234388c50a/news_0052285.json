The airline has now ordered nearly 300 Boeing MAX jets, the most of any customer, a Boeing spokesman said. The MAX series is more fuel efficient than previous models.\nSouthwest warned on Thursday that the consequences of a mid-air engine explosion on a 737-700 last week will weigh on second-quarter bookings, as investigators probe the events that led to the first passenger death in the airline’s history.\nThe carrier posted a first-quarter profit of $438 million, excluding special items, up from $372 million a year earlier.
