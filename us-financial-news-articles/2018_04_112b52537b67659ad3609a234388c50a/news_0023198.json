However, the likelihood that the current tit-for-tat threats escalate to such an extent seems low,” Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said.\nElsewhere, investors eyed U.S. inflation data due later in the session and minutes from the Federal Reserve’s March meeting for signs of whether the Fed will favour three or four rate hikes this year.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters forecast that the core consumer price index (CPI) would be unchanged year-on-year in March, after a 0.2 percent rise in February.\n“Inflation is expected to nudge a little higher in March but not to the point that markets will feel the Fed definitely needs to up the pace of tightening,” Scotiabank’s chief FX strategist Shaun Osborne said in a note.\nThe euro gained 0.2 percent at $1.2383, its strongest level since March 28.\nThe common currency received a boost on Tuesday after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said the ECB’s bond buying programme would be wound down by the end of this year, paving the way for the bank’s first rate rise since 2011.\nThe rouble took another leg down on Wednesday, falling more than 1 percent against the dollar, taking its losses so far this week to nearly 12 percent as markets reeled from the latest U.S. sanctions.\nTurkey’s lira sank to a new record low against the dollar as investors worried about the outlook on monetary policy.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-04-11T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:46:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
