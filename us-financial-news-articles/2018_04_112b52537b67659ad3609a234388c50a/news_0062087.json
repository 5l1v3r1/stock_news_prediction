(NYSE:AMG) today reported its financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, diluted earnings per share were $2.77, compared to $2.13 for the same period of 2017, and Economic earnings per share (“Economic EPS”) were $3.92, compared to $3.21 for the same period of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Net income was $153.0 million, compared to $122.5 million for the same period of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Economic net income was $215.2 million, compared to $183.2 million for the same period of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA was $286.5 million, compared to $243.8 million for the same period of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Consolidated revenue was $612.4 million, compared to $544.3 million for the same period of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Aggregate fees (previously referred to as Aggregate revenue, and consisting of the total asset- and performance-based fees of all Affiliates) were $1.6 billion, compared to $1.4 billion for the same period of 2017. (Economic EPS, Economic net income, and Adjusted EBITDA are defined in the attached tables, along with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.)\nNet client cash flows for the first quarter of 2018 were $(1.9) billion. AMG’s aggregate assets under management were approximately $831 billion at March 31, 2018.\nToday, AMG announced a second-quarter cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, an increase of 50% over the year-ago level, payable May 24, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2018. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased approximately $151 million in stock, or 0.8 million common shares.\n“AMG’s first quarter results marked a strong start to 2018, including year-over-year growth of 22% in our Economic earnings per share, which were $3.92,” stated Sean M. Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AMG. “Our results reflect the quality of our Affiliates and the diversity of our business, and given the strength of our competitive position along with the scale and earnings power of our business, we have excellent prospects for continued earnings growth going forward.”\n“Strong inflows across our liquid and illiquid alternative strategies were offset by equity outflows from institutional clients,” Mr. Healey continued. “During the quarter, our Affiliates extended their outstanding long-term performance records, especially across our global and emerging markets equities products. Looking ahead, we see increasingly favorable conditions for performance-oriented managers operating differentiated, high-conviction strategies, as lower correlations and heightened volatility provide additional opportunities for alpha-generation.”\n“With our unique competitive position, including a strong and growing pipeline of prospective new Affiliates and our decades-long track record of successful partnerships, we have an outstanding opportunity to continue to enhance our earnings growth and the diversity of our business through accretive new investments. Through our execution on this proprietary opportunity set and our organic growth strategy, along with our disciplined commitment to the consistent return of capital to shareholders, we are positioned to generate substantial shareholder value ahead.”\nAbout AMG\nAMG is a global asset management company with equity investments in leading boutique investment management firms.

Average assets under management provides a more meaningful relationship to our financial and operating results as it reflects both the particular billing patterns of Affiliate sponsored products and client accounts and corresponds with the timing of the inclusion of an Affiliate’s financial results in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (B) Aggregate fees consists of the total asset- and performance-based fees earned by all of our Affiliates and is an operating measure used by management to evaluate the operating performance and material trends across our entire business. Aggregate fees is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, our GAAP performance measures. (C) Adjusted EBITDA (controlling interest) represents our performance before our share of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairments and adjustments to our contingent payment arrangements. We believe that many investors use this measure when assessing the financial performance of companies in the investment management industry. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. (D) Under our Economic net income (controlling interest) definition, we add to Net income (controlling interest) our share of pre-tax intangible amortization and impairments (including the portion attributable to equity method investments in Affiliates), deferred taxes related to intangible assets, and other economic items which include non-cash imputed interest (principally related to the accounting for convertible securities and contingent payment arrangements) and certain Affiliate equity expenses. We consider Economic net income (controlling interest) an important measure of our financial performance, as we believe it best represents our performance before our share of non-cash expenses relating to the acquisition of interests in Affiliates, and it is therefore employed as our principal performance measure. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Net income (controlling interest) or other GAAP performance measures. We add back intangible amortization and impairments attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) because these expenses do not correspond to the changes in the value of these assets, which do not diminish predictably over time. The portion of deferred taxes attributable to intangible assets (including goodwill) is added back because we believe it is unlikely these accruals will be used to settle material tax obligations. We add back non-cash imputed interest and reductions or increases in contingent payment arrangements because it better reflects our contractual interest obligations. We add back non-cash expenses relating to certain transfers of equity between Affiliate partners when these transfers have no dilutive effect to shareholders. (E) Economic earnings per share represents Economic net income (controlling interest) divided by the Average shares outstanding (adjusted diluted). In this calculation, the potential share issuance in connection with our convertible securities is measured using a “treasury stock” method. Under this method, only the net number of shares of common stock equal to the value of the convertible securities in excess of par, if any, are deemed to be outstanding. We believe the inclusion of net shares under a treasury stock method best reflects the benefit of the increase in available capital resources (which could be used to repurchase shares of common stock) that occurs when these securities are converted and we are relieved of our debt obligation. This method does not take into account any increase or decrease in our cost of capital in an assumed conversion. This non-GAAP performance measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, Earnings per share (diluted) or other GAAP performance measures. (F) Other primarily includes the assets under management attributable to Affiliate product transitions and transfers of our interests in Affiliates. (G) For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2018, Other economic items are net of income tax expense of $0.3 and $0.2, respectively. (H) Other items include depreciation and adjustments to contingent payment arrangements. (I) Our consolidated income tax provision includes taxes attributable to the controlling interest, and to a lesser extent, taxes attributable to non-controlling interests. The following table summarizes our consolidated tax provision: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2018 Taxes attributable to controlling interest $ 57.8 $ 60.8 Taxes attributable to non-controlling interests 1.9 2.7 Total income taxes $ 59.7 $ 63.5 Income before taxes (controlling interest) $ 180.3 $ 213.8 Effective tax rate (controlling interest) 32.1 % 28.4 %\nSource:Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.amg.com/InvestorRelations/", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b0f545c2-fd77-456a-b99a-050801995e8d", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=FQFr1d-pqehqOKxqcEORCNe0C9Qcd0M6c1raB5zj_dc5-vGQXId1sXn0qgvjqYDBXG8njvQJ3TuW42RvlpZaDHWuY5DkX7GhziTeeUsYDNPVoMlIsDCHcIjhZQao5YG98NPXFBIFHH5RYbANyzB9Yg=="], "published": "2018-04-30T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:47:34.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
