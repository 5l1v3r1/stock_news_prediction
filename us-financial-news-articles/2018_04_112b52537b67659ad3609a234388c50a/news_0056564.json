The stock has had a weak run in the run-up to the results, falling 6 percent in the past week.\n$1 = 8.5479 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom Editing by Niklas Pollard and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:11:17.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
