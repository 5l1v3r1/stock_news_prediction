Many other opposition leaders have also resigned in the wake of the election defeat.\nFILE PHOTO: Chairman of the Hungarian right wing opposition party Jobbik Gabor Vona speaks at a rally during Hungary's National Day celebrations, in Budapest, Hungary, March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo/File Photo Unable to grow larger on a far-right platform, Jobbik shifted toward the center from 2013 and effectively traded places as Orban grew closer to the far right with his strong anti-immigration platform during Europe’s migrant crisis.\nBut its strategy to remake itself into a moderate force, distancing itself from the racist and xenophobic platform which defined its formative years, has failed to produce the kind of breakthrough the party had hoped for.\nJobbik party leader Gabor Vona, main opponent to current Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and his wife Krisztina Vona-Szabo, arrive at a polling station during Hungarian parliamentary election in Gyongyos, Hungary, April 8, 2018.

Potential leadership changes will undermine the opposition’s effectiveness, giving Fidesz more unconstrained room to rule.”\nJobbik’s parliamentary group will have 25 lawmakers based on a preliminary tally, just one more than under the previous government term. It will be the single biggest opposition group, but leftist parties still outnumber it with 38 lawmakers.\nVona, 39, has been a Jobbik leader since its inception as a student movement in 1999.\nHe took advantage of resentment toward Hungary’s large Roma population as a volatile propellant for his party. Vona launched a vigilante group called Hungarian Guard in 2007 and marched through Roma communities around Hungary.\nReporting by Gergely Szakacs and Marton Dunai; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:13:54.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
