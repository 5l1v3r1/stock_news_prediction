Against the euro, it strengthened to 87.08 pence \nThe British currency has rallied more than 1.5 percent in the last three trading sessions. Market watchers say a successful break above the $1.4252 line would put sterling on track to test a 2018 high of $1.4346 hit in late January. \nIts gains against the struggling euro have been even more pronounced. Sterling has strengthened 1 percent so far this month after a 2 percent rally in March. \n“This an interesting level technically ... recent data and positioning seem to be weighing on the euro,” said John Marley, head of FX strategy at Infinity International, a currency risk management firm. \nApril tends to be a strong month for the British currency, according to recent analysis by strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. They said dividend payments by UK companies have helped sterling to rally every April for the last 14 years. \nThe BoE raised rates for the first time in more than a decade in November and a recent string of strong data including house price data on Monday have virtually sealed the case for a second rate increase in May. \nBut positioning is already long according to various survey data and poll forecasts and therefore the market may be vulnerable to a selloff if a correction materialises or data surprises on the downside.
