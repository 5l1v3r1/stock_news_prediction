Overall, MSCI euro zone companies are expected to report earnings growth of 4.9 percent from Q1 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nA spate of broker rating cuts bruised German retailer Metro , down 6.9 percent at the bottom of the STOXX after Friday’s profit warning on poor performance in its Russian operations. \nHelvea Baader, JP Morgan, Kepler Cheuvreux and Bernstein all cut their price targets on the stock, while HSBC cut it to “reduce” from “buy”. \n“While the company did their best to contextualise the timing and the drivers of this announcement, it is the quantum of the profit warning which is concerning, especially given the confidence with which management was previously defending its EBITDA guidance,” wrote Berenberg analysts. \nFresenius Medical declined 4.4 percent after the German dialysis specialist cut its 2018 sales target. It helped push Germany’s DAX down 0.4 percent. \nStrong growth in its Chinese market helped boost Philips’ first-quarter results above expectations, sending its shares up 3.5 percent. The Dutch health technology company’s CEO said he saw rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China having a negative impact on its results, however. \nAnd in an an incipient sign of this year’s surge in crude oil prices trickling down to component makers, Rotork, which makes valves for the oil and gas industry, reported strong first-quarter results sending its shares up 10.5 percent. \nM&A news also rumbled on. Shares in Swiss banking software business Temenos gained 3.4 percent after it said it would not raise its bid for Fidessa. \nThe British financial trading systems firm ditched Temenos in favour of a 1.5 billion pound deal with rival bidder Ion.
