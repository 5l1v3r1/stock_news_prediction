REUTERS/Vincent Kessler\nThe euro zoneâ€™s second-biggest economy grew 0.3 percent in the first three months - the slowest rate since the third quarter of 2016 - after expanding 0.7 percent in the final three months of last year, INSEE said.\nEconomists had on average expected growth of 0.4 percent, with forecasts ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.6 percent in a Reuters poll of 30 economists.\nConsumer spending growth, traditionally the main motor of the French economy, grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter despite exceptionally cold temperatures boosting energy consumption, the same rate as in the previous quarter.\nMeanwhile businesses slowed investment growth to 0.5 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous three months, while exports dipped marginally after a spike in the previous quarter. Since imports were flat, foreign trade had no impact on overall growth.\nFor a graphic of GDP by contributions: reut.rs/2oQ8Pxu Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta", "external_links": ["http://reut.rs/2oQ8Pxu"], "published": "2018-04-27T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T09:34:56.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
