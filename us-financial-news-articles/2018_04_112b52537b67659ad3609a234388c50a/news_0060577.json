Morrisons slipped at the opening but finished 1.3 percent higher.\nThe reaction among European retailers was mixed, too. France’s Carrefour gained 0.9 percent and Casino rose 1 percent while Ahold Delhaize declined 0.4 percent.\nIn other deal news, Deutsche Telekom shares ended the day down 0.7 percent, having earlier risen to the top of the DAX after the German firm clinched a $26 billion deal to merge T-Mobile US and Sprint.\nAccorHotels rose 1.9 percent after the French hotel chain agreed to buy rival Movenpick Hotels & Resorts for $567 million.\nIn results-driven moves, the world’s biggest advertising group, WPP, surged 8.6 percent after reporting forecast-beating sales in its first results without founder Martin Sorrell.\nThe agency’s gains boosted the pan-European media sector by 1.4 percent to a three-month high.\nA drag on the banking sector was Sweden’s SEB, which tumbled 4.5 percent after reporting first-quarter profit below market expectations as cautious corporate customers and a seasonal slowdown hampered earnings.\nFrench construction materials firm Imerys also fell 5.2 percent after reporting results.\nGlencore dropped 5 percent after mining subsidiaries in the Democratic Republic of Congo were served freezing orders for alleged unpaid royalties of nearly $3 billion.\nOverall, Europe’s first-quarter results season has kicked off relatively weakly, particularly compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nEarnings have surprised negatively, on average, in the banking sector, while commodity-related sectors have reported surprisingly strong results thanks to higher materials prices, according to Goldman Sachs.\nSociete Generale analysts struck a note of caution about investors’ high expectations of earnings. “Optimistic consensus earnings growth for the next three years could be a source of disappointment,” they wrote in a note entitled “Reality check”.
