This week’s data may be crucial for determining the direction of WTI,” he added.\nThe American Petroleum Institute is due to publish oil storage data later on Tuesday while official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Wednesday.\nOil markets have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).\nHowever, soaring U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to 10.46 million barrels per day (bpd), is threatening to undermine OPEC’s efforts to tighten the market and prop up prices.\nThe United States late last year overtook top exporter Saudi Arabia as the world’s second biggest crude producer. Only Russia pumps more crude out of the ground, at almost 11 million bpd.\nIn a sign that oil supplies remain ample, China’s Sinopec , Asia’s largest refiner, plans to cut Saudi crude imports in May by 40 percent, instead buying from alternative sources, after Saudi Aramco set higher-than-expected prices, a company official said on Monday.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T09:25:20.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
