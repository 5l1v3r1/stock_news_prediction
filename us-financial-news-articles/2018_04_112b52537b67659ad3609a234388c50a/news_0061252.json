Rating agency Standard and Poor’s this week cut Qazaq Banki’s rating to CCC- from ССС+.\nOne lender mentioned by Nazarbayev, Bank of Astana, has since limited cash withdrawals after a customer run. Fitch downgraded it to CCC from B this month. The third lender, Eximbank, has also been downgraded by S&P this year.\nNone of the three banks had been picked for a state-sponsored bailout programme under which the central bank provided a number of medium-sized lenders with capital injections to help them write off bad loans.
