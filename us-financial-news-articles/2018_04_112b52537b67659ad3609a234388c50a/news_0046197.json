Diluted earnings per share were $1.93, up 30 percent year-over-year and a first-quarter record.\n\"We are pleased with the continued improvement in our financial performance and the growth in our business,\" said James A. Squires, Norfolk Southern chairman, president and CEO. \"We are focused on improving service for our customers to position us for future growth and efficiency that will benefit both our customers and shareholders. The outlook for 2018 is promising, and we are increasing our expected annual share repurchases to $1.5 billion, confident that we will deliver strong financial performance.\"\nFirst-quarter summary\nRailway operating revenues of $2.7 billion increased 6 percent compared with first-quarter 2017, as overall volumes were up 3 percent, reflecting 8 percent growth in our intermodal category that offset declines in merchandise and coal volumes.\nRailway operating expenses increased $64 million, or 4 percent, to $1.9 billion compared with the same period last year, as higher fuel prices and increased costs associated with overall lower network velocity were offset, in part, by efficiency gains.\nIncome from railway operations was $835 million, an increase of 10 percent year-over-year, a first-quarter record. The railway operating ratio, or operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, was 69.3 percent, also a first-quarter record.\nAbout Norfolk Southern\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE: NSC) is one of the nation's premier transportation companies. Its Norfolk Southern Railway Company subsidiary operates approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serves every major container port in the eastern United States, and provides efficient connections to other rail carriers.

The retrospective application resulted in the reclassification of $16 million of pension and other postretirement benefits from the \"Compensation and benefits\" line item within \"Railway operating expenses\" to \"Other income - net\" on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe repurchased and retired 2.1 million and 1.7 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively, at a cost of $300 million and $200 million, respectively. Since the beginning of 2006, we have repurchased and retired 170.6 million shares at a total cost of $11.6 billion.\nReclassification of Stranded Tax Effects\nIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, \"Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\" This update is intended to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2018-02 resulting in an increase to \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" of $88 million and a corresponding increase to \"Retained income,\" with no impact on \"Total stockholders' equity.\"\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/norfolk-southern-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300635924.html\nSOURCE Norfolk Southern Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.norfolksouthern.com/", "http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en/system-overview.html", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/norfolk-southern-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300635924.html", "https://norfolksoutherncorporation.gcs-web.com/"], "published": "2018-04-25T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T16:54:11.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
