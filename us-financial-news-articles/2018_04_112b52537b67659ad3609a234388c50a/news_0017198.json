We are still testing to determine the contents,” said a police spokesman, Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko.\nAuthorities had raided streetside vendors to seize and destroy thousands of bottles of the moonshine, he said.\nMedia broadcast pictures of grieving families waiting to claim the bodies of loved ones at hospital morgues in several cities.\nMuslim-majority Indonesia imposes high rates of tax on alcohol, which sometimes leads to people turning to cheap home brews.\nDeaths from such consumption are reported frequently, but the latest toll is among the highest in recent years. In 2016, 36 people died after drinking locally made liquor, according to media.\nReporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa; Writing by Kanupriya Kapoor; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T16:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:02:41.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
