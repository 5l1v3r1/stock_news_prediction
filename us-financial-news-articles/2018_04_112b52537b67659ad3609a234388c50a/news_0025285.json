REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nSenator Cory Gardner, Trump’s fellow Republican whose state has some of the most permissive marijuana laws in the country, had blocked Senate confirmation of Justice Department nominations to force the change. \nSessions on Jan. 4 rescinded a policy begun under Democratic former President Barack Obama that had eased enforcement of federal marijuana laws in states that legalized it. In doing so, Sessions, who has taken a hard line against marijuana, gave federal prosecutors wide latitude to pursue criminal charges. \nGardner said on Friday he received a commitment from Trump that the rescission “will not impact Colorado’s legal marijuana industry.” Gardner said Trump assured him he would support legislation “to fix this states’ rights issue once and for all.” FILE PHOTO: U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) smiles after he was ceremonially sworn-in by Vice President Joseph Biden in the Old Senate Chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, U.S., January 6, 2015. REUTERS/Larry Downing \nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the president’s action. \n“We’re always consulting Congress about issues, including states’ rights, of which the president is a firm believer. And the statement that the senator put out earlier today is accurate,” Sanders added.

He then appeared to change his position last year by saying he has a constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute federal laws. \nBob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general of Washington state, which permits marijuana use, said Gardner’s announcement made him “cautiously optimistic” but until there is a formal agreement or law on the issue he stands ready to defend “Washington’s well-regulated marijuana industry.” Reporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Will Dunham", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:19:02.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
