NEW COMPETITION \nThe barriers to entry in the ride-hailing sector are relatively low in Southeast Asia, but new entrants will need to scale up quickly to compete with Grab, which is backed by Japan’s SoftBank \nThe Singapore market is complicated by the high cost of car ownership on the island, where the government tightly controls the number of vehicles on the road. \n“In addition to the usual methods of competing in ride-hailing, which is using incentives and subsidies to build up your network, in the Singapore market that means they will most likely have to incur quite a bit of cost providing the fleet,” said Walter Theseira, a senior economics lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. \nNew competition is emerging in other Southeast Asian markets. \nIndonesian ride-hailing and online payment company Go-Jek is looking to expand into the Philippines, Manila’s transport regulator said last week. \nGo-Jek also plans to enter Singapore soon, the Straits Times newspaper reported this month. \n“If an entrant comes in and quickly acquires substantial market share, we could very well see the (CCCS) investigation dropped,” Theseira said.
