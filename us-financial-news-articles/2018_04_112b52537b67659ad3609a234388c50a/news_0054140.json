Operating EBITDA decreased by 4% during the first quarter of 2018 to US$535 million versus the same period in 2017.\nMONTERREY, Mexico--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CEMEX, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"CEMEX\") (NYSE:CX), announced today that consolidated net sales increased by 8% during the first quarter of 2018 to US$3.4 billion versus the comparable period in 2017.\nCEMEX’s Consolidated First-Quarter 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nThe increase in quarterly consolidated net sales was due to higher prices of our products, in local currency terms in Mexico, the U.S. and our Europe and Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, as well as higher volumes in our U.S. and our Asia, Middle East & Africa regions. Operating earnings before other expenses, net, in the first quarter decreased by 5%, to US$332 million. Controlling interest net income during the quarter was US$26 million from an income of US$336 million in the same period of 2017. Operating EBITDA decreased by 4% during the quarter compared to the same period in 2017, to US$535 million. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter decreased to 15.8% from 17.7% in the same period of 2017. Free cash flow after maintenance capital expenditures for the quarter decreased by 1% to negative US$154 million, compared to the same quarter of 2017.\nFernando A. Gonzalez, Chief Executive Officer of CEMEX, said, “The first quarter of 2018 was characterized by solid operating results with good consolidated daily volumes and improved pricing performance, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. However, our EBITDA generation during the quarter was affected by seasonal effects, including adverse weather in our European and U.S. operations, fewer business days and an inventory costing-variation effect. We expect the impact of the fewer business days and the inventory effect to revert in upcoming months while we should recover most of the pent-up demand caused by adverse weather to be recovered during the rest of the year.\n“For the rest of 2018, we expect favorable consolidated volumes and improving pricing dynamics in most of our markets. This, together with an expected moderation in our energy cost increases and our initiatives to contain other costs, should translate into increased operating EBITDA generation for the full year.”\nConsolidated Corporate Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, controlling interest net income was US$26 million, versus an income of US$336 million in the same period last year.\nTotal debt plus perpetual notes increased by US$3 million during the quarter.\nGeographical Markets First-Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet sales in our operations in Mexico increased 10% in the first quarter of 2018 to US$800 million, compared with US$725 million in the first quarter of 2017.
