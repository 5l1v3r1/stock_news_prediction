(Nasdaq:TSRI), a provider of computer programming consulting services, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended February 28th, revenue decreased to $15,058,000 from $15,390,000 in the same quarter last year. Net loss attributable to TSR was $19,000 in the current quarter, as compared with a loss attributable to TSR of $68,000 in the prior year quarter. Additionally, net loss per share was $0.01 in the current quarter compared with a loss of $0.03 in the prior year quarter.\nChristopher Hughes, CEO, stated, “Our revenue for the quarter ended February 28, 2018 decreased $332,000 from the prior year comparable quarter. This decrease resulted primarily from heavier than usual furloughing of consultants on billing with customers around the holidays and other customer budget reduction measures. The overall average number of consultants on billing with customers decreased from 394 for the quarter ended February 28, 2017 to 370 for the quarter ended February 28, 2018, while the average number of computer programming consultants decreased from 328 in the quarter ended February 28, 2017 to 324 in the current quarter. The 370 consultants on billing for the current quarter include 46 administrative workers, compared with 66 in the prior year quarter, which we placed at billing rates substantially lower than those charged for computer programming consultants. The net loss decreased from the prior year quarter due to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of $197,000 compared with the prior year quarter resulting primarily from the retirement of the former Chairman and other cost savings.”\nCertain statements contained herein, including statements as to the Company’s plans, future prospects and future cash flow requirements are forward-looking statements, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
