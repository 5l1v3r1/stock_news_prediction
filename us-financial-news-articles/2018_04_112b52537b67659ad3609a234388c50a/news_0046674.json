It said its board was considering its position.\nTakeda’s fourth bid for Shire on Friday was pitched at 47 pounds per share and comprised 26 pounds in Takeda stock and 21 pounds in cash. That valued Shire at 44.3 billion pounds ($61.85 billion).\nUnder British rules, Takeda has until 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Wednesday to make a firm offer or walk away from Shire. That deadline can be extended at the request of Shire.\n$1 = 0.7163 pounds Reporting by Ben Martin; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:24:50.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
