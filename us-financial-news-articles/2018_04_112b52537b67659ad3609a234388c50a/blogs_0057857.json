In 2017, the operating margin for Google (excluding long-term bets) was more than 30 percent, which is where it's hovered for years. And this figure includes businesses like cloud and hardware, which probably have a much lower margin than its core advertising business (Google does not break out operating profit or loss for these sub-businesses).\nSo in all likelihood, any new business it tries to conquer will have a lower profit margin.\nAmazon, meanwhile, has famously run its retail business on a razor-thin margin -- it booked a tiny operating loss on $160 billion in revenue in 2017 -- so if it can win in other areas it will almost certainly deliver higher margins over time. That's already happening with its fast-growing cloud business, which had a profit margin of 25 percent (earning $4.3 billion on $17.5 billion in revenue) in 2017.\nMacquarie raised its price forecast for Amazon and predicts it will be the first trillion-dollar company . It maintains an outperform rating for Alphabet.\n\"GOOG is clearly still doing the right thing and investing for the future, but that is a lower margin future,\" Schacter wrote, while noting that Alphabet has always focused more on incremental operating profit than margins.\nshow chapters Jim Cramer on Amazon: This is best quarter of a company I’ve ever seen 6 Hours Ago | 02:06", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T21:24:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
