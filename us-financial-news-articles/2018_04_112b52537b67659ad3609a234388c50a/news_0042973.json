Many “teapot” refineries produce less than 100,000 bpd.\n“Hengli’s world-class scale, sophisticated refinery configuration that favors high-end petrochemicals and its location means it will be a killer competitor to teapots,” said Harry Liu of consultancy IHS Markit.\nWith the government stepping up scrutiny over their tax and environmental practices, Liu predicted some of the smaller of the independents close in the next two years as a result of the competition.\nHengli started as a small chemical fiber maker and operates a 6.6 million tonnes per year plant making purified terephthalic acid (PTA), the world’s largest. PTA is a feedstock for producing polyester.\nAlthough the NDRC grants approval for quotas, the Commerce Ministry determines how much of a quota can be put to use.\n“For next year, we are confident of getting 20 million tonnes of allowances from the government,” the senior Hengli official said.\nHe said the refinery’s two crude distillation units (CDU) are designed to process 30 percent of Saudi Arabia’s Arab Medium crude, 60 percent of Saudi Heavy and 10 percent Qatar Marine crude.\nThe company has recently applied for a quota to export fuel oil.\nThe senior Hengli official and another company official said Hengli would market its refined fuel to state-owned Sinopec and PetroChina, as well as independent wholesalers and distributors. There is no near-term plan to build its own retailing network because of the cost.\nIn January, Hengli signed a framework deal with state-run Sinochem Group to cooperate on imports of crude oil and the marketing of refined fuel.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Neil Fullick and Christian Schmollinger\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
