This increase was primarily in construction loans and commercial real estate loans. The FDIC-acquired loan portfolios had net decreases totaling $12.2 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and consumer auto loans outstanding decreased $34.0 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Outstanding net loan receivable balances increased $35.4 million, from $3.73 billion at December 31, 2017 to $3.76 billion at March 31, 2018. Asset Quality : Non-performing assets and potential problem loans, excluding those acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions which are accounted for and analyzed as loan pools rather than individual loans, totaled $35.1 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $679,000 from $35.8 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $27.4 million (0.62% of total assets), down $472,000 from $27.8 million (0.63% of total assets) at December 31, 2017. Capital : The capital position of the Company continues to be strong, significantly exceeding the thresholds established by regulators. On a preliminary basis, as of March 31, 2018, the Company's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.4%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.0%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.5%, and Total Capital Ratio was 14.1%. Net Interest Income : Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $737,000 to $39.4 million compared to $38.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest income was $39.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 3.93% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.78% for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net interest margin compared to both the prior year first quarter and the quarter ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate paid on deposits and other borrowings. The positive impact on net interest margin from the additional yield accretion on acquired loan pools that was recorded during the period was 12, 18 and 7 basis points for the quarters ended March 31, 2018, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively. For further discussion of the additional yield accretion of the discount on acquired loan pools, see \"Net Interest Income.\"\nGreat Southern Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:GSBC), the holding company for Great Southern Bank, today reported that preliminary earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $0.95 per diluted common share ($13.5 million available to common shareholders) compared to $0.81 per diluted common share ($11.5 million available to common shareholders) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, annualized return on average common equity was 11.22%, return on average assets was 1.23%, and net interest margin was 3.93%, compared to 10.50%, 1.03% and 3.78%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nPresident and CEO Joseph W. Turner commented, \"Our first quarter results were underscored by strong earnings supported by an expanded core margin, continued expense containment and a lower effective tax rate. Core net interest margin for the first quarter 2018 expanded to 3.81%, which was an increase of 22 and 13 basis points from the year ago quarter and most recent linked quarter, respectively. The primary driver of the margin expansion was increased yields in most of our loan categories. In addition, with the enactment of the federal tax legislation, the Company's effective corporate tax rate significantly decreased. The effective tax rate was 16.4% for the first quarter 2018 as compared to 26.1% during the same period in 2017.\nCommercial real estate and construction loan production was relatively strong during the first quarter, as we are coming off of another year of more than $1 billion in loan originations throughout our franchise. Total gross loans, including the undisbursed portion of loans and excluding FDIC-assisted acquired loans and mortgages held for sale, increased $80.3 million, or 1.8%, from the end of 2017. Credit quality during the quarter was stable with small decreases in non-performing loans and potential problem loans.\"\nTurner continued, \"With our strong earnings and capital levels, we were pleased to increase the quarterly dividend announced in March by $0.04 per common share to $0.28 per common share, representing a payout ratio of approximately 30%. We're proud that we have paid a dividend every quarter to our stockholders since going public in December 1989.\"\nSelected Financial Data:\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet interest income\n$ 39,438\n$ 38,701\nProvision for loan losses\n1,950\n2,250\nNon-interest income\n6,935\n7,698\nNon-interest expense\n28,312\n28,573\nProvision for income taxes\n2,645\n4,058\nNet income and net income available to\ncommon shareholders\n$ 13,466\n$ 11,518\nEarnings per diluted common share\n$ 0.95\n$ 0.81\nNET INTEREST INCOME\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $737,000 to $39.4 million compared to $38.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 3.93% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.78% in the same period of 2017, an increase of 15 basis points. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the net interest margin increased 18 basis points compared to the net interest margin of 3.75% in the three months ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the margin from the prior year first quarter was primarily the result of increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on deposits and other borrowings and a reduction in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the acquired loan pools compared to the prior year period. The increase in the margin from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to the same factors described above and an increase in the additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the acquired loan pools. The average interest rate spread was 3.74% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.63% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 3.58% for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe Company's net interest margin has been positively impacted by significant additional yield accretion recognized in conjunction with updated estimates of the fair value of the loan pools acquired in the 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2014 FDIC-assisted transactions. On an on-going basis, the Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected from the acquired loan pools. For each of the loan portfolios acquired, the cash flow estimates increased during the current and prior periods presented below, based on payment histories and reduced credit loss expectations. This resulted in increased income that has been spread, on a level-yield basis, over the remaining expected lives of the loan pools (and, therefore, has decreased over time). In the prior year period, the increases in expected cash flows also reduced the amount of expected reimbursements under the loss sharing agreements with the FDIC (when such agreements were in place), which were recorded as indemnification assets, with such reductions amortized on a comparable basis over the remainder of the terms of the loss sharing agreements or the remaining expected lives of the loan pools, whichever was shorter. Additional estimated cash flows totaling approximately $1.8 million and $155,000 were recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to all of these loan pools.\nThe impact of adjustments on all portfolios acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions for the reporting periods presented is shown below:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(In thousands, except basis points data)\nImpact on net interest income/\nnet interest margin (in basis points)\n$ 1,157\n12 bps\n$ 1,980\n19 bps\nNon-interest income\n—\n(634)\nNet impact to pre-tax income\n$ 1,157\n$ 1,346\nBecause these adjustments will be recognized generally over the remaining lives of the loan pools, they will impact future periods as well. The remaining accretable yield adjustment that will affect interest income is $3.2 million. Of the remaining adjustments affecting interest income, we expect to recognize $2.0 million of interest income during the remainder of 2018. Additional adjustments may be recorded in future periods from the FDIC-assisted transactions, as the Company continues to estimate expected cash flows from the acquired loan pools.\nExcluding the impact of the additional yield accretion, net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018, increased 22 basis points when compared to the year-ago period. The increase in net interest margin in the three month period is primarily due to increased yields in most loan categories and higher overall yields on investments and interest-earning deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank, partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate on deposits.\nFor additional information on net interest income components, see the \"Average Balances, Interest Rates and Yields\" tables in this release.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income decreased $763,000 to $6.9 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the following items:\nAmortization of income related to business acquisitions: Because of the termination of the loss sharing agreements in previous years, the net amortization expense related to business acquisitions was $-0- for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $489,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which reduced non-interest income by that amount in the previous year. Late charges and fees on loans: Late charges and fees on loans decreased $489,000 compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to fees on loan payoffs totaling $502,000 received on two large commercial loans during the 2017 quarter, with no similar large fees in the current year quarter. Net gains on loan sales: Net gains on loan sales decreased $410,000 compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to a decrease in originations of fixed-rate loans during the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period. Fixed rate single-family mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market. In 2018, the Company has originated more variable-rate single-family mortgage loans, which have been retained in the Company's portfolio. Other income: Other income decreased $341,000 compared to the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to final residual income related to certain federal tax credits in the prior year quarter, which was not repeated in the current year quarter.\nNON-INTEREST EXPENSE\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, non-interest expense decreased $261,000 to $28.3 million when compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the following items:\nSalaries and employee benefits: Salaries and employee benefits decreased $710,000 from the prior year quarter. Residential loan originations have been lower in the current year period than in the prior year period, resulting in less incentive compensation for loan originators and staff. The Company has also reorganized some staff functions over the past year to operate more efficiently. In addition, there are budgeted but unfilled positions in various areas of the Company that have resulted in lower compensation costs in some areas. Office supplies and printing: Office supplies and printing decreased $464,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017. During the 2017 quarter the Bank incurred printing and other costs totaling $373,000 related to the replacement of a portion of customer debit cards with chip-enabled cards, which was not repeated in the current year period. Expense on foreclosed assets: Expense on foreclosed assets increased $566,000 compared to the prior year period primarily due to valuation write-downs of certain foreclosed assets during the current period, totaling approximately $617,000, and higher levels of expense related to consumer repossessions than in the year ago quarter, partially offset by valuation write-downs in the prior year quarter. Legal, audit and other professional fees: Legal, audit and other professional fees increased $489,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The Company's other professional fees were higher during the current year quarter due to consulting fees related to ongoing process improvement initiatives and fees paid related to the implementation of the Company's new commercial loan system. In the 2017 quarter, the Company received some large recoveries of legal fees on loans totaling $72,000, which was not repeated in the current year quarter.\nThe Company's efficiency ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was 61.05% compared to 61.58% for the same quarter in 2017. The decrease in the ratio in the 2018 three month period was primarily due to a small decrease in non-interest expense and an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income. The Company's ratio of non-interest expense to average assets increased from 2.55% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to 2.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in the current three month period ratio was due to a decrease in average assets in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period. Average assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased $115.2 million, or 2.6%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to decreases in investment securities and other interest-earning assets, loans receivable and other non-earning assets.\nINCOME TAXES\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Act\"), was signed into law. Among other things, the Act permanently lowers the corporate federal income tax rate to 21% from the prior maximum rate of 35%, effective for tax years including or commencing January 1, 2018. The Company currently expects its effective tax rate (combined federal and state) to decrease from approximately 26.7% in 2017 to approximately 15.5% to 17.5% in 2018, mainly as a result of the Act.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's effective tax rate was 16.4% and 26.1%, respectively. These effective rates were lower than the statutory federal tax rates of 21% (2018) and 35% (2017), due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax-exempt investments and tax-exempt loans which reduced the Company's effective tax rate. The Company's effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the Company's utilization of tax credits and the level of tax-exempt investments and loans and the overall level of pre-tax income. The Company's effective income tax rate is currently expected to continue to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to the factors noted above.\nCAPITAL\nAs of March 31, 2018, total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity were $480.0 million (10.9% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $34.02 per common share. Total stockholders' equity and common stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017, were $471.7 million (10.7% of total assets), equivalent to a book value of $33.48 per common share. At March 31, 2018, the Company's tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 10.7%, compared to 10.5% at December 31, 2017.\nOn a preliminary basis, as of March 31, 2018, the Company's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 11.4%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.0%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 11.5%, and Total Capital Ratio was 14.1%. On March 31, 2018, and on a preliminary basis, the Bank's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 12.2%, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.4%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 12.4%, and Total Capital Ratio was 13.2%.\nEffective April 18, 2018, the Company approved a new common stock repurchase plan. The plan authorizes the repurchase of up to 500,000 shares of its common stock, representing approximately 3.5% of outstanding shares. The new plan replaces and terminates the Company's repurchase plan that was approved November 15, 2006.\nThe Company has historically utilized stock buy-back programs from time to time as long as management believed that repurchasing the stock would contribute to the overall growth of shareholder value. The number of shares of stock that will be repurchased at any particular time and the prices that will be paid are subject to many factors, several of which are outside the control of the Company. The primary factors, however, are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time, the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market, and the projected impact on the Company's earnings per share and capital.\nLOANS\nTotal gross loans (including the undisbursed portion of loans), excluding FDIC-assisted acquired loans and mortgage loans held for sale, increased $80.3 million, or 1.8%, from December 31, 2017, to March 31, 2018. This increase was primarily in construction loans ($61 million) and commercial real estate loans ($58 million). These increases were partially offset by decreases in consumer auto loans ($34 million). The FDIC-acquired loan portfolios had net decreases totaling $12.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nLoan commitments and the unfunded portion of loans at the dates indicated were as follows (in thousands):\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2015\nClosed loans with unused available lines\nSecured by real estate (one- to four-family)\n$ 138,375\n$ 133,587\n$ 123,433\n$ 105,390\nSecured by real estate (not one- to four-family)\n12,382\n10,836\n26,062\n21,857\nNot secured by real estate - commercial business\n108,262\n113,317\n79,937\n63,865\nClosed construction loans with unused\navailable lines\nSecured by real estate (one-to four-family)\n29,757\n20,919\n10,047\n14,242\nSecured by real estate (not one-to four-family)\n749,926\n718,277\n542,326\n385,969\nLoan Commitments not closed\nSecured by real estate (one-to four-family)\n37,144\n23,340\n15,884\n13,411\nSecured by real estate (not one-to four-family)\n200,192\n156,658\n119,126\n120,817\nNot secured by real estate - commercial business\n12,995\n4,870\n7,022\n—\n$ 1,289,033\n$ 1,181,804\n$ 923,837\n$ 725,551\nFor further information about the Company's loan portfolio, please see the quarterly loan portfolio presentation available on the Company's Investor Relations website under \"Presentations.\"\nPROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES\nManagement records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge-offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the Bank. The amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors, including, but not limited to, past loss experience, current portfolio mix, actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and internal as well as external reviews. The levels of non-performing assets, potential problem loans, loan loss provisions and net charge-offs fluctuate from period to period and are difficult to predict.\nWeak economic conditions, higher inflation or interest rates, or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and/or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense. Management maintains various controls in an attempt to limit future losses, such as a watch list of possible problem loans, documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio. Additional procedures provide for frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size, loan type, delinquencies, financial analysis, on-going correspondence with borrowers and problem loan work-outs. Management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible, or represent a greater risk of loss, and makes additional provisions to expense, if necessary, to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level.\nThe provision for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, decreased $300,000 to $2.0 million compared with $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $36.3 million and $36.5 million, respectively. Total net charge-offs were $2.1 million and $2.7 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, $1.3 million of the $2.1 million of net charge-offs were in the consumer auto category. In response to a more challenging consumer credit environment, the Company tightened its underwriting guidelines on automobile lending in the latter part of 2016. Management took this step in an effort to improve credit quality in the portfolio and lower delinquencies and charge-offs. This action also resulted in a lower level of origination volume and, as such, the outstanding balance of the Company's automobile loans declined approximately $34 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018. We expect to see further declines in the automobile loan outstanding balance through the remainder of 2018 as well. In addition, three commercial loan relationships amounted to $626,000 of the total charge-offs during the current quarter. General market conditions and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects contributed to the level of provisions and charge-offs. As assets were categorized as potential problem loans, non-performing loans or foreclosed assets, evaluations were made of the values of these assets with corresponding charge-offs as appropriate.\nIn June 2017, the loss sharing agreements for Inter Savings Bank were terminated. In April 2016, the loss sharing agreements for Team Bank, Vantus Bank and Sun Security Bank were terminated. Loans acquired from the FDIC related to Valley Bank did not have a loss sharing agreement. All acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values, which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition date. These loan pools are systematically reviewed by the Company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition. Techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to those used to determine the risk of loss for the legacy Great Southern Bank portfolio, with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics. Review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes review of financial information, collateral valuations and customer interaction to determine if additional reserves are warranted.\nThe Bank's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, excluding FDIC-acquired loans, was 1.02% and 1.01% at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the Bank's loan portfolio at March 31, 2018, based on recent reviews of the Bank's loan portfolio and current economic conditions. If economic conditions were to deteriorate or management's assessment of the loan portfolio were to change, it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required, thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition.\nASSET QUALITY\nFormer TeamBank, Vantus Bank, Sun Security Bank, InterBank and Valley Bank non-performing assets, including foreclosed assets and potential problem loans, are not included in the totals or in the discussion of non-performing loans, potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below. These assets were initially recorded at their estimated fair values as of their acquisition dates and are accounted for in pools; therefore, these loan pools are analyzed rather than the individual loans. The performance of the loan pools acquired in each of the five transactions has been better than expectations as of the acquisition dates.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower's circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate.\nNon-performing assets, excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired assets, at March 31, 2018 were $27.4 million, a decrease of $472,000 from $27.8 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets, excluding all FDIC-assisted acquired assets, as a percentage of total assets were 0.62% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.63% at December 31, 2017.\nCompared to December 31, 2017, non-performing loans decreased $2.0 million to $9.3 million at March 31, 2018, and foreclosed assets increased $1.4 million to $18.0 million at March 31, 2018. Non-performing commercial business loans comprised $3.3 million, or 34.9%, of the total $9.3 million of non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.2 million from December 31, 2017. Non-performing consumer loans comprised $2.8 million, or 30.4%, of the total non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $427,000 from December 31, 2017. Non-performing one- to four-family residential loans comprised $2.8 million, or 29.8%, of the total non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, an increase of $56,000 from December 31, 2017. Non-performing commercial real estate loans comprised $360,000, or 3.9%, of the total non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $866,000 from December 31, 2017. Non-performing construction and land development loans comprised $96,000, or 1.0%, of the total non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $2,000 from December 31, 2017. Non-performing other residential loans were $-0- at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.9 million from December 31, 2017, due to the transfer to foreclosed assets and related charge-downs of the one property previously in this category of non-performing loans.\nCompared to December 31, 2017, potential problem loans decreased $207,000 to $7.7 million at March 31, 2018. The decrease during the quarter was due to $610,000 in payments, $26,000 in charge-offs and $9,000 in loans removed from potential problem loans, partially offset by the addition of $438,000 of loans to potential problem loans.\nActivity in the non-performing loans category during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was as follows:\nBeginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\nAdditions to\nNon-\nPerforming\nRemoved\nfrom Non-\nPerforming\nTransfers\nto Potential\nProblem\nLoans\nTransfers to\nForeclosed\nAssets and\nRepossessions\nCharge-Offs\nPayments\nEnding\nBalance,\nMarch 31\n(In thousands)\nOne- to four-family construction\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\nSubdivision construction\n98\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(2)\n96\nLand development\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nCommercial construction\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOne- to four-family residential\n2,728\n266\n—\n—\n(34)\n(12)\n(164)\n2,784\nOther residential\n1,877\n2\n—\n—\n(1,601)\n(278)\n—\n—\nCommercial real estate\n1,226\n157\n—\n—\n(894)\n(101)\n(28)\n360\nCommercial business\n2,063\n1,751\n—\n—\n—\n(321)\n(233)\n3,260\nConsumer\n3,263\n1,059\n—\n(307)\n(318)\n(555)\n(306)\n2,836\nTotal\n$ 11,255\n$ 3,235\n$ —\n$ (307)\n$ (2,847)\n$ (1,267)\n$ (733)\n$ 9,336\nAt March 31, 2018, the non-performing commercial business category included nine loans, seven of which were added in the current quarter. The largest relationship in this category included 2 loans and totaled $1.5 million, or 46.3% of the total category. This relationship was previously collateralized by commercial real estate which has been foreclosed upon and subsequently sold. Collection efforts are currently being pursued against the guarantors of the credit relationship. The second largest relationship in the commercial business category, which was added during the current quarter totaled $1.2 million, or 37.4% of the total category.

The largest relationship in this category, which is made up of three loans totaling $5.2 million, or 98.2% of the total category, is collateralized by theatre and retail property in Branson, Mo. This is a long-term customer of the Bank and these loans were all originated prior to 2008. The borrower experienced cash flow issues due to vacancies in some of the properties and the loans were added to potential problem loans during the third quarter of 2017. Payments of $550,000 were received on these loans during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The one- to four-family residential category of potential problem loans included 19 loans, three of which were added during the current quarter. The consumer category of potential problem loans included 61 loans, 25 of which were added during the current quarter. The commercial business category of potential problem loans included four loans.\nActivity in foreclosed assets and repossessions during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, excluding $3.3 million in foreclosed assets related to loans acquired in FDIC-assisted transactions and $1.6 million in properties which were not acquired through foreclosure, was as follows:\nBeginning\nBalance,\nJanuary 1\nAdditions\nORE and\nRepossession\nSales\nCapitalized\nCosts\nORE and\nRepossession\nWrite-Downs\nEnding\nBalance,\nMarch 31\n(In thousands)\nOne-to four-family construction\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\n$ —\nSubdivision construction\n5,413\n—\n(38)\n—\n(539)\n4,836\nLand development\n7,729\n—\n(45)\n—\n—\n7,684\nCommercial construction\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOne- to four-family residential\n112\n44\n(65)\n—\n—\n91\nOther residential\n140\n1,601\n(140)\n—\n—\n1,601\nCommercial real estate\n1,194\n894\n—\n—\n—\n2,088\nCommercial business\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nConsumer\n1,987\n2,491\n(2,756)\n—\n—\n1,722\nTotal\n$ 16,575\n$ 5,030\n$ (3,044)\n$ —\n$ (539)\n$ 18,022\nAt March 31, 2018, the land development category of foreclosed assets included 18 properties, the largest of which was located in the Branson, Mo., area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 16.2% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the land development category of foreclosed assets, 36.3% and 21.7% was located in the Branson, Mo. and the northwest Arkansas areas, respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets included 15 properties, the largest of which was located in the Springfield, Mo. metropolitan area and had a balance of $1.2 million, or 25.5% of the total category. Of the total dollar amount in the subdivision construction category of foreclosed assets, 37.6% and 25.5% is located in Branson, Mo. and Springfield, Mo., respectively, including the largest property previously mentioned. The commercial real estate category of foreclosed assets included six properties, three of which were new during the current quarter. The largest property in the commercial real estate category, which was recreational property in the St. Louis area and was added during the current quarter, had a balance of $652,000, or 31.2% of the total category. The other residential category of foreclosed assets included one property, which was added during the current quarter totaling $1.6 million, and is an apartment building in central Missouri. The larger amount of additions and sales under consumer loans are due to a higher volume of repossessions of automobiles, which generally are subject to a shorter repossession process. The Company experienced increased levels of delinquencies and repossessions in indirect and used automobile loans throughout 2016 and 2017. This trend generally continued into the first quarter of 2018.\nBUSINESS INITIATIVES\nOn March 20, 2018, the Company announced that it has entered into a purchase and assumption agreement to sell its deposit accounts and all four of its branches in the Omaha, Neb., metropolitan market to Lincoln, Neb.-based West Gate Bank. Great Southern plans to maintain a Commercial Loan Office in the Omaha market.\nPursuant to the purchase and assumption agreement, the Bank will sell branch deposits of approximately $58 million and sell substantially all branch-related real estate, fixed assets and ATMs. The transaction is expected to close in July 2018, pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Subject to deposit balances at the time of closing, the Company estimates that it will record a pre-tax gain of approximately $6.5–$7.0 million, or $0.35–$0.38 (after tax) per diluted share, based on the expected deposit premium and the sales price of the branch assets. As a result of this transaction, the Company expects that non-interest income will decrease $300,000–$350,000 annually, non-interest expense will decrease by $1.1– $1.2 million annually, and interest expense will increase by $300,000-$350,000 annually (based on current interest rates for non-deposit funds).\nIn June 2018, the Company plans to consolidate operations of a banking center into a nearby office in Paola, Kan. The banking center, located at 1 S. Pearl Street, will close at the end of business on June 22, 2018, and all accounts will automatically transfer to the banking center at 1515 Baptiste Drive, less than a mile away. After the consolidation date, a deposit-taking ATM and interactive teller machine will remain available for customers at the S. Pearl Street building.\nGreat Southern Bancorp, Inc. will hold its 29th Annual Meeting of Shareholders at 10:00 a.m. CDT on Wednesday, May 9, 2018, at the Great Southern Operations Center, 218 S.
