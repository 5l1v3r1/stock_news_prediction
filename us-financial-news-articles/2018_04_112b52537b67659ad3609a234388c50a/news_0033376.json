Ghali, Hill’s President and Chief Operating Officer, said of the promotion, “Mohammed’s work in growing our MER business and overseeing our many mega-projects in the area was exceptional, and we thank him for his leadership and dedication. Going forward, Abdo brings the right experience to continue to refine and improve our MER operations, and to build on the hard work accomplished to date in the region.”\nHill International, with more than 3,000 professionals in more than 50 offices worldwide, provides program management, project management, construction management and other consulting services to clients in a variety of market sectors.
