Previously, changes in the fair value of marketable securities were recognized through “accumulated other comprehensive income” on Vornado’s consolidated balance sheets and did not impact its consolidated statements of income;\n$23.5 million of expense related to Vornado’s share of potential additional New York City real property transfer taxes which Vornado is contesting as previously disclosed on Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 2, 2018;\n$14.5 million of expense for the write-off of Series G and Series I issuance costs upon their redemption in January 2018 as previously disclosed on Annual Report on Form 10-K dated February 12, 2018;\n$6.5 million net loss from other items.\nThe above amounts resulted in a reduction in net income of $0.39 per diluted share which will be included in Vornado’s first quarter 2018 “net loss attributable to common shareholders” and will be excluded from “net income attributable to common shareholders, as adjusted.” On an FFO basis, the above amounts resulted in a reduction of $0.37 per diluted share which will be included in “total FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions” and will be excluded from “FFO attributable to common shareholders plus assumed conversions, as adjusted.”\nThe above amounts are preliminary estimates. There can be no assurance that Vornado’s final results will not differ from these preliminary estimates as a result of quarter-end closing, review procedures, or review adjustments, and any such changes could be material.\nFFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciated real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified non-cash items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition to FFO, we also disclose FFO, as adjusted. Although this non-GAAP measure clearly differs from NAREIT’s definition of FFO, we believe it provides a meaningful presentation of operating performance.\nCertain statements contained herein may constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
