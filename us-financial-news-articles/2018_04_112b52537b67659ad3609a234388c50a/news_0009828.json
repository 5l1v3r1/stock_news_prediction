We noted there are several uncertainties around the baseline inflation path which is why we kept the stance neutral and rate unchanged.”\nInflation risks included a proposed increase in the minimum purchase price of foodgrains, fiscal slippage worries and volatility in global crude oil prices, he added.\nThe Reserve Bank of India kept its policy rates on hold for the fourth straight meeting and toned down its inflation rhetoric, cheering markets as inflationary pressures eased more than expected.
