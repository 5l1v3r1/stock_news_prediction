Shares in Shire were up 6.3 percent at 39.90 pounds at 1113 GMT in London.\nTakeda confirmed last month it was considering an offer for Shire, which sells treatments for rare diseases and attention deficit disorder.\nA takeover would be transformational for Takeda, which has a market value of about $37.8 billion, making it smaller than its bid target.\nIts bid values Shire at approximately 43 billion pounds, or $61 billion, Thomson Reuters data showed.\nA spokesman for Takeda declined to comment and Shire did not reply to a request for comment.\nThe bid comes amid a surge in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the UK as companies take advantage of cheap debt to pursue dealmaking opportunities.\nThe value of M&A involving British firms rose by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion in the first three months of the year, the most since 2007, Thomson Reuters data shows.\n$1 = 0.7039 pounds Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Ben Martin; editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:08:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
