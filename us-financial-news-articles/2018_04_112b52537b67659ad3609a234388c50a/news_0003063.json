What we did do was accomplish a 15.8% increase in after tax income to $14,114,000, the second highest in our company’s history.\n“There were numerous subplots to this year’s income. The change in tax laws was favorable, the impact of accounting changes varies depending on the quarter but was probably negative at year end, property valuations, especially in the Midwest, were definitely unfavorable, as were two hurricanes in our major mortgage markets. The interest rate backdrop remains challenging, rates rising enough to quell mortgage volumes industrywide, but not enough to increase substantially the return on our invested assets. Nevertheless, we accomplished a 12% return on shareholders equity and a 13% increase in earnings per share.”\nSNFC has three business segments. The following table shows the revenues and earnings before taxes for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to 2016, for each of the three business segments:\nRevenues Earnings before Taxes 2017 2016 2017 2016 Life Insurance $ 100,691,000 $ 95,606,000 5.3 % $ 4,707,000 $ 7,858,000 (40.1 %) Cemeteries/Mortuaries $ 13,387,000 $ 12,880,000 3.9 % $ 1,698,000 $ 1,219,000 39.3 % Mortgages $ 162,848,000 $ 195,849,000 (16.9 %) $ 1,127,000 $ 10,626,000 (89.4 %) Total $ 276,926,000 $ 304,335,000 (9.0 %) $ 7,532,000 $ 19,703,000 (61.8 %)\nNet earnings per common share was $.87 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net earnings of $.77 per share for the prior year, as adjusted for the effect of annual stock dividends.
