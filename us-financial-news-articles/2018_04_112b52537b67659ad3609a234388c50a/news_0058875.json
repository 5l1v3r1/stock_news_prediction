He has also denied being the source of the leaked names.\n“Chief Prosecutor Jan Tibbling of the Swedish Economic Crime Authority has started a preliminary investigation related to financial crime ... connected with the Swedish Academy,” the financial crime unit said in a statement.\nTibbling said he would not give further information on which crimes were being investigated nor the persons or people who were involved.\nThe Swedish Academy could not immediately be reached by telephone or email for comment. Arnault’s lawyer could also not immediately be reached for comment.\nThe workings of the normally secretive institution have come under intense scrutiny in recent weeks as a result of the allegations and a bitter and very public split among its members about how to handle them.\nThe head of the Academy and several of its members have stepped down. Sweden’s King Carl Gustaf - the patron of the institution founded by his forbear Gustav III in 1786 - has had to step in and promise to reform its arcane statutes.\nUntil now, Academy members have been appointed for life and resignations have been extremely rare. Even when members step down, they have not been able to formally leave.\nThe Nobel Foundation Board, which administers the money left by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel to fund the awards that bear his name, has criticised the Swedish Academy for potentially tarnishing the reputation of the Nobel Prize.
