REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo\nTotal produced 2.703 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the first quarter, driven by ramp-ups and new acquisitions, up more than 5 percent compared to the same period in 2017, and above analysts’ estimates of 2.663 million boe/d.\nIt was the company’s highest output ever recorded in a quarter, surpassing a previous record of 2.66 million boe/d in 2003.\nNet adjusted profit came in at $2.9 billion, beating analysts’ forecast of $2.77 billion in the quarter.\n“Oil prices continued to rebound in the first quarter 2018,” said Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne in a statement.\n“Brent rose to an average of $67 per barrel, supported by strong demand, OPEC-non-OPEC compliance and geopolitical tensions,” he also said.\n“Cash flow after organic investments increased to $2.8 billion, up by more than 50 percent from a year ago, thanks to good operational performance and continued spending discipline,” added Pouyanne.
