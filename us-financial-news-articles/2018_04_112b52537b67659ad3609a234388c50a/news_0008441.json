He attributed the trade actions to Trump's \"Art of the Deal\" negotiating style. \"You go out there with trumpets and bullhorns, and you argue 20 and your negotiator on the other side of the table argues 10. You settle at 15,\" Doll said.\nAnother reason for calming stocks is that \"the market is looking at some other things beyond trade,\" Doll said. \"Starting next week we're going to look at some pretty good earnings.\"\nDespite strong earnings and the possibility of easing trade tensions, market jitters may continue, Doll said. \"I still think we're in a fragile, volatile sort of stage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T19:36:00.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
