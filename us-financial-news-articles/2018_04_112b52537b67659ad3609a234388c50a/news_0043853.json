Today we’re concentrating on two in particular, from Russia and Germany,” Rafael Alarcon said at a news conference.\nBolivia boasts nearly a quarter of the world’s known resources of the world’s lightest metal. Still, production lags far behind neighboring Chile and Argentina.\nAlarcon said the winning candidate would bring both the expertise and technology necessary to develop the resource, from raw material to battery production, and be required to form a partnership with the state.\nBolivia’s state-run lithium company YLB says it anticipates the partner will invest between $750 million and $1 billion in factories to meet rising demand from China and other countries for lithium-ion batteries.\nReporting by Daniel Ramos in Bolivia, writing by Dave Sherwood\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:00:31.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
