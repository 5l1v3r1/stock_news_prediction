Does their mission consist of shooting at civilians?” said one demonstrator, who gave his name only as Youssouf.\nAtahirou Balla Dodo, the mayor of the Bangui district in which PK5 is located, told Reuters that a total of 21 people were killed in the clashes. Seventeen were brought to MINUSCA, while four others, including two women and two children, had remained at a mosque.\nThe bodies were later removed from MINUSCA by the local Red Cross.\nMedical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), which operates one of the main hospitals in Bangui, said it had treated more than 40 people for gunshot wounds on Tuesday.\nMINUSCA officials were not immediately available on Wednesday to comment on the accusations that peacekeepers were responsible for the deaths.\nViolence increased in Central African Republic after mainly Muslim Seleka rebels ousted president Francois Bozize in 2013, provoking retaliation killings by “anti-balaka” armed groups, drawn largely from Christian communities.\nSelf-styled Muslim self-defence groups sprang up in PK5, claiming to protect the Muslim civilians concentrated there against efforts to drive them out.\nBut MINUSCA now accuses them of extortion and violence against civilians and said it had launched the operation in PK5 at the request of the neighbourhood’s residents.\nIn a statement late on Tuesday MINUSCA said that Rwandan peacekeepers had come under attack.\n“For four hours, the MINUSCA force had to push back heavily armed elements of criminal gangs who deliberately opened fire on the international forces, who fired back,” it said. “Any attack against (U.N. troops) can constitute a war crime.”\nAdditional reporting by Crispin Dembassa-Kette; Writing by Joe Bavier; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T12:10:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
