At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Bank also held a $0.1 billion long-term U.S. Treasury Note classified as trading.\nThe Bank's short-term liquidity portfolio, which is comprised substantially of overnight federal funds sold and overnight reverse repurchase agreements, totaled $11.6 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.5 billion at December 31, 2017.\nThe Bank's retained earnings increased to $972 million at March 31, 2018 from $942 million at December 31, 2017.
