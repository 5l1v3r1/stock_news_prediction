The stock is up 16 percent so far this year, sharply outperforming a 3 percent rise in the Thomson Reuters Europe Steel Index .\nSSAB said the steel tariffs introduced in the quarter had so far had a limited impact on its business.\nThe company also said contract prices and longer lead times meant a sharp rise in North American heavy plate spot prices since November only began to boost SSAB’s margins toward the end of the quarter.\nSSAB forecast good underlying demand for high-strength steels in most markets during the second quarter.\n$1 = 8.4168 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom Editing by Niklas Pollard and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:46:07.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
