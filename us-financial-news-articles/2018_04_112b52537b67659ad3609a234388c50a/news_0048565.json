Similar teams operate in Scotland and Wales.\n“Loan sharks are a blight on society and prey on vulnerable people who struggle to make ends meet,” said Tony Quigley, the head of the English IMLT. “These criminals use callous methods to enforce repayment and victims are often subjected to threats, intimidation and violence.”\nIMLTs are funded by a levy imposed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulator on thousands of companies offering consumers credit.\nIn a report on illegal money lending published last November, the FCA said the market operated below the regulatory radar, with both consumers and lenders involved hard to reach and reluctant to talk.\nLenders tended to keep within local boundaries and relied on word of mouth for customers.\n“One young woman was punched in the face at a house party in front of a room full of her peers as punishment for non-payment,” it Quote: d one IMLT report as saying. “No one would report the attacker even though many people saw what happened and who had done it.”\nPeople who used loan sharks are often vulnerable to exploitation, either because of financial desperation or inherent vulnerability to influence and manipulation.\nIllegal lenders would seek them out, put them in their debt and seek to keep them there, providing lenders with an ongoing income stream, the FCA said.\n$1 = 0.7170 pounds Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T02:29:35.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
