Jonathan Viller singled home Pina and Aguilar scored on a ground out by Lorenzo Cain.\nThe Padres got a brief respite when first baseman Eric Hosmer threw out Orlando Arcia at the plate for the second out.\nBut Braun then lined a 0 -2 pitch from Hand 396 feet into the second deck in left.\nReliever Oliver Drake was credited for the win (1-0). Corey Knebel got the save (1). Hand took the loss (0-1).\nChacin, who had a 9-4 record and a 1.79 earned run average for the Padres in 16 starts at Petco Park last year, gave up four runs on seven hits (including the two homers) Friday night.\nMeantime, Padres left-handed starter Joey Lucchesi allowed three runs on seven hits in 4 2/3 innings in his Major League debut.\nMilwaukee took a 2-0 lead in the first against Lucchesi on a double by Cain, a single by Travis Shaw and a double by Domingo Santana.\nThe Padres struck for three in the bottom of the second. Freddy Galvis opened the inning with a single ahead of the homers by Spangenberg and Hedges, who had gone 0-for-24 to start the 2017 season.\nMargot extended the lead to 4-2 in the fourth with a one-out RBI single. Milwaukee cut the lead to 4-3 in the fifth when Cain opened the inning with his second double of the game and scored on Braun’s sacrifice fly.\nCarlos Asuaje returned the Padres to a two-run lead in the seventh with a two-out RBI double that scored Matt Szczur, who pinch-ran for Wil Myers. The Padres scored their final run in the eighth on a two-out RBI double by Hosmer.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:31:07.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
