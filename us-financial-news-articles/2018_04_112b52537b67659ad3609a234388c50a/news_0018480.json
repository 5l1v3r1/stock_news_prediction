But the risk-off sentiment weighed on Treasury yields, pushing financial stocks down 1.4 percent.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 231.41 points, or 0.95 percent, to 24,176.59, the S&P 500 lost 15.01 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,641.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.41 points, or 0.37 percent, to 7,067.90.\nFacebook shares added the most to the S&P, gaining 1.2 percent as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress for a second day.\nThe shares were down about 0.5 percent at the start of Zuckerberg’s testimony, but they reversed course as he pushed back on Congress members’ suggestions that users do not have enough control of their data.\nIndustrial distributor Fastenal fell 6.4 percent after its earnings missed expectations. The stock was the biggest decliner on the S&P, followed by peer WW Grainger’s 4.2 percent drop.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 6 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 43 new highs and 23 new lows.
