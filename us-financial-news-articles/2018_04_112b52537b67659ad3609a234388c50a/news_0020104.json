But BlackRock benefited from its large footprint in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been taking market share away from pricier investment products for several years. \nBlackRock attracted nearly $57 billion in new cash from clients in the latest quarter. Its iShares ETFs unit was the biggest contributor, drawing $35 billion in net inflows. \n“It’s better to be BlackRock in this atmosphere,” BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview. \n“We have always differentiated ourselves in more volatile times.” \nMarkets swung wildly during the first three months of the year as early enthusiasm over U.S. corporate tax cuts was soon blunted by concerns about inflation, the risk of a global trade war and Federal Reserve policy. \nEven so, BlackRock’s assets under management climbed to $6.32 trillion as of March 31, up from $5.42 trillion a year earlier. \nIn addition to customer inflows, BlackRock benefited from favorable currency movements, lower taxes and ensuring expenses rose less than revenue. \nThe New York-based company’s net income rose to $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, in the first quarter, up 28 percent from the year-ago period.

Though it is among BlackRock’s smaller business lines, Fink said he expects its revenue to grow at mid-teen percentages in the coming years. \nEarlier this year, the company opened an artificial intelligence laboratory in California’s Silicon Valley and added Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) executive Peggy Johnson to its board of directors.
