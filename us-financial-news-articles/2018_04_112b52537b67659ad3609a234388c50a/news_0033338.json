Fears around trade disputes is affecting everything, because the basic underlying business (for Nucor) is good,” Bradford Research analyst Charles Bradford said. \nAverage selling prices for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Nucor, which makes sheet steel, beam blanks and bar steel among other products, rose 9 percent in the quarter ended March 31. \nSteel mill shipments increased 8 percent in the quarter while shipments to outside customers 15 percent from a year earlier. \nThe company said it expected profit in the second quarter to increase “significantly” compared to the first quarter. \nNet income attributable to shareholders dipped to $354.2 million, or $1.10 per share, in the first quarter, from $356.9 million, or $$1.11 per share, year earlier. \nExcluding the write-off of deferred tax assets, the company earned $1.17 a share, beating a consensus estimate of $1.10, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S \nRevenue rose 15.6 percent to $5.57 billion, also beating the average estimate of $5.46 billion.
