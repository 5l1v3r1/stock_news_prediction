Under the amendment, the principal amount that can be drawn down, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, is increased by up to USD 4 million. If drawn down, the total principal amount outstanding would be approx. USD 22.6 million. Any draw down would be used to fund potential acquisitions by the Company or to support the launch of WISeKey's WISeCoin cryptocurrency initiative as previously announced. WISeKey currently contemplates to fund such a launch with an initial coin offering (\"ICO\") via a Swiss special purpose vehicle, with the ICO currently anticipated end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. The WISeCoin ICO will be based on a strict due diligence and admissions process, as well as a high-quality digital asset exchange. The ICO is designed to help countries and central bank cryptocurrencies offer financial institutions a secure way to conduct a wide variety of transactions using collateralized assets on a custom-built blockchain. WISeCoin will be associated with digital identities for people and objects.

The IoT CryptoCurrency Smart Payment allows the ability for connected objects secured by WISeKey Semiconductors to pay other connected objects using WISeCoin. WISeKey has tested the technology on connected cars allowing a connected car secured by WISeKey to pay for electricity, gas and parking through the integration of WISeCoin crypto wallets at the Secure Element Chip level.\nUnder the Credit Facility, ExWorks continues to have the right to convert, at its option, any of the loans under the Credit Facility, including any potential increase(s), together with any interest accrued thereon and fees payable in connection therewith. The applicable conversion price remains unchanged and corresponds to USD 4.74.\nAs previously announced, the Credit Facility can be up-sized or syndicated at the same terms for up to an additional USD 10.0 million by way of adding co-lender(s) or selling a participation interest.\nAbout WISeKey:\nWISeKey (SIX Swiss Exchange: WIHN) is a leading global cybersecurity company currently deploying large scale digital identity ecosystems with a patented process.
