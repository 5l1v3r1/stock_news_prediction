Tighter regulation of how Facebook uses its members' data could affect its ability to attract advertising revenue, its lifeblood.\nSome 40 senators out of the 100-member Senate sit on the two committees holding Tuesday's hearing, setting up a possibly marathon hearing.\nTo ease the way, Zuckerberg on Monday met some lawmakers privately, listening to their concerns before they will have a chance to interrogate him in public.\nZuckerberg appeared willing \"to turn things around where he sees mistakes that have been made,\" Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, said after meeting with the CEO.\nFor hearings last year about Russia's alleged use of social media to influence American politics, Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google sent lawyers, angering lawmakers.\nFacebook's previous emissary \"was a silver-tongued devil\" who \"said nothing,\" Republican Senator John Kennedy said on CNBC on Monday. Kennedy said he planned to ask Zuckerberg about antitrust enforcement and its acquisition of rivals.\nZuckerberg will get a second dose of questioning on Wednesday from the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee.\nHis perch atop Facebook is assured as long as he wants it, given that he remains its controlling shareholder.\nBut his reputation has suffered as television comedians have mocked his perceived robotic speaking patterns and allegedly cavalier attitude toward privacy.\nShares in Facebook are down more than 14 percent since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke last month.\n(Reporting by David Ingram in San Francisco and Dustin Volz in Washington Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T14:13:02.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
