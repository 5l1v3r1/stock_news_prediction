UNCERTAINTY \nThe Ion agreement comes after weeks of uncertainty about the Temenos deal. \nFidessa disclosed on April 5 that it had received approaches from two new potential suitors, Ion and U.S. firm SS&C Technologies ( SSNC.O ). The Ion deal was announced less than three hours before a deadline for the counterbidders to either make a firm offer or walk away from Fidessa expired at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Friday. \nIf SS&C wants to make further counterbid, it must offer at least 41.50 pounds-a-share, including the dividend payments, for Elliott, Lindsell Train and Evenlode to be released from their pledge to back the Ion offer, according to a source with direct knowledge of the terms of the undertakings made by the three investors. \nA new deadline for competing offers will be set, the source said. SS&C did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nFidessa shares rose 1.4 percent to close at 40.55 pounds on Friday afternoon. \nThe Ion takeover comes amid a wave of deal activity in Britain, as companies take advantage of cheap debt to pursue mergers and acquisitions (M&A). \nThe value of M&A involving British firms jumped by 56.5 percent to $164.3 billion during the first quarter, the highest level since 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data.
