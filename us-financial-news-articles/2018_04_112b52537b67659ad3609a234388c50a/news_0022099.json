It was not immediately clear if any more senior officers are suspected. At least two ex-military officials have also been arrested.\nScores of mosques, Muslim homes and businesses were destroyed as Buddhist mobs ran amok for three days early last month in Kandy, a district previously known for its diversity and tolerance.\nAn officer at the police spokesman’s office told Reuters 342 suspects have been arrested. The corporals were arrested on Monday.\nMuslims comprise about nine percent of Sri Lanka’s population of 21 million. Buddhists make up about 70 percent and Hindus about 13 percent.\nThe government ended a full-blown 26-year civil war by defeating mostly Hindu Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels in 2009, with claims of atrocities on both sides.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T17:50:31.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
