It was not clear whether this includes offshore wind park project Triton Knoll, which sources say has also attracted Macquarie’s interest. \nInnogy earlier said it had received a request from a suitor it did not name, adding it had granted due diligence for its Czech activities. It said the suitor also expressed interest in certain parts of Innogy’s renewables, retail and networks units. \n“Discussions are at an early stage and at this point in time it is open whether and on what terms offers for individual business activities will be submitted,” Innogy said. Business paper Handelsblatt first reported Macquarie as the bidder. \nShares in RWE and E.ON fell following the news and were down 2.7 percent and 1.9 percent respectively at 1414 GMT. Innogy shares were 0.4 percent lower at 37.76 euros, below the 40 euros E.ON will offer minority owners as part of the deal with RWE. \nWith a regulated asset base of 1.7 billion euros ($2.1 billion), Innogy is the largest gas distribution networks operator in the Czech Republic and already shares ownership of that business with Macquarie, which holds just below 50 percent. \nInnogy also has 1.63 million power and gas customers in the country, about 7 percent of the group’s total. \nIf Macquarie ends up buying some of Innogy’s assets it could mean the complex break-up plans by E.ON and RWE might have to be changed, said Thomas Hechtfischer, managing director of shareholder advisory group DSW. \n“What happens if the Innogy pie gets smaller and smaller? Everything has been calculated and valued. It certainly wouldn’t get any easier.” $1 = 0.8146 euros Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Maria Sheahan and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T17:39:35.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
