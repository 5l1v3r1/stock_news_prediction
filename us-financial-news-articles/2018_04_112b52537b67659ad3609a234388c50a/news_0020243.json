This decrease was due to delivery delays from a subcontractor resulting in stock shortages of the Xposition S stent at the end of the period and to a decrease in activity of some of the distributors associated with the context of the MINVASYS acquisition. In Europe, the supply difficulties have not enabled the renewal of some hospital inventories, however this issue will be resolved before the end of April and should lead to a return to a normal level of activity during the second quarter.\nSolid cash position of €18 million\nThe Company had a cash position of €18 million at March 31, 2018, before the €6.5 million cash disbursed for the acquisition of MINVASYS, providing STENTYS with the necessary resources to deploy its commercial strategy.\nCommercial launch of Serpentis\nFollowing conclusive trials in target centers across Europe and the granting of the first market authorizations, STENTYS announces the official commercial launch of Serpentis, its latest-generation Sirolimus-eluting stent with a thin cobalt-chrome mesh and a bio-absorbable polymer coating. STENTYS thus expands its proprietary product portfolio to cover all market indications: Serpentis for routine procedures and Xposition S for complex procedures.\nChristophe Lottin, Chief Executive Officer of STENTYS, comments: “The first quarter of the year, which nevertheless should be promising in terms of activity, saw a decrease as a result of an exceptional situation at the end of the period. However, the imminent signing of the acquisition of MINVASYS will allow us to launch a joint commercial offer that should rapidly stimulate our different sales networks and enable us to benefit from an extended geographical coverage in over 60 countries. Lastly, following a constructive and successful pre-commercialization phase, from April we will carry out the commercial launch of our new Serpentis stent. We therefore remain confident that we will achieve a solid pro-forma annual revenue growth in 2018.”\nUpcoming financial publication\nRevenues for the second quarter of 2018: Wednesday July 11, 2018\nShareholder Meeting\nSTENTYS will hold its General Shareholder Meeting from 4 pm on May 14, 2018 at 21 place de la Madeleine, 75008 Paris, France.\nPreparatory documents for this Meeting, including the postal voting form, will be available on the Company’s website, www.stentys.com , in the Investors / Filings section within the statutory deadline, no later than April 23, 2018.\nIf you are a STENTYS shareholder and wish to vote on the resolutions, you can either attend in person or send the completed voting form before Monday May 14, 2018 :\n• by email to stentys@newcap.eu\n• by post to STENTYS, 18 rue d’Hauteville, 75010 Paris, France.\nShould the required quorum not be met, the Meeting on the second call would be held on June 4, 2018, and your postal vote would remain valid and accounted for.\nAbout STENTYS\nSTENTYS develops and commercializes innovative solutions for the treatment of patients with complex artery disease.
