It sparked protests and a decision by Starbucks to close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for employees.\nRobinson said the incident was more about “what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong.”\nThe incident put Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, at the center of a social media storm after the cafe manager’s decision to call police on Nelson and Robinson.\nThe men had not made a purchase and were waiting on a friend to discuss a real estate deal. A female manager, who has since been fired, called police within two minutes of the pair’s arrival, according to the men’s account of the incident. They were released without charges.\nThe video of the arrest has been viewed almost 11 million times.\n“It didn’t really hit me what was going on, that this was real, until I’m being double-locked with my hands behind my back,” Robinson said.\nThe men’s attorney, Stewart Cohen, said on the show that they were engaged in mediation with Starbucks, with a retired federal judge as arbitrator.\nStarbucks also has turned to co-founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz to emphasize its commitment to offering a “safe space” to customers.
