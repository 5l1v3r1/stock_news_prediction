REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo Earlier this month, President Donald Trump said he would take a serious look at policies to address what he says are the unfair business advantages of online retailer Amazon, which has been interpreted as a threat to Amazon winning the cloud deal. \nThe competition has attracted criticism from companies that fear Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud unit, will win the contract, snuffing out hopes that others will break into government cloud computing. Amazon Web Services is the only company the U.S. government has approved to handle secret and top secret data. \nThe Defense Department’s under secretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, Ellen Lord, told reporters in her Pentagon office on Friday morning that at least 50 companies were competing for the contract. \nProposals from industry, according to a letter from the Pentagon to potential bidders, are needed to help the Defense Department with its broad modernization effort that will move data off older data storage facilities and into cloud computing, which is commonly used by businesses. \nThe selection process for the $10 billion a year contract was set for completion in September. \nSeveral other U.S. companies including Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Oracle Corp ( ORCL.N ), Alphabet Inc’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google are expected to compete for the two-year contract. \nReporting by Mike Stone in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T22:09:05.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
