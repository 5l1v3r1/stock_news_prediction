It comes amid sustained pressure at the New Zealand firm which has suffered a depressed share price and missed earnings forecasts due to a glut in domestic chicken supplies.\nIn a filing with the New Zealand Stock Exchange, Tegel’s 45 percent shareholder, Claris Investments, said it had accepted the offer.\nA spokesman for Bounty’s mergers and acquisitions said the bid was part of an expansion strategy for Southeast Asia.\n“We have operations now in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines - this brings another country into our grasp,” the spokesman said.\nHe said Bounty had not yet conducted due diligence, but that the aim was to get Tegel “back (up) to speed”.\nTegel in March forecast profit for the year ending April of NZ$25 million to NZ$27 million, from NZ$31 million in 2017.\nTegel said on Thursday it was too early for its independent directors to comment on the offer.\n“In particular, the independent directors do not yet have full details in respect of Bounty’s proposed strategy for Tegel, which is something we are focused on.”\nTegel shares rose 37 percent on Thursday to close at NZ$1.12.\nThe deal would be subject to approval from New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office which regulates inbound foreign investment.\nReuters data showed that a Bounty acquisition of Tegel would represent the largest outbound purchase by a Filipino company since Universal Robina Corp bought Australia’s Consolidated Snacks Pty Ltd in August 2016 for A$600 million ($454 million).\nNew Zealand’s economy is widely recognised for its agricultural prowess, with a clean image that makes its dairy and other produce sought after in Asian economies.\nTegel is New Zealand’s largest exporter of chicken and is responsible for more than half of the country’s poultry production.\n$1 = 1.4148 New Zealand dollars $1 = 1.3208 Australian dollars Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales in MANILA and Will Ziebell in SYDNEY; Additional reporting by Rushil Dutta and Elaine Tan; Editing by G Crosse and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T11:47:17.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
