An ICBC spokesman in Spain did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though the bank has previously denied any wrongdoing. \nThe court said Caixabank employees at ten branches in Madrid helped suspected Chinese criminals transfer 99 million euros ($122.48 million) to China and Hong Kong between 2013 and 2015 partly via corresponding banking agreements with ICBC. \nThe Caixabank employees made the transfers with the “knowledge and collaboration of the top official in charge of compliance at the entity,” the court said. The official’s name was redacted in the written ruling. \n“Caixabank did not implement the necessary anti-money laundering controls, despite knowing the risks,” the judge said in the court ruling, adding that the bank did not properly alert Spain’s financial intelligence unit to suspicious transfers. \nCaixabank shares initially fell slightly after the court issued the ruling but they later reversed their losses. \nCaixabank signed corresponding banking agreements with ICBC in 2011 and 2014. The court said Caixabank was responsible for ensuring any clients it received from ICBC were compliant. \nA Reuters investigation last year detailed the alleged money laundering scheme involving ICBC following the arrest of seven ICBC executives in Madrid in February 2016. \nThe High Court last September approved a request from prosecutors to investigate ICBC Europe, whose headquarters is in Luxembourg, for the alleged crime of money laundering.
