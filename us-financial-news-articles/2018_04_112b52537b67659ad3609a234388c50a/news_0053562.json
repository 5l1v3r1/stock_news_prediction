A worker removes a street plate in appliance to Spain's Law of Historical Memory which forbids public places or entities to be named with references to Spain's former dictatorship, in Madrid, Spain, April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Susana Vera\nMadrid’s city council said some 49 streets would be renamed over the coming days. The process has been fraught with legal disputes in a show of how Spain still struggles to come to terms with its dictatorship past.\nMany of the names refer to generals who took part in the military uprising against the Spanish republic in 1936 and the Civil War that followed. Streets will revert to their pre-Franco era names or, if this is not possible, in honor of illustrious women, education institutions or politicians, the council said.\nHistorians estimate as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians were killed on the Republican and Nationalist sides in the war. After it ended, tens of thousands of Franco’s enemies were killed or imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent.

This appeal was later overturned by a Madrid court.\nIn one working-class area of Madrid on Friday, neon-clad workmen climbed ladders to takedown place names honoring General Romero Basart, a general who fought on the side of Franco during the Civil War, replacing them with a new name in honor of the 20th century Spanish physicist Blas Cabrera.\n“These have been the street names since I was 10 years old,” said Domingo, an 80-year-old pensioner who declined to give his surname. “But now we are in new times and we have to change.” Additional reporting by Marco Trujillo; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T19:03:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
