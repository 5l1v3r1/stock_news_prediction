Bilal Hafeez, an FX strategist at Nomura, said the broad economic and risk backdrop has become unstable after 2017 saw booming stock markets, synchronised global growth and benign inflation.\n“This year is seeing all these reverse,” he said.\nThe euro edged 0.2 percent lower to $1.2345, after gains in recent sessions. The euro has gained 0.5 percent so far this week, as comments by European Central Bank officials reinforced views that the bank is on track to normalise monetary policy.\nMinutes from the European Central Bank’s meeting in March showed that ECB policymakers expressed concern over the risk of a full-fledged trade war with the United States and fretted over the potentially harmful impact of the euro’s strength .\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:51:58.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
