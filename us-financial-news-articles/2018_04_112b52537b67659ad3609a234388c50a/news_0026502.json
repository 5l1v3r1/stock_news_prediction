We want to be the engine provider. The CR929 will invite a lot of positive competition and innovative opportunities to the aviation industry,” Stein was Quote: d as saying in Beijing.\nThe newspaper also said that Rolls-Royce, the world’s second-largest maker of aircraft engines behind U.S. group General Electric ( GE.N ), has been in talks about potential cooperation opportunities with Chinese firms, including aero engine manufacturers, without providing further details.\nRolls-Royce did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nChina has been plowing billions of dollars into developing jets to raise its profile in global aviation and to disrupt the current Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) duopoly.\nThe company, which sent its C919 narrowbody jet on its maiden flights last year, has established a joint venture for the C929 wide-body with an aim to eventually take 10 percent of a market dominated by the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350.\nReporting by Brenda Goh; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T06:33:22.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
