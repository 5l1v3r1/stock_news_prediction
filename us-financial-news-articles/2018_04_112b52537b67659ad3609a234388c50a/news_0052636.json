The Nasdaq was expected to benefit on Thursday after forecast-beating after-market results from data-scandal hit Facebook.\nEurope’s rises dragged it of one-week lows, though a mixed set of earnings weighed, including a 79 percent drop in profit at Deutsche Bank.\nThe reaction from its new chief executive, Christian Sewing, was to order cut backs in bond and equities trading in its long-troubled investment bank.\nECB WATCH At the day’s main event, the ECB kept its policy unchanged as was widely expected, but focus will be on a news conference by the bank’s chief, Mario Draghi, for any hint about winding up the ECB’s powerful stimulus this year.\nAn 11 percent oil price rise this year, on top of last year’s 18 percent jump, is increasing inflation levels and some of the bank’s top policymakers have said they expect the recent soft patch in euro zone economic data to pass. “The Governing Council confirms that the net asset purchases, at the current monthly pace of 30 billion euros, are intended to run until the end of September 2018, or beyond, if necessary,” the ECB’s policy statement said.\nCredit Agricole strategist Orlando Green said: “The risk is that he (Draghi) is less dovish than expected.”\nThat could lift the euro which has sold off in recent days against the dollar to approach its March 1 level of $1.2154. It fetched $1.2185 before the ECB meeting as the dollar saw only its second drop in eight sessions.\nSweden’s central bank remained dovish at a policy meeting, pushing the crown to its lowest versus the euro since late-2009 .\nThe breather for the dollar helped emerging market currencies regain some ground having been almost universally whacked by the combined yield and dollar rise over the last week.\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries, the reference rate for global borrowing,, have risen around 25 basis points since early-April and are now hovering at four-year highs.\nThat, alongside the rise in commodity prices has led companies such as Alphabet to warn of surging costs while heavy equipment maker, Caterpillar said its buoyant first-quarter earnings could be the “high water mark”.\nWhile 81.2 percent of U.S. earnings have beaten consensus estimates and Thomson Reuters data projects first-quarter earnings growth at 22 percent, investors fear similar warnings from other companies.\n“We have been on a real high with corporate profitability so people got psyched up about those numbers getting even better,” said Peter Lowman, CIO of UK-based wealth manager Investment Quorum.\n“But with Treasury yields rising, people are worrying we may be peaking on profits, or if GDP growth is peaking and we are now in a situation where markets are getting very nervous,” he said, adding that the U.S. Federal Reserve appeared to be in no mood to brake its rate-hike programme.\nReporting by Sujata Rao, additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo, Marc Jones and Dhara Ranasinghe in London Editing by Hugh Lawson and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:29:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
