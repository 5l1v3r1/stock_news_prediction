Tatum also pulled down 10 rebounds.\n“We’ve been down a lot (this season), a lot of injuries, and we’ve always found a way (to win),” Horford told TNT after the game.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo had a game-high 35 points and 13 rebounds and Khris Middleton scored 31 for Milwaukee, which hasn’t advanced past the first round in seven straight postseason appearances dating back to 2003.\nAntetokounmpo and Middleton were the first pair of Bucks teammates to score 30 apiece in a playoff game since Bob Dandridge and Brian Winters did so in 1976.\nMilwaukee and Boston split their four-game, regular-season series, with each team winning once on the other’s home court. It is the first playoff meeting between the Bucks and Celtics since 1987, when Boston won a seven-game series in the East semifinals.\nGame 2 of the series is Tuesday in Boston.\nTatum blocked Malcolm Brogdon’s layup with 26.4 seconds left in overtime and the Bucks down 108-106. Brogdon collected the rebound and found Tony Snell, who missed a corner 3-pointer with 21.9 on the clock.\nTerry Rozier hit two free throws with 18.8 left to make it a four-point game.\nAntetokounmpo made one of two free throws at the 14.8-second mark, then committed his sixth and final foul fighting for a loose ball with Rozier, who made one of two free throws with 13 ticks to go.\nBoston salted the win at the line after that.\nUp 70-66 entering the fourth quarter, Boston took a double-digit lead at 86-76 on Morris’ put-back dunk with 4:27 remaining.\nAntetokounmpo hit two free throws with 1:22 to play to trim the Celtics’ lead to 91-89 entering the final minute.\nBrogdon hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 96 with 10.3 seconds to go before Terry Rozier’s go-ahead trey with 0.5 seconds on the clock.\nMiddleton hit a desperation 3-pointer from near mid-court as time expired to send it to overtime.\nThe Bucks led 47-44 at halftime.\nAlready without injured stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward, the Celtics also began their playoff push without defensive centerpiece Marcus Smart (right thumb surgery). However, Smart said he might be able to return for a potential Game 7 against Milwaukee.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:29:02.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
