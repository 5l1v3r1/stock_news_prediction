London aluminium is up 6.9 percent over the past three trading days, whereas aluminium prices in top producer China have risen only 1.9 percent since the Rusal sanctions were announced on Friday. \"The (Chinese) domestic market is very clearly in a surplus,\" said CLSA analyst Victor You, adding that Shanghai aluminium prices were likely rising solely because of the London Metal Exchange (LME) price gains. China imported only 14,631 tonnes of primary aluminium from Russia in 2017, according to Chinese customs data, although Russia was still its top foreign supplier of the metal. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange was up 0.4 percent at $2,148.50 a tonne by 0415 GMT, having jumped 4.8 percent in the previous session, its biggest daily jump since November 2011.
