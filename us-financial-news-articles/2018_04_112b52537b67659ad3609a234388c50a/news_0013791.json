REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo In exchange for the support, which is given through tax incentives, La Poste will continue to operate some 9,500 outlets across the country, including rural areas, with post offices gradually being replaced by partnerships by shops and town halls.\nThe Commission, which oversees competition policy in the European Union, said the scheme helped the postal service to fulfill an important role without distorting competition.\n“The Commission’s assessment showed that the scheduled compensation did not exceed the amount needed to cover the net cost of this public-service mission,” the Commission said in a statement.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:59:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
