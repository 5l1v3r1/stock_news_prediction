About a third of its imports come from the United States. \nChina's soymeal futures jumped nearly 6 percent to record highs on Monday following news of Beijing's planned tariffs, with other key proteins also soaring on the news. \nBut without a timeframe for the tariffs, and proposed talks between the U.S. and China now on the table, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the market, say analysts. \nThe ministry did not change its forecast for soybean imports in the 2017/18 crop year, and has not yet issued an outlook for the following year. \nIt also said state corn sales to begin this week would curb rising prices of the grain in the near-term but the impact would be limited, with demand from processors expected to be healthy. \nThe report also lowered the forecast for sugar output in 2017/18 by 50,000 tonnes to 10.25 million tonnes, largely due to a decline in yields in major growing region Guangxi.
