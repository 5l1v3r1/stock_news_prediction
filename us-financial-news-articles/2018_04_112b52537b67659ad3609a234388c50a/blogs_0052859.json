In fact, he says he performs very limited day-to-day operational work.\n\"I've constructed my job so I don't have to be pulled into the present. I can stay two to three years in the future,\" Bezos says. \"I'm always advising my senior team that they should organize themselves in the same way.\"\nAs the CEO, Bezos says the only time he's forced to work on the here and now is when something goes wrong. \"It's a fire-fighting exercise, and that's not how you should be running a business of this scale.\"\nBased on his track record, Bezos may be onto something: The CEO's long-held emphasis on thinking ahead has helped Amazon to repeatedly disrupt the retail sector.\nIn the company's 1997 shareholder letter , Bezos said, \"Because of our emphasis on the long-term, we may make decisions and weigh trade-offs differently than some companies.\"\nHe again discussed the importance of looking to the future in a 2013 interview with Four Peaks TV . \"A lot of invention doesn't work,\" the entrepreneur said. \"If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, so you have to think long-term.\"\nHe also noted that Amazon remains one step ahead of the competition by investing in \"risky initiatives\" and continuously innovating.\nUltimately, Bezos says that getting to \"work in the future\" also makes his job at Amazon fun. \"I love my job,\" he says. \"I tap dance into work.\" ", "external_links": ["http://www.fourpeakstv.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu6vFIKAUxk", "https://intelligentfanatics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2016-Amazon-Letter-to-Shareholders.pdf", "https://www.fastcompany.com/3067455/why-amazon-is-the-worlds-most-innovative-company-of-2017"], "published": "2018-04-27T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:36:18.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
