Still, he added, tariffs might not be enacted in the end because there are no winners in that scenario.\nGlobal trade can expect serious headwinds in the case of the tariffs pushing through, and while the agricultural industry will be impacted, Olam's diversification has placed it in strong standing to deal with the potential fallout, the CEO said.\n\"That is the reason we are in 72 countries, and we are also participating very intensely in domestic trade in all of these countries,\" Verghese said. As a result of not relying wholly on the export trade flow, he added, the company is quite \"well hedged,\" to deal with the aftermath of any tariffs or trade war.", "external_links": ["https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contestablemarket.asp"], "published": "2018-04-17T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T08:39:26.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
