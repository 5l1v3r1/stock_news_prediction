The question is, can the sector, beloved by investors for the past 18 months, withstand the pressure?\nSouth Africa’s rand, Russia’s rouble and Argentina’s peso have weakened around 2 percent against the dollar this week. Many others are not far behind.\nDollar borrowing costs for emerging sovereigns have blown out to multi-month highs and investors have pulled $5.6 billion from emerging debt and equity funds since mid-April, according to the Institute of International Finance.\nStronger-than-expected Q1 U.S. growth has set the stage for next week’s Fed meeting. Investors will closely watch the intersection of Treasury yields and the dollar to see how much more pain may lie ahead for emerging markets.\nRussia pauses rate cuts after U.S. sanctions spur inflation risks\n5/STAPLES SQUEEZED\nAs bond yields rise on expectations of higher interest rates, one thing that comes into focus is the equity risk premium (ERP) — the price paid to investors to compensate for the risk of investing in stocks rather than bonds.\nIt was this issue that was core to February’s global equity selloff — the sudden realisation by investors that government bonds could soon provide a viable safer alternative to equities.\nTypically, first in line to be bruised by higher yields are consumer staples, which are known as “bond proxies” due to generous dividends and comfortable cash flows. So when U.S. 10-year yields rose above 3 percent this week, concerned clients called analysts asking what this meant for consumer staples stocks.\nIndeed, higher yields have already caused an adjustment in the price-earnings ratios of firms such as Nestle and Unilever. And $100 million flowed out of consumer stocks and utilities — another bond-proxy sector — this week, EPFR figures showed.\nBut higher yields are not the only challenge: more salient might be the disruptive effect of internet shopping, and companies’ waning pricing power in a more inflationary environment.
