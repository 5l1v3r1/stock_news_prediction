Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the expected benefits of NKTR-214. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, anticipated events and trends, and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others: (i) NKTR-214 is in early stage clinical development and the risk of failure remains high and failure can unexpectedly occur at any stage for one or more of the cancer indications being studied prior to regulatory approval due to lack of sufficient efficacy, safety considerations or other factors that impact drug development; (ii) scientific discovery of new medical breakthroughs is an inherently uncertain process and the future success of potential new drug candidates such as NKTR-214 is therefore very uncertain and unpredictable and could fail; (iii) patents may not issue from our patent applications for our drug candidates including NKTR-214, patents that have issued may not be enforceable, or additional intellectual property licenses from third parties may be required; and (iv) certain other important risks and uncertainties set forth in Nektar's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 1, 2018. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this press release is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.\nNektar Contacts:\nFor Investors:\nJennifer Ruddock of Nektar Therapeutics\n415-482-5585\nFor Media:\nJodi Sievers of Nektar Therapeutics\n415-482-5593\nDan Budwick of 1AB\n973-271-6085\ndan@1abmedia.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nektar-therapeutics-to-host-analyst--investor-event-at-2018-asco-annual-meeting-300638914.html\nSOURCE Nektar Therapeutics", "external_links": ["http://www.nektar.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nektar-therapeutics-to-host-analyst--investor-event-at-2018-asco-annual-meeting-300638914.html"], "published": "2018-04-30T16:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:29:45.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
