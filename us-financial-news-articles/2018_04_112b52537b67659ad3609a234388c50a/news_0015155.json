I don’t really think about it too much. I just see a shot and swing. \n“When I’m playing my best golf, all I’m seeing is the shot, and then I swing to hit that shot. I don’t really think about anything during my swing.” \nThe modest Leishman joked on Tuesday that he has only 76 fewer PGA Tour victories than Tiger Woods. \nNonetheless, Leishman is a perennially solid campaigner with three PGA Tour wins to his name as well as a playoff loss at the 2015 British Open at St Andrews. \nThe 34-year-old has a languid-looking but deceptively powerful swing that he says matches his personality. \nWhen it comes to Augusta, Leishman is probably best known for his role in a famous photo taken on the 72nd green in 2013 when he was compatriot Adam Scott’s playing partner. \nAs Scott roared in celebration after holing a putt to get into a playoff he would subsequently win to become the first Australian to triumph at the Masters, Leishman was captured pumping his fist in the background. \n“At least it’s something good I’m remembered by,” he said. \n“Hopefully I can change that this week and be remembered for this tournament. But if it’s not, I’m happy to be remembered for something positive.” (Reporting by Andrew Both; Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T01:16:37.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
