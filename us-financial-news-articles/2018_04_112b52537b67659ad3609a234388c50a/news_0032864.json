Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!” \nTrump said the meeting took place last week, but U.S. officials said Pompeo actually visited over the Easter weekend, which ran from March 31 to April 2. \nThe trip, which followed a North Korean invitation, was first broached through intelligence channels that his staff was using with North Korea’s spy service, a U.S. official said. \nIt provides the strongest sign yet of Trump’s willingness to become the first serving U.S. president to meet a North Korean leader as he seeks to resolve a crisis over Pyongyang’s development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States. \nTrump said on Tuesday he believed there was a lot of goodwill in the diplomatic push, but added it was possible the summit - which the president had earlier said could take place in late May or early June - may not happen, in which case the United States and its allies would maintain pressure on North Korea through sanctions. \nU.S. officials said the visit by Pompeo, one of Trump’s most trusted advisers, was arranged by South Korean intelligence chief Suh Hoon with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Yong Chol, and was intended to assess whether Kim was prepared to hold serious talks about giving up his nuclear weapons. \nThey said Pompeo’s conversations in Pyongyang fueled Trump’s belief that productive negotiations were possible, but far from guaranteed. They said no site had yet been chosen for a summit. \nPompeo flew to North Korea from a U.S. air force base in Osan, south of Seoul, an official with South Korea’s defense ministry said. \nPompeo told his Senate confirmation hearing for the post of secretary of state last week he was optimistic a course could be set at a Trump-Kim summit for a diplomatic outcome with North Korea, but added that no one was under any illusion that a comprehensive deal could be reached at that meeting. \nPompeo said the aim would be “an agreement...such that the North Korean leadership will step away from its efforts to hold America at risk with nuclear weapons” and that Pyongyang should not expect rewards until it takes irreversible steps.
