However, Prime Minister Theresa May apologised at CHOGM, saying she regrets the “legacy of discrimination, violence and even death that persists today.”\nMay reitterated the “deep regret” and insisted that she and the UK government would “support any Commonwealth member wanting to reform outdated legislation that makes such discrimination possible, because the world has changed.”\nThe fact homosexuality is illegal across 70 percent of the Commonwealth hit headlines last week when British diver Tom Daley used the spotlight after his fourth Commonwealth Games gold medal win to call for more countries in the group to act.\n“I feel extremely lucky to compete openly as who I am, not worry about ramifications. But for lots of people living in those countries it is not the case,” Daley, who married U.S. director Dustin Lance Black last year, told BBC Breakfast.\nThe message illuminated on the Palace of Westminster said “In 37 Commonwealth countries, love is illegal. It’s time to fix it.”\nA Commonwealth Secretariat spokesman said there were more LGBT events this year than at the last CHOGM in 2015 including a roundtable on LGBT rights and reception to brief lawmakers on economic developments favouring decriminalisation.\nHe added that the Commonwealth Secretariat worked closely with parliaments to encourage them “to become parliamentary human rights champions for equality”.\nBut activists angered by the Commonwealth’s failure to put LGBT decriminalisation on the agenda said they planning to picket the Commonwealth Secretariat’s offices on Thursday.\nQasim Iqbal, an activist with Pakistani LGBT organisation Naz Male Health Alliance, said Britain should apologise for homophobic laws left in its wake, with same sex sexual activity still punishable in Pakistan by up to 10 years in jail.\n“The UK has a responsibility to undo the damage that they caused. They need to not only apologise but also pressure countries to decriminalise by putting conditions on any aide they give,” Iqbal told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBut Frank Mugisha, an LGBT activist in Uganda where same-sex sexual activity can be punished with life imprisonment, said it was important Britain was not seen as “giving a lecture” as that could further alienate LGBT communities.\nSeychelles activist Fabianna Bonne echoed similar concerns, urging Britain to support activists and advocates with “quiet diplomacy” to help push discussions forward.
