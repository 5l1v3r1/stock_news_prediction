But they are fantasized versions that are not representative of the reality, and do not include the workers and the villagers,” he said.\nRapid urbanization and rising incomes in India have led to an unchecked sprawl of office towers and luxury apartments that are pushing the poor farther out to the margins.\nAt least six homes are destroyed and 30 people forcibly removed each hour, with efforts to modernize urban centers and build ‘Smart Cities’ responsible for most evictions, according to advocacy group Housing and Land Rights Network.\nGurugram, a global technology hub built on dusty farmland, is dotted with skyscrapers and swanky apartments bearing American and European names.\nYet like most Indian cities it is notorious for its daily traffic snarls and its water-logged roads during the rains.\n“Cities want to be seen as modern, global and smart, but (they) cover up real problems like pollution and the lack of planning and infrastructure,” said Crestani, 27, whose photographs are being exhibited in a Paris show until May 6.\n“Slums are demolished for so-called beautification, and the people who work in the gated communities live in shacks and (are) seen as dirty encroachers,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\nLast year, violent protests erupted at a gated community near Delhi after a domestic worker filed a police complaint saying her employers had beaten her and locked her up.\nBut Crestani said the people he photographed seemed to accept their place in society.\n“There was some sadness about not being a part of the world in the ads. But there was also hope for a better future for their children,” he said.\n“They also really liked those buildings in the ads.”\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
