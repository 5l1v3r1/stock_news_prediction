REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nIt is unusual for deal negotiations to start with the acquirer valuing its target at a discount. The fact that CBS’s first bid for Viacom infers such a valuation reflects how CBS views its position in the U.S. media landscape as superior to Viacom’s. \nAs part of its initial offer to be submitted in the next few days, CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves will propose to stay at the helm for at least two years if the U.S. media company’s bid to merge with peer Viacom is accepted, according to the sources.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo \nThat offer is contingent on Viacom accepting all other aspects of CBS’s bid, the sources added. \nThe persons asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. \nCBS and Viacom declined to comment. \nCBS and Viacom are exploring a merger at the urging of their common controlling shareholder, National Amusements Inc, the family holding company of Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari. \nThe two companies explored a merger in 2016 instigated by National Amusements, but those talks ended unsuccessfully, due to concerns by CBS about price and governance issues. \nSince then, Viacom CEO Bob Bakish has taken a number of steps to boost the company’s performance, including improving relations with cable and satellite companies, causing some analysts to expect CBS to acquire Viacom at a premium.
