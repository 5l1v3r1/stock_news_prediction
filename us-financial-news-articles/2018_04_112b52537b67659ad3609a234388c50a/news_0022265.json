A week after the profit warning, the company said Taht would leave Rovio immediately for personal reasons.\nHeinonen was not immediately available for a comment.\nRovio will hold its first annual general meeting on April 16.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T15:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:00:58.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
