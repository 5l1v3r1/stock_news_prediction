Spotify's focus on creating a virtuous cycle for consumers and artists and using technology to create curated experiences evokes a Netflix-like promise of significant global penetration potential.\"\nAnd investors have shown they are willing to pony up for a promising business model, even in the competitive content business.\nNetflix's price-to-earnings ratio — the amount of money that stock buyers pay compared with how much profit a company makes — was over 100 by the end of last year, and well over 200, on average, over the past five years. Compare that with Facebook — a P/E of about 62 over the past five years — or Apple — with an average P/E of about 14 during that time, according to FactSet.\nRBC analyst Mark Mahaney also expressed optimism before the stock began trading, noting that Spotify may have an even larger data set than Netflix in terms of playlist personalization, in addition to a \"very, very large\" potential market. \nNetflix and Spotify also share some common competitors in Apple and Amazon . But Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell echoed Mahaney's outlook on Spotify's data and market.\n\"Spotify faces stiff competition, but we believe its richer music data and singular focus will enable it to offer the best service in terms of music discovery — the key competitive differentiator,\" Cordwell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T18:36:21.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
