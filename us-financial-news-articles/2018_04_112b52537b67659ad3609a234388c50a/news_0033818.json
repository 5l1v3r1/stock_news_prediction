REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo \nThe responsibility for information technology, which was Hammond’s main task, may be transferred to another board member, the person said, adding the bank would need clearance from supervisory authorities for a such move. \nDeutsche Bank declined to comment on the matter, which was first reported by daily Handelsblatt. \nThe lender announced Hammonds’ departure on Wednesday, amid a continuing reshuffle of its executive management. \nHammonds had been tasked with streamlining the bank’s IT systems, which former Chief Executive John Cryan called ‘lousy’ when he took the helm. But she came under pressure after disparaging comments she made about the bank became public. \nHammonds is the latest to go in a major shake-up of top managers. Cryan was ousted last week, replaced by his deputy Christian Sewing, and a top investment banker, Marcus Schenck, also left the bank. \nHammonds told colleagues earlier this year that Deutsche was “the most dysfunctional company” she had ever worked for, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
