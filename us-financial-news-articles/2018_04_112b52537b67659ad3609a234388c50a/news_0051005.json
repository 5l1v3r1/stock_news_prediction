Motherboard said it was able to confirm the first four digits of the social security numbers, names, addresses, and dates of birth for four people whose data appears in a post from July 2014.\nA Google search inquiry still pulls up a few public Facebook posts that offers to sell personal details including credit card numbers. However, many of such posts appeared to be removed once the link was opened.
