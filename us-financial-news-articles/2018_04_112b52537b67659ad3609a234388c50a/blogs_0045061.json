We should have an integrated solution,\" said one of the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private. \nThe second source said talks with the Chinese intensified recently and a deal could be only a few weeks away. \nTwo other people familiar with the matter said the refinery needed about $3 billion of investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, adding that it was not clear if Petrobras would foot part of the bill. \nPetrobras declined to comment. CNPC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian oil sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocs as the government lowers barriers to foreigners. \nThe Comperj deal would not be the first in which Petrobras offered oil to attract Chinese funding. In 2016, it renewed a $10 billion credit line with China Development Bank, originally opened in 2009, that was guaranteed by Brazilian oil exports. \nCNPC and Petrobras signed a memorandum of understanding last year to reach a strategic partnership in oil exploration and production. CNPC has already partnered with Petrobras in the Libra field of the Santos basin, one of the largest discoveries in Brazil's prolific pre-salt oil area. \nThe investment at Comperj would help to offset Brazil's fuel imports and resolve a long-running headache at the complex, where Petrobras has little to show for some $13.5 billion in investments over the past decade. \nThe project was caught up in a corruption probe in recent years and Petrobras has booked some 6.5 billion reais ($1.92 billion) in writedowns there linked to overpriced works and services. \nThe company said it wants to finish Comperj, but preferably without pouring in any more money, so it is talking to potential partners. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente said last year that CNPC was in talks to invest in the refinery. \nSeparately, Petrobras awarded a contract last month worth 1.95 billion reais to China's Shandong Kerui Petroleum Equipment Co to build a natural gas processing unit at the Comperj complex. \nThe privately run Kerui Group partnered with mid-sized Brazilian engineering company Método Potencial Engenharia SA to build the plant in Itaboraí, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Rio. \n($1 = 3.38 reais) (Reporting by Rodrigo Viga Gaier; Additional reporting by Marianna Parraga; Writing by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Brad Haynes, Daniel Flynn and Christian Schmollinger)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T11:28:18.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
