The procedure uses a combination of suction and forceps to bring tissue through the cervix and accounts for 16 percent of all abortions performed in Kentucky.\nThe law took effect on Tuesday after Bevin signed the measure.\nLast year, a similar Texas measure was struck down by a federal judge. Similar bans in other states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma, have also been struck down by the courts.\nMississippi’s governor last month signed into law the most restrictive abortion measure in the United States, banning all abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy.\nMississippi’s only abortion clinic has sued to block that law, and a federal court this week extended a restraining order until 30 days after conclusion of a Sept. 24 hearing.\nSince last year, when Republicans took control of the Kentucky House of Representatives for the first time since 1921, the legislature has passed several measures to restrict access to abortion, including banning all abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy.\nReporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T23:03:45.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
