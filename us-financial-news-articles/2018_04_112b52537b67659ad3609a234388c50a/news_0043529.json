(TSX-V:CZO) (“Ceapro” or the “Company”) , a growth-stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of active ingredients for healthcare and cosmetic industries, today announced its financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Ceapro plans to provide a corporate update on April 23, 2018.\n“Over the course of 2017, a primary aspect of our focus was the research and development of our enabling technologies, which we believe will pave the way for the transition of our business model from a contract manufacturer to a full-fledged biopharmaceutical company. In addition to our increased investment, we have also laid excellent groundwork to diversify our business model to get closer to the customer by the offering of high-end value final cosmeceutical products through Juvente DC . Given the significant investments made in our beta glucan and avenanthramides product portfolio and the encouraging results obtained so far, I believe that we are well poised to expand into the profitable nutraceutical sector over the next 12 months,” stated Gilles Gagnon, M.Sc., MBA, President and CEO of Ceapro.\n“On the financial front, we continued to deliver solid results even with sales slightly lower than 2016, which was a record-breaking year for the Company. Our fundamentals are solid with positive income and cash generated from operations, a positive working capital balance, and our balance sheet, when excluding one-time provisions for legal matters, has continued to improve showing a strong cash on hand position, reduced long-term debt, as well as a slightly improved positive equity position compared to 2016,” added Mr. Gagnon.\nFinancial Summary for the Full Year 2017\nTotal sales of $12,926,000 for the full year 2017 compared to $13,674,000 in 2016; a decrease of 5% partially due to a lower U.S. dollar on U.S. dollar denominated sales and partially due to lower sales of beta glucan offset by increased sales of avenanthramides; Income from operations of $2,656,000 for the full year 2017; Cash flows generated from operations of $1,573,000; Positive working capital balance of $4,930,000 as of December 31, 2017; Retained earnings position of $2,709,000 as of December 31, 2017; and Cash on hand as of December 31, 2017 was $6,174,000.\nSummary of Judgements in AVAC Ltd. Legal Matters\nSubsequent to year-end, the Alberta Courts rendered a decision in the pending cases with an Alberta based organization, AVAC Ltd., in regard to the previously announced claims brought against Ceapro Inc. and a subsidiary respectively in 2011 and 2012 . Ceapro Inc. has accepted the decision whereby it expects to pay approximately $780,000. However, a provision of $1,375,000 for the judgement against the subsidiary has only been recognized in the financial statements strictly to comply with accounting rules.\nThese one-time provisions are presented separately on the balance sheet and on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and cash flows and are further explained in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements. Due to the outcome of the legal matter, the 2017 year-end financial performance resulted in a net loss after tax of $958,000 for the full year 2017, compared to a net profit after tax of $3,620,000 in 2016. Excluding these one-time provisions for legal matters, net profit after tax for the full year 2017 would be $985,000.\nCEAPRO INC.
