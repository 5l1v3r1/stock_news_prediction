REUTERS/Marco Bello\nSo on a recent day, just before flying to Madrid, he was sadly packing a red suitcase - while stacking diplomas from a half a dozen trades he picked up in the last year from bakery and bartending to photography and burger-flipping.\nThose, he hoped, would help him find work in Spain and fund the medicines his mother needs for a kidney transplant.\n“If not, she’s going to die,” Alzaibar, 28, said, folding socks and shirts in his family’s middle-class Caracas apartment.\nDroves of Venezuelans, including professionals like Alzaibar and even retired soldiers and prosecutors, have been taking short courses to prepare for life abroad.\nSuffering a severe economic crisis that has left many people short of food and basics, nearly a million Venezuelans have departed since 2015, according to the United Nations.

COCKTAILS AND COFFEE\nValentina Maggi, 22, studied graphic design and dreams of illustrating children’s stories, but has followed in friends’ footsteps to learn how to mix cocktails at the National Bartender Academy.

REUTERS/Marco Bello\n“I have many friends who have left the country and have told me to do this type of course because when you get there, you have more work options,” she said in a room with a long table where she had just completed her final test: a Gin Fizz made from gin, lemon, sugar and soda water.\nAt the academy, 6,000 students are expected to graduate this year - up from 4,500 a couple of years ago.\nWith Maggi were a 60-year-old retired military officer and a 52-year-old former Supreme Court prosecutor, both hoping to land work at bars in the United States and Argentina respectively.\nAsking not to disclose his name for fear of reprisal, the former soldier said his monthly pension of some $5 at the black market exchange rate, left nothing for food after paying for his two sons’ schools.\nVenezuela’s economic meltdown is one of the worst slumps in modern Latin American history.\nGross domestic product is shrinking on a scale akin to that of the United States during the Great Depression and inflation is the highest in the world, nearly 9,000 percent annually, according to National Assembly data.\nA monthly minimum wage is worth less than a carton of eggs.\nWhile critics lambaste President Nicolas Maduro for failed socialist economic policies and corruption, he says a U.S.-led “economic war” including financial sanctions are to blame.
