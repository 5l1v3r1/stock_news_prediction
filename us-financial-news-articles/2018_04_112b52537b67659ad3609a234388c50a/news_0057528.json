As a result of adopting ASC 606, the following financial information has changed:\nRevenue captions in the statements of operations\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 605, Revenue Recognition, or ASC 605, we reported perpetual license, subscription, and software support and services revenue. Upon the adoption of ASC 606, we now report license, cloud services, and software support and services revenue.\nLicense revenue consists primarily of revenue from on-premises perpetual licenses and the license portion of on-premises subscriptions. Cloud services revenue includes sales of cloud-based solutions that allow customers to use hosted software over a contract period without taking possession of our software and is typically provided on a subscription or usage basis. Software support and services revenue consists of revenue from arrangements to provide software upgrades, updates and technical support to customers with perpetual software licenses and on-premises subscriptions, and professional services.\nRevenue recognition and recurring revenue\nThe most significant impact to revenue from ASC 606 comes from the elimination of the requirement to have vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value to separate and recognize revenue for products and services in a contract. The elimination of the VSOE requirement causes a significant change to the timing of revenue recognition for on-premises software term license revenue and other multiple-element arrangements with products or services that lacked VSOE of fair value. Our on-premises term license agreements include distinct software licenses and software update and support services. Under ASC 606, we recognize the software license revenue from on-premises subscriptions at the time of delivery and recognize the associated software update and support services revenue ratably over the term of subscription agreements. Under ASC 605, we recognized all revenue from those arrangements ratably over the term of the subscription agreements. In addition, the concept of standalone selling price replaces VSOE in determining the value of each component of an arrangement. Because the values assigned to the components of an arrangement using standalone selling price may differ from the values assigned to components of an arrangement using VSOE, different amounts may be allocated to revenue recognized at a point-in-time versus revenue recognized over time.\nFor the reasons noted above, recurring revenue calculated under ASC 606 is different than recurring revenue calculated under ASC 605. Because under ASC 606 the license component of on-premises subscriptions is recognized upfront instead of ratably over the contract term as it was under ASC 605, recurring revenue reported under the new guidance may show more quarterly variability than it did previously. The year-over-year recurring revenue growth rate from Q4 2016 to Q4 2017 under the ASC 606 method was 12%, which is 3 percentage points lower than the 15% growth rate under ASC 605. For the full year of 2017, we reported a 15% recurring revenue growth rate under ASC 605 and under ASC 606, the growth rate was 14%.\nUnearned revenue and customer arrangements with termination rights\nCurrent and noncurrent deferred revenue has been replaced by current and noncurrent unearned revenue and customer arrangements with termination rights. Because some of our arrangements with customers contain termination rights, they do not meet the definition of a contract under ASC 606 and the balances are not recorded as unearned revenue and are instead recorded as \"customer arrangements with termination rights\" on our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize revenue from those arrangements, including the distinct licenses contained therein, as the termination rights expire which generally results in the arrangement being recognized ratably over the contract term.\nUnbilled accounts receivable and DSOs\nUnder ASC 606 we began to report current and noncurrent unbilled accounts receivable. Unbilled accounts receivable are recorded, for example, when a customer commits to a multi-year subscription term for our on-premises licenses and pays for the subscription in annual installments. This is true even though the unbilled receivables have not yet been invoiced and are not yet due to us. In that example, we record upfront revenue for the license component of the transaction that is not fully billed and record unbilled accounts receivable for the difference between the license revenue recognized and the amount billed. DSOs are impacted because we now include the current portion of unbilled accounts receivable in accounts receivable. Current unbilled accounts receivable included in accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018 was $2.5 million and $1.9 million, respectively. As a result of this change, DSO increased by 5 days at December 31, 2017 and 4 days at March 31, 2018.\nSales commissions\nUnder the new guidance we capitalize and amortize sales commissions to closely match the expense with the expected revenue recognition period. Previously we expensed sales commissions as they were earned. Consequently, we recorded $17.4 million and $18.4 million of deferred commissions on our balance sheets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. For the restated periods we observed a general increase in commission expense in the first half of the year and a decrease in the second half of the year.\nFinancial Results\nMOBILEIRON, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND MARCH 31, 2018\n(Amounts in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2018\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\n (1)\n$\n85,833\n$\n96,311\nShort-term investments (1)\n6,797\n2,995\nAccounts receivable -

These exclude stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and a litigation settlement charge.\nStock-based compensation expenses: In our , we have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expense because it is non-cash in nature and excluding this expense provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. In particular, because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types that companies can use under FASB ASC Topic 718, we believe that providing that exclude this expense allows investors the ability to make more meaningful comparisons between MobileIron operating results and those of other companies. Stock-based compensation expenses will recur in future periods.\nAmortization of intangible assets: In our , we have excluded the effect of the amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets can be significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is not expected to recur in future periods.\nLitigation settlement charges: In our , we have excluded the charge for the cost of the settlement of our shareholder litigation. While it is possible that we will have material litigation-related charges in the future, we do not expect it to be a consistently recurring expense.\nNon-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net loss, and non-GAAP net loss per share: We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangible assets, and the litigation settlement charge from various non-GAAP financial metrics such as gross profit, gross margin, operating income (loss), operating margin, net income (loss), and net income (loss) per share provides useful measures for management and investors. Stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible assets have been and can continue to be inconsistent in amount from period to period. We have not historically had a material litigation-related settlement charge. While it is possible that we will have material litigation settlement charges in the future, we do not expect it to be a consistently recurring expense. We believe the inclusion of these items makes it difficult to compare periods and understand the growth and performance of our business. In addition, we evaluate our business performance and compensate management based in part on these non-GAAP measures. There are limitations in using because the are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from used by our competitors and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Further, stock-based compensation expense has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of the compensation provided to our employees. Amortization of intangible assets is not expected to be a recurring expense.\nBillings and free cash flow: Our also include: billings, which we define as total revenue plus the change in unearned revenue plus the change in customer arrangements in termination rights minus the change in unbilled accounts receivable in a period; and free cash flow, which we define as cash provided by (used in) operating activities less the amount of property and equipment purchased. We consider billings to be a useful metric for management and investors because subscription billings and software support and services billings drive unearned revenue and customer arrangements with termination rights, which are important indicators of future revenue. There are limitations related to the use of billings. First, billings include amounts that have not yet been recognized as revenue. Second, our calculation of billings may be different from other companies that report similar financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by evaluating billings together with revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP, including recurring revenue. Management believes that information regarding free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to invest in our business and fund ongoing operations. However, our calculation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies.\nWe believe these are helpful in understanding our past financial performance and our future results. Our are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management regularly uses our supplemental internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business, and make operating decisions. These non-GAAP measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods.
