REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Files\nThe first winter downpour will slightly replenish dams dried by the region’s worst drought in a century, a dry spell that has scorched farms and hit the tourism sector.\nSouth Africa has declared a national disaster over the drought affecting the southern and western regions which had two of the driest years ever recorded in 2015 and 2016.\nCape Town authorities warned that taps in the port city of 4 million could run dry this year. But they have pushed back this worst case scenario to next year and only if winter rains fail to sufficiently boost dam levels.\n“There has been a lot of flooding in urban areas across the metro and a lot of roadways have been affected,” said Charlotte Powell, spokeswoman for Cape Town’s disaster management centre.\n“Flooding is a known risk to the city,” Powell said.

We don’t see too much rain,” she said adding that up to 5 millimeters was expected. Empty fountains are seen in Adderley Street in central Cape Town, South Africa, January 28, 2018.
