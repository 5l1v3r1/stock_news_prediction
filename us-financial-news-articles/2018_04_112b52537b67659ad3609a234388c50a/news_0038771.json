Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Closing ceremony - Carrara Stadium - Gold Coast, Australia - April 15, 2018 - General view of the closing ceremony. REUTERS/Paul Childs \nOrganisers signed off with the uncontroversial assertion that they had delivered the best possible environment for the athletes from 71 mostly former British colonies to showcase their skills over 11 sun-kissed days in the beachside city. \n“You have delivered a truly Golden Games for the Commonwealth,” Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) President Louise Martin said. \n“A Games of innovation, inspiration, colour and vibrancy with an exuberant Gold Coast buzz - embracing us all with your warmth and friendship.” \nFor a CGF constantly fighting the perception that a multi-sport event which sprung from the British Empire is an anachronism, there was confidence that the movement was firmly on the path back to relevancy. \nThe Gold Coast Games were the first with an equal number of gold medals for men’s and women’s events, included 38 events in a fully integrated Paralympic programme and welcomed a high-profile transgender athlete. \n“Inclusion is the Commonwealth Games’ future, it’s what makes us extraordinary,” said organising committee chairman Peter Beattie. \n“From its beginnings ... the Games were always designed to be more than just a sporting spectacle. They are a way for us to come together and share what we have in common.” \nAs far as the sporting spectacle was concerned, the host nation came out as the biggest winners with 80 of the 275 gold medals, well clear of England on 45 and India (26) with Canada and New Zealand (both 15) rounding out the top five. \nThe CGF were keen to emphasise a greater diversity of medal winners with 43 nations taking at least one and the British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands all winning their first.

REUTERS/Paul Childs \nOf the nine world records set, the majority were in Paralympic events with the most prestigious coming in the pool in women’s 4x100m freestyle relay. \nIt was, almost inevitably, set by the Australian team, who put behind them their disappointing 2017 world championships by winning 28 swimming gold medals and 73 overall, well ahead of England’s nine (24). \nSeveral high profile athletes like England’s Adam Peaty and Australia’s Kyle Chalmers appeared to be down on performance, as is often the case at this stage in the Olympic cycle. \nTaylor Ruck was arguably the swimmer of the meeting with eight medals in eight events, leading a resurgent Canadian swimming team along with backstroke world record holder Kylie Masse. JAMAICA DISAPPOINTMENT \nWith the now retired Usain Bolt watching from the stands, Jamaica’s sprinters had a desperately disappointing time in the athletics, winning none of the six titles in the 100m, 200m and 4x100m relays. \nBolt’s heir apparent Yohan Blake stumbled in the individual 100m and had to settle for bronze, while double Olympic sprint champion Elaine Thompson went home with just a relay silver. \nAkani Simbine led a South African 1-2 to win the men’s 100m in 10.03 seconds, while Jereem Richards was handed the 200m after England’s Zharnel Hughes was disqualified for hindering the Trinidadian as they raced across the line in 20.12 seconds.
