REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo A former vice president, Vizcarra took office on March 23 after his predecessor, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, resigned in a graft and vote-buying scandal.\nThe Ipsos survey, published in El Comercio, showed 13 percent of Peruvians polled disapproved of Vizcarra. But 30 percent declined to answer — a sign many were still undecided about him.\nMost Peruvians could not name Vizcarra two weeks before he was thrust into office in Peru’s worst political crisis in nearly two decades. A civil engineer by training, Vizcarra had been doubling as vice president and Peru’s ambassador to Canada.\nVizcarra has risen to power amid high frustration with elected officials following a graft scandal involving the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht that has tainted most of the political class.\nHe must govern Peru, the world’s No. 2 copper producer, with the opposition-controlled Congress through 2021.\nThe poll of 1,289 people was taken on April 10-12 and had a 2.7 percentage point margin of error.\nKuczynski, a former Wall Street banker, also took office with the support of a majority of Peruvians, but ended his term with a 19-percent approval rating.\nReporting by Marco Aquino; Writing by Mitra Taj; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T02:26:34.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
