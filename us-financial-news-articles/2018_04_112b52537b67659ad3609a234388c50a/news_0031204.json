Only the overnight rate fell, to 1.36775 percent from 1.50500 percent.\nEIBOR rates, used in many UAE financial transactions, are calculated daily for maturities ranging from overnight to one year. In practice, interbank deals using EIBOR rarely have maturities of more than one month, bankers say.\nThe new system shrinks the panel of banks from which Quote: s are used to calculate the rates to eight from 10 and increases pressure on the banks to give reasons for each of their Quote: s.\nBanks are also encouraged to consider a wider range of trades and counterparties when submitting Quote: s, rather than only basing their Quote: s on trades with long-term bank clients to which they may lend relatively cheaply.\nThis means the new system could push up EIBOR rates, though the impact is likely to be small because some banks had already expanded their reference points for Quote: s in the weeks before the system came into effect, bankers said.
