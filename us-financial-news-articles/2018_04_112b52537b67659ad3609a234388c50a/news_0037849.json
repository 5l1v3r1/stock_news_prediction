He has been injured for a long time.” \nSanches played a key role in Portugal’s Euro 2016 triumph but Carvalhal has told the 20-year-old to forget about playing in the World Cup in June. \n“I don’t think he has any chance of going to the World Cup,” the Portuguese manager added.

We are proud to do the guard of honour for them,” Carvalhal said. \n“It is very tough to play against them because they are a mix of a manager with a very good idea and players who understand football.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T20:49:14.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
