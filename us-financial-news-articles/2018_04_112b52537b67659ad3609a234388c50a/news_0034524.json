They made that decision. This change in no way resuscitates that,” Morrison told reporters in Sydney.\nAdani had hoped for government funding to help build a 400 km (250 mile) rail line connecting its proposed mine with a Pacific Ocean port.\nAustralian state leaders will also keep their ability to veto any NAIF loan, which scuttled Adani’s plans, Morrison said.\nThe amendments come just over 12 months out from Australia’s next federal election where the ruling coalition government will seek to win favor with voters on its economic record.\nAustralia’s north, which has been home to a rise of right-wing parties such as Pauline Hanson’s One Nation, is shaping up as a key battleground and contains many of the ruling Liberal/National coalition government’s least secure seats.\nReporting by Colin Packham; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T08:59:55.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
