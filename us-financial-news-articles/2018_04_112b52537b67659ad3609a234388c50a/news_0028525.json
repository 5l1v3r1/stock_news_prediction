At 11-1, they are off to the best 12-game start in team history.\nThe Mets scored what proved to be the decisive runs in the fifth, when Jay Bruce delivered an RBI double and Adrian Gonzalez lofted a sacrifice fly before Bruce raced home on a wild pitch to give New York a 6-2 lead.\nYoenis Cespedes had two hits, including an RBI single in the first, while Asdrubal Cabrera extended his hitting streak to 11 games by going 2-for-4.\nThe Brewers pulled within 6-4 on Ryan Braun’s two-run homer in the top of the sixth — an inning that ended with Lorenzo Cain getting thrown out at third trying to take the extra base on a single by Domingo Santana.\nTravis Shaw homered with one out in the eighth for the Brewers, who left two runners on when Robert Gsellman — the Mets’ fourth pitcher of the inning — induced Jett Bandy to ground out.\nHernan Perez had two hits for the Brewers, including a two-run homer in the fourth.\nMets left-hander Steven Matz (1-1) earned his first win in more than nine months after allowing four runs (three earned) on three hits and two walks while striking out five over 5 1/3 innings. Matz was 0-7 with a 7.40 ERA in 11 starts since his most recent win June 28.\nJeurys Familia, the Mets’ sixth pitcher, earned his seventh save with a perfect ninth.\nBrewers right-hander Zach Davies (0-2) took the loss after allowing five runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out four over 4 1/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T10:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:16:00.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
