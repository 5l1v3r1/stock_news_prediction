As part of his plea, Bertrand agreed to pay about $78,500 in restitution, representing the amount he personally benefited.\nBased in the New York City borough of Staten Island, Soupman sells products under the Original SoupMan brand.\nIt traces its roots to 1984, when Al Yeganeh opened his soup shop on West 55th Street in midtown Manhattan and soon began drawing long lines of customers.\nYeganeh was the inspiration for Yev Kassem, a character portrayed by Larry Thomas on a 1995 “Seinfeld” episode who was known for making customers follow strict ordering rules, or risk being shunted away with his forceful bellow: “No soup for you!”\nSoupman filed for bankruptcy protection in June and emerged in September after its assets were acquired by Gallant Brands Inc.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T00:35:40.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
