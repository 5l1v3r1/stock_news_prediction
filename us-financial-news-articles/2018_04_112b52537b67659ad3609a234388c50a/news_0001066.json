It produced 2,425 of the cars in the entire fourth quarter.\nTesla shares recovered around half of an 8 percent loss as the reports filtered into the market, but were still down more than 5 percent by 1:30 pm ET.\nThe company declined to comment on the reports.\nShares of Musk's $50-billion dollar venture have been reeling from a triple whammy of probes into the crash, concerns about Model 3 production and nerves over its debt load after a credit downgrade by rating agency Moody's.\nWith share prices falling across the board in a grim few weeks for U.S. technology majors, Tesla's shares are now down 19 percent this year.\nThe company's lone outstanding junk bond, worth $1.8 billion and maturing in 2025, briefly dropped two points to as low as 85 cents on the dollar for a yield of around 8 percent on Monday, according to MarketAxess data.\n\"It is a combination of a bunch of things (for Tesla) - it is still news of the crash and news that a crash like that is a setback for that autonomous part of the industry,\" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at ONeil Securities in New York.\nTesla says it has about 500,000 advance reservations from customers for the Model 3, but manufacturing bottlenecks since the vehicle began to be built last July have delayed production and deliveries to customers, exacerbating Tesla's need for cash.\nFailure to meet targets and pressures on funding prompted the downgrade last week by Moody's, which said Tesla was likely to raise more than $2 billion in new capital, partly to cover about $1.2 billion in convertible bonds due by March 2019.\nMusk made light of the company's financial situation on April 1, joking in a tweet that Tesla had gone bankrupt.\n\"Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it,\" the tweet said.
