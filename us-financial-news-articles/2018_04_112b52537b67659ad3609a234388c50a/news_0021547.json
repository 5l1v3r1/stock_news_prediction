Wednesday’s assembly meeting comes just a few weeks ahead of the first summit the two Koreas will have in more than a decade on April 27.\nThe parliament assembly had been in focus due to the flurry of diplomacy recently seen centering North Korea including the inter-Korean summit, with policymakers keen to see whether Kim Jong Un would offer comments that would lend insight to his stance on related affairs.\nKCNA reported on Thursday the speakers at the meeting touched on economic strides the North had made in the past year and that the state budget had been used “exactly” last year.\nOf last year’s budget, 15.8 percent was used in bolstering the North’s military defences while 47.7 percent of spending was executed to boost the economy, KCNA said. It did not offer an amount for last year’s budget.\nKim Jong Un is due to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in late May or early June, Trump said earlier this week. Separately, Kim Jong Un chaired a party meeting on Monday in which he assessed future talks with Washington and his upcoming summit with South Korea.
