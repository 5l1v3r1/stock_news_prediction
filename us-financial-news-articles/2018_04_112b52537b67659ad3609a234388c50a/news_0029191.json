The VIX edged down, near a six-week low.\n“Volatility has come down because expectations are very strong for the earnings season and the market is happy to see some hard data,” said Laurent Godin, equity analyst at Indosuez Wealth Management.\nBritain’s FTSE 100 stood out with much stronger gains. It was up 0.9 percent after an unexpected fall in British inflation to a one-year low dented the pound — good news for its high percentage of overseas revenue earners.\nWhile investors were refocusing on fundamentals after weeks dominated by geopolitical tensions, the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) survey of fund managers showed signs of caution.\nInvestors cut their equity allocation to an 18-month low and increased their cash balances.\n“Just like they were chasing the market up in January, investors have gradually started to sell,” said Clark Fenton, chief investment officer at Agilis Investment Management.\n“I think that gives the market scope to rally a bit more as positioning has lightened up.”\nTRANS-ATLANTIC YIELD GAP WIDENS, CURRENCIES MUTED\nFund managers named the threat of trade war as the biggest “tail risk” in BAML’s survey, while they were less concerned about inflation causing convulsions in bond markets.\nMonetary tightening, proceeding at a different pace on either side of the Atlantic, was making its mark on bond markets.\nThe gap between U.S. and German two-year bonds reached its widest in nearly 30 years, reflecting the diverging monetary policy outlook.\n“In some ways I am sort of surprised that it hasn’t mattered more,” said Agilis’ Fenton, referring to the trans-Atlantic divergence. “I would have thought it would have helped European equity prices more on a relative basis.”\nThe U.S. yield curve - the gap between U.S. 2-year and 10-year government bond yields — flattened back slightly, having fallen to a low of 41.8 basis points overnight.\n“I would worry if [the curve] got inverted. It’s probably a bit premature to get too bent out of shape about it now,” said Fenton.\nThe rise in short-dated yields has pushed the real yield on U.S. two-year Treasuries above the S&P 500 dividend yield for the first time in 10 years. tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO\nCurrency market movements, outside of a sliding sterling, were restrained.\nThe euro was stuck at $1.2362, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index hovered at 89.5.\nThe yen pulled back to 107.23 against the dollar, pushed down by signs of progress in talks between South and North Korea.\nStrong metals prices, boosted by supply concerns after U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium giant Rusal, helped send Europe’s basic resources stocks surging 2.1 percent.\nOil prices also continued their relentless rise.\nBrent crude futures were up 86 cents at $72.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 95 cents to $67.48 a barrel.", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2JSYMCO", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2H82OFO"], "published": "2018-04-18T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T22:14:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
