Organic growth and EPS are still expected to improve but at more muted levels than last quarter’s all-time highs. Meanwhile, margin outlooks temper as more than 60% report a High level of concern with rising input costs.\nContinuing, 65% believe we are Mid-to-Late to Late in the Industrial cycle with 46% forecasting earnings will peak in 2019.\nViews on nearly all regional economy prospects softened, with sentiment on Eurozone, Mexico and Japan dampening the most. Still, China, which has been out-of-favor, and India, saw increased optimism.\nDespite increased uncertainty, 83% of respondents describe their sentiment as Neutral to Bullish or Bullish while none characterize their views as Bearish. As well, nearly 40% report they were Net Buyers amid the recent equity market dislocations.\n“We are at an interesting inflection point this earnings season, as many companies will likely report strong growth momentum in the first quarter but are now faced with rising inflation and interest rates, as well as the emergence of trade war uncertainty,” said Rebecca Corbin, Founder and CEO of Corbin Advisors. Ms. Corbin added, “The majority of investors are forecasting 2018 Industrial organic growth rates at a healthy 5% or greater, as companies continue to invest in innovation, capacity expansion and technology. Managements’ discussions on 2018 guidance outlooks will be in focus as investors seek clarity on the long-term impact of these mounting headwinds.”\nSurveyed financial professionals are most bullish on Defense, which saw the highest sentiment ever recorded for any industry, as well as Commercial Aerospace. Conversely, Auto remains the biggest laggard for the fifth consecutive quarter, while bearish sentiment increased on Non-Resi and Resi Construction and Chemicals.\nSince 2006, Corbin Advisors has tracked investor sentiment on a quarterly basis.
