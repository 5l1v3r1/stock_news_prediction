Either they must reacquire the land under the new law, or return it to us, so we can cultivate it and earn a living,” Gohil said.\n“Without our land, we are dead. So they may as well kill us,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nA Bhavnagar district official acknowledged they had received a letter from the farmers, and said police had not used force in removing them from the property.\n“The land was acquired following due process under the previous law, with adequate compensation paid to the farmers,” said the official, M.A. Gandhi.\n“Developing a project takes time. They were occupying it illegally for many years, and are now demanding compensation under the new law,” he said, referring to a law passed in 2013, that aimed to protect poor farmers.\nThe 2013 Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act requires consensus to buy the land, a social impact assessment, rehabilitation for those displaced and compensation of up to four times the market value.\nFarmers across the country are protesting in increasing numbers for the recognition of their rights over land and forests, and demanding a halt to acquisitions for industrial projects the government says are key to faster economic growth.\nLast month, more than 30,000 farmers walked 180 km (112 miles) over several days to Mumbai from the town of Nashik, in one of the largest such protests in recent years.\nOfficials in Gujarat, one of India’s most prosperous states, are luring investors to set up more industries, which often pits them against farmers and villagers fighting to keep their land.\nIdle land is particularly contentious, with a case filed in the Supreme Court last year petitioning for such land to be returned after a period of time.\nThe farmers in Bhavnagar will continue to protest till their demands are met, or ask to be killed by the state, Gohil said.
