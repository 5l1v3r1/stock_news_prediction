A fully accessible register of beneficial owners of U.K. real estate isn’t expected to go live until 2021, but current property owners need to start working to comply, attorneys said.\n“Current overseas investors will have to go through an audit and self-report exercise to make sure they comply with the new rules,” said David Seymour, a partner in the real-estate investments and transactions group at Ropes & Gray LLP in London. “If they don’t, it’s potentially a criminal offense and it will restrict transactions down the line,” he said.\nThe U.K. is trying to free its real-estate market of those who use it as a vehicle to launder proceeds of corruption. Property has a “particular appeal to high-end money launderers” who wish to conceal large amounts of money using only a few transactions, according to a national risk assessment of money laundering and terrorism financing released last year.\nThe push for transparency on beneficial ownership is part of a broad effort by the government to stamp out corruption in the U.K. Transparency International found in 2015 that 75% of properties whose owners were under investigation for corruption involved companies registered overseas.\nThe plan for a register follows the establishment of a public central registry of ultimate controllers of U.K. companies in June 2016. A month earlier, David Cameron, prime minister at the time, hosted the Anti-Corruption Summi t, a global gathering of leaders from governments and civil society groups.\nVarious other European countries have since set up registers of ultimate beneficial ownership of companies, a requirement under the E.U.’s Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which became effective last year.\nFor the register of property owners, the U.K. will define a person of significant control as an individual or legal entity that ultimately owns or controls more than 25% of a company’s shares or voting rights, or exercises control over management of a firm.\n“One of the essential aspects of the register [is] that it is publicly and easily accessible in order to improve transparency and accountability of overseas legal entities operating in the U.K.,” the government said in a paper setting out its views on the register in late March.\nIndividuals may be able to keep their details out of the register in certain cases, according to a client notice by London-based attorneys at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. Cases include those that could pose a safety risk.\nThe government also signaled that beneficial owners of personal and family trusts that have provided details to the HM Revenue and Customs could remain private under the new register, in cases where confidentiality is needed. Details of ultimate owners in trusts are only shared with law enforcement, said the attorneys.\nUnder the proposed system, foreign entities investing in property will have to disclose their ultimate beneficial owners to Companies House, a public register of U.K. companies—private and public. They will have to provide minimum information on the individual stakeholder, including full name and address, nationality and date of birth.\nInvestors will use their Companies House registration to record their property holdings with HM Land Registry. Only then will a legal title be provided.\nIf a foreign entity fails to comply with the registration, “it is likely that, at a minimum, a restriction will be placed on the registered title to prevent a future transaction affecting the real estate,” said the Bryan Case attorneys.\nThe registry will cover residential and commercial property, as well as firms seeking government contracts.\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.
