It has weakened 0.6 percent so far this month, taking its year-to-date losses to nearly 3 percent, extending a theme firmly in place since last year. \nThe dollar hit a two-week low of 89.36 last week. \n\"The military strikes were well telegraphed and we are seeing a continuation in the broad market theme from last week of a weaker dollar and favourable conditions for risk taking,\" said Credit Agricole currency strategist Manuel Oliveri. \nIn a wider measure of dollar positioning that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian rouble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short position valued at $27.21 billion, its biggest since August 2011. \nOther major currencies also remain trapped in trading ranges, with the euro starting the week around $1.23, a level around which it had traded all last week. \nThe U.S. Treasury semi-annual report didn't jolt the currency markets, with the Trump administration again refraining from naming any major trading partners as currency manipulators as it pursues potential tariffs and negotiations to try to cut a massive trade deficit with China. \nAlthough the Japanese yen usually draws demand in times of political tension and market turmoil due to its perceived safe-haven status, the dollar's losses against it were small. \n\"The reaction in currencies has been limited as President Trump had provided advance notice about a possible strike on Syria, giving speculators ample time to brace for the actual event,\" said Yukio Ishizuki, senior forex strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. \n\"Many speculators are showing less of a response to yen-supportive factors lately, after the Bank of Japan made clear it was not going to normalise policy soon. This goes for domestic factors as well, like falling support ratings for (Japan Prime Minister Shinzo) Abe.\" \nSupport for Abe, who is plagued by accusations of cronyism and cover-ups, fell to 26.7 percent in a survey by private broadcaster Nippon TV released on Sunday, the lowest since he took office in December 2012. \nSterling was the big outperformer in currency markets with the British currency vaulting half a percent above the $1.43 line as investors focused on data that could help shore up expectations of a May interest rate hike. \n(Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; Editing by Mark Heinrich) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T19:03:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
