U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday predicted China would take down its trade barriers, while Chinese officials have said this is not the time for negotiations. Two days later, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to further open the country’s economy and lower tariffs on certain products, though the country’s Foreign Ministry on Wednesday said that pledge was unrelated to the trade tensions with the United States.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell, who took the helm at the central bank in early February when Janet Yellen’s term ended, said on Friday that the Fed saw risks to the economy as “roughly balanced.”\nThe details released on Wednesday showed more Fed policymakers believe inflation could well be higher than they currently expect. In December, two policymakers thought that inflation was more likely to be lower than expected and two thought higher than expected was more likely.\nBut in March, three policymakers considered inflation poised to potentially outperform forecasts while none saw underperformance as more likely.
