That has improved the efficiency and productivity of staff by removing roles and functions that were no longer required, it said.\n“In the first six months, we acted boldly and decisively to reduce our costs and increase our productivity through the VSP and other programmes,” Group Chief Executive Officer Richard Brasher said in a statement.\n“By doing so we built a leaner, fitter and stronger Pick n Pay, and gave ourselves the headroom to reduce our prices from the second half of the year.”\nSouth African shoppers are feeling the impact of low growth in disposable income, little to no job creation and tight credit conditions.\nTo keep attracting struggling consumers, Pick n Pay invested 500 million rand in price cuts across 1,300 everyday grocery items and extended this to 2,000 items in the second half.\nThe group opened 59 franchise stores during the year, including 7 supermarkets, 35 liquor stores, 9 express stores and 8 spaza shops — a local convenience store. It also opened 29 clothing stores.\nPick n Pay, which also owns discount grocery chain Boxer, declared a final dividend of 155.40 cents per share, bringing the total annual dividend for the year to 188.80 cents, up 7.1 percent.\nThe group expects the stuff cut programme, both on sales and profit to deliver further momentum in the 2019 financial year.
