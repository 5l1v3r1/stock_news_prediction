Iran-backed militias first helped his army stem rebel advances and, following Russia’s entry into the war in 2015, turn the tide decisively in Assad’s favor. \nIn a meeting with military commanders on Sunday, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed confidence that enemies would fail in any confrontation with Iran. \n“Despite all the conspiracies ... of the enemies, the power of the Islamic system will increase day by day,” IRNA quoted Khamenei as saying.
