Total shares gained 0.7 percent.\nWith Shell’s output up 2 percent at 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) and Total’s production rising 5 percent to 2.7 million boe/d in the quarter, both were well positioned to capture the price upswing in benchmark oil prices.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, together with other producers led by Russia, started in early 2017 to throttle its output to revive prices and regain market share from U.S. oil producers.

Adjusted net income rose to $5.322 billion, topping a company-provided analysts’ consensus of $5.277 billion.\nTotal’s net adjusted profit came in at $2.9 billion, beating analysts’ forecast of $2.77 billion in the quarter.\nArmed with such results, Shell and Total are in payback mood to investors, buying back shares after diluting stakes with scrip dividends - consisting of shares rather than cash - introduced after the price crash which sent oil prices as low as $28 a barrel.
