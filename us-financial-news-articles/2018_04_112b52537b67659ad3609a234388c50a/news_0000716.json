Curtis McElhinney had 32 saves for the Maple Leafs while improving to 11-5-1 on the season.\nSam Reinhart and Jason Pominville scored for Buffalo. Chad Johnson finished with 31 saves for the Sabres in losing for just the second time in 10 career decisions (7-2-1) against Toronto.\nJohnsson gave Toronto a 1-0 lead in the first period when he scored his second goal of the season. Tomas Plekanec picked up the puck along the left boards and fired a pass across the crease to Johnsson, who was left alone by the right side of the net where he tapped the puck through Johnson’s pads.\nBuffalo tied it early in the second period on Reinhart’s power-play goal, his 24th of the season, on a redirect of a Rasmus Ristolainen shot from high slot while Roman Polak was serving a double-minor for high-sticking Jack Eichel.\nBut the Maple Leafs took control with three goals in a span of 5:39 starting with a power-play tally by Matthews, who fired a wrist shot from the dot in the left circle.\nMatthews then displayed his passing skills, taking the puck in his own end and firing a laser down the middle of the ice to Nylander, who split the defense and fired a wrist shot past Johnson’s glove side.\nNylander then made it 4-1 with his second goal in less than three minutes and 19th of the season when he took a pass from Zach Hyman in the slot and roofed a shot over Johnson’s glove.\nPominville cut the Toronto lead to 4-2 early in the third period with his 14th goal of the season, banging in a rebound from the right side of the net. But Matthews answered with his second of the game and 33rd of the season 3 1/2 minutes later with another wrist shot from the bottom of the left circle off a pass from Nylander.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:56:41.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
