I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”\nHe also said that Facebook’s major investments in security “will significantly impact our profitability going forward.” Zuckerberg is meeting with U.S. lawmakers Monday ahead of two days of congressional testimony starting on Tuesday.\nFacebook shares were up 1.7 percent in midday trading.
