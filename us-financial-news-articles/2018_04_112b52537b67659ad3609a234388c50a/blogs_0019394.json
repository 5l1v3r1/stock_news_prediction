Photo: Serious Fraud Office \nThe U.K. Serious Fraud Office named its chief operating officer as interim director on Tuesday, 10 days before the departure of current head David Green.\nMark Thompson will take over as interim director on April 21, said the SFO, a special agency with powers to investigate and prosecute serious economic crimes.\nA new permanent director was selected but couldn’t yet be named, said the announcement from the Attorney General’s office, which is in charge of naming the SFO’s director.\n“They are currently undertaking the final stages of the appointment process and managing their exit from their current position,” stated the announcement. “We will make an announcement in due course and the new director will take up the role later this year.”\nMr. Thompson joined the SFO in 2004 and headed its proceeds of crime division from 2012 to 2016. He was named chief financial officer in 2015. He is a chartered accountant and previously worked as a police officer.\nThe interim appointment reflects the poor recruiting process for the top job at the special prosecutor and recasts a shadow over the SFO’s place in the U.K.’s constellation of economic crime-fighting agencies, said some London-based attorneys.\n“This delay [in naming a new director] is very odd,” said Stephen Parkinson, head of criminal litigation at Kingsley Napley.\nThe interviews for the post were concluded more than a month ago and some delay is usually expected because the successful candidate needs to be approved by the attorney general and the prime minister. But even the most thorough background check can be conducted in a short period of time, he said.\n“The way the government managed this [recruiting] process has been very inefficient,” said Mr. Parkinson.\nNo surprise \nThe departure of Mr. Green was known for at least two years, as his four-year contract was extended for two more years in 2016.\nThe agency’s interim head likely will be constrained in decisions regarding new corporate investigations and charges, especially as a permanent candidate has already been found, said Mr. Parkinson.\nMark Thompson isn’t a lawyer and has never made decisions on prosecutions so his doing so could undercut his successor, said Mr, Parkinson.\n“The SFO will be drifting for the next few weeks if not months…that’s highly regrettable,” said Mr. Parkinson who, 15 years ago, made the shortlist of candidates for director of the SFO.\nThe recruitment of a new head of the SFO was delayed, in part, because of a broad government review of its economic crime agencies that concluded in December. There was a chance the SFO would be folded into the National Crime Agency, as had been promised by Prime Minister Theresa May . Such a decision would have significantly affected the role of the SFO’s director.\nThat didn’t come to pass but the review reshaped the landscape of the financial crime-fighting agencies in the U.K. and included the creation of a new national economic crime center within the NCA.\nThe review envisions better coordination of law enforcement response to financial crime by giving the NCA the power to “directly task” the SFO to investigate the worst offenders.\nThat has yet to play out as the new center hasn’t been established, but its prospect still hangs over the SFO, said Alison Geary, counsel in the financial crime practice of law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP. The new director will have a key role in establishing where the SFO fits once the National Economic Crime Center is established, she said.\nThe background and personality of the selected candidate may offer clues as to what the SFO-NECC relationship might look like,” said Ms. Geary.\nWrite to Mara Lemos Stein at mara.lemos-stein@wsj.com.
