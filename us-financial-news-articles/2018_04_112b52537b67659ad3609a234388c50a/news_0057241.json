International Labor Organization (ILO) and rights group Walk Free Foundation.\nIn recent years modern slavery has come under the global spotlight, putting greater regulatory and consumer pressure on companies to ensure their supply chains are free of forced labor, child labor and other forms of slavery.\n“We hope CGF members will be able to direct more efforts and resources towards meaningfully protecting workers and engaging more deeply with their supply chains,” Kilian Moote, director of KnowTheChain (KTC), told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nKTC is a project of Humanity United, a U.S.-based foundation, for businesses and investors looking to address forced labor in supply chains.\nFrom chocolate and tea to shrimp and sugar, food and drink supply chains are complex with multiple layers across various countries - whether in sourcing raw ingredients or processing the final product - making it hard to spot and remedy abuses.\n“Increasingly complex global supply chains mean companies must undertake detailed checks to ensure their products are not created at the expense of the workers,” said Joe Bardwell of the British-based Business & Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC).\nThe CGF - which includes most consumer goods giants from Campbell Soup to Unilever Plc - said its members have combined sales of $4.3 trillion and directly employ nearly 10 million people, with a further 90 million jobs along their value chains.\n“The SSCI will support continuous improvement ... worldwide in order to achieve our common goal of more sustainable supply chains,” said Chris Tyas, global head of supply chain at food group Nestle, which makes KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups.\nReporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Katy Migiro.
