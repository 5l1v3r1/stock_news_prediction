( https://on.wsj.com/2GV0Prl )\nWells Fargo's corporate bank and investment bank, though not fully merged, will now share profit and loss targets across industry verticals, the Journal said.\nThe Journal also reported that the bank has told staff of several dozen layoffs as recently as on Wednesday in its markets division, which is part of Wells Fargo's wholesale division along with corporate and investing banking.\nThose layoffs affect senior and junior employees in areas including credit sales and trading units and are based on a review of the business and staffing level adjustments, one of the people told WSJ. The layoffs are not directly tied to the corporate bank and investment bank integration, the person said.\nThe San Francisco-based bank declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
