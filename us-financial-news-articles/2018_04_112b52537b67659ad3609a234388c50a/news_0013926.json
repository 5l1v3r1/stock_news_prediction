The frequency of magnitude 3.0 or greater earthquakes fell to just over 300 last year.\nPerry, Oklahoma, is about 50 miles from Cushing, a town sometimes referred to as the “Pipeline Crossroads of the World” and home to massive storage tanks. Currently, about 35 million barrels of oil are held in Cushing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\nA spokesman for Magellan Midstream Partners, which owns about 12 million barrels of capacity at Cushing, said its pipelines and terminals were operating normally on Monday. Enbridge Energy Partners, which has about 20 million barrels of storage, also said there was no impact to its operations, and Blueknight Energy Partners said operations were normal.\nPhillips 66 said its Ponca City refinery about 40 miles from Perry was not affected.\nReporting by Liz Hampton; Additional reporting by Devika Krishna-Kumar in New York and Erwin Seba in Houston; editing by Diane Craft and Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T21:30:09.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
