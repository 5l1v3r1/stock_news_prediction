According to a Bloomberg report , Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc also reiterated the illegality of Vietnamese financial institutions going anywhere near cryptocurrencies. \nICOs are a form of fundraising in which “investors” pay for new virtual coins issued by a company, which will supposedly be useful at some point. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is busily trying to crack down on scammy ICOs , although it is adamant that not all of the offerings are fraudulent . China has banned ICOs outright . \nAs for the Vietnamese case, news outlet Tuoi Tre News reported earlier this week that the offices of the company behind the two allegedly fraudulent ICOs, Modern Tech, were besieged by angry investors. However, the building’s owners said Modern Tech had liquidated and cleared out its office a month ago. \nAccording to that report, Modern Tech claimed to be the authorized Vietnamese representative for the launches of the iFan and Pincoin platforms. It claimed iFan was a Singaporean project and Pincoin a Dubai-based scheme; in fact, Modern Tech itself was behind them. \nThe websites for both schemes are still live. Pincoin claims to be a cryptocurrency for the “sharing economy.” Meanwhile, iFan is supposedly the “most advanced social network”—an Ethereum-based platform for celebrities and their communities of fans, using a token called ERC20. \nBoth are apparently classic pyramid schemes, with new investors’ money going to pay off older investors. All investors were promised huge returns—”profit up to 40% monthly,” Pincoin’s investors were told. However, while investors could see the value of their token rise within the platforms’ systems, Tuoi Tre News reported that they were unable to withdraw their profits in cash. \nIn total, 32,000 people reportedly fell victim to the scheme, shelling out 15 trillion Vietnamese dong ($658 million .)
