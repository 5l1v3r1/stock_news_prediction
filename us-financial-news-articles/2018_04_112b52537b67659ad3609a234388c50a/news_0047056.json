REUTERS/Michaela Rehle//File Photo \nThe update comes ahead of the company’s annual general meeting on Wednesday. \nMunich Re has posted declines in profit over the past five years, but is counting on a reversal in fortune in 2018. \nIt stuck to its guidance for 2018 consolidated net profit of 2.1-2.5 billion euros. \n“We’ve reached a turnaround and our profit target for 2018 is higher than last year,” CEO Joachim Wenning said in an interview with Reuters published earlier on Monday. \nLast year, Munich Re eked out a small profit after a spate of hurricanes and other natural catastrophes in North America prompted record claims to insurers across the industry. \nNet profit of over 800 million euros in the quarter would be a large gain on the 557 million euros for the first quarter of last year. \n“The main reason for this good result is low major-loss expenditure in reinsurance,” Munich Re said in a statement late on Monday.
