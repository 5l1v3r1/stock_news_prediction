Brent, the global benchmark, gained 48 cents, or 0.7%, to $68.12 a barrel.\nPrices had slid to a two-week low Monday , with Brent closing down 2.5%, after China imposed import tariffs on U.S. goods . That was a response to tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum imports introduced by the Trump administration earlier this year. Analysts and traders have warned that these actions could trigger a global trade war that would weigh on economic growth and subsequently damp demand for petroleum products.\n“The trade disputes continue to create market noise, putting downward pressure in particular on the cyclical commodities” such as oil, said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer. “Despite the global economy humming, we see more downside for the asset class as market mood cools and profit-taking pressures prices,” Mr. Ruecker said in a note Tuesday.\nBrent had closed above $70 a barrel ahead of the Easter weekend—close to a three-year high—with growing geopolitical risk lifting prices.\nBut prices started the second quarter under pressure. In addition to concerns about trade, prices were hurt by burgeoning Russian oil production in March and a “confirmation that U.S. supply outperformed expectations in January,” according to analysts at consultancy JBC Energy.\nRussia’s crude output in March climbed by 20,000 barrels a day to 10.97 million barrels a day, according to government data. “It is the first increase since December and the highest production level for 11 months, which takes Russian output above the agreed ceiling” of its deal with OPEC, according to Tamas Varga, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 10 countries outside the oil cartel, including Russia, have been holding back crude output by roughly 1.8 million barrels a day since the start of last year. The deal, which is set to expire at the end of 2018, has helped drain a global supply glut that has weighed on prices since late 2014. Traders await government data on U.S. crude stockpiles Wednesday. Analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect on average that crude inventories increased 1 million barrels in the week ended March 30.\nThe American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said late Tuesday its data for the week showed a 3.3 million-barrel decrease in crude supplies, a 1.1 million-barrel rise in gasoline stocks and a 2.2 million-barrel increase in distillate inventories, according to a market participant.\nGasoline futures increased 0.4% to $1.9741 a gallon, and diesel futures rose 0.8% to $1.9950 a gallon.\n—Stephanie Yang contributed to this article.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T06:12:57.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
