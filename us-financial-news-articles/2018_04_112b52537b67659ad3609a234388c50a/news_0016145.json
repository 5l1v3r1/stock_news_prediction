And it’s actually come at a very good time because I still haven’t put pen to paper.”\nEditing by Alan Baldwin and Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:36:56.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
