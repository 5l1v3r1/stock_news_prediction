REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nMay is looking to win the support of the Commonwealth, a network of mostly former British colonies, for future trade deals at a meeting of its leaders in London, and bolster her argument that the future is bright after Brexit. \nThe Commonwealth, headed by Queen Elizabeth, is not a formal trading bloc with a free-trade agreement. In 2015 it accounted for only 9 percent of British exports while by contrast the EU, which Britain voted to leave in 2016, accounted for around 44 percent. \nSpeaking at the opening of a Commonwealth business forum, May urged the use of common standards across the network of 53 countries, warning that global growth was fragile and that protectionism posed a clear threat to the world economy. \n“With its unique scope and global voice, such a Commonwealth can set a powerful example to the world, one that demonstrates and underlines the importance of protecting free trade and the rules-based international order,” she said. \n“Freer and easier trade means stronger economies, more jobs, more choice and lower prices.” \nThe lavish week-long Commonwealth meeting, split across landmark locations in London, is likely to be overshadowed by May’s decision to join U.S. and French air strikes on Syria on Saturday in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack.

The EU has said Britain cannot enjoy the benefits of its single market after leaving. \nMay’s ministers have spent much of their time since the 2016 exit vote touring the globe, touting Britain’s ability to negotiate its own trade deals with countries including Commonwealth states such as Australia, India, and New Zealand as one of the main benefits of life outside the EU. \n“Our Commonwealth family already accounts for one-fifth of global trade,” May said in a statement before the meeting. \n“And we must continue to work together to build further upon this solid foundation by building on our existing trade links and establishing new ones.” Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends a press conference in 10 Downing Street, London, April 14, 2018.
