The leading businesses of the future will be those that empower the workforce of the future and their value networks with knowledge and know-how to deliver new categories of sustainable solutions. Digital experience platforms are the infrastructures of the 21st century: they have transformed retail, transportation and hospitality services; the industrial world is next. The 3D EXPERIENCE Marketplace positions Dassault Systèmes as a catalyst of this transformation.\n“The sharp increase in 3D EXPERIENCE licenses revenue proves that our 3D EXPERIENCE platform opens up whole new market opportunities. It brings unparalleled added value for customers in terms of leadership and innovation as the platform is both an operating system, as shown this quarter by Gilead Sciences and a business model. Our Cloud offer represents for large and smaller companies, like recent new engagements with Kärcher and EVelozcity, the possibility to reduce to zero the distance to their own clients. For the SOLIDWORKS users’ community it represents the opportunity to benefit from a wide range of marketplace services.”\n2018 First Quarter Financial Summary\n(Unaudited)\nSoftware Revenue in millions of Euros IFRS IFRS15 Basis Q118 Difference IAS 18 Basis Q118 IAS 18 Basis Q117 IAS 18 Change IAS 18Change in cc* Total Software Revenue 735.1 (49.4) 685.7 670.2 2% 11% - Licenses and Other software 179.1 1.4 180.5 173.0 4% 14% - Recurring software 556.0 (50.8) 505.3 497.2 2% 10% Americas total software 209.6 (13.8) 195.8 201.3 -3% 12% Europe total software 325.0 (36.1) 288.9 280.7 3% 7% Asia total software 200.6 0.4 201.0 188.2 7% 16% Software Revenue in millions of Euros Non-IFRS IFRS15 Basis Q118 Difference IAS 18 Basis Q118 IAS 18 Basis Q117 IAS 18 Change IAS 18Change in cc* Total Software Revenue 737.0 (49.4) 687.6 676.1 2% 10% - Licenses and Other software 179.1 1.4 180.5 173.0 4% 14% - Recurring software 557.9 (50.8) 507.2 503.2 1% 9% Americas total software 210.5 (13.8) 196.7 203.2 -3% 11% Europe total software 325.3 (36.0) 289.3 284.4 2% 6% Asia total software 201.2 0.4 201.6 188.6 7% 16% * In constant currencies\nFirst Quarter 2018 versus 2017 Financial Comparisons on an IAS 18 Basis (“IAS 18 IFRS and IAS 18 non-IFRS”)\nOn an IAS 18 basis, total revenue increased 10% (IFRS) and 9% (non-IFRS). First quarter financial results include EXA Corporation, an acquisition completed on November 17, 2017. Excluding acquisitions, IAS 18 non-IFRS total revenue increased 7% and software revenue increased 8%. (All growth rates are in constant currencies.) On an IAS 18 basis and in constant currencies: Software revenue increased 11% (IFRS) and 10% (non-IFRS). Licenses and other software revenue grew 14% (IFRS and non-IFRS), with double-digit growth for CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, ENOVIA, SIMULIA, DELMIA and GEOVIA. Non-IFRS Recurring revenue, comprised of Subscription and Support revenue, represented 74% of non-IFRS software revenue. Non-IFRS Recurring revenue increased 9% reflecting strong growth in Subscription revenue, including the acquisition of EXA, and continued strong Support renewal rates in all three regions. (In the Company’s financial statements the line item ‘Periodic and Maintenance Revenue’ has been updated to ‘Subscription and Support Revenue’ commencing with the 2018 First Quarter and combined represent the Company’s ‘Recurring Revenue’.) IAS 18 non-IFRS software revenue increased double-digits in constant currencies across Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Equipment, Consumer Goods & Retail, Architecture, Engineering & Construction and Natural Resources. The Company noted an improving dynamic in Life Sciences. On a regional and IAS 18 basis: Asia non-IFRS software revenue increased 16% on broad-based growth in China, India and South Korea and strong improvement in Japan. In Europe non-IFRS software revenue increased 6% with notable performances in Western and Southern Europe as well as Russia. In the Americas, non-IFRS software revenue increased 11% on North America growth dynamics. High Growth Countries non-IFRS software revenue increased 12% on strong growth in a number of countries. (All growth rates are in constant currencies.) On an IAS 18 basis, 3D EXPERIENCE software revenue was up 26% during the 2018 first quarter, with Go Live implementations continuing and new 3D EXPERIENCE investments commencing with multiple large customers. More specifically, the Company noted new wins including in Electric Vehicles where it has the leading industry presence and in Industrial Equipment, Marine & Offshore and High Tech, as well as 3D EXPERIENCE programs ramping with large clients in Transportation & Mobility, in Aerospace & Defense as well as in Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail. 3D EXPERIENCE cloud activity was up significantly during the first quarter. Services revenue of €84 million was unchanged in constant currencies (IAS 18 IFRS and non-IFRS) on a mixed performance. The Company noted strong growth in 3D EXPERIENCE services activity. IAS 18 IFRS operating income increased 8%. IAS 18 non-IFRS operating income totaled €208.3 million, representing an increase of 4% as reported but 18% in constant currencies. The IAS 18 non-IFRS operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27.0% in the first quarter, compared to 26.2% in the year-ago period, reflecting underlying organic improvement of 240 basis points, offset by negative currency effects of 110 basis points and acquisition dilution estimated at 50 basis points. Principally reflecting the U.S. Tax Reform Act of 2017, the Company’s IAS 18 IFRS and non-IFRS effective tax rates decreased to 25.0% and 28.9%, respectively, in the 2018 first quarter compared to 31.8% and 31.9%, respectively, in the year-ago period. IAS 18 non-IFRS financial revenue totaled €5.2 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to €0.6 million in the year-ago period principally due to lower currency exchange losses. IAS 18 IFRS diluted net income per share increased 18% or 33% in constant currencies. IAS 18 non-IFRS diluted net income per share totaled €0.59, increasing 11% or 26% at constant currency.\nBusiness Outlook\n(Discussion on an IAS 18, non-IFRS basis, with revenue growth rates in constant currencies)\nPascal Daloz, Dassault Systèmes’ Executive Vice President, CFO and Corporate Strategy Officer, commented , “ We expected a strong start to 2018 and are pleased to report that first quarter results came in well aligned with this objective. Software revenue increased 10%, with licenses and other software growth of 14% and recurring software revenue growth of 9% in constant currencies. Earnings per share increased 11% or 26% excluding strong currency headwinds. Those good results are also reflected in strong cash flow from operations, up 17%.\n“Importantly, the first quarter results demonstrated the improving breadth and balance of our financial performance. Our three sales channels, all major brands and 9 of 12 geos reported strong license revenue growth in constant currencies. Moreover, looking at total software performance, we saw a similar pattern of strength across Transportation & Mobility, Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Equipment, Consumer Goods & Retail, Architecture, Engineering & Construction and Natural Resources as well as improvement in Life Sciences.\n“For the second quarter, we anticipate a strong performance with non-IFRS total revenue growth of 8% to 10% and non-IFRS EPS of about €0.65 to €0.68, representing growth of about 16% to 22% at constant currency (all on an IAS 18 basis).\n“We are reconfirming our 2018 financial objectives with IAS 18 non-IFRS total revenue growth of about 8% to 9% in constant currencies, a IAS 18 non-IFRS operating margin of 31% to 31.5%, and IAS 18 non-IFRS earnings per share of €2.83 to €2.88, representing growth of about 11% to 13% at constant currency.\n“In summary, the first quarter well underscores our strategy and growth drivers at work. We look forward to sharing our perspectives for the future at our Capital Markets Day on June 15th.”\nThe Company’s second quarter and full year 2018 financial objectives are given in IAS 18 on a non-IFRS basis:\nSecond quarter 2018 IAS 18 non-IFRS total revenue objective of about €815 to €830 million based upon the exchange rates assumptions below, growing about 8% to 10% in constant currencies; non-IFRS operating margin of about 29% to 30%; and non-IFRS EPS of about €0.65 to €0.68, up 5% to 10%, or about 16% to 22% at constant currency; 2018 IAS 18 non-IFRS revenue growth objective of about 8% to 9% in constant currencies at €3.355 to €3.385 billion (reflecting the principal 2018 currency exchange rate assumptions below for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional currencies representing about 17% of the Company’s total revenue in 2017); 2018 IAS 18 non-IFRS operating margin of about 31% to 31.5%, compared to 32% in 2017, reflecting acquisition dilution and currency headwinds offset in part by moderate organic improvement at constant currency; 2018 IAS 18 non-IFRS EPS of about €2.83 to €2.88, representing a growth objective of about 6% to 8%, or about 11% to 13% on a constant currency basis; Objectives are based upon exchange rate assumptions of US$1.25 per €1.00 for the 2018 second quarter and US$1.20 per €1.00 for the 2018 second half; and JPY135.0 per €1.00 for the 2018 second quarter and JPY134.5 per €1.00 for full year 2018 before hedging.\nThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.\nThe 2018 non-IFRS objectives, which are stated on an IAS 18 basis, set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements and are estimated based upon the 2018 principal currency exchange rates above: deferred revenue write-downs estimated at approximately €5 million on an IAS 18 basis, share-based compensation expense, including related social charges, estimated at approximately €78 million and amortization of acquired intangibles estimated at approximately €160 million. The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expense, net principally comprised of acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, from one-time items included in financial revenue and from one-time tax restructuring gains and losses. Finally, these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants, or any new acquisitions or restructurings completed after April 25, 2018.\nCash Flow and Other Financial Highlights Under IAS 18 For Year-over-Year Comparisons\nThe Company’s net cash flow from operations for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 is identical under IFRS 15 in comparison to IAS 18 although some of the line items differ. (See page 19 in the Appendix to this press release for further details including a reconciliation of the cash flow statement and balance sheets under IFRS 15 compared to IAS 18 for the quarter and period ended March 31, 2018.)\nIAS 18 net operating cash flow increased 17% to €406.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to €347.8 million in the 2017 First Quarter on growth in net income and working capital evolution.\nDassault Systèmes’ net financial position totaled €1.85 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to €1.46 billion at December 31, 2017, reflecting cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of €2.85 billion and long-term debt of €1.00 billion.\nCash Dividend Recommendation, Annual Shareholders’ Meeting Date and Filing of Regulatory Annual Report\nThe Board of Directors has scheduled the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting for May 22, 2018 and is recommending a dividend per share equivalent to €0.58 per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of approximately 9% compared to the prior year €0.53 per share. In addition, as in recent years, it will also be proposed that each shareholder be granted the option to choose to receive payment of the dividend in cash or new shares. Shareholders may choose payment of the dividend in cash or new shares between May 29, 2018 and June 8, 2018, inclusive. Shares will be traded ex-dividend as of May 29, 2018. Dividends will be made payable as from June 19, 2018. These recommendations are subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting.

Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors. The Company’s current outlook for 2018 takes into consideration, among other things, an uncertain global economic environment. In light of the continuing uncertainties regarding economic, business, social and geopolitical conditions at the global level, the Company’s revenue, net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly, whether on an annual or quarterly basis. While the Company makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook, the Company’s business results, however, may not develop as anticipated. Further, there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results. The Company’s actual results or performance may also be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties, as described in the “Risk Factors” section of the 2017 Document de Référence (Annual Report) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 21, 2018 and also available on the Company’s website www.3ds.com .\nIn preparing such forward-looking statements, the Company has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.25 per €1.00 for the 2018 second quarter and US$1.20 per €1.00 for the 2018 second half as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY135.0 to €1.00 for the 2018 second quarter and JPY134.5 to €1.00 for the full year 2018 before hedging; however, currency values fluctuate, and the Company’s results of operations may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.\nNon-IFRS Financial Information\nReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered as a substitute for IFRS measurements. Also, the Company’s supplemental non-IFRS financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled non-IFRS measures used by other companies. Further specific limitations for individual non-IFRS measures, and the reasons for presenting non-IFRS financial information, are set forth in the Company’s 2017 Document de Référence filed with the AMF on March 21, 2018.\nIn the tables accompanying this press release the Company sets forth its supplemental non-IFRS figures for revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income and diluted earnings per share, which exclude the effect of adjusting the carrying value of acquired companies’ deferred revenue, share-based compensation expense and related social charges, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other operating income and expense, net, certain one-time items included in financial revenue and other, net, and the income tax effect of the non-IFRS adjustments and certain one-time tax effects. The tables also set forth the most comparable IFRS financial measure and reconciliations of this information with non-IFRS information.\nThis press release constitutes the quarterly financial information required by article L.451-1-2 IV of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code Monétaire et Financier).\nAbout Dassault Systèmes\nDassault Systèmes, the 3DEXPERIENCE Company, provides business and people with virtual universes to imagine sustainable innovations.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts, particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore, we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and EPS (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us \"in constant currencies\", the results of the \"prior\" period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year, and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.\nWhile constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure, we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore, we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All constant currency information is provided on an approximate basis. Unless otherwise indicated, the impact of exchange rate fluctuations is approximately the same for both the Company’s IFRS and supplemental non-IFRS financial data.\nWe have followed a long-standing policy of setting our revenue growth objectives in constant currencies and calculating a reported revenue range based upon the key currency exchange rate assumptions outlined in our quarterly earnings reports and in our half-year and annual regulatory documents. We also set our non-IFRS revenue objectives in constant currencies in order to provide transparency on our activities as compared to the impact of currency exchange rates.\nInformation on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)\nIn addition to discussing total growth, we also provide financial information where we discuss growth excluding acquisitions or growth on an organic basis as used alternatively. In both cases, growth excluding acquisitions have been calculated using the following restatements of the scope of consolidation: for entities entering the consolidation scope in the current year, subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from the aggregates of the current year, and for entities entering the consolidation scope in the previous year, subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from January 1st of the current year, until the last day of the month of the current year when the acquisition was made the previous year.\nInformation on Industrial Sectors\nThe Company’s global customer base includes companies in 12 industrial sectors: Transportation & Mobility; Industrial Equipment; Aerospace & Defense; Financial & Business Services; High-Tech; Life Sciences; Energy, Process & Utilities; Consumer Goods & Retail; Natural Resources; Architecture, Engineering & Construction; Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail and Marine & Offshore. Commencing in 2012 we implemented an industry go-to-market strategy with the dual objectives of broadening and deepening our presence in our largest industries as well as increasing the contribution from a diversified set of industrial sectors. “Diversification Industries” include: Architecture, Engineering & Construction;

Under this method, the transition effect is accounted for within the consolidated equity at the date of initial application, i.e. January 1, 2018, without any adjustment to the prior year comparative information. See also the Company’s 2017 Document de Référence (Annual Report) for further information.\nRecurring software: Recurring software is comprised of subscription and support revenue. IFRS 15 has an impact on the timing of the quarterly recognition of subscription revenue but on a full year basis there is essentially no difference between IFRS 15 and IAS 18 for subscription contracts of one year in length. For the 2018 first quarter, recurring software revenue was €557.9 million under IFRS 15 and was €50.8 million higher compared to the prior IAS 18 standard. Previously, under IAS 18, we showed a ratable quarterly amount based upon the annual contract level of our on-premise subscription software. Under IFRS 15, for new contracts entered into or for contracts renewing, we have assigned an upfront value as required which is recognized in the first quarter of the contract, and the remainder which is recognized ratably during the four quarters. We continue to report both of these amounts within recurring revenue, specifically as subscription revenue (previously called periodic revenue). Historically, a higher proportion of subscription contracts are renewed in the first quarter of the year than in the other three quarters of the year. Operating expenses and sales commissions: The Company continues to expense sales commissions under the IFRS 15 standard as was done under IAS 18. Therefore, there are no capitalized sales commissions. As a result, the Company’s operating expenses are identical under IFRS 15 and IAS 18. One-time permanent difference: The implementation of IFRS 15 on January 1, 2018 resulted in a one-time permanent difference between IFRS 15 and IAS 18, where the deferred portion of rental agreements concluded in prior years will not be recognized into revenue. As a result, the corresponding amount of €80 million, net of taxes (€110 million before) was recorded in stockholders’ equity as of January 1, 2018. Initial impact on unearned revenue: At March 31, 2018 unearned revenue on the Balance Sheet under IFRS 15 is not directly comparable to the year-ago March 31, 2017 balance sheet under the prior standard IAS 18. This is due to the fact that the March 31, 2018 balance sheet line item unearned revenue has been reduced by €158 million, reflecting mainly (i) the one-time permanent difference of €110 million, and (ii) the higher amount of recurring revenue recognized in the first quarter under IFRS 15 compared to IAS 18 in the amount of €49.4 million.\nDASSAULT SYSTEMES\nRECONCILIATION P&L NON-IFRS IAS 18 vs IFRS 15\n(unaudited;
