The coalition argues that the Alphabet -owned site had \"actual knowledge\" they are trafficking personal information of children under 13 and, as a result, are breaching COPPA laws.\nGoogle said that while it had not received the complaint, \"protecting kids and families has always been a top priority.\"\n\"We will read the complaint thoroughly and evaluate if there are things we can do to improve. Because YouTube is not for children, we've invested significantly in the creation of the YouTube Kids app to offer an alternative, specifically designed for children,\" a YouTube spokesperson told CNBC in an email.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T15:41:48.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
