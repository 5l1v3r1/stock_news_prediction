But he has said it would be “self evidently ridiculous” if the agency received more in blockbuster funding than in core funding in a year. \nThe SFO’s average annual core budget has stood at around 33 million pounds, although when bolstered by blockbuster reserves, annual funding has ranged from around 38 million to 61 million pounds over the last six years, according to its website. \nUnder the new scheme, the agency will still be able to request special blockbuster funding. But this cash will no longer be ringfenced around specific cases, allowing the agency to re-allocate staff between cases. Those resources will be limited to cover costs of more than 2.5 million pounds on any single case in a year. $1 = 0.7029 pounds Reporting by Kirstin Ridley Editing by Huw Jones and Andrew Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T20:43:54.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
