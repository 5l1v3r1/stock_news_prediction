Slideshow (5 Images)\n“I think the signals of the Jaguars relocating to London are premature and very assumptive at this point,” he told Reuters.\n“Khan has invested a lot in the areas around the NFL stadium in Jacksonville with plans to develop even more around it, so it would be millions of dollars down the drain if the ultimate plan was simply to rip the team away as all of that comes to fruition. For now, I view it as just a value investment with a lot of potential return for Khan.” Writing by William Schomberg and Neil Robinson; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:52:07.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
