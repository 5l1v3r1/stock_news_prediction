Marcin Gortat and Otto Porter Jr. added 12 points apiece and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 10 for the eighth-seeded Wizards.\nDeMar DeRozan had 35 points, six rebounds and six assists for the top-seeded Raptors, who were outscored 66-47 in the second half. Kyle Lowry made four 3-pointers while scoring 19 points, Jonas Valanciunas had 11 points and Jakob Poeltl tallied 10 for Toronto.\nGame 5 is Wednesday in Toronto.\nShortly after Beal’s exit, the Wizards took control with a 12-2 burst to take a 104-96 lead with 21.9 seconds left. The Raptors were unable to get closer than six points.\nLowry drained a 3-pointer to open the second half to give Toronto a 54-40 lead.\nWashington followed by erupting with an 18-4 burst and tied the score at 58 on Gortat’s short hook shot with 8:11 remaining.\nThe Wizards inched ahead at 66-65 when Beal buried a 3-pointer with 5:27 remaining but the Raptors recovered to take an 80-75 lead on DeRozan’s 3-pointer with 37.9 seconds left in the quarter.\nBut Oubre converted a three-point play and Mike Scott knocked down a jumper with 0.2 seconds left to tie it at 80. That finished off a 40-point stanza in which Washington was 15 of 23 from the field.\nToronto scored the first eight points of the final quarter to take an 88-80 lead. The Wizards used their own 8-0 run a short time later to tie it at 90 on two free throws by Beal with 6:05 to play.\nBut Beal fouled out with the score tied at 92 with 4:58 left on a play in which it appeared DeRozan initiated the contact.\nPoeltl hit a jumper 21 seconds later to put Toronto ahead before the Wizards put together their decisive run.\nDeRozan scored 15 first-half points as the Raptors held a 51-40 lead at the break.\nDeRozan missed all five of his field-goal attempts in the first quarter but hit 9 of 12 free throws as Toronto led 30-22 after the end of the period.\nThe Raptors led 41-29 on Valanciunas’ inside basket with 6:06 left in the half before settling for the 11-point halftime edge.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:21:58.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
