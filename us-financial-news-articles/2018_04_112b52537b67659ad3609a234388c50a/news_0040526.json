Russia and its ally deny that.\nA U.N. security team came under fire in Syria on Wednesday while doing reconnaissance for inspectors to visit the sites of the suspected attack.\nThe United States, Britain and France fired missiles at Syrian targets on Saturday in retaliation for the suspected chemical use.\nNauert said the United States worried that the evidence would “deteriorate” the longer the inspectors were delayed.\n“That is of great concern to us,” she said.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton and David Alexander; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Eric Beech and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T00:21:34.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
