That set grain futures prices jumping.\nEconomic data showed the Chinese economy grew 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year, unchanged from the previous quarter.\nMarch retail sales jumped over 10 percent too, the strongest pace in four months, though other figures saw industrial output miss expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth also slowed.\n“Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech. This is encouraging,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore.\nSTERLING AND EARNINGS Commodity markets were still focused on the geopolitical situation in Syria and the fallout from the U.S. sanctions on Russia.\nBuoyed by growing expectations over tighter supply in the aftermath of sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal, aluminium prices jumped more than 1 percent to almost $2,500 a tonne to hit their highest since mid 2011. Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil steadied at $66.57 a barrel for U.S. crude and $71.66 a barrel for Brent having tumbled nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over Middle East tensions eased. In another sign of the returning risk appetite, the euro rose above $1.24 to a three-week high and Southern European government debt outperformed better-rated peers.\n“We have had a long enough period of extended volatility now that some of the more extended positions in risk assets have been reduced so that is also a positive,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets.\nOn sterling, which was buying just over $1.43, he added that with so much good Brexit news priced in in recent weeks and rate hike bets growing, it was difficult to see how much further it could go.\nIt was curbed slightly too after data showed wage growth stalled last month despite the unemployment rate hitting a four-decade low.\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on Monday about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies continued to weigh on the dollar, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants a weaker currency.\nFocus was also turning to first quarter results from the likes of Goldman Sachs and eBay later.\nS&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.
