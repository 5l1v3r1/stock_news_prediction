(OTCQB: MDCL) (“Medicine Man Technologies” or “Company”), one of the United States' leading cannabis branding and consulting companies today provided preliminary financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an update on new client activity, and insight as to recent federal developments.\nThe Company projects having achieved revenue growth to approximately $1.2M in its first quarter, a 122% increase over the $541,000 as reported in the comparable first quarter period in 2017, making this the fifth consecutive quarter on quarter revenue growth period achieved. In addition, Medicine Man Technologies anticipates reaching an operational profit/loss breakeven point for the quarter and, the Company repaid all its remaining debt in this quarter.\nSince its last client update in early March of 2018, the Company has entered into five (5) new license and/or service agreements and is pleased to highlight its single Iowa client’s win of two dispensary licenses, which was announced in late March by our client. Additionally, among the new license agreements is substantial new Cultivation MAX Client in Nevada, which expects to begin construction around mid-year for the rehabilitation of over 100,000 SF of existing space.\nBrett Roper, Medicine Man Technologies’ co-founder and CEO commented, “We are pleased with the solid operational results that we project for the first quarter of 2018, highlighted by the achievement of a breakeven quarter, and believe that this performance has the Company firmly on track to achieving its profit goals for the full year. As it relates to new client expansion, we continue to experience an increase in both US as well as international inquiries, as the Company’s reputation and expanded client pipeline continues to evolve. As of this date we have several formal service proposals out to prospective new clients in multiple states and expect our client base to continue to expand over time.”\nMr. Roper continued, “We are also pleased with the recent report of expected non-interference from the U.S. Department of Justice in Colorado’s Cannabis marketplace, as such a commitment by the Trump administration to Senator Gardner would offer a defined path to the creation of an overarching legal strategy related to states’ rights in determining their individual direction for Cannabis regulations and deployment. We anticipate that this development will have a positive impact on the progress of Colorado House Bill 18-1011, allowing certain strictly defined ‘fully reporting’ public companies to hold ownership in Colorado based Cannabis licenses. We are confident that this level of public company transparency would benefit the industry and investors alike and provide a source of new capital to those businesses deserving of it.”\nAndy Williams, Chairperson of Medicine Man Technologies’ Board of Directors added, “Yet again, Senator Cory Gardner has stepped up for Colorado and made a positive impact on the cannabis industry. We applaud the work of the New Federalism Fund in educating Republicans like Senator Gardner on marijuana-related issues. We look forward to continued pro-cannabis legal initiatives, including enacting the Cole memo into law instead of a referendum, which we also believe holds the potential to fix issues facing the industry related to banking and 280e.\"\nAdditionally, on the new client front, Medicine Man Technologies has entered into preliminary negotiations with one of its significant existing Canadian partners to expand support to the Micro Grower community in Canada through offering enhanced access to the Company’s proprietary Three-A-Light ® cultivation methods and Success Nutrients ® as a cornerstone of that new enterprise through an extended licensing arrangement.\nJoshua Haupt, Medicine Man Technologies’ Chief Revenue Officer stated, “This market segment for cultivators will require a hyper competitive footprint as it relates to the 2,000 SF canopy limitation and I believe that our current cultivation efficiency and performance will provide these talented growers with a distinct advantage in achieving low cost production of quality tested ‘craft’ based cannabis to the marketplace in Canada. The craft side of cultivation served as my onramp to the industry years ago and resulted in my creation of the Three-A-Light methodology. I look forward to working with our licensees in Canada and across our growing client footprint to assist these entrepreneurs to achieve maximum efficiency in their gardens.”\nAbout Medicine Man Technologies, Inc.\nEstablished in March 2014, the Company secured its first client/licensee in April 2014.
