But she has not committed to doing so nor ruled the option out.\nOn Wednesday she said all the indications were that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the attack, and that she was working with allies on how to hold those responsible to account.\n“Parliament should always be given a say on military action,” Corbyn, a veteran anti-war campaigner, told the BBC when asked about Syria.\n“Obviously the situation is very serious, obviously there has to be, now, a demand for a political process to end the war in Syria. We cannot risk an escalation even further than it’s gone already.”\nMay is not bound by law to seek parliamentary approval for offensive military action, but recent interventions in Libya and Iraq have been put to a vote. Many now believe lawmakers should always have a vote before the government takes military action.\nCorbyn said countries involved should get around a negotiating table to find an end to the civil war by political means.\n“What happened last weekend was terrible. What we don’t want is bombardment which leads to escalation and leads to a hot war between Russia and America over the skies of Syria,” he said.\nReporting by William James; editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:08:27.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
