While the magnitude of the losses are not big, sterling’s weakness in April is a concern because historically, the British currency has tended to gain in that month due to dividend-related inflows for the currency.\n“After the hat-trick of disappointing numbers last week and a more dovish sounding Bank of England, a weaker than forecast Q1 GDP on Friday would put to bed any remaining optimism of a May rate hike,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.\nThe release will be the last key data issued before the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting early next month.\nMarkets are split over whether the central bank will raise interest rates after Governor Mark Carney dampened expectations of a hike, saying last week that economic data was “mixed” and that there were several other MPC meetings later this year.\nMarket expectations for a rate hike have slipped back to 50 percent from an almost certain 80 percent a couple of weeks ago, according to swap markets.\nAgainst the euro, which some analysts say is currently a better gauge of demand for pounds given there has been considerable dollar-specific news this week, sterling weakened 0.2 percent to 87.45 pence per euro.
