The study into exporting oil products from Marifu came after Petrolimex and JXTG concluded that for now it would be difficult to build a new refinery in Vietnam, he said.\n“If the Marifu refinery became a 50-50 venture, half of the refinery would belong to Petrolimex with half of volumes exported and that would help us to reduce our supply capacity as well,” he told reporters.\nAsked whether if it makes economic sense for Vietnam to import oil products from Japan, he said that there is a tariff barrier, which would need to be taken into account.
