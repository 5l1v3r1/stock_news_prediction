In March, Plain listed a rare Lisa 2 prototype on eBay for just under $100,000; however, it caught the attention of Apple's lawyers and has since been removed.\nBut Plain will continue adding to his collection and hopes some of the devices end up in a museum one day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T16:48:28.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
