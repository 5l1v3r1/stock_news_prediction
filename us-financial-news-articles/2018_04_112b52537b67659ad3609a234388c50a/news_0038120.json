J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. JBHT 6.19% reported a 15% boost in first-quarter net profit and the a 20% gain in revenue, WSJ Logistics Report’s Jennifer Smith writes, a sign in the first logistics earnings report of the season that operators are seeing strong shipping demand drive growth to the bottom line. The demand seen in various weekly and monthly measures has defied the usual lull at the start of the year. With its various rail and road business units, J.B. Hunt is a force across a wide span of the freight market, and its latest report suggests how operators are riding the robust demand by managing capacity and pricing. One key marker for the company: freight brokerage profits nearly doubled on soaring revenue, suggesting shippers are paying as much as they can bear to keep goods moving.\nVolkswagen AG’s drive to overhaul its business may end up roiling the international market for heavy-duty trucks. The German auto maker’s commercial-vehicles unit is considering a full takeover of Navistar International Corp. NAV 9.85% , one of America’s largest truck makers. The WSJ’s William Boston reports the bid to boost its ownership from the current level just shy of 17% could come through an initial public stock offering of Volkswagen Trucks. That would help the business build out a global commercial trucks strategy, while extending Volkswagen’s cooperation with Navistar on engineering and manufacturing. That would add bulk to Navistar, which has a near 12% share of a U.S. market for heavy trucks that appears to be on the cusp of big technology-driven changes. Volkswagen has important stakes and alliances in South America and in Asia, providing the kind of scale that may press competing truck manufacturers to make their own consolidation moves.\nSmall businesses caught up in dueling U.S.-China tariff threats are already scrambling to reset their supply chains. From a Pacific Northwest trucker paying $1,500 more for trailers to firms stocking up on raw materials, companies are looking for ways to cut their costs and stock up on inventories to avoid possible disruptions. The WSJ’s Ruth Simon writes the actions at small companies across the country show the potential for a trade war with China is already rippling through the U.S. economy. For example, Connecticut-based Sound Manufacturing Inc., which makes housings for generators, is asking suppliers to increase the company’s credit lines. A recent survey found more than one-third of small-business owners believe tariffs will hurt their businesses, while just 5% said they would benefit. Some hope to pass their higher costs up through the supply chain, while others see a different solution in expanding their push for exports.\nCOMMODITIES Photo: Bloomberg News All inventory may not be created equal, even a basic commodity like iron ore. There’s enough iron ore sitting at Chinese ports right now to produce more than 100 million automobiles, the WSJ’s Rhiannon Hoyle reports, casting a shadow over iron ore prices that have tumbled nearly 15% this year . The rising mountain of iron ore at China’s docks has surged by more than a third over the past year, to some 161 million tons, with stocks growing as the country’s steel industry recalibrates to reduce capacity and cut pollution. High-quality iron ore has become a hot commodity as mills try to produce steel more efficiently. Some experts say most of the recently added ore is likely low-quality, however, made up of little more than half iron. Still, with iron ore prices already depressed, even poor-quality inventory could weigh on international markets.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ It’s hurting our suppliers. It’s hurting us.
