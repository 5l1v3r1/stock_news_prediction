McGill, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “A combination of strong unit growth and constant focus on our higher margin businesses enabled our team to drive meaningful year-over-year gross margin and earnings per share improvement. As our industry continues to recover, the environment for capturing additional product margins remains encouraging. Our 8% same-store sales growth was driven by increased traffic at boat shows, online and in our stores, as demand was aided by strong consumer confidence. Our team executed well by controlling costs in the quarter, which allowed for strong flow-through, despite an unusual increase in health insurance claims in the quarter.”\nMr. McGill continued, “New, innovative models from our manufacturing partners are continuing to be well received and are helping to drive demand from existing boaters as well as those new to boating, as evidenced by our growing backlog. MarineMax remains well positioned to build on its industry leading share position as we enter the height of the boating season. Through continuing to deliver our customers the highest level of service, providing a broad array of new products and working to ensure that each boating experience is maximized, MarineMax will remain the retailer of choice for years to come.”\n2018 Guidance\nBased on current business conditions, retail trends, it’s most recent results and other factors, the Company is again raising its annual fiscal 2018 expectations for fully taxed earnings per diluted share to range from $1.44 to $1.50 versus prior expectations ranging from $1.30 to $1.40.
