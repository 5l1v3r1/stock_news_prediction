The company’s orders were down 14.2 percent in the first quarter year on year\n“Not a bright path is rising ahead,” the trader added.\nBesi’s first-quarter core profit (EBITDA) rose 52.0 percent year-on-year to 52 million euros, while revenue was up 40.5 percent at 154.9 million euros.\nReporting by Stratos Karakasidis, additional reporting by Alan Charlish.
