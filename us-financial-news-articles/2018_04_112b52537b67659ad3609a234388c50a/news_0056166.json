He didn’t mention specific carriers. But operators like state-run Chinese behemoth Cosco Shipping, South Korea’s Hyundai Merchant Marine Ltd. and Taiwan’s Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. which have been benefiting from cheap state financing, bailouts and other perks for years.\nIn many cases, governments like those in Seoul and Taipei have pressed ahead with the support because of broader industrial and trade policies that support vast numbers of jobs, such as those in South Korea’s shipbuilding sector, and provide critical transportation for exporters.\n“In my mind there is no longer anything strategic about governments investing in shipping. The market will sort it out,” Mr. Skou said.\nWithout pointing the finger at any one nation, he said companies are building ships that were “not needed, for companies who were not profitable and who do not have a profitable business model,” he added.\nHis criticism comes as shipping rates on key global trade lanes have been slipping, threatening to undermine a recovery for ship operators from a recent downturn that led to broad consolidation among shipping lines.\nRead More in Logistics\nBoeing Nears Deal to Buy Aerospace-Parts Specialist KLX April 27, 2018 Supervalu Will Sell Distribution Centers in Cost-Saving Plan April 26, 2018 Freight Costs Weighing on Earnings at Consumer-Goods Makers April 24, 2018 XPO Logistics Names Former Amazon Executive as COO April 23, 2018 The cost for sending a container from Asia to Europe, the world’s biggest trade route stood at around $600 this week, less than half what industry experts say is a $1,400 break-even rate. Maritime executives estimate capacity outweighs demand by 20% on the route.\nAlphaliner, a global shipping research group, forecasts that overall container vessel capacity world-wide will grow 6% this year, ahead of its projecting for 5.1% growth in demand. Capacity across the industry grew at a double-digit annual pace during the mid-2000s across the industry and has nearly doubled since the end of 2008, according to the group’s figures.\n“This is a very competitive industry,” Mr. Skou said. “Even after we have consolidated, there are still more than 10 global carriers and we fight like only siblings can fight for market share, amongst other things.”\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T03:23:19.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
