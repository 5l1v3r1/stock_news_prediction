We are not aware of such a request,” Finance Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe said in a statement.\nShe added: “Suffice to say, we have never been requested by any entity, including the IMF, to conduct such an exercise.”\nZambia said on Wednesday its $8.7 billion foreign debt has not been understated and those saying it is higher should produce evidence.\nMwanakatwe said Zambia has not defaulted on any of its eurobond interest payments, nor has it defaulted on any of the debts from China.\nShe said restructuring of Chinese debt was an option that was open and will be undertaken as and when the need arises.\n“We cannot foretell market conditions in the period 2021 to 2027, however, we are keen to put in place a more robust and smoothened cash flow in our debt sustainability strategy,” Mwanakatwe said.\nSpeculation that Zambia has higher foreign debt than stated spooked investors at a time debt-ridden Mozambique is struggling to repay loans of more than $2 billion that were not approved by parliament.\nThe discovery in 2016 of the undisclosed loans prompted the IMF and foreign donors to cut off support to Mozambique, triggering a currency collapse and leading to a default.\nReporting by Chris Mfula; Writing by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:53:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
