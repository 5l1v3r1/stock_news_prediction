Watsco estimates that over 250,000 contractors and technicians visit or call one of its 560 locations each year to get information, obtain technical support and buy products.\nWatsco has launched a variety of customer-obsessed technologies to transform how HVAC/R contractors and technicians are served in the marketplace. Watsco believes speed, productivity and efficiency will be ever more critical as the digital era progresses and is investing to ensure an unparalleled customer-experience. Proprietary innovations launched by Watsco include:\nMobile apps, websites and e-commerce platforms, incorporating the industry’s most data-rich repository of product information. Business intelligence and data analytics to enable insightful decision-making by 600+ managers. Order fulfillment software to improve speed and convenience of fulfilling nearly 7 million orders. Predictive analytics-driven demand planning and inventory optimization software to improve order fill-rates, increase inventory turns, reduce real estate requirements and improve long-term productivity.\nHVAC/R products provide comfort to homes and businesses regardless of the outdoor climate. There are approximately 92 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the United States that have been in service more than 10 years. Older systems often operate below today’s government mandated energy efficiency and environmental standards. Watsco has an opportunity to accelerate the replacement of these systems at a scale greater than its competitors as the movement toward reducing energy consumption and its environmental impact continues. This is especially important since heating and cooling accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical U.S. home.
