King & Co., Inc., Toll-Free at (800) 967-5071; Banks and Brokers should call (212) 269-5550.\nDetails of Eversource’s Compelling Proposal\nOn April 5, 2018, Eversource made a proposal to acquire all the outstanding shares of Connecticut Water for $63.50 per share in cash and/or in Eversource common shares at the election of Connecticut Water shareholders.\nEversource believes its proposal is a superior alternative to the all-stock transaction proposed in SJW Group’s agreement announced March 15, 2018 to acquire Connecticut Water. Eversource’s proposal represents a 21% premium to Connecticut Water’s closing share price on March 14, 2018, the day prior to the SJW Group announcement. In addition, those Connecticut Water shareholders who elect to receive Eversource shares would realize the equivalent of an 81% dividend uplift based on the closing price of Eversource’s shares on April 4, 2018 and the annualized quarterly dividend of $0.2975 per share declared by Connecticut Water on January 18, 2018.\nEversource is the parent company of Aquarion Water Company (“Aquarion”), a Connecticut-based water utility that serves nearly 230,000 customers, approximately 90% of whom are located in Connecticut. Aquarion, whose service territory is in close proximity to Connecticut Water’s service territory, is in the first quartile for customer service according to JD Power.\nUpon completion of a transaction, Eversource would seek to combine Connecticut Water and Aquarion to form a leading water utility dedicated exclusively to providing communities in Connecticut and other parts of New England with premier service quality and a highly reliable water supply into the future.\nFor more information on Eversource’s superior proposal for Connecticut Water, please visit www.betterCTwater.com .\nAbout Eversource:\nEversource (NYSE: ES) transmits and delivers electricity and natural gas and supplies water to approximately 4 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
