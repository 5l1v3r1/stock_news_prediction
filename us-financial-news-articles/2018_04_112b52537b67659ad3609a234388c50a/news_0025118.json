Government bonds meanwhile made gains, with European and U.S. yields around the 0.50 and 2.80 percent marks.\nAny full-blown trade battle would hit the world economy and upset the plans of major central banks to tighten policy - fuelling demand for government bonds.\nHowever, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump had both struck conciliatory tones on Tuesday, boosting hopes the door to trade negotiations might open. But one report said early talks had already broken down.\n“The risk of a full-blown trade war ... poses the most serious risk to continued strong global momentum,” Berenberg senior economist Kallum Pickering said. He said he doubted there would be a major further escalation at this point.\nEURO Wall Street also looked set for a softer start later with S&P mini futures down 0.5 percent.\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index was last down 0.3 percent, while in Asia overnight Japan’s Nikkei and Australian stocks both lost 0.4 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.2 percent though China did end higher.\nAsian shares had fared better after China’s central bank set out the clearest timetable yet for opening the financial services sector to foreign investors.\nIt will allow offshore firms to enter its trust, financial leasing, auto finance and consumer finance sectors by the end of this year.\nChina watchers said the announcement may further ease trade tensions. But they remained cautious, noting that action had yet to be taken and pointing out that foreign companies still face unofficial barriers in sectors ostensibly already opened up.\nBack among the major currencies, the yen and euro were both a shade higher at 107 yen and $1.2365 respectively.\nIt was the common currency’s fourth session of gains and it stayed close to two-week high of $1.2378 it had scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters it could get rate hikes rolling once its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying programme ends this year.\nThe euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalise monetary policy and hike interest rates.\n“We anticipate further, gradual euro appreciation versus the dollar over the course of 2018,” ANZ’s head of global economics Brian Martin wrote.\nOil prices slipped meanwhile following the previous day’s sharp rally, although losses were limited as the commodity markets eyed an escalation of Middle East tensions.\nU.S. crude futures were down 0.3 percent at $65.32 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday on the back of the surge in risk appetite in the broader markets.\nBrent lost 0.45 percent to $70.73 a barrel after jumping 3.5 percent on Tuesday, when it rose to $71.34, highest since December 2014.\nTraditional safe haven gold touched a one-week high of $1,342.64 an ounce on geopolitical tensions.
