That values the company at around 7.6 billion pounds ($10.6 billion).\nThey had been at one-year highs in recent days after reports said Brittain believed a spin-off was inevitable.\nMorgan Stanley, which rates Whitbread “equal-weight”, said the demerger could trigger takeover interest in Costa.\nEd Meier, a manager of the Old Mutual UK Equity Income Fund, which is a Whitbread investor, welcomed the move.\n“As long term shareholders in Whitbread we feel this is the right decision to maximise shareholder value over the medium term, though we sense allowing 24 months for the process is longer than most would have anticipated,” he said.\nBrittain said the split would be pursued as fast as practical to optimise value for Whitbread’s shareholders.\nRAPID GROWTH Costa, founded in London in 1971, has expanded rapidly since it was acquired by Whitbread in 1995. It now has more than 2,400 shops in Britain, over 1,400 stores in 31 international markets and over 8,000 Costa Express self-serve units.\nSince taking the helm in 2015, Brittain has driven Costa’s expansion in China, a market where Costa’s only larger rival Starbucks is planning to more than triple its over 3,000-store network within a decade.\n“Costa will become a listed entity in its own right and the clear market leader in the out-of-home coffee market in the UK,” she said.\n“Costa will also be well positioned to build further on its strong international foundations with growth expected in China and Costa Express.”\nHowever, over the last two years, Whitbread, like many other consumer-focused companies in Britain, has felt the pinch from higher inflation and low real wage growth in its home market.\nCosta’s like-for-like sales in its British stores slipped 0.3 percent in the final quarter of the year, it said on Wednesday.\nWhitbread reported a 4.5 percent rise in underlying annual profit before tax to 591 million pounds, beating a company-compiled forecast of 585 million.\nCosta had underlying operating profit of 159 million pounds, while Premier Inn generated 498 million on the same basis.
