A sign stands on display at Windrush Square in the Brixton district of London, April 16, 2018\nComing just as May has to navigate particularly choppy waters over Brexit in the next few weeks , the Rudd resignation throws yet another unpredictable element in the mix. It will be hard for May to find an equally high-profile Remain-voting ally to replace her, possibly skewing the balance in her cabinet more in favour of the hard Brexiters.\nConversely, the pro-EU rebels in her parliamentary party have already invited Rudd to join them in their cause of softening Brexit - notably in voting for Britain to remain in an EU customs union. And the departure also heightens risks for May herself: Rudd was acting as a lightning rod for criticism of interior ministry policies that were current when May was in charge of the portfolio. With her gone, the prime minister’s role could come under closer scrutiny.\nU.S. President Donald Trump will decide by midnight tonight whether to make permanent the exemptions he granted the European Union from new import tariffs on steel and aluminium.\nAhead of the May 1 expiry of the exemptions, leaders of Germany, France and the UK agreed during a joint phone call at the weekend to defend the region from any punitive U.S. tariffs \"within the framework of the multilateral trade order\". Unless Trump pulls back, this will tweak higher the trade tensions that are now emerging as one of the biggest risks to the global economy.\nGermany's regional statistics offices release preliminary inflation figures for April throughout the morning, followed by the overall national figure in the early afternoon. Analysts expect inflation to be broadly stagnant and even a touch softer - not particularly helpful to the European Central Bank as it moves to end its stimulus programme.\nMARKETS\nWorld stocks are set to clock in a positive month for the first time since January, with MSCI’s all-country index of global equities up 1.3 percent for April as we enter the last day of another edgy month. Another torrent of first-quarter earnings dominates this week as May gets underway, with Apple the standout report on Tuesday and the big European blue chips kicking in as the U.S. season wends on. Amber Rudd arrives in Downing Street, April 24, 2018\nThe Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision on Wednesday keeps nervous bond markets on their toes. But despite holidays in many major centres, Asia’s bourses that were open were buoyant first thing on Monday after what appeared to be a spectacularly successful Korean summit between the leaders of the North and South on Friday that’s already led to talks on the ‘denuclearisation’ of the North.\nSouth Korea’s benchmark Kospi index is up 0.9 percent and HK’s Hang Seng is up almost 1.5 percent. Both Tokyo and Shanghai were closed.\nU.S. and European stock futures were higher, with UK grocer Sainsbury’s shares indicated up 5 percent at the open after weekend news of a proposed merger with Walmart’s ASDA - a deal which will create Britain’s biggest supermarket group by market share, surpassing current leader Tesco as the supermarket. Sainsbury also reported above-forecast first-quarter results, as did UK advertising giant WPP.\nThe merger news has done little to help sterling, however. The pound continued to weaken against both the dollar and the euro after Friday’s surprisingly weak UK first-quarter gross domestic product data , compounded by the resignation at the weekend of UK interior minister Rudd after an immigration policy scandal.\nRudd was seen as advocate of a softer Brexit within the cabinet and a close ally of PM May. The GDP shock, meantime, has reduced market pricing of a Bank of England interest rate cut next month to less than one in four.\nThe dollar index was little changed more broadly, with euro/dollar holding a rebound back above $1.21 after last week’s shakeout on a dovish European Central Bank meeting. German flash inflation numbers for February are out later and will be watched closely for a steer on ECB thinking. Despite Tokyo’s absence, the yen ‘safety’ bid ebbed a touch more and dollar/yen firmed above 109 first thing.\nWith a big week of U.S. economic news and a Fed decision ahead, U.S. Treasury bonds were steady and the 10-year yield remained well below the 3 percent milestone it topped last week for the first time in four years. The 10-year was last at 2.9660 percent. The U.S. March personal consumption expenditures index, a key inflation gauge for the Fed, is due out later on Monday.\n— A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
