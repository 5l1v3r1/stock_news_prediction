Traffic congestion is a major cause.\nOzone is one of six components of China’s official air quality index, along with sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, PM2.5 and larger airborne particles known as PM10.\nOzone rose throughout the region, with concentrations up 40 percent or more in 10 northern cities from 2014 to 2017, the study said. Cuts in other forms of pollution are believed to have contributed to the rise.\n“Regional declines in the amount of PM2.5 and PM10 have reduced the volume of floating particles and increased the strength of the sunlight required to produce ozone,” the paper said.\nA study by Chinese researchers published last year identified ozone as a growing health risk that had caused a rise in deaths from strokes and heart disease.\n“If you look at the public health impact ... PM2.5 is responsible for more than a million premature deaths per year, whereas ozone is somewhere above 100,000,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, clean air campaigner with environment group Greenpeace.\n“But last summer, ozone really spiked and it is deservedly going to get more attention,” he said, adding that China should set targets to cut nitrogen oxide and VOC emissions in its next air quality plan, due to be published later this year.\nReporting by David Stanway; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T09:35:44.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
