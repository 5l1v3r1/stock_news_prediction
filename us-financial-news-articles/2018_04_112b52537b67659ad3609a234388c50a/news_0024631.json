Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda enters a news conference room in Tokyo, Japan, April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nKuroda said Japan’s economy will continue expanding moderately as rising household income drives up spending. \n“With the output gap improving and medium- to long-term inflation expectations seen heightening, we expect inflation to accelerate as a trend and head toward 2 percent,” Kuroda told a quarterly meeting of the BOJ’s regional branch managers. \nThe BOJ will maintain its ultra-loose policy “until needed to stably and sustainably achieve” its target, Kuroda said. \nA senior BOJ official also told parliament on Thursday that there were promising signs in the economy that would help the bank meet its elusive price goal. \n“Medium- and long-term inflation expectations are recently emerging from weaknesses, while wages and inflation are rising moderately,” said BOJ Executive Director Eiji Maeda.

The report will be among factors the central bank’s board will assess at its rate review this month.
