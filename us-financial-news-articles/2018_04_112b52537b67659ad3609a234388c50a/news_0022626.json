The team, which has subpoenaed the Trump Organization, is also believed to be examining whether there was obstruction of justice related to the probe. \nTrump has spoken about potentially firing the special counsel as recently as this week. \n\"Why don't I just fire Mueller? Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens,\" Trump said Monday in response to a question. \"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.'\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T04:10:03.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
