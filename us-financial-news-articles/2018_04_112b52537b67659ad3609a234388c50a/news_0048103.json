Tim's time with the company is an advantage,\" a comment that received louder applause than Chiang received.\nSpeaking before the meeting, individual investor Cherie Mortice of Des Moines said she voted for Sloan and other directors, saying it was worth giving the bank a chance to recover.\n\"I think he's kind of hoping to restore trust. I'm really hopeful,\" she said.\nNone of three shareholder measures on the bank's proxy received a majority of support, bank executives said.\nThe event came days after Wells Fargo said it would pay regulators $1 billion to settle matters related to mortgage and auto lending abuses.\nAbout 100 protesters marched into the lobby of the hotel before the meeting, holding signs for various causes.\nIn 2016 the bank admitted employees had opened potentially millions of sham accounts, triggering a leadership revamp.\nThe Federal Reserve in February ordered Wells Fargo to halt growth until governance and controls improve.\nWells Fargo, though based in San Francisco, has held the meeting in other locations in recent years.\nTuesday's meeting at moments laid bare divisions in Iowa over one of the states largest private employers. State leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver, a Republican, spoke to welcome executives.\nOthers questioned whether Sloan and others were right for the task of reform.\n\"If I ran my farm the way Wells Fargo ran their business, I'd be kicked out of Marshall County. I'd be a failure,\" said one speaker, who identified himself as a retired Iowa farmer.\nWells Fargo's home mortgage and home equity businesses have about 14,500 workers in and around Des Moines.\nWells Fargo shares ended down 0.2 percent at $52.51 on Tuesday.\n(Reporting by Ross Kerber in Des Moines and Elizabeth Dilts in New York Writing by Meredith Mazzilli; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Matthew Lewis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T06:55:35.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
