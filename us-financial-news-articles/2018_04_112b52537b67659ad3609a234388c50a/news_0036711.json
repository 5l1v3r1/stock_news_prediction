The TVs will also be sold on Best Buy's website. In exchange, Best Buy will be a third-party seller on Amazon.com, giving the retailer access to Amazon's vast customer network. \nSource: CNBC Anthony Wood Shares of streaming device maker Roku were previously on a tear this week. The company announced on Monday its media streaming device would offer access to ESPN+ , allowing users to stream Disney 's sports content for $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. Shares continued climbing Tuesday, after Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management took a 5.1 percent passive stake in the company.\nWednesday's losses virtually wiped out Roku's recent gains. Shares of Roku are down 36 percent this year.\n--The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T20:13:20.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
