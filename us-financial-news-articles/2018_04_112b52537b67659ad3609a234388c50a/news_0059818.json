After Stanton singled and Sanchez drew a walk, Austin hit his line drive home run to left field, his fifth of the season, for a 5-2 lead and an end to Lynn’s night. In 3 2/3 innings, he gave up six runs on seven hits with three walks. He struck out three.\nGray couldn’t get through the fifth inning because of recurring control problems that brought him into the game with an 8.27 ERA in four previous outings.\nJoe Mauer began the Twins fifth with a hard line-drive single that hit Gray in the upper back as he tried to twist out of the way. Sano then followed with a single.\nBut Gray struck out Eddie Rosario, and Max Kepler, who finished with three of the Twins’ 10 hits, lined out. One out away and with his pitch count mounting, Gray walked Eduardo Escobar, and manager Aaron Boone brought in reliever Chad Green, who got Logan Morrison to pop out.\nIn 4 2/3 innings, Gray allowed three runs on six hits and five walks. He struck out four, and exited having thrown 104 pitches.\nGreen ran into trouble in the seventh, when Mauer doubled and Sano walked. One out later, Kepler singled to bring in Mauer. Another single loaded the bases, and Boone brought in lefty Chasen Shreve, who struck out Morrison and then got Robbie Grossman on a pop out that Austin snagged as he went into a slide approaching the right field stands.\nStanton added a sacrifice fly in the eighth inning.\nYankees closer Aroldis Chapman gave up a single in a scoreless ninth inning for his fourth save.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:32:23.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
