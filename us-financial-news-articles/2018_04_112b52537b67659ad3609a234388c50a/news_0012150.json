His appointment follows a 52 percent fall in the companyâ€™s shares since it emerged from bankruptcy proceedings a year ago.\nBullock was put in temporary charge of the company last June and oversaw eventually abandoned talks on selling the company to larger rival SandRidge Energy.\nSandRidge in December abandoned its bid under pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Fir Tree Partners, who said the $746 million deal overvalued Colorado-based Bonanza.\nBonanza Creek filed for bankruptcy in January 2017 after a more than 50 percent fall in global oil prices from mid-2014 which eroded cash flows of many oil producers and crimped their ability to meet debt and interest payments.
