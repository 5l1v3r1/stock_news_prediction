REUTERS/Tyrone Siu \nEsports, the competitive side of electronic gaming, has quickly amassed an estimated 250 million players worldwide, more than several traditional Olympic sports federations combined in a growing market worth about a billion dollars a year. \nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) in November recognised esports as a sports activity, the first clear indication to the growing industry that it wants to link up. \nEsports will be a medal event at the 2022 Asian Games. \n“It won’t be possible to be an official discipline but to be a demonstration title within the Paris Olympics,” Chung told Reuters by telephone from the IeSF headquarters in Busan, South Korea. \n“The local Olympic organising committee and the city are supporting this movement, so this will be a stronger message towards the IOC that esports could be included as a demonstration title in 2024.” \nWhile esports is mainly driven by the games developers and publishers, the IeSF is the first attempt at creating a global body that could promote esports. \nThe IeSF currently has 46 members and hosts an annual esports World Championship involving three major gaming titles – Counter Strike, League of Legends and Tekken. \nGlobal audiences for esports are expected to reach 380 million this year, according to research firm Newzoo, who have also estimated that the esports economy was expected to grow 38 percent year on year in 2018. \nEsports is due to appear as a demonstration event at this year’s Asian Games in Jakarta and will make its debut as a medal event at the multi-sport tournament four years later in Hangzhou, China. \nAppearing at an Olympics would be a huge step for esports and Chung said Paris was the perfect platform. \n“Paris would one day like to become an esports hub for Europe,” said Chung. \n“There are great engagement numbers, great fan numbers who live in France and especially in Paris, who would definitely want to come to an esports game.” \nThe IOC is fully aware of esports’ rapid growth and its popularity among young people, making it an attractive proposition to refresh its own ageing audience and make the Games relevant to a new generation. \nIOC President Thomas Bach acknowledged the popularity of esports among young people this month but was wary of its often violent or discriminatory content.
