Wolters was 2-for-3 and made at least three run-saving plays behind the plate.\nAdam Ottavino (2-0) pitched a scoreless 10th and earned the win. He struck out one and hit a batter in his lone inning.\nThe loss ended Atlanta’s three-game winning streak and wasted a ninth-inning comeback.\nThe Braves tied the game in the ninth against Colorado closer Wade Davis, who blew his first save of the season. Davis issued a one-out walk to pinch hitter Kurt Suzuki and a single to Dansby Swanson, which sent speedy pinch runner Peter Bourjos to third. Ryan Flaherty then knocked in Bourjos with a line-drive single to center field.\nThe Rockies had runners at first and second with no outs against reliever A.J. Minter in the bottom of the ninth, but failed to score. Charlie Blackmon popped out while trying to bunt, and DJ LeMahieu lined into an inning-ending double play.\nAtlanta had a runner on third in the 10th but failed to score against Ottavino. Ozzie Albies was hit by a pitch, stole second and took third when the throw went into center field. Nick Markakis was retired on a lineout to shortstop Trevor Story, who leaped high to make the catch.\nColorado starter Chad Bettis kept the Braves off stride for 5 2/3 innings before being relieved in favor of Mike Dunn, who retired the final out in the sixth inning. Bettis allowed only one run on four hits and two walks, with three strikeouts.\nAtlanta starter Anibal Sanchez, a veteran who joined the team late in spring training, gave the Braves five quality innings in his first start for the team. He allowed two runs on seven hits and two walks. Sanchez struck out six.\nColorado took the lead with a run in the third on an RBI single by Nolan Arenado. But the third baseman ran the Rockies out of a rally when he was thrown out on the back end of a double-steal to diffuse a rally.\nThe Rockies took a 2-0 lead in the fourth on Trevor Story’s solo homer to left-center field. It was his first career homer against Sanchez and gave him homers in back-to-back games.\nAtlanta cut the lead in half with a run in the sixth. Pinch hitter Lane Adams walked and scored on Freddie Freeman’s double to left.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:14:18.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
