The event appears on the president's official schedule merely as a \"dinner with supporters.\"\n\"We at America First Action are deeply honored to host President Trump, along with supporters and friends of our organization this evening,\" the spokeswoman said.\nShe also noted that the event is not a fundraiser for America First or any other entity related to it.\nThe event Monday night marks the second event the PAC has thrown in the Washington, D.C., area this month featuring the president. Earlier in April, Trump met with backers of America First Action along with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\nA White House spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.\nThe PAC raised a solid $5 million during the first quarter this year.\nIn combination with its nonprofit advocacy arm, America First Policies, the pro-Trump groups took in $13.6 million between January and April, putting them on track to surpass last year's haul of $26 million.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:41:50.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
