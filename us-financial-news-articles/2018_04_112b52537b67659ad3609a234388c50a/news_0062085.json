The title is not decided by a couple of games but by many, we have been chasing it since the start and we have been top of the table since the start.

Deportivo are 18th on 28th, 12 points adrift of 17th-placed Levante with three games left.\nWhile Deportivo’s players and supporters mourned their return to Spain’s second tier for the first time since 2014, Barcelona’s squad formed a human chain and danced around the centre circle.\n“This double tastes glorious,” midfielder Sergio Busquets said.\n“Winning seven league titles out of the last 10 is outrageous and just look at how we did it this year, with four games remaining. We have had an almost perfect Liga campaign,” Busquets added.
