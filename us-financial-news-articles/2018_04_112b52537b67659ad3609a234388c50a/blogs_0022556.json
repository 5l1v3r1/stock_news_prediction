That's despite claims of an \"unprecedented\" number of death threats to justify his security spending.\nDemocrats on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee said Tuesday they reviewed confidential security assessments describing 16 purported threats. Among them: public protests, criticism of Pruitt's policies and other activities protected by the First Amendment.\nThe Democrats say they saw no records describing specific, credible threats against Pruitt or his family, as the EPA has claimed. Pruitt's staff cited death threats to rebut criticism of Pruitt flying in first-class airline seats and a full-time security detail of 20 armed officers.\nThe Associated Press reported Friday that the EPA spent $3 million on Pruitt's security.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:55:19.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
