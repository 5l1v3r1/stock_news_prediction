Seems the latest early indicators are that the economy is already dipping a little bit,” he said.\nAlso on Wednesday, the U.S. reports inflation data for March, with expectations at 2.4 percent based on a Reuters poll.\nWhile this is well above the Federal Reserve’s preferred rate, Mizuho head of rates Peter Chatwell said base effects were in play, driven by soft demand, weakness in gasoline and heavy competition in wireless services in March 2017.\n“This largely mechanical move higher should mean that an upside surprise will be largely written off as being exacerbated by base effects, while if the data come in line or below, we think there is scope for a short-squeeze (in bonds),” he said in a note.\nAlso on Wednesday, Portugal is marketing a new 15-year bond sale through syndication.
