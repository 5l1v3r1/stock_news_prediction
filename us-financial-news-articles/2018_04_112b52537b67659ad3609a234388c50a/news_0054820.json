Instead of wishing for fewer people to run for office, we should welcome diversity and choice when it comes to selecting elected officials.\nThe writer argues that the state’s public financing program, which gives candidates who show broad community support by collecting large amounts of small donations to run their campaigns, has opened politics to too many candidates and “anxiety is growing” over the lack of unity in the party and the “smoke-filled” rooms of old might offer a better way.\nFor a decade voters in Connecticut have had a bigger say in deciding who will represent them. It isn’t just big donors or party insiders. Of the nine Republicans vying for the nomination, not all of them will qualify to receive public funds for their campaigns. Those who qualify will have done so after proving they have sufficient public support. They’ll then be able run their campaigns without spending time raising money from big donors or special interests in the state. That’s exactly what our democracy should be about.\nNick Nyhart\nPresident and CEO\nEvery Voice Center\nBoston", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T13:55:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
