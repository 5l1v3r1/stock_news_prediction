REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nThe data points to the challenge the ECB faces in seeking to meet its target of inflation just below 2 percent in the euro zone as a whole. On Friday, an ECB board member said euro zone inflation would continue to rise but only slowly.\nIn Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, annual inflation slowed to 1.5 percent in April from 1.6 percent the previous month, the data showed. Yearly consumer price inflation (CPI) was unchanged in the states of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and Brandenburg.\n“April’s regional CPI data suggest that German HICP (harmonised) inflation was unchanged at 1.5 percent as increases in energy and food prices were offset by a fall in the core rate,” said Jennifer McKeown, economist at Capital Economics.\nShe said the fall in core inflation was not a major cause for concern as it was largely due to the Easter break being earlier this year than in 2017 so package holiday prices were on average lower than last April. Related Coverage German annual inflation slows to 1.4 percent in April\nThe ECB decided on Thursday that the euro zone’s uncertain economic outlook was not enough to warrant a change in policy, meaning its bond purchases - which aim to stimulate growth and inflation through low debt costs - will continue at 30 billion euros a month at least until the end of September, or beyond if needed to prop up inflation.\nMcKeown said: “The soft tone of today’s inflation data coupled with the recent dip in the activity surveys appears to justify the ECB’s latest decision not to make any major changes in its forward guidance for now.”\nThe state inflation readings, which are not harmonised to compare with other euro zone countries, feed into nationwide inflation data due at 1200 GMT.\nA Reuters poll conducted before the release of the regional data suggested that Germany’s harmonised consumer price inflation rate would hold steady at 1.5 percent in April.\nThe euro zone will publish preliminary April inflation data on Thursday, with the annual rate expected to remain unchanged at 1.3 percent according to a Reuters poll.
