The market wants further direction on the political angle,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO, Acuity Stockbrokers. \n“Even before we could observe much reaction to the no-confidence vote, we are going in for a long holiday.” \nCeylinco Insurance (non-voting), John Keells Holdings and Hemas Holdings, which were mainly traded via block deals, together accounted for around 88 percent of the day’s turnover. \nCeylinco Insurance ended 2 percent lower, John Keells closed 0.7 percent lower, Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka Plc ended 7.6 percent lower, and Hatton National Bank closed down 1 percent. \nDiversified conglomerate Hemas Holdings ended 0.8 percent higher. \nForeign investors bought shares worth net 102.3 million rupees on Monday, but they have net sold 788.3 million rupees worth of equities. \nDealers expect the stock market to be tepid this week ahead of the Sinhala-Tamil New Year on April 14. \nThe central bank unexpectedly cut its key lending rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, as policy makers sought to revitalise an economy growing at its weakest pace in 16 years and facing heightened political uncertainty. \nThe index fell 0.33 percent last week and dropped 1.14 percent in March. $1 = 155.4500 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:12:54.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
