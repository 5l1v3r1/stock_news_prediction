The pact aims to end the fossil fuel era this century but has been weakened by U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans to withdraw.\nFiji praised governments for action including a deal this month to cut greenhouse gas emissions from shipping by 2050. And no nations have followed Trump in planning to quit.\nBut overall “the current commitments nationally are woefully inadequate,” Luke Daunivalu, Fiji’s chief negotiator, told Reuters in a telephone interview. Fiji is the current president of the U.N. negotiations.\nDozens of nations, including China, Saudi Arabia and European Union states, have submitted documents to the United Nations in recent weeks about the state of global climate action.\n“One recurrent, cross-cutting theme was that the scale and pace of climate action must increase dramatically, and immediately so” to avoid dangerous man-made climate change, Fiji wrote in a document summing up the proposals.\nChina, for instance, said there are still “huge gaps” in efforts to curb climate change and that rich nations are lagging in pledges to provide $100 billion a year to developing nations from 2020 to help them tackle warming.\nSmall island developing states, from the Pacific to the Caribbean, say they are suffering ever more from rising sea levels and storm surges whipped up by cyclones. They say there is too much hand-wringing and too little action.\n“If we spent as much time working on this problem as we do congratulating ourselves for caring so deeply about it, we would be closer to an outcome worthy of a celebration,” said Thoriq Ibrahim, environment minister for the Maldives and chairman of the Alliance of Small Island States.\nThe rule book, formally the “implementation guidelines” for a pact that has no sanctions for non-compliance, will define ways to measure and report greenhouse gas emissions, and how to review and step up national actions every five years.\nAgreement on the rules, due at a meeting in Poland in December, “will be the most critical moment...since the outcome in Paris in 2015,” said David Waskow, of the World Resources Institute think-tank.\nTrump, who doubts climate change is mainly caused by human activities, plans to quit but cannot formally withdraw until 2020. French President Emmanuel Macron predicted this week that Washington would sometime rejoin.
