The pair bid against other liquidators.\nThe money raised from the auction will be used by Bon-Ton to repay its creditors.\nA portion of the winning bid came in the form of a credit bid, or when a creditor uses some of what they are owed instead of cash, sources told Reuters. Bondholders’ credit bid contributed at least $100 million to the value of the winning bid, according to the sources.\nThe failure of the company, with headquarters in York, Pennsylvania and Milwaukee, comes weeks after Toys ‘R’ Us began a piecemeal liquidation of its namesake stores and Babies ‘R’ Us, the latest sign of upheaval in the retail industry.\nA U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing will be held in Wilmington, Delaware on Wednesday to approve of the winning bid, clearing the way for the liquidators to begin selling store inventory, leases and fixtures.\nIt is possible some of the stores will be acquired by another retail operator that could reopen the stores under one of the Bon-Ton names.\nThe company’s stores include Carson’s, Younkers, Elder-Beerman, Bergner’s, Boston Store, and Herberger’s, as well as Bon-Ton.\nReporting by Jessica DiNapoli in New York and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:29:54.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
