The rising rig count points to further increases in U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has already climbed by a quarter since mid-2016 to a record 10.54 million barrels per day (bpd).\nOnly Russia currently produces more, at almost 11 million bpd.\nDespite the dips in crude oil prices on Monday, overall markets remain well supported by strong demand, especially in Asia, and Brent prices are up by 20 percent from their 2018 lows in February.\nProviding further support have been supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) introduced in 2017 with the aim of propping up prices, as well as by the potential of renewed U.S. sanctions against Tehran.\nThe United States has until May 12 to decide whether it will leave the Iran nuclear deal, which would further tighten global supplies.\n“Stay long oil,” U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said in a note to clients.\nReporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T03:52:45.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
