U.S. President Donald Trump makes a statement about Syria at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2018.

SYRIA TV via Reuters TV \nBehind closed doors, Trump pushed for a more aggressive response than the one taken last year, wanting options that would involve attacks on targets in Syria associated with Russia and Iran, officials said. \nHis generals pushed back, not wanting to escalate tensions with those two countries, the officials said. \nHours after the first missiles fell on Friday night, it was not yet clear how extensive the attacks were. \nMattis described them as a “one-time shot” to send a strong message to Assad not to use chemical weapons again. \nThat appeared to contradict Trump’s own pledge that the United States, France and Britain would sustain the military campaign until Assad stops using prohibited chemical agents. \nWhile Trump was determined to respond to the chemical attack, he also said the United States “does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances.” \nAs Trump announced the military action, Pence was in Peru attending the Summit of the Americas. Trump had been scheduled to attend but stayed in Washington to focus on Syria. \nPence abruptly left the summit’s opening ceremonies and returned to his hotel in time to make secure phone calls to congressional leaders to tell them about the strikes. \nPence was in constant contact with Washington on his trip, speaking multiple times to Trump and also to Bolton. He again spoke to Trump after the attacks were launched, an aide said.
