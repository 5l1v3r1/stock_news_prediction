Brand said the company has said it is seeking an 18 percent return from the plants \n* In related news, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry suggested at a Bloomberg New Energy Finance summit on Monday that he may not support a request by a unit of Ohio power company FirstEnergy Corp to order PJM to negotiate a deal that would keep the company’s reactors in service \n* FirstEnergy’s FirstEnergy Solutions unit, which filed for bankruptcy protection on March 31, said a couple of weeks ago that it would shut three nuclear plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2020 and 2021 unless it receives some sort of state or federal support, and asked Perry to find that the reactors and some coal plants were needed to maintain grid reliability \n* FirstEnergy’s request “may not be the way that we decide is the most appropriate, the most efficient way to address this,” Perry said at the Bloomberg summit. “It’s not the only way” (Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T18:01:24.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
