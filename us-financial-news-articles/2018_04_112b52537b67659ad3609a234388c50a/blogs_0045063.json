In fact, the Marvel film is currently poised to potentially unseat 2015's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" as the biggest opening of all time in the U.S. and Canada, The Wall Street Journal reports . \nThe current opening weekend record -- held by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” -- is $248 million. Infinity War has already sold more than $50 million in advance tickets, and surveys suggest more people are interested in seeing the film than were in the last “Star Wars” release. \nAbout 45% of moviegoers consider the film to be a \"first choice\" when it comes to seeing upcoming films at the box office, in contrast to the 33% of moviegoers who said the same about “The Force Awakens” at the same point in time before its opening, according to The Journal . \nInfinity War was the first film to be shot using IMAX cameras. It follows the release of another hit from Marvel, “Black Panther,” which accounted for one-quarter of all movie tickets sold during the first three months of 2018. A box-office hit itself, “Black Panter has grossed close to $1.3 billion worldwide since its release.
