Leucadia will also make an investment in Schonfeld’s fundamental equities fund.\nBusiness Insider first reported the news.\nFolger Hill was launched in 2014 after Kumin left billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen’s SAC where he had been chief operating officer. Kumin quickly raised more than $1 billion in assets for the firm which had many portfolio managers pursuing a variety of strategies.\nFolger Hill’s Asia fund, which returned roughly 2.7 percent last year and had helped offset some stumbles in Folger Hill’s U.S.-focused business after investor redemptions, will continue to operate. The U.S. fund is being liquidated, the letter said.\nFolger Hill employed 45 people in Asia and all their jobs will be preserved. Many of the firm’s U.S.-based employees, who work in offices in Boston and New York, are also expected to move to Schonfeld.
