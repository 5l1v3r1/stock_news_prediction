But campaigners, while hailing the vote, said the law does not go far enough.\nMartin Bowman of Britain-based This is Rubbish said the 50 percent target is not binding, meaning nations would not face penalties for failing, but called the requirement to report annually as a breakthrough.\n“This will transform the fight against food waste,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCritics say food waste is not only unethical in a world of rising hunger but also environmentally destructive.\nEstimates show that in Europe, 88 million tonnes of food are wasted annually at a cost of 143 billion euros ($177.12 billion) ( here ).\nMeanwhile, 55 million people around the world struggle to find food, campaigners say.\nA study published Wednesday by U.S. researchers found American consumers are wasting nearly a pound of food per person each day - the equivalent of four portions of chicken, four quarter-pound meat patties or a pint of blueberries. ( here )\nHigher quality diets with large amounts of fruits and vegetables are also associated with greater amounts of food waste, wasted irrigation water and pesticides, it said.\nThe new EU law is part of wider global trend to tackle food waste, said Camelia Bucatariu, an officer on the subject at the FAO, pointing to the African Union’s commitment in 2014 to halve post-harvest losses by 2025.\n( here )\nReporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, corruption and climate change.
