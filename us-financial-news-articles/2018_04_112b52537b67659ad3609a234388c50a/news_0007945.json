Caterpillar fell 4.5 percent.\nAutomakers Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler fell between 3.5 percent and 4 percent. Tesla was down 4.7 percent, following a near 6 percent gain on Tuesday after saying it need not raise more capital as its Model 3 output increases.\nGrain merchant Archer Daniels was down 3.3 percent, while Bunge slipped 2.7 percent.\nThe malaise was broad based. Twenty-four of the 30 Dow components were trading premarket, with all of them in the red. About 185 of the S&P 500 components were trading premarket, with only nine of them flat to slightly higher.\nAmong them was Lennar, which gained 2.2 percent after the homebuilder reported a higher quarterly profit as it sold more homes at higher prices.\nInvestors headed for safer bets, sending gold prices nearly 1 percent higher. U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was last down 2.5 basis points at 2.76 percent.\nEconomic data due includes the ADP National Employment Report that is expected to show U.S. private employers added 205,000 jobs in March, compared to 235,000 jobs in February. That comes ahead of the more comprehensive March payrolls data on Friday.
