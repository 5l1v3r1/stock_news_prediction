The 26-year-old then sealed a decisive break to clinch the first set and gain the upper hand in the contest.\nDespite stepping up her attack, Romania’s Halep struggled to find a way past her opponent who cruised through the second set to reach the last four of a claycourt event for the first time.\nVandeweghe next takes on sixth seed Caroline Garcia who later overcame Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-7(4) 6-4 6-2 in two hours and 16 minutes.
