That will put us in the top quarter (of costs reduction industry-wide) after previously being in the bottom quarter,” he said. \nHennie Faul, CEO for copper at Anglo-American, one of the mine´s top shareholders, said in an interview with Reuters this week that productivity improvements and brightening long-term fundamentals for copper could open the door to a potential expansion at Collahuasi. \nGomez added that the mine was well-positioned “to take on new challenges” and said Collahuasi was asessing different possiblities to reduce the mine´s use of water - a critical though often scarce resource in Chile´s parched northern desert. \n“Not necessarily a desalination plant, which may be the most common (solution)...” Gomez said. “In economic terms, it´s a decision that needs to be taken very seriously.” \nCollahuasi produced 524,000 tonnes of copper in 2017.
