They are scheduled to start power generation in 2020 and 2021 respectively.\nPV Power, the second largest power producer in Vietnam after the state-run Vietnam Electricity group, said earlier this year that it was looking to sell 676.39 million shares, or a 28.9 percent stake, to strategic investors. The companyâ€™s shares were trading at 14,100 dong apiece on Thursday, potentially putting the value of the deal at $419 million.\nThe government raised $308 million selling a 20-percent stake in PV Power at an initial public offering in January.
