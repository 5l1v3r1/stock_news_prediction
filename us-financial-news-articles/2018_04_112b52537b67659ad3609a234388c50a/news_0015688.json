It's located 120 kilometers outside the Philippine capital, and its investors hope it will be the first of its kind in the country: smart, sustainable and resilient to disasters. \nOf course, many countries are aiming to build their own version of the city of the future, and the Philippines still has a long way to go in its economic development, so the project's financial future is not a certainty. \nAccording to its lead developers, the project is mainly funded through public-private partnerships â€” a move necessary for the cash-strapped country.

The Philippine government recently announced it is committed to moving some offices to New Clark City, but the main goal plan is for foreign investors to set up operations there, according to Wong.

A brand new railway line is being built by the Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corporation for Transport & Urban Development. The train would reduce the travel time between the two cities to one hour from the current two to three hours. \nThe first phase of the project is slated to finish by 2022, but Wong said that the goal is to keep developing as technologies advance. \nBut technical hurdles would still need to be resolved said Wong. \"All these things need to be planned. You need that network of communication. And also a cyber security network needs to be put in place,\" he said.
