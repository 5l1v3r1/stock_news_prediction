He worked his way up to become a waiter, he recalls, \"where I learned basically everything I've ever needed to know about customer service.\"\nWhen Ohanian declared a major in history at UVA, he was convinced he was going to be a lawyer, he tells Guy Raz on NPR's podcast \"How I Built This\": \"As a history major, I thought the only way I was going to have a career was to go to law school.\"\nIt was during an LSAT study break at Waffle House when he realized he didn't actually want to go to law school. \"It's a great place for epiphanies — and waffles,\" the entrepreneur tells Raz. \"And I had both there that morning, and realized if I wanted these waffles more than the LSAT, I probably shouldn't be a lawyer.\"\nshow chapters CEOs, celebs share their first jobs      2:23 PM ET Tue, 9 Aug 2016 | 01:20 Instead, Ohanian realized he wanted to start something, so he convinced his college roommate Steve Huffman to try help him build a business called \"My Mobile Menu,\" a kind of food ordering mobile app. But since the iPhone hadn't yet come out at the time — it was 2005 and the iPhone debuted in 2007 — the college seniors were pitching the idea before smartphones were ubiquitous.\n\"That didn't work out,\" Ohanian tells the Times. But the team's second idea stuck. After coming up with the idea of Reddit over spring break of their senior year, they launched the site just three weeks later, in June 2005.\nToday, Reddit has over 300 million monthly users and is valued at $1.8 billion .\nshow chapters Barbara Corcoran: You learn more waiting tables than from any other job      9:36 AM ET Mon, 26 March 2018 | 01:04 Ohanian, who sold Reddit to Condé Nast in his early 20s and came back to the company in 2014 as executive chairman, isn't the only self-made millionaire who has worked as a waiter and in other menial jobs before striking it big. \nShark Tank investor Daymond John waited tables at Red Lobster for five years while developing his FUBU clothing line. Fellow Shark Barbara Corcoran worked 22 low-paying jobs, including several waitressing gigs, before making her fortune in real estate.\nIn fact, of all the menial jobs she worked in her teens and early 20s, it was waitressing that most prepared her to build a successful company, Corcoran says : \"The best job you could have to prepare for entrepreneurship is, walk on the other side of the counter and serve people. Make them happy. If you've got that ability … chances are good you're going to be a good entrepreneur.\"\nLike this story?
