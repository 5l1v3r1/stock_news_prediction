China warns that it will fight back “at any cost”.\nThis storm started with steel and aluminum, with tariffs coming into effect on March 23, but has grown in intensity to encompass a lengthening list of goods and products.\nRising trade tensions have weighed on industrial metal prices, unsurprisingly given their exposure to global growth prospects, but have caused the U.S. aluminum premium market to whipsaw higher.\nWhich is ironic since prior to this week the premium was falling as the aluminum market realised that in its case the U.S. administration’s bark has proved considerably worse than its bite.\nGraphic on the CME aluminum premium contract and reactions to key tariff announcements:\ntmsnrt.rs/2GWOjHR\nA MIRROR ON TARIFF POLITICS The CME’s Midwest aluminum premium contract <0#AUP:> has provided an accurate market mirror on President Trump’s seemingly chaotic approach to tariffs.\nBased on the supply and logistics drivers of the North American aluminum market, it is a much more sensitive gauge of U.S. tariff impacts than the London Metal Exchange price.\nIt is also an increasingly popular one with contract volumes up 32 percent in the first quarter and open interest at a year’s high.\nThe premium exploded upwards on Feb. 13, the day of the release of the Section 232 investigation into U.S. imports on national security grounds.\nThe report’s recommendations for blanket tariffs and/or quotas propelled the CME’s Dec 2018 contract from 13.0 to 16.5 cents/lb, a 27 percent jump equivalent to a $77 per ton rise in the cost of delivered aluminum in the U.S. Midwest.\nAfter a brief pull back it surged again to 17.0 cents/lb after Trump announced on March 1 his intention to impose duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.\nCrucially, there was no talk of countries being exempted, not even Canada, the largest supplier of aluminum to the U.S. market place and one that is “integrated” with the U.S. industrial base, to Quote: the Section 232 report.\nThere was panic in Canada with officials simultaneously promising it would never happen and mulling possible retaliatory measures.\nAnd there was panic everywhere else, encapsulated by the surging aluminum premium.\nHowever, the premium dropped following Trump’s signing of the executive order on tariffs on March 8 with “carve-outs” for both Canada and Mexico.\nIt dropped harder towards 15 cents/lb after U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on March 22 the Administration would “pause” on both steel and aluminum tariffs for Argentina, Australia, Brazil, the European Union and South Korea.\nThese exemptions, particularly that of Canada, significantly cushion but do not eliminate the tariff hit on the U.S. market.\nGraphic on top 10 suppliers of primary aluminum to the U.S. in 2017: tmsnrt.rs/2uQFfQ0\nGraphic on top 10 suppliers of plate, sheet and strip to the U.S. in 2017: tmsnrt.rs/2GBYORD\nHITTING THE TARGET(S) Exempted, for now at least, are three of the largest 10 suppliers of primary unwrought aluminum to the United States last year; top supplier Canada, fourth largest Argentina and eight largest Australia.\nIndia, sixth largest source of imports, is lobbying hard for its own carve-out.\nAnd others will be doing the same. Among last year’s top 10 importer list are the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain, all of which offer intriguing bilateral deal potential for an Administration that explicitly mixes trade and politics.\nProbably not lobbying so hard are Russia and Venezuela, two of the five countries singled out in the Section 232 report as benefiting from state subsidy, being potentially unreliable partners or acting as points of transhipment.\nThe other three were China, Vietnam and Hong Kong.\nRussia was the second largest shipper of aluminum to the United States last year and what happens to that metallic flow is perhaps the key question to determining the lasting market impact of tariffs.\nHowever, the broader take-away here is that after threatening to use a sledge-hammer, the U.S. Administration has narrowed its sights on those it regards as the real targets.\nA similar pattern emerges from the tariffs on aluminum products.\nFour out of last year’s 10 top suppliers of aluminum plate, sheet and strip are exempt. Canada, Germany, Austria and France all duck the tariff bullet.\nThat leaves exposed China, target number one and by a wide margin the biggest-volume supplier of products to the United States last year.\nIt would be wrong, however, to suppose that all of this is low-grade material being dumped out of an oversupplied Chinese market.\nChinese imports to the United States, particularly those of lower-specification products, have been falling in recent years in response to ever tougher anti-dumping actions on specific product lines.\nLast month, for example, the U.S. Commerce Department slapped hefty duties on imports of aluminum foil from China, previously a major part of the two countries’ aluminum trade.\nSome of what China supplies may not be easily replaceable, opening the door for potential product exemptions, a process that is now underway.\nThis gradual dilution of the original “shock and awe” threat to hit everyone and every product with a 10 percent tariff is why the aluminum premium was steadily retreating from its earlier highs.\nUntil this week, that is.\nWHIPLASH The rising political trade temperature has whiplashed U.S. aluminum premiums higher again.\nThe Dec 2018 contract closed Thursday back up at 17.0 cents/lb. as everyone reassesses, again, their previous assumptions about how this tariff storm is going to play out.\nAn interesting contrarian indicator comes in the form of the share price of Century Aluminum, a prominent lobbyist for action against China aluminum imports and a domestic producer now promising to reactivate idled capacity.\nThe Century share price hit a two-year high of $24.77 on the day the Section 232 report was released.\nIt slumped on the two exemption announcements and is currently trading just above $17.00 with no obvious knock-on impact from the renewed strength in physical premiums.\nIs that because, when it comes to aluminum at least, Trump’s tariffs are not what they first appeared?\nTo view a graphic on Aluminium premium timeline: tmsnrt.rs/2GWOjHR\nTo view a graphic on U.S. aluminium imports 2017: tmsnrt.rs/2uQFfQ0\nTo view a graphic on U.S. product imports 2017: tmsnrt.rs/2Hd5nte\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2GBYORD", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2GWOjHR", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2Hd5nte", "https://tmsnrt.rs/2uQFfQ0"], "published": "2018-04-10T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:26:31.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
