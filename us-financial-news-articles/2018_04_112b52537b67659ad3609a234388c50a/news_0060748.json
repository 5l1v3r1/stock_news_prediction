Rader, who represented Richard Altman, a lawyer and tenant who lived in a small apartment building in the West Village.\nAt issue in the case is the interpretation of convoluted rent regulation laws that the Court of Appeals once described as an “impenetrable thicket” for laymen and lawyers.\nLandlords routinely added in a vacancy allowance of 20% as well as a rent increase to cover the costs of renovations before determining what the legal rent was.\nBut in 2014, Mr. Altman sued and said that nine years earlier, a previous owner of the building had illegally deregulated his apartment. Under a strict reading of the law, he said, the owner shouldn’t have included the vacancy allowance in the calculation.\nAn appellate court agreed and the current owner was ordered to pay $165,000 in back rent, interest and penalties, and to lower the rent to $1,829, the same rent the prior tenant had paid.\nThat triggered about 20 additional lawsuits against other landlords, Mr. Turkel said, and fears that many more would follow.\nThe language in the law covered apartments deregulated between 1997 and 2011, when about 118,000 vacant apartments were deregulated because of high rents, according to figures compiled by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board. It isn’t clear how many included the extra rent increases in the calculation.\nBut the Court of Appeals, in a case known as Altman v. 285 West Fourth LLC, ruled the statute included two different criteria for the legal rent , including one that allows other additional rent increases.\nIt cited legislative history to bolster the interpretation. It found the state legislature adopted the language to overturn a more narrow interpretation of the provision by the New York City Council.\nLandlords have been critical of the Court of Appeals in the recent past. They said the court has moved from a close reading of state statues to a broader focus on public policy and the plight of vulnerable tenants. Among other decisions, they cited a 2010 case in which the court held that tenants could look back many years to challenge rents if they made a plausible claim of fraud, despite a law that precluded a look a rental history “prior to a four year period.”\nTenant lawyers said the decisions were firmly grounded in the law.\nAll current Court of Appeals judges were appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat.\nWrite to Josh Barbanel at josh.barbanel@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T06:27:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
