A one-earner married couple with two children on average paid 14 percent of gross wages.\nThe tax benefit of having children has also increased since 2000, especially for single parents, who in 13 countries receive more than they pay into the system.\nTaking into account taxes also paid by employers, the total tax burden of labor fell last year on average for the fourth year in a row due to lower employer social security contributions, according to the OECD.\nFinland, Hungary and Luxembourg in particular saw big decreases in the so-called tax wedge - income tax and employers payroll taxes - while the average fell in 16 countries.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:30:52.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
