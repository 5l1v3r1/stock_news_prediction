That is of course the lifeblood of this war,” Mr. Macron said.\nGovernments face an increasingly complex challenge tracking terror finance because of the changing technology of transactions . France pushed delegates at the conference to look for ways to better identify users of prepaid cards and electronic wallets and strengthen regulation of crowdfunding websites that are increasingly used by terror groups.\nThere are also “high risks” associated with transfers by mobile phone because it is hard to identify recipients of funds, French officials said.\nFrance says the large sums of money in circulation could spark a resurgence of terrorist organizations despite the military collapse of Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Islamic State is estimated to have had revenue of around €1 billion a year between 2014 and 2017, and is now seeking ways to amass small international donations, French officials say.\n“The successes in Syria and Iraq might make us think we are confronted with a declining threat, but the reality is very different,” an adviser to Mr. Macron said.\n“It feels like we are in a sprint because there is a sophistication of instruments,” the adviser said.\nThe closed-door conference, dubbed “No Money for Terror,” began Wednesday with talks between some 450 terror finance experts and intelligence officials, and concluded later Thursday with a public speech from Mr. Macron.\nMr. Macron, who returned earlier from a three-day U.S. state visit , is pushing for a more multilateral approach. The French leader said countries attending the Paris conference have divergent interests and some have in the past financed opposing groups in foreign countries.\n“There will be complete transparency between us, real information exchange and a will to work together because these movements have taken too many innocent lives,” Mr. Macron said.\nDelegates at the conference signed a joint declaration committing to stepping up national and collective efforts to fight terror financing. The commitments included strengthening national frameworks to collect information, increasing traceability of financial flows, working more closely with large tech companies, sharing more financial intelligence and giving technical assistance to less developed nations.\n“There are still challenges to the effectiveness of counterterrorism financing efforts. These include improving our understanding of terrorism financing risks, making better use of financial intelligence, and enhancing domestic and international cooperation,” International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said after the conference.\nDelegates also examined how tracking transactions can be used to gather intelligence and anticipate possible attacks. Paris prosecutors working with financial investigators to track transactions in recent years have identified 416 donors on French soil and 320 recipients in Turkey and Libya, helping them identify jihadists who traveled to Iraq and Syria or those who are now looking to return to France.\nMost Middle Eastern countries were represented at the conference, with the notable exception of Iran. Iran is on the blacklist of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental group of 37 that combats money laundering and terror financing. French organizers also refused to invite Iran amid tensions between Tehran and Arab states.\nWrite to William Horobin at William.Horobin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:29:45.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
