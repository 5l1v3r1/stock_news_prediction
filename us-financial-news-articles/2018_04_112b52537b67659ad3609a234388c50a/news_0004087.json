Leader.ir/Handout via REUTERS \nSaudi Arabia - birthplace of Islam and site of its holiest shrines - does not officially recognise Israel, but Mohammed bin Salman’s comments, quoted in the U.S. magazine The Atlantic, are a further sign of an apparent thawing in bilateral ties. \nThey come as mainly Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia faces off against Shi’ite Iran in a regional power struggle. Tehran and Riyadh back opposing sides in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon. \n“Movement toward negotiation with the cheating, lying and oppressive regime (of Israel) is a big, unforgivable mistake that will push back the victory of the people of Palestine,” Khamenei said in a statement posted on his official website. \nThe statement, which did not explicitly name Saudi Arabia, said it was the duty of all Muslims to support Palestinian resistance movements and it pledged continued Iranian backing for the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. \nAfter the crown prince’s comments, his father King Salman reiterated Saudi Arabia’s support for a Palestinian state. \nRiyadh has long maintained that normalising ties with Israel hinges on an Israeli withdrawal from Arab lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war - territory Palestinians seek for a future state. \nHowever, Saudi Arabia opened its air space for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel last month, which an Israeli official hailed as historic following two years of efforts. \nIn November, an Israeli cabinet member disclosed covert contacts with Saudi Arabia, a rare acknowledgment of long-rumoured secret dealings which Riyadh still denies. \nKhamenei issued Wednesday’s statement in reply to a letter he recently received from Hamas chief Ismail Haniya which criticised the support of Arab governments in the region for the United States. \nHamas, which is sworn to Israel’s destruction, dominates the small coastal strip of Gaza, where this week at least 17 Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli security forces. \nIn his statement, Khamenei called on the people of Muslim countries to defeat Israel. \n“With an intense and planned struggle they should force the enemy to retreat toward the point of demise,” he said.
