(“Postmedia” or the “Company”) today released financial information for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Operating Results\nRevenue for the quarter was $157.6 million as compared to $176.7 million in the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $19.1 million or 10.8%. The revenue decline was primarily due to decreases in print advertising revenue of $16.3 million or 18.8% and decreases in print circulation revenue of $4.6 million or 7.9%. Digital revenue increased by $2.4 million or 10.1% in the quarter with digital advertising revenue up 12.0%.\nTotal operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring decreased $36.2 million or 21.0% for the quarter, relative to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was as a result of cost reduction initiatives as well as a compensation expense recovery totaling $17.0 million related to the Company’s Ontario Interactive Digital Media Tax Credit (“OIDMTC”) claim. Excluding the recovery related to the OIDMTC claim, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring decreased $19.2 million or 11.1% for the quarter, relative to the same period in the prior year.\nOperating income before depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring of $21.1 million in the quarter represents an increase of $17.1 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to operating expense decreases partially offset by a decrease in total revenues.\nNet loss in the quarter ended February 28, 2018 was $1.3 million, as compared to $28.5 million in the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily the result of the increase in operating income before depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring as well as a decrease in restructuring expense.\nYear-to-Date Operating Results\nRevenue for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was $346.6 million as compared to $387.4 million in the same period in the prior year, a decrease of $40.9 million or 10.5%. The revenue decline was primarily due to decreases in print advertising revenue of $36.1 million or 18.3% and decreases in print circulation revenue of $8.4 million or 7.0%. Digital revenue increased by $6.4 million or 12.5% year to date with digital advertising revenue up 14.9%.\nTotal operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring decreased $62.2 million or 17.1% for the six months ended February 28, 2018, relative to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was as a result of cost reduction initiatives as well the compensation expense recovery related to the Company’s OIDMTC claim. Excluding the recovery related to the OIDMTC claim, total operating expenses excluding depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring decreased $45.2 million or 12.4% for six months ended February 28, 2018, relative to the same period in the prior year.\nOperating income before depreciation, amortization, impairment and restructuring of $45.0 million in the six months ended February 28, 2018 represents an increase of $21.3 million relative to the same period in the prior year. The increase is due to operating expense decreases partially offset by a decrease in total revenues.\nNet earnings in the six months ended February 28, 2018 was $4.5 million, as compared to a net loss of $8.7 million in the same period in the prior year. The change was primarily the result of a gain on debt settlement and impairment expense in the six months ended February 28, 2017 as well as a decrease in restructuring expense.\nBusiness Transformation Initiatives\nDuring the three months ended February 28, 2018, the Company implemented initiatives which are expected to result in approximately $5 million of net annualized cost savings.\nThe Company will continue to identify and undertake ongoing cost reduction initiatives in an effort to address revenue declination in the legacy print business.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are executing on a strategy that continues to deliver results including continued positive signs from our digital advertising initiatives,” said Paul Godfrey, Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition there has been a slowing of our legacy revenue declines along with continued rigor around cost reduction initiatives.”\nAdditional Information\nAdditional information, including financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis can be found on the Company’s website at www.postmedia.com/investors/financial-reports or on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNote: All dollar amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise specified.\nAbout Postmedia Network Canada Corp.\nPostmedia Network Canada Corp.
