FILE PHOTO: Wolfgang Porsche, member of Supervisory board of Volkswagen addresses a news conference at the company's headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany September 23, 2015.REUTERS/Axel Schmidt/File Photo \nThe shareholder, Christian Strenger, accused Porsche of “ongoing conflicts of interests” because he is also chairman of the board of Volkswagen’s controlling shareholder Porsche Holding SE, according to a six-page counter-motion for the AGM in May, cited by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. \nStrenger also accused Porsche, a member of Volkswagen’s Porsche-Piech founding clan, of “inaction in pursuing misconduct” by the company’s top managers over its diesel emissions scandal, the newspaper quoted the motion as saying. \nInstead, Strenger said “truly qualified people” should be proposed to fill open seats on Volkswagen’s supervisory board. \nStrenger is a small shareholder, but a prominent voice in Germany as a former and founding member of the government’s Corporate Governance Commission. He was previously a chief executive officer of DWS, the asset management arm of Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ). \nStrenger and Volkwagen did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside of business hours on Sunday. \nThe press office of the Porsche division, where Wolfgang Porsche is also chairman of the supervisory board, did not respond to a request for comment.
