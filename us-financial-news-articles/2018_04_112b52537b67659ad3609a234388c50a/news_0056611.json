A drop below that level would take the euro to its lowest since Jan. 12.\nThe near-term focus is on the European Central Bank’s rates review due later on Thursday.\nThe ECB is set to keep policy unchanged on Thursday, playing down worries over recent softness in the euro zone economy and leaving the door open to ending its lavish bond purchase scheme by the close of the year.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar eased 0.1 percent to 109.38 yen . Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. currency touched a 2-1/2 month high of 109.49 yen.\nThe dollar has gained nearly 2.9 percent against the yen so far in April, putting it on track for its biggest monthly gain since November 2016.
