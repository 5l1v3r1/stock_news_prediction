Phone calls to India’s oil ministry for more information have gone unanswered. \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has laid out a plan to increase the share of gas in India’s energy mix to 15 percent by 2030 from below 6.5 percent now, Oil Minister Pradhan said at a conference in Thailand last year. \nIndia currently produces close to 90 million standard cubic meters per day (mscmd) of gas and imports another 70 mscmd as LNG, according to government figures for 2016-17. \nIn the next three to five years, as natural gas projects from India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp and a partnership involving BP and Reliance Industries ramp up, India’s domestic gas output will be in the range of 140 mscmd, said Chakraborty. \nLNG imports are expected to grow to around 50 million tonnes a year (160 mscmd) over the same period, he said, referring to Pradhan’s speech. \nSufficient supplies for the smooth operation of a gas exchange are one of the primary concerns. \nIndia’s industrial gas consumers such as power plants and fertiliser makers were disappointed in 2010 after promised gas output from the east coast’s Krishna-Godavari basin fell short of expectations. Many facilities that were built in anticipation of more gas production remain stranded without adequate fuel. \nThe Reliance-BP partnership plans to develop three assets off India’s east coast, and state-owned ONGC is developing another gas field in the same region.
