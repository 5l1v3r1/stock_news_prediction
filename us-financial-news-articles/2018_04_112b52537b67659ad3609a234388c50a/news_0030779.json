(TSX:DNG) (OTC:DNGDF) (Dynacor or the Corporation) is pleased to announce that the Toronto Stock Exchange has approved the Corporation's request to establish a normal course issuer bid share buyback program, through which Dynacor may purchase, for cancellation, up to 1,982,717 or approximately 5% of its outstanding common shares as of April 10, 2018.\nJean Martineau, President & CEO said, \"With today’s current weakness in the gold mining market, we see the launch of the NCIB as an opportunity to add value in what we deem to be a strong buyer’s market. Dynacor is in a fiscally healthy position to return a portion of its cash to its shareholders through the NCIB. Purchasing common shares in the market at what we believe is a significant discount will attribute to increasing shareholder value. Additionally, we are reviewing other value-added opportunities which will further contribute to enhancing shareholder value.\"\nThe Corporation may purchase shares under the normal course issuer bid over the 12-month period beginning April 23, 2018 and ending April 22, 2019, when the bid expires. Purchases may be made through the facilities of the TSX, and the price for any repurchased shares will be the prevailing market price at the time of the acquisition. All shares purchased by the Corporation will be cancelled. The number of shares repurchased on any given day may not exceed 12,692 common shares, which is equal to 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX for the six-month period ending March 31, 2018 except where purchases are made in accordance with the “block purchase exception” of the TSX rules. The average daily volume for this period was calculated in accordance with the rules of the TSX and is equal to 50,768 shares.\nThe normal course issuer bid represents a proper utilization of Dynacor’s available funds as part of the Corporation’s capital management strategy and is being established to enhance shareholder value.\nThe extent to which Dynacor repurchases its shares and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions and other corporate considerations, as determined by Dynacor's management team. The purchases will be funded from existing cash balances.\nABOUT DYNACOR GOLD MINES INC.\nDynacor Gold Mines Inc. is a gold production corporation headquartered in Montreal, Canada.
