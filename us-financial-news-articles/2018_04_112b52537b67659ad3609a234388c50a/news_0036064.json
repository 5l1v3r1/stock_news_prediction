Reuters was not able to confirm the buyer of the debt, but hedge funds and other traders specialising in distressed debt have shown an increased interest in the debt of AHAB and Saad in recent months.\nMore than 1.5 billion riyals of AHAB’s debt has traded in the past month, with sources attributing that to anticipation of a breakthrough in the row.\nThe value of AHAB’s debt has risen from around 12 cents on the dollar at the start of last year to 19 to 20 cents now.\n($1 = 3.7503 riyals)\nReporting by Tom Arnold; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:40:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
