The meeting is scheduled for 1.45 p.m. Washington, D.C., time. It will be closed to the press. There was no agenda for the meeting posted or hints towards what could be discussed. An Apple spokesperson was not immediately available for request. The meeting comes at a time of heightened trade tensions between the U.S. and China with technology caught up in the spat. Both countries have proposed import tariffs on each others' products, but the U.S. has been tough on Chinese technology firms. For example, the government banned U.S. firms from providing technology to Chinese firm ZTE. China is a key market for Apple, one that it has struggled in recently and a potential cause for concern from some investors for Apple's upcoming earnings. The meeting also comes a day after Cook attended the state dinner held for French President Emmanuel Macron who is visiting the U.S. Â© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
