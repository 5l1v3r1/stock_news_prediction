Analysts had expected a 10.35 percent rise, Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal comparable store sales rose 9 percent, beating the average expectation of a 7.4 percent rise.\nAbercrombie also forecast same-store sales for fiscal year 2018 to be up low-single digits percentage. Analysts are expecting an increase of 1.75 percent.\nNet income attributable to Abercrombie rose to $74.2 million, or $1.05 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, from $48.8 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.38 per share, and reported a 15 percent rise in revenue to $1.19 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $1.16 billion in the reported quarter, Reuters I/B/E/S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T04:07:11.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
