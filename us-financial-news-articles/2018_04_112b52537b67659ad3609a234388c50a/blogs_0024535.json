Boeing lost its trade case against Canada's Bombardier earlier this year, a surprise loss for the world's biggest airplane manufacturer. Boeing said Canada's Bombardier sold the planes to Delta below cost and received illegal government subsidies. It said the company's practices harmed its business. \nDelta agreed to purchase at least 75 of the Bombardier planes, which have sold poorly in general, in 2016. \nThe U.S. International Trade Commission's January ruling in Bombardier's favor effectively blocked a Trump administration recommendation of tariffs of nearly 300 percent.
