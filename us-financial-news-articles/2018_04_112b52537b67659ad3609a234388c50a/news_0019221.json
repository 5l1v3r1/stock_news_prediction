It is the leading cause of infertility. \nNeurocrine and AbbVie are also testing Elagolix for the treatment of uterine fibroids in late-stage clinical studies. \nAbbVie said the marketing application for Elagolix was based on data from the largest prospective randomized clinical trials conducted to date for endometriosis, and that it remained confident in its application for the drug. \nIn June 2010, Neurocrine and AbbVie entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration to develop and commercialize Elagolix. \nNeurocrine’s shares were down 4.3 percent at $75.79 in morning trading.
