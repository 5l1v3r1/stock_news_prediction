Results were driven by strong contributions from the underlying base business as well as the Feb. 1 dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services from sponsor Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: MPC).\nThe partnership ended the quarter with strong distribution coverage of 1.29 times and affirmed its 2018 distribution growth guidance of 10 percent. Debt-to-pro forma adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times for the quarter. Consistent with its strategy to maximize unitholder returns and execute a self-funding model, the partnership did not issue public equity during the first quarter.\n\"Our record financial results reflect MPLX's significant transformation into one of the largest diversified master limited partnerships in the energy sector,\" said Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer. \"The dropdowns of the past year have nearly doubled the partnership's earnings base, and the elimination of incentive distribution rights improves the partnership's cost of capital. Combined with our existing business and planned organic growth, the partnership is extraordinarily well-positioned to deliver long-term sustainable distribution growth for our investors.\"\nGathering and Processing (G&P) reported segment operating income of $350 million for the quarter and segment adjusted EBITDA of $323 million, up $41 million and $42 million on a year-over-year basis, respectively. The G&P segment continues to build upon its strong footprint in the Marcellus, Utica, Permian and STACK shale plays. In the Northeast, the partnership added capacity to support producer needs. The Sherwood 9, 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant was commissioned during the quarter and is expected to ramp up in the second quarter. The partnership also added 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity at its highly utilized Houston, Pennsylvania, complex to support increased demand. MPLX expects to further strengthen its position as the largest processor and fractionator in the Northeast by adding approximately 800 million cubic feet per day of incremental processing capacity and 100,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity during the second half of 2018, expanding its earnings base.\nContinuing to expand on its Permian growth strategy, MPLX commissioned operations of the 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day Argo plant, doubling the partnership's gas processing capacity in the Permian basin. Construction of the 75-million-cubic-feet-per-day Omega gas processing plant in the STACK shale play in Oklahoma is on schedule and expected to be completed by mid-2018. These new facilities provide an important addition to the partnership's expanding footprint in these regions.\nLogistics and Storage (L&S) reported segment operating income of $424 million for the quarter and segment adjusted EBITDA of $437 million, up $268 million and $295 million on a year-over-year basis, respectively. During the quarter, the L&S segment significantly expanded its earnings base with the Feb. 1 acquisition of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services from MPC. These assets and services are projected to generate annual EBITDA of $1 billion, providing additional high-quality fee-based revenue streams to the partnership.\nMPLX also continued to execute its organic growth plan for the L&S segment. The partnership commenced operations of the Robinson butane cavern in late March and expanded its marine fleet by two boats and 13 barges, with further growth planned later this year. The expansions of the Ozark and Wood River-to-Patoka pipeline systems, which deliver Cushing, Oklahoma-sourced crude to Patoka, Illinois, continue to be targeted for completion by mid-2018. These projects are expected to create additional fee-based revenue for the partnership while providing logistics solutions and crude optionality to MPC and other market participants.\n\"We are enthusiastic about the future for MPLX and the value proposition for our unitholders,\" Heminger said. \"The partnership is extraordinarily well-positioned with strong and growing operations in the most prolific and economic shale plays in the country and a diversified suite of logistics assets. With a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit profile, we believe MPLX is one of the most compelling investments in the midstream space.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31\n(In millions, except per unit and ratio data)\n2018\n2017\nNet income attributable to MPLX\n$\n421\n$\n150\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX (a)\n760\n423\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n450\n377\nDistributable cash flow (\"DCF\") (a)\n619\n354\nDistribution per common unit (b)\n0.6175\n0.5400\nDistribution coverage ratio (c)\n1.29x\n1.29x\nGrowth capital expenditures (d)\n470\n358\n(a)\nNon-GAAP measure calculated before the distribution to preferred units.

Reported total processed volumes of 6.6 billion cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2018, an 8 percent increase compared with the first quarter of 2017. Reported total fractionated volumes of 423,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018, a 15 percent increase from the first quarter of 2017. The new Houston, Pennsylvania, 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant in the Marcellus shale commenced operations. The Argo 200-million-cubic-feet-per-day gas processing plant in the Permian Basin commenced operations. The Sherwood 9 gas processing plant in the Marcellus shale began ramping up operations. The Robinson, Illinois, butane cavern became operational.\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, MPLX had $2 million in cash, approximately $2.2 billion available through its bank revolving credit facility expiring in July 2022, and $500 million available through its credit facility with MPC. In February, the partnership issued $5.5 billion in unsecured senior notes with a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.4 percent. MPLX used a significant portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay the $4.1 billion term loan made on Feb. 1 associated with the dropdown transactions. The remaining proceeds were used to repay the outstanding borrowings on the bank revolving credit facility and the credit facility with MPC, as well as for general partnership purposes. The partnership has since increased availability through its credit facility with MPC to $1 billion. The increased borrowing capacity provides additional financing flexibility to MPLX.\nThe partnership's $2.7 billion of available liquidity at the end of the first quarter and its access to the capital markets should provide it with sufficient flexibility to meet its day-to-day operational needs and continue investing in organic growth opportunities. The partnership's debt-to-pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.8 times at March 31, 2018. MPLX remains committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nSegment Results\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31\nSegment operating income attributable to MPLX LP (unaudited)\n2018\n2017\nLogistics and Storage (a)\n$\n424\n$\n156\nGathering and Processing (a)\n350\n309\nSegment adjusted EBITDA attributable to MPLX LP (unaudited)\nLogistics and Storage (b)\n437\n142\nGathering and Processing (b)\n323\n281\n(a)\nSee reconciliation below for details.\n(b)\nNon-GAAP measure.

Interested parties may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-606-5719 (confirmation number 6033306) or by visiting MPLX's website at http://www.mplx.com and clicking on the \"2018 First-Quarter Financial Results\" link in the \"News & Headlines\" section. Replays of the conference call will be available on MPLX's website through Tuesday, May 15. Investor-related material will also be available online prior to the conference call and webcast at http://ir.mplx.com .\nAbout MPLX LP\nMPLX is a diversified, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2012 by Marathon Petroleum Corporation to own, operate, develop and acquire midstream energy infrastructure assets. MPLX is engaged in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas; the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs; the transportation, storage and distribution of crude oil and refined petroleum products; and the refining logistics and fuels distributions services through a marine fleet and approximately 10,000 miles of crude oil and light product pipelines. Headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, MPLX's assets consist of a network of crude oil and products pipelines and supporting assets, including storage facilities (tank farms) located in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States; 62 light-product terminals with approximately 24 million barrels of storage capacity; an inland marine business; storage caverns with approximately 2.8 million barrels of storage capacity; a barge dock facility with approximately 78,000 barrels per day of crude oil and product throughput capacity; tanks with storage capacity of approximately 56 million barrels as well as refinery docks, loading racks and associated piping; and gathering and processing assets that include approximately 5.9 billion cubic feet per day of gathering capacity, 8.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capacity and 610,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity.\nNon-GAAP references\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management utilizes additional non-GAAP measures to facilitate comparisons of past performance and future periods. This press release and supporting schedules include the non-GAAP measures adjusted EBITDA (including segment adjusted EBITDA), distributable cash flow (DCF) and distribution coverage ratio. The amount of adjusted EBITDA and DCF generated is considered by the board of directors of our general partner in approving the Partnership's cash distribution. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered separately from or as a substitute for net income, income from operations, or cash flow as reflected in our financial statements. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and DCF are net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) (benefit) provision for income taxes; (iii) amortization of deferred financing costs; (iv) non-cash equity-based compensation; (v) impairment expense; (vi) net interest and other financial costs; (vii) (income) loss from equity method investments; (viii) distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries; (ix) distributions of cash received from equity method investments to MPC; (x) unrealized derivative losses; (xi) other adjustments to equity method investment distributions; and (xii) acquisition costs. In general, we define DCF as adjusted EBITDA adjusted for (i) deferred revenue impacts; (ii) net interest and other financial costs; (iii) maintenance capital expenditures; (iv) equity method investment capital expenditures paid out; and (v) other non-cash items.\nThe Partnership makes a distinction between realized or unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. During the period when a derivative contract is outstanding, we record changes in the fair value of the derivative as an unrealized gain or loss. When a derivative contract matures or is settled, we reverse the previously recorded unrealized gain or loss and record the realized gain or loss of the contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial performance measure used by management, industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies to assess the financial performance and operating results of our ongoing business operations. Additionally, we believe adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors for trending, analyzing and benchmarking our operating results from period to period as compared to other companies that may have different financing and capital structures.\nDCF is a financial performance measure used by management as a key component in the determination of cash distributions paid to unitholders. We believe DCF is an important financial measure for unitholders as an indicator of cash return on investment and to evaluate whether the partnership is generating sufficient cash flow to support quarterly distributions. In addition, DCF is commonly used by the investment community because the market value of publicly traded partnerships is based, in part, on DCF and cash distributions paid to unitholders.\nDistribution coverage ratio is a financial performance measure used by management to reflect the relationship between the partnership's financial operating performance and cash distribution capability. We define the distribution coverage ratio as the ratio of DCF attributable to GP and LP unitholders to total GP and LP distribution declared.\nForward-looking statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws regarding MPLX LP (\"MPLX\") and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (\"MPC\").
