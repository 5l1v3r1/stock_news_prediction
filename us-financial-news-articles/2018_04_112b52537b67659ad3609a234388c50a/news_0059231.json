The White House, inspector general of the EPA, House oversight committee and Government Accountability Office have been looking at the issues.\nMr. Pruitt, who as the Oklahoma attorney general sued the Obama administration over its environmental policies, was tapped for the EPA post to lead the rollback of regulations Republicans deemed burdensome.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Pruitt said he reversed course on several of the issues now under investigation when he became fully aware of them or if they became a distraction.\nOn his first-class air travel, he reiterated it had been dictated by security threats—some of which he read aloud— but subsequently opted to stop it after concluding it was creating a distraction for reasons of “optics.”\nChallenged about a $43,000 secure phone booth he had installed in his office, Mr. Pruitt said that he had simply told staff he needed a method of secure communication. He said it had been agency career staff members who decided to spend the money and made the judgment it wasn’t necessary to notify Congress. He said he wouldn’t have made the decision if he had been aware of the cost.\nHe maintained that he was “not at any time aware” of the amounts involved or the process used to award pay raises that now are under scrutiny as they didn’t go through the normal approval process by the White House. He added that when found out the details, he rescinded them\nWhere Mr. Pruitt was unapologetic, Democrats were unforgiving.\n“Your actions are an embarrassment to President Trump and distract from the EPA’s ability to effectively carry out the president’s mission,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) “And if I were the president I wouldn’t want your help, I’d just get rid of you.”\nRep. Tom Cole, a fellow Oklahoman, said he had high confidence in Mr. Pruitt’s integrity and he believed the president’s confidence in Mr. Pruitt would remain intact.\n“He really performs for the president; that’s a presidential decision,” Mr. Cole said after the second hearing. “I don’t think anything that happened today would undermine that.”\nMr. Trump has been supportive of Mr. Pruitt, including publicly, though some administration officials have been more skeptical. On Thursday, an administration official was critical of Mr. Pruitt’s performance in the two hearings, but said he probably benefited from attention being directed at Ronny Jackson’s withdrawal from the Veterans Affairs secretary nomination and an interview the president gave on Fox News Thursday morning.\n“It wasn’t necessarily a forest fire—more like a small little burn,” the official said of Mr. Pruitt’s hearings.\nMr. Pruitt chalked up some of his missteps to a learning curve but said that responsibility for identifying and making changes “rests with me and nobody else,” He also said that the criticisms targeted toward him largely stemmed from policies he had pursued.\n“They want to attack and derail the president’s agenda,” he said. “I am simply not going to let that happen.”\nAt both hearings, Republicans came to his defense while Democrats offered sharp-edged critiques of his policy priorities at the agency and Mr. Pruitt’s actions.\n“You’re not sparing any expense on yourself,” said Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, who is the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. That panel’s environment subcommittee questioned Mr. Pruitt later on Thursday.\n“You have failed as a steward of American taxpayer dollars and our environment,” Mr. Tonko said at the earlier hearing.\nBut Republican David McKinley of West Virginia decried what he called a “classic display of innuendo and McCarthyism” in criticisms of Mr. Pruitt.\nGOP Rep. Joe Barton of Texas also said that he believed Mr. Pruitt was being subjected to ad hominem attacks, “a victim, for lack of a better word, of Washington politics.”\nWhere Republicans did address ethical issues, they did so in a relatively friendly fashion.\nMr. Barton asked Mr. Pruitt if his condo lease in Washington, which critics have said was improperly below market rates and had ties to an energy lobbyist, was cleared by his agency’s ethics officer, or if he had done anything illegal by flying first class on commercial airliners. Mr. Pruitt said the housing arrangement had been approved twice, and that his travel was also cleared by two teams at the EPA, but that he had subsequently made changes.\nMr. Pruitt emphasized EPA ethics officials cleared his lease. The ethics office has since said it is revisiting the issue. He compared his spending to numerous Obama administration officials to make the argument he has been thrifty, saying many of them had spent more on international travel than he.\nNewsletter Sign-up A number of Democratic lawmakers asked Mr. Pruitt about the recently proposed rule to require that any study used in shaping EPA regulation must include raw data. Many scientists have panned the move, saying it would exclude much needed research. “This was an effort to ensure transparency,” Mr. Pruitt said.\nMr. Tonko asked whether Mr. Pruitt had confidence in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which has criticized the rule. “I’m sure their opinion is credible,” he said, but “the actions that we take at the agency are different from their responsibilities.”\n—James V.
