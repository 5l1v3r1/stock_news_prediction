REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/Files “Our April cash position is quite comfortable with better-than-expected GST tax collections,” the official said, adding that the weak demand seen at auctions was not a worry.\nThe government’s revenue collection from goods and services tax (GST) from August to March was at 7.19 trillion rupees, it said on Friday.\nAt Thursday’s auction of a 7.37 percent 2023 bond, the Reserve Bank of India was only able to sell about 430 million rupees out of the 30 billion on offer into the market, with the remainder having to be bought by primary dealers.\nThe government has been trying to boost bond market sentiment by cutting the size of its April-September borrowing requirement, but conflicting signals from the RBI has turned investors away.\nReporting by Manoj Kumar; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:43:53.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
