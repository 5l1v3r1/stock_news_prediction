Still suffering from the fallout of fresh sanctions by Washington, Russia’s currency is on track for a near double-digit fall in April, its worst month since late 2015.\nSouth Africa’s rand eased 0.7 percent on the day falls as markets awaited the latest trade numbers and data showed that foreign investors had been net sellers of local bonds last week. The rand looked poised to end April 4.5 percent weaker - its worst monthly performance since summer 2016.\nTurkey’s lira - one of the most vulnerable emerging market currencies due to its large external financing requirements - was on a stronger footing than its peers.\nThe lira hovered unchanged after central bank governor Murat Cetinkaya pledged it would continue a tight monetary policy stance until the inflation outlook improved and that it would stick to its efforts of simplifying the country’s multiple interest rate.\nThe bank also lifted its year-end inflation forecast to 8.4 percent from 7.9 percent in its regular inflation briefing.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see\nReporting by Karin Strohecker, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml"], "published": "2018-04-30T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T12:40:55.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
