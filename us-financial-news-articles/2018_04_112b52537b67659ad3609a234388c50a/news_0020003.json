That marked a further retreat from the prior session’s peak of $4.94 - the highest since March 13.\nDealers noted a decline in Russia’s rouble could diminish export prospects in the United States and EU.\n“This is providing a further factor of competitiveness for the Russian wheat on international markets. We consider that Russia could export 40 million tonnes in this marketing year,” Agritel said in a market note.\nThe USDA is forecasting Russian exports at 38.5 million.\nMay milling wheat in Paris was down 0.25 euros, or 0.15 percent, at 167.25 euros a tonne.\nThe most active CBOT corn futures rose 0.06 percent to $3.89-1/2 a bushel.
