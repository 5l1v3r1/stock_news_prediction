It is probably spread throughout the country at a variety of sites,” said Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie, joint staff director.\n“They will have the ability to conduct limited attacks in the future, I would not rule that out,” McKenzie said during a Pentagon briefing.\nThe United States, France and Britain destroyed three targets tied to Syria’s weapons program. The most important of them was the Barzah Research and Development Center, which U.S. intelligence concluded was involved in the production and testing of chemical and biological warfare technology.\nSyria and Russia deny unleashing poison gas on April 7 during their offensive on Douma, which ended with the recapture of the town that had been the last rebel stronghold near the capital, Damascus. The suspected chemical attack triggered the U.S. response.\nMcKenzie said that the “absolute preponderance of the evidence” pointed to chemical weapons being present at the sites that were struck, including elements of sarin, particularly at the Barzah site.\nHe added that while the United States could not know with certainty, there was no evidence that any chemicals had escaped into the air after the strike.\nReporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:39:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
