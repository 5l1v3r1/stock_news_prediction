We think it’s the right time to go in,” he said. \n“With the backing of Formula One, we think there’s a lot of opportunity over there.” \nPlayON is also the official daily fantasy sports (DFS) partner of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in Europe, Latin America and Asia. REGIONALLY TAILORED GAMES \nJones said PlayON would operate “real money games” only in those states where local gambling regulations specifically allowed them. \n“On the daily fantasy side, we’ll be operating three different formats,” he said. “So we’ll have a game that’s just for qualifying, a game that’s just for the race and a game that’s the race weekend, including both qualifying and race.” \nPlayers will pick a team of five drivers and one constructor in games that are tailored for regional audiences and in local languages. \nPoints are awarded for achievements, including finishing positions, places gained and fastest laps. \nArthofer said the season-long game, with one change per race week, on the F1 website mirrored that of some U.S. sports leagues and Premier League soccer. \n“(The fans) will on a global basis have the option to play a free-to-play season-long game on our platform, and there will be no daily fantasy wagering,” he said. \n“And then separately on Killian’s platform he’ll have a free-to-play game on a global basis, as well as — where regulated — a pay game.” \nA Formula One spokesman said the sport’s 10 real teams would ultimately also benefit from any increase in overall revenues. $1 = 0.7039 pounds Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Neville Dalton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T16:34:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
