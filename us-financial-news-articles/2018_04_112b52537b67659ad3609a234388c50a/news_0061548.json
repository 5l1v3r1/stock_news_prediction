That compares with a take of less than $1,000 if he switches to growing wheat on the same land, as authorities hope.\nBut Nadir will have to share his profit with the Taliban, in exchange for which they protect poppy fields and find domestic and international smugglers to sell the illegal produce.\nThe insurgents extract a large share of their revenues from narcotics, a trade the United Nations values at roughly $3 billion a year in Afghanistan.\nDespite years of effort to replace it, the banned crop is a vital part of the south Asian nation’s economy. Opium production hit a record in 2017, up 87 percent over 2016, the U.N. says.\nLast year, the government distributed more than 10,000 tonnes of seeds to farmers to persuade them to grow wheat along with 20,000 tonnes of urea, widely used as fertilizer for foodgrains.

REUTERS/Stringer\nMany farmers collected seeds to grow wheat but did not plant them, said Akbar Rustami, a spokesman for the agriculture ministry in Kabul, the capital.\n“We tried to discourage farmers from sowing poppy seeds but they continue to ignore our orders because they want to earn more money,” he said.\nWorsening security and immediate economic benefits for farmers fuel the spurt in poppy cultivation, experts say.\nMore than 3,000 square kilometers (1,158 square miles) of arable land was under poppy cultivation last year, the counter-narcotics ministry said.\nIt launched more than 500 criminal cases against farmers and civil servants for allowing illegal cultivation.\nAmerican and Afghan forces have begun a campaign of air strikes against drug refining and manufacturing laboratories in southwestern Afghanistan, aiming to choke off Taliban revenue.\nYet security concerns hamper efforts to run nationwide inspections, officials say.\n“We need a special task force to stop farmers from sowing poppy,” said Najibullah Ahmadi, who oversees the drive to ban poppy cultivation. “We need helicopters to conduct aerial surveillance.” An Afghan man works on a poppy field in Kandahar, Afghanistan, April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer\nThe government has failed to provide alternate sources of income, said Nadir, the farmer in Kandahar, who worries about providing for his five children.\n“We want the government to find us jobs and pave the ground for alternative farming. If there is a good alternative, there won’t be any need for cultivating poppy anymore.” Writing by Rupam Jain; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T06:52:47.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
