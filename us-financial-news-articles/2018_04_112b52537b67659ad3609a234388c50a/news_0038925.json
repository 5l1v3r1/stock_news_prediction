Flankers Pierre Barthere and Lucas Guillaume, as well as flyhalf Mathieu Belie, all received 14-week bans for using threatening actions and words at a match official. \nA misconduct complaint against the Spanish Rugby Union will be heard at a later date, the statement added. \nWorld Rugby said earlier this month that it would convene an independent disputes panel to review the match. \nSpain must now beat Portugal to earn a two-legged playoff against Samoa for a place at the World Cup.
