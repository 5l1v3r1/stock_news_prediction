Frustrated at the sport, frustrated at all the variables that are involved in the sport,” he added.\n“Sometimes I question why I chose this sport because there’s so many other things out of your control and it does get you down a lot. But then when you have a day like this it’s worth 50 of those bad ones.”\nRelated Coverage Motor racing: Team by team analysis of the Chinese Grand Prix Ricciardo was forced out of last weekend’s race in Bahrain after just two laps due to a problem with his power unit’s control electronics.\nIt was a race the Australian had gone into expecting to challenge for the win.\nIn the season-opener in Melbourne he was slapped with a grid penalty that took away any hope of winning in front of his home crowd.
