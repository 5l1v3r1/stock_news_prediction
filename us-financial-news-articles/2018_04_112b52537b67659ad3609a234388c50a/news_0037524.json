The pair repeatedly refused to leave when politely asked to do so by the employees and officers, he said. \n“If you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, they (the officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties. And they did just that,” Ross said. \n“They were professional in all their dealings with these gentlemen, and instead they got the opposite back.” \nRoss said that as an African-American man he was acutely aware of implicit bias. “We are committed to fair and unbiased policing and anything less than that will not be tolerated in this department,” he said. \nThe two men were released, Ross said, after officers learned Starbucks was “no longer interested” in prosecuting them. \nIn a post on Twitter earlier on Saturday, Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said it was sorry for what took place. \nJohnson added his apology, saying the company would review its policies and “further train our partners to better know when police assistance is warranted.” \nMelissa DePino, an author who posted video of the arrest, said staff called police because the two men had not ordered anything while waiting for a friend. She said white customers were “wondering why it’s never happened to us when we do the same thing.” \nPolice departments across the United States have come under criticism for repeated instances of killing unarmed black men in recent years, which activists blame on racial biases in the criminal justice system.
