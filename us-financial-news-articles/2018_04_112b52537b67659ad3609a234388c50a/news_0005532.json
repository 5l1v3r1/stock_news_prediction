REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh SEEKING A WAY OUT Opposition sources say Jaish al Islam officials have been desperately trying to strike a deal that would bring Russian military police into Douma, and let the group keep a role in maintaining internal security but under the state’s overall jurisdiction.\nRussian military officers negotiating with Jaish al Islam told the group it accepted such an arrangement but the Syrian government remained against it, a senior opposition source familiar with the talks said.\nRussia, a key ally of President Bashar al-Assad, was behind the main battle plan, directing elite forces and militias on the ground and calling in air strikes from Syrian and Russian warplanes, two Western intelligence sources based in the region told Reuters this week.\nThe Syrian army last week warned the insurgents to surrender or face a military assault to drive them out.\nThe Syrian army command said on Saturday it had regained most of the towns and villages in eastern Ghouta and was pressing its military operations in Douma [L8N1RD0N6].\nThe city’s fall would seal the rebels’ worst defeat since 2016.\nThe once bustling commercial hub on the outskirts of the capital was the main center of street protests in the Damascus suburbs against Assad’s rule that ignited the conflict more than seven years ago.\nDefense analysts say a major goal of the government’s campaign was to complete a security belt around the capital, where for years rebels dug into a network of tunnels and well-fortified positions resisted countless offensives to seize the enclave.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Many of the predominantly Sunni Muslim inhabitants of eastern Ghouta say they fear their displacement was part of a deliberate attempt to bring demographic changes in strategic areas that dilutes their presence in favor of Assad’s Alawite sect and other minorities.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by John Stonestreet and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T12:42:07.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
