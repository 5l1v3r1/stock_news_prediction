That is a cautionary tale for rival WPP as it deals with the intrigue and drama of longtime boss Martin Sorrell’s exit .\nPublicis delighted the market Thursday with strong first-quarter numbers. Organic growth of 2.8% in North America, which accounts for over half of group sales, was particularly reassuring in an industry facing upheaval, as big consumer clients trim budgets and as advertising moves further online . The company also announced a daring strategy involving a shift into consulting in March.\nA company plaque outside WPP’s offices in London. No successor to former CEO Martin Sorrell is lined up. Photo: daniel leal-olivas/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Publicis is only now recovering some poise after years of subpar growth. The problems date back to the 2014 collapse of its attempted merger with New York-based peer Omnicom . The deal distracted management and prompted staff to quit, setting Publicis up for substantial client losses when an unusual number of accounts changed hands in 2015. A major deal—the $3.7 billion takeover of digital consultancy Sapient in 2015—and drawn-out succession planning— Arthur Sadoun finally replaced multidecade Chief Executive Maurice Lévy in 2017—added to the upheaval.\nWPP looks on the back foot this time round, with Mr. Sorrell out and no successor in place. Another bumper crop of accounts is up for review this year. Given the uncertainty surrounding the future of ad agencies, whoever replaces Mr. Sorrell has every incentive to lay bare the extent of the company’s problems and initiate a costly round of restructuring.\nWPP shares are undeniably cheap, but the experience of Publicis shows that recoveries in this industry can be slow. For investors prepared to bet that the ad industry can successfully reinvent itself, Publicis looks the safer bet.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T19:36:28.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
