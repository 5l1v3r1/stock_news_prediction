Retail loans within that grew 27.4 percent, while wholesale loans grew 9.4 percent. \nNet interest income rose 17.7 percent for the fourth quarter, while non-interest revenue grew 22.7 percent, the bank said. Net interest margin was steady at 4.3 percent. \nTo fund its future growth, the bank has said it plans to raise up to 240 billion rupees by selling shares to investors, including a preferential issue to its parent HDFC Ltd .
