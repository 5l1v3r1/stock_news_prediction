(NASDAQ: IRWD), a commercial biotech company, today announced that it has received notice from Sarissa Capital Management LP (“Sarissa”) that it intends to nominate its chief investment officer Alex Denner to stand for election to the Ironwood Board of Directors at Ironwood’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Ironwood’s Board and management team will consider the input of its shareholders prior to the Board making a recommendation in Ironwood’s definitive proxy statement.\nIronwood maintains open and ongoing communications with its shareholders and welcomes views and opinions that may advance its goal of creating shareholder value. Members of Ironwood’s management team had one introductory meeting with Sarissa’s representatives prior to Sarissa notifying the company of their intention to nominate a director candidate. Ironwood remains open to continuing a constructive dialogue.\nIronwood has a diverse, experienced and owner-oriented Board comprised of nine directors, eight of whom are independent. Collectively, the Board has significant experience that is critical to our business, including in capital allocation and finance, business strategy, customer and market insights, and senior leadership in both small, entrepreneurial companies and in large pharmaceutical organizations.\nIronwood also has a refreshed Board, having added six new independent directors since 2013. The average tenure of our independent directors as of our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders was five years. The interests of our Board are directly aligned with shareholders, as all Ironwood directors are shareholders in the company, and each director is generally required to hold all shares of stock acquired as payment for his or her service as a director throughout his or her term on the Board.\nThe Ironwood Board regularly reviews its composition on behalf of its shareholders to ensure that it has the skills and expertise to match the demands of the company’s strategy. The Board’s Governance and Nominating Committee has a thorough process in place for evaluating prospective directors and will carefully review and consider Sarissa’s nomination.\nShareholders are not required to take any action at this time. The Ironwood Board will present its recommendation regarding director nominations in the Company's definitive proxy statement to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Ironwood has not yet announced the date of its 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nAbout Ironwood Pharmaceuticals\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: IRWD) is a commercial biotechnology company focused on creating medicines that make a difference for patients, building value for our fellow shareholders, and empowering our passionate team.
