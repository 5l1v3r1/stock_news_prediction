REUTERS/Thomas Peter The list of items reflects a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously in September over North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.\nThe ministry gave details of 32 materials, technologies and forms of equipment with potential use related to weapons of mass destruction, including particle accelerators and centrifuges.\nIn addition, it outlined bans on items with potential dual use in conventional weapons.\nThe announcement of the export bans comes amid a tightening of exports from China to North Korea. China’s exports of fuel to North Korea slowed to a trickle in February.\nNorth Korea has told the United States that it is prepared to discuss denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula when its leader, Kim Jong Un, meets U.S. President Donald Trump.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Richard Pullin, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T02:43:19.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
