The work would last about 16 months, Grana said.\nFluor won a contract in 2014 to provide construction management and early works execution for the Quellaveco project in southern Peru. Fluor and AngloAmerican did not immediately respond to request for comment.\nQuellaveco, which could produce some 225,000 tons of copper annually, has the permits needed for its development but has been stalled since 2013. An Anglo executive told Reuters a year ago the project could be executed by the end of 2018.
