( on.wsj.com/2HbwTow )\nGlass Lewis generally supports a company’s auditors choice except when it believes the “auditor’s independence or audit integrity has been compromised,” according to the report.\nGE in January disclosed that U.S. securities regulators are probing insurance charges including a $6.2 billion charge to increase insurance reserves and $15 billion more in provisions for insurance policies.\nGE in a report dated March 12, had backed KPMG and said its Audit Committee believed that KPMG is independent and it is in the best interests of GE and its share owners to retain KPMG as its independent auditor for 2018.\nKPMG declined to comment. Glass, Lewis & Co was not immediately available for a comment.\nReporting by Shubham Kalia and Philip George in Bengaluru Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://on.wsj.com/2HbwTow"], "published": "2018-04-06T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:58:57.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
