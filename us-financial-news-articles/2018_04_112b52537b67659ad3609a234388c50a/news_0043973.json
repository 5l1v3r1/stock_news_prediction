REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski Deutsche Bank earlier on Friday said it had made the transfer in error to its own account at the derivative exchange Eurex, confirming news first reported by Bloomberg.\nThe bank said it noticed the mistake in a matter of minutes and there was no financial damage.\nThe ECB, which oversees Deutsche Bank, has sent a questionnaire to the bank about the incident, Handelsblatt reported. Questions include why the bank’s internal security controls didn’t work and why there weren’t two sets of eyes for the transaction.\nThe ECB also wants to know how Deutsche plans to prevent such an incident from happening again, the newspaper said.\nThe ECB declined to comment.\nReporting by Tom Sims and Andreas Framke; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T21:30:08.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
