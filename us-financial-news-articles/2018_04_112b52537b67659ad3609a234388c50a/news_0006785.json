They were ordered by a Guatemalan tribunal to pay fines equivalent to $67,500 each.\nIn addition, as a group, they will have to repair and construct at least six roads and build a school in a rural area of the impoverished country, according to the CICIG.\nLawyers for the businessmen could not immediately be reached for comment.\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Writing by Julia Love; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T09:14:36.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
