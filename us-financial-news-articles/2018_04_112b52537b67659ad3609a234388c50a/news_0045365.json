SIs play an increasingly significant role guiding customer planning and decision making to introduce emerging technologies designed to enhance and grow their business. Integration with Avaya’s industry-leading portfolio of unified communications and contact center platforms can amplify the business impact.\n“As a proven strategist who delivers business growth with partners, Ron Griggs is an outstanding addition to our team,” said Jim Chirico, President and CEO, Avaya. “He has a deep understanding of the needs and requirements in engaging and building new practices with SIs as we expand our partner ecosystem to deliver differentiated business value to customers.”\nGriggs comes to Avaya from Deloitte, where he was responsible for alliance sales executive management for Cloud, Digital, Networking and Security Vendors. He also spent more than 20 years at Accenture, ultimately serving as a managing director/partner for over a decade in a tenure marked by significant revenue and market share growth. Griggs earlier career includes stints at Sequent Computer Systems, which was acquired by IBM, Robec Distributors and Unisys. He is a graduate of DePaul University, with a BS degree in management and marketing.\n“SIs are proving to be great enablers for digital transformation, although it becomes a greater challenge for them to understand how to map and merge the many diverse technologies available into highly functional systems that will bring the greatest benefits to a business,” said Griggs. “I look forward to rolling up my sleeves with these partners, helping them learn what our solutions offer, and exploring how we can integrate with other technologies to deliver innovative business models and entirely new value for themselves and their clients.”\nAbout Avaya\nAvaya is a global leader in digital communications software, services and devices for businesses of all sizes.
