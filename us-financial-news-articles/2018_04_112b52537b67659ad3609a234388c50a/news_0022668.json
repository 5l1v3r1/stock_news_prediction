REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi The first round of formal consultations, which was held last week, ended in a stalemate.\nMattarella has the power to name a prime minister, but the March 4 national election ended with a hung parliament so it is still unclear whether rivals can find common ground for a coalition government, or whether another vote will be needed.\nItaly’s parliament is divided three ways between a right-wing coalition, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, and the centre-left Democratic Party. These main groups will meet Mattarella on Thursday afternoon and evening.\nReporting by Steve Scherer; editing by Francesca Landini\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:09:44.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
