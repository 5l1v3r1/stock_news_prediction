REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker/File Photo \nStocks of drug distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, as well as those of drug retailers CVS Health and Walgreens Boots Alliance , all jumped after the report. \nThe change in Amazon’s plans comes partly because the online retailer has not been able to convince big hospitals to change their traditional purchasing process, CNBC said, citing sources familiar with the matter. \nAmazon did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. \nThe company, through its Amazon Business unit, will instead focus on selling less sensitive medical supplies to hospitals and smaller clinics, according to CNBC. \nThe pharmaceutical supply chain, including distributors and retailers, has been rattled in the past year over speculation that Amazon will make a big move into the industry.
