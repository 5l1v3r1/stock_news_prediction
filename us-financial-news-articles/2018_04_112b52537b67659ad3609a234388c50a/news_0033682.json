The brothers had served as co-CEOs since 2000.\n“I thank my family and our advisory committee that they continue to put their faith in me and transfer sole leadership of our family business to me,” Christian Haub, 53, said in a statement.\nThe brothers are the fifth generation of the family to run the business that was founded in 1867 as an importer of coffee and tea and a trader in goods from the colonies.\nTheir father, Erivan Haub, died last month on his ranch in Wyoming. Forbes magazine estimated his fortune at $6.4 billion.
