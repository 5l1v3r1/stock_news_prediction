We will, however, continue to monitor closely any potential risks,” a Uniper spokesman said, reiterating previous remarks made by the company.\nUniper is among five European energy firms funding Nord Stream 2, which will run from Russia to Germany. Other investors include BASF unit Wintershall [WINT.UL], Anglo-Dutch group Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie.\nOMV declined to comment.
