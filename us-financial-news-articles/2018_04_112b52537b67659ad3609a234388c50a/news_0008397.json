REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo Deutsche Post initially developed the StreetScooter for its own operations to avoid inner-city emissions after growth in online shopping resulted in increased parcel deliveries. But it has since sought to step up production and sell the vans to other customers.\nThe new unit, entitled Corporate Incubations, will be led by Juergen Gerdes, currently head of the Post-eCommerce-Parcel (PeP) division, and will also cover other new mobility solutions, digital platforms and automation, the company said in a statement.\nUntil a successor for Gerdes is found, Deutsche Post CEO Frank Appel will lead the PeP division.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T18:20:33.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
