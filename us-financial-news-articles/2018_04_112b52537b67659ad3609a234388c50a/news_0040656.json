But while they often put on a strong show of political unity and shared intent, the devil is frequently in the detail.\nOn Tuesday, Merkel said creating a euro zone banking union was a priority for her, but she also broadened out the reform question to include a European asylum system, as well as foreign, defence and research policy.\nFraming reform as such a broad issue risks diluting Macron’s drive to beef up the euro zone with extra funding firepower.\nMerkel also wants to make economic competitiveness a priority for the euro zone, rather than simply amassing funds for countries in trouble, and has suggested a “Jumbo Council” of European finance and economy ministers, government sources say.\nBut in an indication of the divisions within her government on euro zone reform, the Handelsblatt business daily reported that Merkel’s junior coalition partner, the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD), reject the idea.\nThe SPD sympathises with Macron on the euro zone and wants him to be rewarded for his efforts to reform the French economy, well aware that a big chunk of French voters remains susceptible to far-right and far-left populists sceptical about the EU.
