We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” Schroepfer wrote.\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg apologized to U.S. senators for issues that have beset Facebook, but the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect calls for any specific promises to support possible congressional regulation.\nSchroepfer was filling in for Zuckerberg in front of the British lawmakers after the Facebook chief declined to appear himself, a decision the parliamentary committee chairman had described as astonishing.\nSchroepfer said users would be able to view who runs adverts by June and that further measures, including labels for political ads and a searchable archive, would be rolled out before local elections in May 2019.\nRelated Coverage Facebook reviewing operations in Myanmar, says needs more people on the ground Facebook CTO says decisions on political ads are not to do with money Facebook CTO says sorry journalists feel firm is trying to suppress the truth He denied that any shortcomings in Facebook’s approach to political adverts before now had been due to commercial reasons.\n“This is not an issue of revenue for us,” he said. “Political advertising is a very small, low single-digit percentage of our overall advertising, so the decisions here have nothing to do with money or revenue.”\nWE ARE HUMAN During an often testy hearing, Facebook was criticized for how it has worked with the committee, as lawmakers gather evidence for an inquiry into “fake news”.\nSchroepfer declined to give much detail, citing ongoing investigations by Britain’s information commissioner and Electoral Commission, despite repeated reassurances by committee chair Collins that it was legally safe for him to do so.\n“What’s been a frustration for us in this inquiry is a pattern of behavior from the company, an unwillingness to engage, and a desire to hold on to information and not disclose it,” Collins told Schroepfer.\nAsked by another lawmaker whether Facebook would apologize for its “bullying” behavior towards the media since the scandal broke, Schroepfer said: “I am sorry that journalists feel that we are trying to prevent them from getting the truth out.\n“That is not the intent, so I’m sorry,” he added.\nLawmakers also raised concerns over the use of social media in Britain’s referendum vote in 2016 to leave the European Union.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Schroepfer said it was clear Facebook had not done enough to ensure its tools were “potentially being used for harm” or take a broad enough view of its responsibility.\nAs many as a million British Facebook users may have had their data harvested because they were connected to U.S. users targeted in data passed to Cambridge Analytica, Schroepfer said.\nBut there was no evidence of Cambridge Analytica managing referendum-related ads or pages, Schroepfer said, or spending money on the campaigns.\nCambridge Analytica said, in a tweet, that this was “hardly surprising: Cambridge Analytica didn’t work on the referendum.”\nCambridge Analytica has said it pitched to the Leave.EU campaign group for work, but that no work was undertaken.\nHowever, Schroepfer said a Canadian firm called AggregateIQ, which performed work for the official campaign group Vote Leave, spent $2 million on ads.\nHe added that “similar people” appeared in the accounts and billing information of AIQ and Cambridge Analytica.\nCambridge Analytica has said it was not involved in AIQ’s work for Vote Leave, while AIQ has said it never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica and has never been part of the firm.\nFacebook received a certification that Cambridge Analytica deleted the data at the center of the scandal when requested, Schroepfer said.\nBut one lawmaker said details of what Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica had been withheld when the committee took evidence in Washington from more junior Facebook officials.\nSchroepfer said Facebook was doing its best to provide information as and when it had it, and said the organization had integrity.\n“It hurts when we make mistakes. It hurts when people abuse our platform,” Schroepfer said. “We are human and make mistakes.”\nWriting by Michael Holden and Alistair Smout; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge, Keith Weir and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T13:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:21:16.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
