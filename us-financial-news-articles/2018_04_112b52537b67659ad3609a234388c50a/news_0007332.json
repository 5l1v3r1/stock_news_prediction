They were ordered by a Guatemalan tribunal to pay fines equivalent to $67,500 (£47,992) each. \nIn addition, as a group, they will have to repair and construct at least six roads and build a school in a rural area of the impoverished country, according to the CICIG. \nLawyers for the businessmen could not immediately be reached for comment.
