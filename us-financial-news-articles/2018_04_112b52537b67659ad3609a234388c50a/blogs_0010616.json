Shares rose as much as 28 percent Tuesday in its NYSE debut, before closing 13 percent up . Wednesday the stock returned some of its gains , falling as much as 8.5 percent before closing 3 percent down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T16:43:49.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
