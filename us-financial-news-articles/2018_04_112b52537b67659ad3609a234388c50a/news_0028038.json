Ever wondered why computer bugs, ransomware and viruses often carry such oddball names? The Wall Street Journal’s Robert McMillan explores how security experts and techies lean on puns and punchy wordplay to make their discoveries stand out . There’s even an awards show, the Pwnies, which recognizes the best bug branding. Hmmm, if this gig doesn’t work out…\nMr. Congressman You Can’t Understand Mark Zuckerberg’s two days of hourslong hearings on Capitol Hill are over, and although the Facebook founder was poised throughout, he must be feeling relieved to return to Silicon Valley, where people understand how tech works. That said, the session Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee did get a lot more into the nitty-gritty of the company’s business model than the previous day’s grilling.\nMy top five highlights:\n1) Mr. Zuckerberg revealed his own personal data was caught up in the Cambridge Analytica incident. Refreshing to know even our tech overlords (or one of Mr. Zuckerberg’s pals) can’t resist a fun personality quiz.\n2) “ Shadow profiles ” were brought up in a line of questioning about how Facebook collects data about people who don’t use its services. Mr. Zuckerberg (who said he wasn’t familiar with the term) said that Facebook tracks nonuser data for “security purposes” and its ad network and that anyone can opt out of data collection for ads.\n3) GDPR was once again a hot topic. Mr. Zuckerberg said he believes the regulation will be “a very positive step for the internet” by putting privacy controls in front of people “repeatedly” and making sure people give affirmative consent.\n4) On Cambridge Analytica improperly obtaining data from a Cambridge University researcher, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook had found “a whole program” associated with the university where researchers were building similar apps. “We do need to understand whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall that will require stronger action from us,” he said. Cambridge University responded to the Zuck dunk with a statement and told the BBC it found no evidence its researchers were obtaining personal data illicitly. “Facebook is making allegations but is not presenting us with any evidence,” the university said.\n5) Mr. Zuckerberg didn’t take all the questions in his stride. Wired tallied up 43 separate occasions over the past two days when the Facebook founder deferred to his team for a follow-up. Those include responses on the specific regulations Facebook would propose for the tech industry, the principles Facebook will use to guide the development of artificial intelligence, exactly how Facebook plans to implement the part of GDPR that lets users opt out of their data being shared for marketing purposes in the U.S., and how many like and share buttons there are on non-Facebook webpages.\nSpend a Little Time With Me Facebook may have some other issues closer to home, too. An analysis of Nielsen digital consumption data for January carried out by Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser found Facebook’s share of U.S. consumer time spent on digital media fell 2 percentage points from the prior year to 16.3%. That figure also includes consumption on Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Consumption on Google properties, which include YouTube and Waze, rose 3 percentage points to 27.4%. Mr. Wieser notes the Nielsen data can sometimes be flawed, given methodological tweaks that may occur in any given period and that content consumption doesn’t directly relate to monetization, as platforms can tweak their products, ad loads, pricing and so on. You’ll remember Facebook did warn us time spent on its platform was going to decline as it focused its efforts on providing “meaningful interactions.” Nevertheless, advertisers and investors will be watching the engagement trends closely, not least if the current spotlight on Facebook user privacy leads to people opting to share less of their data.\nThank You for Smoking E-cigarettes are a relatively new advertising category, but much of the creative is borrowing from techniques used by Big Tobacco in what now seems like a bygone era. The Smithsonian National Museum of American History has an archive of more than 50,000 tobacco ads dating back from the turn of the 20th century. The curator of that archive, Robert Jackler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon from Stanford University, recently started adding e-cigarette ads to his collection—and he’s worried about what he sees, dubbing the category an “ unregulated Wild West .” He points to some e-cigarette advertisers using the kind of questionable health references and youth appeal the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act largely stubbed out decades ago. E-cigarettes come within the oversight of the Food and Drug Administration, which in March was sued by public health groups for its decision to delay its regulation of e-cigarettes. Expect e-cigarette companies to keep testing the boundaries in their marketing for some while yet.\nBest of the rest The U.K. Takeover Panel has ruled that Disney must make an offer to buy all of Sky if it succeeds in its bid to acquire 21st Century Fox’s assets. The panel also said Disney must match Fox’s £10.75-a-share offer for the 61% of Sky it doesn’t own already.

[ BuzzFeed News ]\nCambridge Analytica’s acting chief executive, Alex Tayler, told the company’s leadership Wednesday that Julian Wheatland, the chairman of its British affiliate, would take over as the next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter. Former CEO Alexander Nix, who was suspended last month, has officially resigned from his position, according to a person close to the company. [ WSJ ]\nJay Penske’s Penske Media Corporation and Barry Diller’s IAC are reportedly interested in buying some of the assets of Fusion Media Group. [ Vanity Fair ]\nU.K.-based events marketing company Verve has acquired JusCollege for $25 million in cash and equity. JusCollege has a network of “campus reps” who recruit their fellow students to take group trips to destinations like Las Vegas.

Some 80% of programmatic dollars will flow through private marketplaces and direct deals by 2019, according to eMarketer.
