The chiefs of AT&T and Time Warner are set to take to the witness stand Wednesday to defend their proposed $85 billion merger, in what will likely be a dramatic moment in their high-stakes court battle with U.S. antitrust enforcers. Follow along with the Journal’s live coverage of the AT&T-Time Warner court action here .\nOmnicom’s Little Bundle of Joy We’re entering earnings season for advertising holding companies, so expect lots of questions about the departure of Martin Sorrell and the future of WPP. (On that note, Ken Auletta has a great “ professional obituary ” of Mr. Sorrell’s storied career.) Publicis is up on Thursday, but first, Omnicom reported a slight lift in revenue in its first quarter, meeting analysts’ expectations . On the call, one analyst asked about speculation WPP may put some of its research or data assets up for sale. Omnicom CEO John Wren said that is not a “key focus” of the company’s acquisition strategy. Omnicom *does* plan to invest in creating more custom solutions for clients that incorporate resources from various agencies and disciplines—its answer to WPP’s “horizontality” or Publicis’s “Power of One” approaches. In terms of wider trends, Mr. Wren said a lot of clients in the U.S. over the past five quarters have shifted from buying digital ads in a way that bundles media, tech fees and other services to a model that provides more itemized information about the costs. That “has an impact on reported revenue,” but Mr. Wren said this kind of transparency a good thing in the long-run.\nClosing Time Starbucks made headlines this weekend after finding itself at the receiving end of a backlash when two black men were arrested at a downtown Philadelphia location. As we reported in this newsletter Monday, CEO Kevin Johnson committed to working with outside experts and community leaders to “understand and adopt best practices.” On Tuesday, Starbucks announced it will close all its company-owned U.S. stores on the afternoon of May 29 for racial-bias training. It’s a move that some people might compare to when Chipotle closed its stores to hold a national staff meeting about food safety following its various norovirus, salmonella and E.coli issues in 2016. But in Starbucks’ case, the company isn’t just applying a Band-Aid to an unraveling crisis, but defining best practice and a leadership position, according to Davia Temin, president and CEO of management consultancy Temin and Company. “Starbucks is defining a new level of seriousness in crisis response,” she told me. “It is a unique step—not one right out of some PR playbook—that both feels and appears to be honest and real.”\nSo Fresh and So Clean There is a growing sense of anger from a group of YouTube creators as the video platform continues to make the platform a safer place for marketers to place their ads. That means many channels have been “demonetized” and can no longer earn ad revenue from their videos. Earlier this month, police said bitterness over YouTube’s policies appear to have motivated Nasim Najafi Aghdam to open fire at the company’s headquarters, wounding three employees, On Tuesday, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki addressed the creator community for the first time since the incident in a blog post , Business Insider reported. Ms. Wojcicki expressed empathy that the platform’s cleanup “has not been easy for many of you” and said YouTube is looking to improve communication with creators. YouTube is also testing sponsorships, she said, providing a new way for creators to make money beyond the usual ad revenue share deal. Judging by the comments below the post, it seems the creator community still has a lot of questions, particularly about the delays in getting their videos approved for monetization.\nHow Do You Like Them Apples? Facing headwinds like the decline of the print advertising market and Facebook’s recent algorithm tweak, many publishers are looking for a savior to throw them a bone right now. You may recall back in March Apple acquired Next Issue Media and its digital-magazine-subscription service Texture for an undisclosed sum. Texture’s technology is now being integrated into Apple News and the company gearing up to launch a premium content subscription offering within the app in the next year, Bloomberg reports. It looks as though the service will adopt a similar approach to Apple Music, charging a simple monthly subscription to open up access to content from a range of different publishers. Those publishers would share a slice of the revenue, the report says. But longtime Apple analyst and co-founder of Loup Ventures, Gene Munster thinks the company will need to bring down the current $9.99 cost Texture charges to just a few dollars a month in order to boost its subscription numbers. Even then, he doesn’t think it’ll “move the needle” for Apple’s subscriptions business.\nBest of the rest Nate Silver’s politics and news site FiveThirtyEight is heading to Disney-owned ABC News after five years at (Disney-owned) ESPN.
