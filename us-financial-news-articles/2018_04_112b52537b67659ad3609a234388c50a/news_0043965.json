It since slowed but has shown signs of recovery in recent months, despite the impact of the boycott.\n“The previous tightening of financial conditions between mid-2014 to mid-2016, when hydrocarbon prices precipitously declined, does not seem to have harmed private sector lending post-impasse from June 2017 onwards,” said Ehsan Khoman, MENA head of research and strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
