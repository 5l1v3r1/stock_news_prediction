With major ongoing conflicts and more displaced children than at any time in history, it is clear that children around the world need the full power of organizations like ours.”\nSave the Children said in February that concerns were raised about inappropriate comments and behavior by Forsyth in 2011 and 2015. It said reviews in both cases had resulted in “unreserved apologies” to the women involved.\nForsyth resigned days later as the deputy director of UNICEF, the United Nations children’s agency, saying he did not want coverage of past mistakes he had made to damage the organization or other aid bodies.\n“I apologized unreservedly at the time and face to face. I apologize again,” he said at the time.\nReporting by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:27:10.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
