REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo \nMediaset’s struggling Premium pay-TV business, once attractive to customers for its soccer channel offer, will stop airing matches at the end of June, when its rights to broadcast the Champions League expire. \nThe business has changed its strategy towards on-demand offerings and away from expensive, premium sports content after a deal to sell it to France’s Vivendi ( VIV.PA ), signed in April 2016, fell through three months later. \nThe French media group now holds just under 30 percent of Mediaset and is entangled in a legal row with the Italian broadcaster.
