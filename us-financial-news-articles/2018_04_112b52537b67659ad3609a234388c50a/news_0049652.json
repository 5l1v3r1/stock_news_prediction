Boston, which had not lost consecutive games in 2018 before this weekend, dropped a series for the first time in six tries this season.\nBlake Treinen (1-1) got the win with 1 2/3 scoreless innings and three strikeouts. Athletics starter Daniel Mengden gave up one run on six hits with five strikeouts over 6 1/3 innings in a no-decision.\nPrice (2-2) allowed all four runs on nine hits and one walk with six strikeouts in 7 2/3 innings.\nAfter going hitless Saturday, the Red Sox notched a hit in the game’s first at-bat as Jackie Bradley Jr. laced a leadoff single to right field.\nMitch Moreland moved Bradley to second with a single three batters later, but Rafael Devers struck out swinging to end the Red Sox’s first.\nPrice allowed a leadoff double to Marcus Semien two pitches into the Athletics’ first. Semien advanced to third on Stephen Piscotty’s 6-3 groundout and then came home on Davis’ two-out, RBI single to left.\nMengden kept the Red Sox off the scoreboard until the seventh. Back-to-back singles from Moreland and Devers and a Blake Swihart groundout set the table for Holt, who ripped a game-tying RBI double to right.\nChristian Vazquez popped out and Tzu-Wei Lin struck out swinging to strand Swihart at third and end the Boston threat.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:21:18.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
