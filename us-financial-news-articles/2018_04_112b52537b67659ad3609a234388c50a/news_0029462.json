She refused to be drawn on whether she would seek their approval for future action. \nJeremy Corbyn, head of the opposition Labour party, led criticism of May for not recalling parliament a vote, accusing her of blindly following U.S. President Donald Trump’s orders. \n“I’m absolutely clear that it is parliament’s responsibility to hold me to account for such decisions and parliament will do so,” May told the House of Commons in a rowdy session. \n“But it is my responsibility as prime minister to make these decisions and I will make them.” \nMay has weathered months of doubt over her leadership due to rows over the Brexit decision to leave the European Union and an ill-judged decision to call an early election when her Conservative Party lost its parliamentary majority. \nNow, she is enjoying an unusual spell of international support for her action in Syria and her stance against Moscow over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain.

Why was this not done?” PRAISE \nWhile some in May’s Conservative party also expressed their regret that she had sidelined parliament, May won praise from others - one calling her a “real prime minister” - for moving swiftly to support the joint air strikes. \nCorbyn drew jeers and shouts for his taunt that May had acted to please Trump.

May has emphasised that the strikes were “limited” to only target Damascus’s chemical weapons programme. \nBut she will be mindful of how military action can backfire. \nFormer Prime Minister Tony Blair’s legacy was tainted by his decision to join the war against Iraq, especially after an inquiry concluded that the decision was based on flawed intelligence, while her predecessor, David Cameron, was damaged after losing a vote for strikes against Syria in 2013. \nOpinion polls suggest that most Britons do not support military action, with one by Survation taken after the strikes were launched showing 40 percent of the 2,060 people asked opposed the action. Some 36 percent supported the strikes. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May attends a press conference in 10 Downing Street, London, April 14, 2018.

If not, she’s the one that will take the blame.” additional reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek in Brussels; Editing by Richard Balmforth", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T02:04:36.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
