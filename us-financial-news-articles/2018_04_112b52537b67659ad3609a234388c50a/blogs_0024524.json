After producing the top offense in baseball last season, the Astros have scored only nine runs over their last five games despite fielding the same lineup. The Astros were held without an extra-base hit for the third time in five games.\nMinnesota (5-4) capitalized on the control woes of Astros left-hander Dallas Keuchel (0-2), who issued four walks for the second time in three starts after doing so only once over 23 starts last season. Keuchel walked Twins first baseman Joe Mauer twice, with Mauer scoring the second run of the first inning and recording an RBI after drawing a bases-loaded walk in the second.\nKeuchel appeared to retire Twins second baseman Brian Dozier on a groundout to open the game, but the call was overturned following a review that revealed Dozier beat the throw from third baseman Alex Bregman. Keuchel followed with his walk of Mauer and, following a grounder to the right side of the infield that advanced both runners, Dozier scored on an Eduardo Escobar sacrifice fly. Mauer scored one batter later when Robbie Grossman doubled.\nMauer added a run-scoring single in the eighth inning and finished 2-for-3 with two walks. Dozier walked four times in addition to his leadoff single.\nAfter laboring through 29 pitches in the first inning and 33 in the second, Keuchel lasted just four innings, his shortest outing since Aug. 8. He recorded six strikeouts but allowed three runs, bloating his ERA to 4.20 on a staff that entered the night leading the majors in that category.\nOdorizzi (1-0) surrendered a two-out RBI single to Jake Marisnick in the second inning but was otherwise in control. He retired the Astros in order only once, doing so in the sixth. However, he induced inning-ending double-play groundballs from Astros shortstop Carlos Correa in the first and fifth innings to sidestep potential Houston rallies.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T12:18:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
