We view Cabot as a rarity in the sector,” Williams Capital Group analyst Gabriele Sorbara said.\nTotal natural gas production rose to 164.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf) from 163.8 Bcf in the quarter.\nCabot said it expects second-quarter production to be in the range of 1,850 to 1,900 million cubic feet equivalent (MMcfe) and stuck to its 2018 daily production guidance growth of 10 to 15 percent.\nExcluding items, Cabot posted a profit of 28 cents, beating the average analyst estimate 27 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company’s net income rose to $117.2 million, or 26 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31, from $105.7 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.\nShares of the company were up 1.5 percent at $23.81 in midday trading.\nReporting by Akshara P in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T14:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:22:09.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
