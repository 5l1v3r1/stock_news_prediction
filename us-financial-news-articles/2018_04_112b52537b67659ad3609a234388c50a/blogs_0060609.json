Majority leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky., has said the bill is \"not necessary\" and that he would not bring it up for a vote.\n\"I'm the one who decides what we take to the floor,\" McConnell told Fox News last week. \"That's my responsibility as the majority leader, and we will not be having this on the floor of the Senate.\"\nMueller is investigating allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and damage his Democrat opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .\nTrump reportedly considered firing Mueller at least twice last year.
