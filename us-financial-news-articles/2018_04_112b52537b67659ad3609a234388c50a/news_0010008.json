It was good out there, the crowd were fantastic as well.” \n“It’s good to have Aussies in your race to get the crowd going as well.” \nChalmers had sat back as South Africa’s les Clos, who had won the 50m butterfly title about 20 minutes earlier, took on the early pace for the first two laps before Guy took the lead at the turn for home. \nThe Rio Olympics 100m freestyle champion then stormed past Guy and held off the fast finishing Horton. \nLe Clos, whose medal ceremony for the butterfly had ended about five minutes before he was back on the blocks, faded to finish seventh.
