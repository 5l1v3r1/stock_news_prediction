First quarter 2018 EPS from continuing operations was $2.20 compared to $1.73 in the first quarter 2017. The increase in the first quarter 2018 EPS from continuing operations was primarily driven by operational improvements and lower taxes.\n\"We delivered strong operating performance in the first quarter with our sales, earnings per share and cash flow all ahead of our expectations,\" said Thomas A. Kennedy, Raytheon Chairman and CEO. \"We continue to position the company for the future by executing our strategy and investing in advanced capabilities that align with our global customers' evolving requirements.\"\nOperating cash flow from continuing operations for the first quarter 2018 was $283 million compared to an outflow of $41 million for the first quarter 2017. The increase in operating cash flow from continuing operations in the first quarter 2018 was primarily due to favorable collections and lower net cash taxes.\nIn the first quarter 2018, the company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $400 million. In addition, as previously announced, Raytheon's Board of Directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate by 8.8 percent, from $3.19 to $3.47 per share, the fourteenth consecutive annual dividend increase.\nThe company had bookings of $6.3 billion in the first quarter 2018, compared with $5.7 billion in the first quarter 2017.\nSummary Financial Results\n1st Quarter\n%\n($ in millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nChange\nBookings\n$\n6,311\n$\n5,688\n11.0%\nNet Sales\n$\n6,267\n$\n6,000\n4.5%\nIncome from Continuing Operations attributable to\nRaytheon Company\n$\n634\n$\n503\n26.0%\nEPS from Continuing Operations\n$\n2.20\n$\n1.73\n27.2%\nOperating Cash Flow from Continuing Operations\n$\n283\n$\n(41)\nWorkdays in Fiscal Reporting Calendar\n64\n64\nBacklog at the end of the first quarter 2018 was $38.1 billion, an increase of approximately $2.1 billion or 5.8 percent compared to the end of the first quarter 2017.\nBacklog\nPeriod Ending\n($ in millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n2017\nBacklog\n$\n38,139\n$\n36,054\n$\n38,210\nOutlook\nThe company has updated its financial outlook for 2018.

As a result, all components of FAS pension and postretirement benefit expense, other than service costs, were reclassified from operating income to non-operating income, with no impact to net income. The outlook above reflects this change.\nSegment Results\nThe company's reportable segments are: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS); Missile Systems (MS); Space and Airborne Systems (SAS); and Forcepoint™.\nIntegrated Defense Systems\n1st Quarter\n($ in millions)\n2018\n2017\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$\n1,489\n$\n1,398\n7%\nOperating Income\n$\n273\n$\n212\n29%\nOperating Margin\n18.3%\n15.2%\nIntegrated Defense Systems (IDS) had first quarter 2018 net sales of $1,489 million, up 7 percent compared to $1,398 million in the first quarter 2017.
