It contains less than 0.1 percent of tetrahydrocannabinol, the substance that makes people high. \nIt is designed to treat Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), rare childhood-onset forms of epilepsy that are among the most resistant to treatment. \nFDA staff said overall findings from three pivotal clinical studies demonstrated that, when added to a current therapy, GW’s drug “reduces seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant LGS or DS while maintaining a predictable and manageable safety profile”. \nThe FDA briefing document, posted on the agency’s website was prepared ahead of an advisory committee meeting on April 19. \nAn editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine last year said that clinical evidence of Epidiolex’s efficacy represented “the beginning of solid evidence for the use of cannabinoids in epilepsy” after an era of anecdote.
