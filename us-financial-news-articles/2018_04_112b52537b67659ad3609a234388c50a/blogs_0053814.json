In a September tweet, the president called on fans to stop going to games as long as the protests continued. He also urged the NFL to \"fire or suspend\" players who were protesting. During a rally in late September, Trump said the league's business would \"go to hell\" if it did not change its approach to the protests.\nAccording to the Times, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a Trump friend, was chief among the owners expressing worries about Trump's attacks on the league during the October meeting.\n\"The problem we have is, we have a president who will use that as fodder to do his mission that I don't feel is in the best interests of America,\" Kraft said, referring to players' kneeling during \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" according to the Times. \"It's divisive and it's horrible.\"\nKraft is known as a long-time Democrat but has spoken openly about his close friendship with the Republican president . He visited the real estate magnate at Trump Tower in Manhattan days after Trump won the presidential election .\nRepresentatives for the White House, the NFL and the Patriots did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nRead the full New York Times report here.", "external_links": ["https://www.boston.com/news/new-england-patriots/2016/11/16/robert-kraft-just-visited-trump-tower", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/robert-kraft-opens-goodell-deflategate-donald-trump-article-1.2958959", "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/nfl-owners-kaepernick.html?smid=tw-nytsports&smtyp=cur"], "published": "2018-04-25T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T21:18:37.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
