We certainly have to win two definitely, just to give ourselves a glimmer of hope.\n“Realistically though we need three wins. If we do that then I believe we will stay in this league, so there is real pressure on us to try and deliver that.”\nStoke are winless in their last 11 league games although they have secured 1-1 draws against West Ham United and Burnley in their last two games.\n“Personally I love the pressure.... every player, manager has to work under pressure, that is the nature of the business we are in,” Lambert added.\n“As a group we won’t be affected by it. We all know what is at stake. We aren’t frightened by it, we are going to embrace this and give it our best shot.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:37:28.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
