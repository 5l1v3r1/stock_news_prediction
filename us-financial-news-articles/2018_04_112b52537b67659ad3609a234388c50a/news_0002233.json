Pops said it was not clear if this study could be adapted to meet the FDA’s request for data. \n“We don’t believe any additional clinical trials are necessary,” he said. \nAlkermes said it will request a meeting with the regulator to hash out the next steps in its efforts to bring the drug to market. \nALKS 5461, a once-daily pill combining samidorphan and buprenorphine, is designed to rebalance brain function that becomes dysregulated in the state of depression, and was developed to treat major depressive disorder in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. \nThe FDA asked for additional well-controlled clinical trials as well as a bioavailability study to show bridging data between the drug and the reference drug, buprenorphine, which is usually prescribed to depression patients. \nAn estimated 16.2 million people in the United States suffered from major depressive disorder in 2016, according to the company, and a majority of the patients do not adequately respond to initial anti-depressant therapy. \nThe company’s other two drugs in the market treat schizophrenia and alcohol dependence. Its development pipeline includes drugs for treatment of multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. \nThe stock fell as much as 22 percent to a near 1-1/2 year low of $45.17.
