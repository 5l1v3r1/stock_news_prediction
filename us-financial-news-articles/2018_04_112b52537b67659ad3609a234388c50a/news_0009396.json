That is the message we are telling sponsors,” a senior leveraged banker said.\nHOT FOR HOW LONG? No-one has much certainty on what the markets will be like during the remainder of the year. While the loan market has been quite resilient in the face of major geo-political uncertainty so far, there is a fear among bankers that such hot conditions can’t prevail for much longer.\n“We’ve been at the top of the market for a while but are we now at the peak? The market can’t shrug off the inevitable for much longer. There have been a load of issues on the horizon and at some point they will have an impact,” the senior banker said.\nOngoing hurdles include Brexit, Trump and his stance on trade, issues over the Italian government and a rising interest rate environment.\nYet some bankers are more positive and see the loan market’s ability to shrug off volatility as a given.\n“It tends to be the case that technicals trump Trump. They outweigh geopolitical events in the loan market and arguably they should as it is senior secured debt, not equity so it would need an extreme set of circumstances to undermine confidence because that is what senior secured debt is paid to do — you get 3%-4%, not equity returns,” a syndicate head said.\nMany bankers and investors would welcome a correction in Europe’s leveraged loan market, which has gradually imported all the borrower friendly terms of the US leveraged loan market without the flex protection afforded to the US banks in the US markets.\nThis has led European banks and investors to accept increasingly aggressive terms on flexibility around restricted payments with limited deleveraging from the outset, increasing flexibility around accordion features and permissible indebtedness.\nLeverage has rocketed on a number of jumbo deals and some bankers are offering opening day leveraged in excess of 7.5-8.0 times on potential sales of French drug maker Sanofi’s European generic drugs business Zentiva and German metering group Techem.\nBorrowers now have the ability to add up to two turns of leverage onto a company as soon as a loan closes, without prior deleveraging.\nPricing has also compressed at the same time with 300bp being offered on Single B term loans. Meanwhile one bank is offering a second-lien on Zentiva at 675bp, a record low for second-lien since the financial crisis.\n“We are at the peak of aggressiveness in Europe’s loan market and we need something to prompt a correction,” an investor said.
