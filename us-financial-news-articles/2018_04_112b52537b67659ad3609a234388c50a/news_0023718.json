Sanctions on Rusal boosted aluminium prices to a more than six-week high.\nEN+ shares rose 7 percent but were nowhere near recovering their dramatic losses. The stock has halved in value since Friday’s open.\nShares in Evraz, a Russian steel producer which plunged 14.5 percent in the previous session, also recovered slightly to trade 1.1 percent higher.\nFTSE 250 miners Polymetal International and Ferrexpo gained 7.1 percent and 5.6 percent.\nLast week risky assets were hit by an escalation in tensions between the United States and China, with investors worried that the tariffs would leads to a full-blown trade war.\nHowever, a promise from Chinese President Xi Jinping to lower import tariffs on products such as cars helped soothe market nerves.\n“President Xi’s speech overnight appears to have struck the right tone, providing some relief for investors who have been buffeted by the recent war of words between Trump and China over trade,” said Rebecca O’Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor.\nElsewhere, shares in Burberry rose 1.4 percent, buoyed by a well-received first quarter sales update from French luxury peer LVMH.\nThe utilities and consumer staples stocks that investors had rushed into during market stress fell back. United Utilities , Severn Trent and National Grid lost between 1 and 2.9 percent.\nNational Grid said it expected low demand for electricity this summer.\nBritish greeting card retailer Card Factory topped the gainers among mid cap stocks, its shares jumping 12.6 percent after reporting a rise in annual sales and saying it plans to declare a special dividend in September.\nReporting by Kit Rees and Helen Reid Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:04:43.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
