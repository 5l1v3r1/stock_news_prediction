Such procedure is centralized by a broker that must be a member of Euroclear France. In order to comply with such condition, a sale facility procedure from the French market will be put in place on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “ HKEx ”) in order to enable GDS holders to sell their shares of the Company under their GDS (the “ Orderly Sale Procedure ”). The Company has appointed CACEIS Corporate Trust (the “ CACEIS ”) as the centralizing broker for such Orderly Sale Procedure. Brokerage costs of the sale under the Orderly Sale Procedure will be borne by the Company. GDS holders who wish to participate in the Orderly Sale Procedure must tender their GDSs between April 9, 2018 and April 20, 2018. Alternatively, the GDS holders may register the shares underlying their GDS, following the GDS Delisting, with a financial intermediary of their choice acting on HKEx. If a GDS holder does not follow any of the two alternatives as mentioned above, the shares underlying the GDS will still remain valid after the GDS Delisting, but at the time of future disposal, such shares must be sold through a broker on HKEx.\nFrench shareholders wishing to take advantage of the Orderly Sale Procedure should instruct their financial intermediary to deliver the number of GDS they hold to CACEIS pursuant to the Euronext notice published on April 5, 2018. The shares underlying the GDSs tendered will be sold on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on or around April 30, 2018 at the market price at the moment of the sale, after centralization of orders to sell by CACEIS. An applicable weighted average price will then be calculated by CACEIS. The proceeds from the sales, converted in Euros, will be distributed to eligible GDS holders once received by CACEIS.\nBy participating in the Orderly Sale Procedure the holders of GDS understand and accept the implicit risk that may arise because of possible fluctuation of the Company’s share price between the close of the voluntary sale facility, at which time their sell order will become irrevocable, and sale of the shares on the HKEx.\nIt is expected that all GDSs will be delisted from Euronext Paris, and then delisted from Euroclear France.\nIt is expected that the GDS Delisting will be completed on or around 4 May 2018.\nGDS Delisting will not have any impact on the listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on the HKEx and/or the Moscow Exchange.\nThe GDS Delisting shall allow the concentration of the Company’s public equity instrument trading liquidity into its ordinary shares traded in Hong Kong and Moscow.\nShareholders and investors are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the securities of the Company. Shareholders and investors are further advised to consider and rely only on information relating to the GDS Delisting which is released by the Company from time to time in accordance with the requirements of applicable laws, regulations and the Listing Rules.\nBy Order of the Board of Directors of\nUnited Company RUSAL Plc\nAby Wong Po Ying\nCompany Secretary 5 April 2018\nAs at the date of this announcement, the executive Directors are Mr. Vladislav Soloviev and Mr. Siegfried Wolf, the non-executive Directors are Mr. Oleg Deripaska, Mr. Maxim Sokov, Mr. Dmitry Afanasiev, Mr. Ivan Glasenberg, Mr. Maksim Goldman, Ms. Gulzhan Moldazhanova, Mr. Daniel Lesin Wolfe, Ms. Olga Mashkovskaya, Ms. Ekaterina Nikitina and Mr. Marco Musetti, and the independent non-executive Directors are Mr. Matthias Warnig (Chairman), Mr. Philip Lader, Dr. Elsie Leung Oi-sie, Mr. Mark Garber, Mr. Dmitry Vasiliev and Mr. Bernard Zonneveld.\nAll announcements and press releases published by the Company are available on its website under the links http://www.rusal.ru/en/investors/hkse/ , http://rusal.ru/investors/info/moex/ and http://www.rusal.ru/en/press-center/press-releases.aspx , respectively.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180404006432/en/\nUnited Company RUSAL Plc\nSource: United Company RUSAL Plc", "external_links": ["http://www.rusal.ru/en/investors/hkse/", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180404006432/en/", "http://rusal.ru/investors/info/moex/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusal.ru%2Fen%2Fpress-center%2Fpress-releases.aspx&esheet=51783865&newsitemid=20180404006432&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusal.ru%2Fen%2Fpress-center%2Fpress-releases.aspx&index=3&md5=3c00d225ac1338aa950e643f9dd5891e", "http://www.rusal.ru/en/press-center/press-releases.aspx", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Frusal.ru%2Finvestors%2Finfo%2Fmoex%2F&esheet=51783865&newsitemid=20180404006432&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Frusal.ru%2Finvestors%2Finfo%2Fmoex%2F&index=2&md5=9225fd4c66664ecb9fca101c83c21d08", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusal.ru%2Fen%2Finvestors%2Fhkse%2F&esheet=51783865&newsitemid=20180404006432&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusal.ru%2Fen%2Finvestors%2Fhkse%2F&index=1&md5=9eeded29bb6f12e2336560840828f13f"], "published": "2018-04-05T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
