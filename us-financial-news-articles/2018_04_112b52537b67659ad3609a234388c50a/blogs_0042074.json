That indictment charged him with offenses including conspiring to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent in connection with his lobbying for the Ukrainian government under pro- Russian former President Viktor Yanukovych.\nThe other indictment, in Alexandria, Virginia , charges Manafort with bank fraud and filing false tax returns, among other offenses. Manafort's lawyer is set to ask for a dismissal of those charges in May.\nBoth indictments arose from Mueller's investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election. Manafort is expected to have two separate criminal trials, with the Virginia one starting in July.\nThursday's hearing is the latest development stemming from a special counsel investigation that potentially could threaten Trump's presidency. While Manafort has pleaded not guilty, the special counsel's office has extracted guilty pleas from other former campaign figures including Manafort's former deputy and business partner Rick Gates.\nManafort is hoping to convince the judge that the Washington indictment should be tossed because the charges fall outside the scope of the investigation Rosenstein authorized.\nRosenstein's order directed Mueller to investigate whether Trump's presidential campaign colluded with Russia and gave Mueller the power to investigate any other matters that arise from the probe. Trump and Russia have denied any such collusion.\nIn a court filing, Downing said the scope of Rosenstein's order is \"tantamount to a blank check\" that Mueller \"has cashed, repeatedly.\" The charges, Downing added, are not related to Russia or potential coordination with the Trump campaign.\nDowning also said the charges did not arise from Mueller's work, noting the FBI previously investigated Manafort's Ukraine business dealings and closed out the probe in 2014 without pursuing charges.\nDowning presented similar claims in Manafort's civil lawsuit against Mueller and Rosenstein, aiming to convince Jackson to decide that Rosenstein's order naming Mueller was overly broad and violated Justice Department rules on special counsel appointments.\nDuring this month's hearing, Jackson tore into Downing's legal arguments, at one point exclaiming that she did not understand what was left of his case.\nMueller's team has filed evidence in the criminal case to show he had explicit authority from Rosenstein in August 2017 to probe Manafort's Ukraine dealings.\nShort of dismissing the entire indictment, Downing is also expected to ask Jackson to consider tossing a number of individual counts on more technical legal grounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:55:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
