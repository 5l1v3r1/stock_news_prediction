A spokesman for Samsung BioLogics could not be reached. Samsung Bioepis said it was not in a position to comment.\nReporting by Joyce Lee and Ju-min Park; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T18:08:57.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
