SOFR is based on the overnight Treasury repurchase agreement market, which trades around $800 billion in volume daily. \nIt will take time to develop liquidity in derivatives based on the rate. The CME Group will launch futures trades based on SOFR on May 7, while major dealers will enable swaps trading on the rate this year.
