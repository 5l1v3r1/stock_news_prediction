Highly priced and high-margin treatments for rare diseases have been a particular focus for such acquisitions. \nOn Monday, Swiss drugmaker Novartis ( NOVN.S ) agreed to acquire gene therapy specialist AveXis ( AVXS.O ) for $8.7 billion, following similar multibillion-dollar deals by the likes of France’s Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) and U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ). \nJapan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ), meanwhile, is considering a takeover bid for London-listed Shire ( SHP.L ). \nAlexion said its acquisition of Wilson was expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and that it intended to finance the acquisition through cash on hand. \nLazard is acting as financial adviser to Wilson, while Alexion is being advised by BofA Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and DNB Markets. \n($1 = 8.3000 Swedish crowns)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T09:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T09:55:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
