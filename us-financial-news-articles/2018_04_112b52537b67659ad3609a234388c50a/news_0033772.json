It’s the matter of markets finally having attention drawn away from the political (news).”\nAnalysts expect profit at the S&P 500 companies to rise 18.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 9:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.92 percent at 24,799.54. The S&P 500 gained 0.67 percent to 2,695.89 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.92 percent to 7,222.07.\nNine of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.3 percent gain in the consumer discretionary index.\nUnitedHealth jumped nearly 5 percent after the largest U.S. health insurer raised its earnings forecast and posted results that beat Wall Street estimates.\nJ&J fell 0.4 percent, reversing course from premarket after the company reported a better-than-expected profit and raised its full-year sales forecast.\nThe earnings season has helped take away some focus from geopolitical and trade concerns, which have roiled the markets in recent months.\nShares of automakers Fiat Chrysler, General Motors and Ford rose between 0.2 percent and 3 percent after China said it was scrapping a limit on foreign ownership of automotive ventures.\nA U.S.-led attack on Syria over the weekend has so far not prompted any military retaliation from Russia, easing fears over the conflict escalating.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.46-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq, for a 2.25-to-1 ratio.
