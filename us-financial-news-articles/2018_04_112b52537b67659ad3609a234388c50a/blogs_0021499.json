Citing six current and former AMI employees, The New Yorker reported that Sajudin knew the names of the alleged mistress and the child.\nThe Associated Press reported that the woman was an employee at Trump World Tower, located near the United Nations building in Manhattan.\nshow chapters Stocks see a stormy session as FBI raids Michael Cohen's office 7:06 PM ET Mon, 9 April 2018 | 05:00 The AP said the woman emphatically denied that she ever had an affair with Trump. She also told the news organization that she didn't know that AMI had paid Sajudin and pursued the tip. \"This is all fake,\" the woman told AP. \"I think they lost their money.\"\nSince taking office, Trump has been embroiled in multiple allegations of infidelity. The Wall Street Journal first reported that Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid porn star Stormy Daniels $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election for silence over an alleged tryst with Trump years earlier. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is now suing Trump and Cohen to void her agreement.\nLawyers for Cohen did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment, nor did representatives for the Trump Organization, the White House and AMI.\nshow chapters Stormy Daniels goes on the record about Trump 9:19 AM ET Mon, 26 March 2018 | 01:29 Sajudin's alleged deal is not the first reported instance that AMI had agreed to bury a negative story about Trump. In March, former Playboy model Karen McDougal came forward with a lawsuit against AMI itself to void her own alleged $150,000 exclusivity deal .\nCohen told The Associated Press that he had discussed the rumor with the National Enquirer, although he denied knowledge of the payment to Sajudin.\nOn Monday, FBI agents seized records relating to the payment that Cohen made to Daniels shortly before Election Day 2016, among other materials relating to possible settlements and agreements related to Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T16:54:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
