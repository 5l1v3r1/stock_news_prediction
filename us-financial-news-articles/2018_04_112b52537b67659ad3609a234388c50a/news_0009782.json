The Flyers could have clinched a playoff spot Thursday had Boston beaten Florida, but the Panthers beat the Bruins, 3-2.\nShayne Gostisbehere recorded a pair of assists for the Flyers.\nFlyers goaltender Brian Elliott, who had been out just shy of two months after undergoing core muscle surgery, had 19 saves in his shaky return.\nThe Flyers were 13-7-5 without Elliott and had three other goaltenders see action - Alex Lyon, Petr Mrazek and Michal Neuvirth.\nJordan Staal, Sebastian Aho and Klas Dahlbeck each scored one goal each for the Hurricanes.\nCarolina goaltender Scott Darling stopped 30 shots.\nGiroux put the Flyers ahead 3-2 with his 31st goal of the season at 10:18 of the third period. The captain fired a nasty wrist shot into the corner of the net for the go-ahead goal, setting a career-high.\nGiroux also has a 13-game home point streak.\nThe lead was short-lived as the Hurricanes tied the game at 3 when Staal scored at 13:41, finishing a pass from Justin Williams.\nIn this wild third period, the Flyers took the lead again, 4-3, with a goal by Voracek, his 20th of the season at 14:15.\nThe Hurricanes pulled Darling for the final minute but couldn’t capitalize.\nDespite being sluggish for much of the second, the Flyers tied the game at 2 when Provorov notched his 16th goal of the season at 14:56. The rookie defenseman had two shots and pushed the puck into the back of the net on second effort.\nProvorov’s goal seemed to ignite the Flyers and the game wound up 2-2 at the end of the second.\nDahlbeck and Aho scored 1:07 apart late in the first, which was sandwiched around a goal by Philadelphia’s Raffl, and the Hurricanes led 2-1.\nDahlbeck scored at 13:45, Raffl equalized at 14:38 and Aho put Carolina ahead 2-1 at 14:52.\nThe Flyers outshot the Hurricanes 15-7 but still trailed by a goal heading into the locker room.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:54:58.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
