He signaled repeatedly that he had learned the lesson of the recent data-breach scandals that have been dogging the company. And yet, when the discussion turned to details about how industrywide rules might help protect user data, he often couched his willingness to embrace new rules with warnings about poor regulation leading to unintended consequences. \nIn response to a question from \nRep. Fred Upton \n(R., Mich.), Mr. Zuckerberg said he thought it was “inevitable that there will need to be some regulation.” Then he immediately warned against going too far. “You have to be careful about what regulations you put in place,” he said. \nBig internet companies stopped short of endorsing Mr. Zuckerberg’s qualified support for more privacy regulation in his testimony this week. Michael Beckerman, president of the Internet Association, a trade group, said in a statement late Tuesday that the industry’s leading companies are “committed to giving Americans the information and tools they need to make informed choices about their information online,” and pledge to “continue to work with lawmakers” to protect consumers. \nHe added, however, that the internet industry already “complies with a host of laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world.” He emphasized that the internet sector is a bright spot for the U.S. economy and “a great American export.” \nFollowing Wednesday’s hearing, House Commerce Chairman Greg Walden (R., Ore.) described it as “a wake-up call for Silicon Valley and the tech community that if you let these things get out of hand, having grown up in a very lightly regulated environment, you could end up with a lot more regulation than you seek.” \nHe added: “I don’t want to rush into regulation minutes after having the first hearing of this magnitude. But certainly if they can’t clean up their act, we’ll clean it up for them.” ​He said lawmakers would consider calling other tech CEOs. \nLegislators, over the two days of crowded hearings, voiced their anger at Facebook’s approach to privacy, but offered few specifics of what type of oversight would be appropriate, as some struggled with the complexities of data-privacy policy. \nRep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat representing part of Silicon Valley, asked Mr. Zuckerberg several tough questions concerning the Cambridge Analytica incident, in which Facebook users’ personal data was sold for political purposes, and she repeatedly interrupted his answers. \nShe asked whether Facebook has “a moral responsibility” to help protect U.S. democratic institutions. At another point she asked whether Mr. Zuckerberg was “willing to change your business model in the interest of protecting individual privacy.” Unable to finish his answer given the time pressures, he eventually promised to follow up in writing. \nFor Mr. Zuckerberg, the two days represented a delicate balancing act, in which he sought to deflect politicians tapping into public ire over recent scandals, without doing anything to alter the fundamental business model that has made the company one of the most valuable in the world and the 33-year-old CEO one of the richest people in the world. \n“It’s not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure those connections are positive,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in one of his more impassioned moments. “It’s not enough to just give people a voice, we have to make sure people aren’t using it to hurt people or spread misinformation. It’s not enough to give people control of their information, we have to make sure developers they’ve given it to are protecting it too.” \n“It will take some time to work through all of the changes we need to make, but I’m committed to getting it right,” he added. Ultimately, however, Mr. Zuckerberg offered to change little about how Facebook makes money—by selling ad slots and offering targeted ad products. \nThe stock market liked his performance, which provided a floor to recent declines over data privacy concerns. Shares in the company rose 5.5% over the two days of testimony. \nMr. Zuckerberg, who sipped orange juice during the hearing on Wednesday, frequently faced tougher questioning than he had the day before. House Republicans posed numerous questions about alleged censorship of conservative viewpoints on the platform. \nCathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, for example, questioned why Facebook temporarily rejected an image from a Catholic university in Ohio showing Jesus being crucified. “It sounds like we made a mistake there, and I apologize for that,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. \nHe cautioned lawmakers not to extrapolate systemic bias from a few examples, and added that Facebook also receives complaints about bias against liberal points of view. \nRep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, among others, questioned whether Facebook had given special access to the 2012 Obama campaign, as some Obama campaign aides have suggested. Mr. Zuckerberg assured lawmakers repeatedly that the firm treats all campaigns equally. \nSeveral lawmakers criticized Facebook for making it easy for users to buy opioids. The federal government recently called on Facebook and other companies to better police online sales of illegal opioids, said Rep. David McKinley (R., W.Va.). \nMr. Zuckerberg paused and said Facebook needs to do more to police certain types of content. He also reiterated his belief in the importance of artificial intelligence. “The sheer volume of content on Facebook means no amount of people can vet all content on Facebook,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. \nRep. Jan Schakowsky (D., Ill.) asked if other firms besides Cambridge Analytica might have purchased the data from a researcher. “I don’t believe it was a large number,” Mr. Zuckerberg said, but he added that Facebook would find out more from its coming audits. \nMr. Zuckerberg also disclosed that his own personal data was improperly sold to Cambridge Analytica by a developer. The company said last week data about 87 million users was accessed, but didn’t say whether Mr. Zuckerberg was affected. \nSome in Washington found the two days ultimately unsatisfying. One Senate staffer said with a few exceptions, “members were clearly not well-informed about past Facebook privacy abuses, or even on Facebook’s core business model” after Tuesday’s hearing. \nThe aide termed it “a missed opportunity to educate the public on Facebook’s exploitative business practices and frame the debate in a way conducive to passage of data protection legislation.” \nWrite to John D.
