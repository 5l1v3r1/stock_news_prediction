Intel's stock dropped sharply on Monday after Bloomberg reported that Apple would ditch Intel chips for an in-house model on Mac computers. Its shares fell as much as 9 percent after the report and then regained ground, ending the day down 6 percent. \n\"The market is over reacting to Apple's announcement for using an internally developed CPU for its Mac systems as early as 2020,\" analyst Kevin Cassidy wrote in a note to clients entitled \"Potential Apple Move Not a Major Threat to Intel\" on Monday. \"According to IDC, Apple had 7.3% traditional PC unit market share in 4Q17.\" \nHe recommended investors buy Intel shares on Monday's weakness. \nCassidy reaffirmed his $53 price target for Intel shares. \nHe estimated Apple generated only 4 percent of Intel's revenue last year and less than 1 percent of its profits. \n\"We do not expect any other PC manufacturers will consider designing its own CPUs,\" he wrote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T23:22:13.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
