REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Tech stocks were a drag on all three major U.S. indexes ahead of a big week of earnings for the sector. Chipmaker shares fell after the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, cut its full-year revenue target due to softer demand for smartphones.\nYields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose to their highest level since January 2014 amid concerns over the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation.\nWhile rising yields can lead investors away from equities, the robust earnings season gave reason for confidence.\n“Earnings continue to be healthy and in many respects exceed market expectations. It continues to suggest an overall strength in the economy, and we’re seeing more and more above-trend growth,” said Steven Baffico, chief executive officer at Four Wood Capital Partners in New York.\n“One good quarter does not a year make, but I think you can look at overall strength in earnings as a good leading indicator for the equity market,” said Baffico.\nAnalysts expect earnings growth at S&P 500 companies of nearly 20 percent in the first quarter, the strongest showing in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nQuarterly results are expected this week from 181 S&P 500 companies, including technology heavy-hitters Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc and Intel Corp.
