Our financial results were positively impacted by the two company-owned restaurants that we purchased in December 2016 through our acquisition of Seediv.

Kasturi, President and Chief Financial Officer of ARC Group. \"These charges collectively accounted for more than $470,000. With these charges added back, our adjusted income from operations was $388,591. Our cash flows were similarly very strong this year, as we generated $248,345 in positive cash flow from operating activities.\"\n2017 Highlights and Outlook\nThe Company had several notable achievements during 2017, including the following:\nSeenu G. Kasturi was appointed as the Company's President, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors.

We intend to continue strengthening and growing our legacy Dick's Wings brand as well as acquiring financial interests in leading restaurant brands that will offer us product and geographic diversification. We also intend to continue to focus on our operational efficiencies and formalizing best practices throughout our franchise.
