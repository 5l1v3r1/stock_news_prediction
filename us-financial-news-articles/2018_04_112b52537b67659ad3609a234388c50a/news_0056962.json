The group said high demand for electromechanical locks and for access control systems boosted sales.\nJan Molin, who stepped down in March after 12 years as CEO, in February predicted core group sales growth in the first half of 2018 above the 4 percent achieved a year earlier.\nBefore his time at Metso, new CEO Delvaux headed the compressor technique business at Sweden’s Atlas Copco , where both Molin and Assa Abloy’s Chairman Lars Renstrom held executive positions earlier in their careers.
