While cattle losses were devastating for affected ranchers, overall livestock prices should not be affected, said economists and state officials.\nRod Hall, Oklahoma state veterinarian, put preliminary cattle deaths at roughly 1,100 head and expects that number could eventually climb to around 2,000.\n“We’ll never know the exact number and people are also still finding dead animals,” Hall said in an interview, adding that recent rains helped contain most of the blazes.\nSome cattle died directly from the fires while others were later euthanized due to injuries or smoke inhalation, he said.\nMany Oklahoma pastures had not received adequate moisture for more than 200 days. Animals in these areas were caught off-guard when flames were fanned by winds of up to 60 miles per hour (97 km per hour).\nSome of the acres destroyed were much-needed grazing land for cattle, state officials said.\nThe ranchers’ most immediate need is hay to feed their cattle, said Michael Kelsey, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Cattlemen’s Association.\nHay inventories were already low in the wake of last year’s wildfires and an unusually long, cold and dry winter, he said.\nReporting by Theopolis Waters in Chicago; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T20:36:44.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
