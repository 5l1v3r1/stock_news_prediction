The company told TechCrunch that the ability to retract Zuckerberg's messages was instituted for legal compliance after Sony Pictures' emails were hacked in 2014. \nFacebook didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nCNBC recently explained how to download all of your private data from Facebook , and that data includes old chat messages that you might have exchanged with other users on Facebook. It typically appears as a two-way conversation with messages from both parties. In this instance, TechCrunch said that Zuckerberg's messages don't appear at all, even in the downloaded logs.\nZuckerberg has previously had access to features that weren't available to some users. Until last year, other users on Facebook weren't able to block him, for example. He was also scrutinized for comments he made while at Harvard, when he messaged a friend that users who trusted him with their data were \"dumb f****.\" \nBut Facebook's treatment of user data has seen a fresh wave of criticism as millions of consumers have been told they can assume some personal data has been scraped from their profiles. \nRead the full TechCrunch story here. \n-- Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T18:00:06.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
