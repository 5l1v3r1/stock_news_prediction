Approximately half of those could have some delay as a result of the system outage,” Eurocontrol said. \nIt said the issue had been identified but it would take until late on Tuesday evening for normal operations to resume. \n“(The) contingency plan will be maintained for the coming few hours until we are certain that sufficient data is in the system to allow it to operate completely correctly,” it added. \nThe outage did not affect air traffic control and there were no safety implications, Eurocontrol said. \nAirports including Schiphol, Brussels and Helsinki also warned travellers that delays could occur.
