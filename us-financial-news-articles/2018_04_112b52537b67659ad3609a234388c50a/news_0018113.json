REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo \nOf the 82 million people living in Germany, roughly one in every eight is a foreign national, the office said. \nMore than 1.6 million people seeking asylum, mainly from Middle Eastern and African countries, have entered Germany since 2014, weakening Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives who lost voters to a far-right party in an election last year. \nBut the Statistics Office said that the rise in the number of foreigners living in Germany was mainly because of an influx of people from other EU states, especially from eastern members that have joined the bloc since 2004. \nThe number of people from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia rose by 12.5 percent year on year, the office said. \nThis meant that almost half of the 10.6 million foreigners who lived in Germany last year stem from EU countries. \nCitizens of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq make up 11.2 percent of the total number of foreigners. \nAn economic upswing in Germany may be one factor behind the record figure. \nEurope’s largest economy is enjoying a record budget surplus and significant tax revenue. A consumer-led upswing is being fuelled by falling unemployment, inflation-beating pay rises and low borrowing costs.
