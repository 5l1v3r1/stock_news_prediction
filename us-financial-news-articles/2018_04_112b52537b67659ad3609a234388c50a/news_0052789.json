When Yahoo eventually disclosed the data breach in 2016, the company was in the final stages of being sold to Verizon Communications.\n“Yahoo’s failure to have controls and procedures in place to assess its cyber-disclosure obligations ended up leaving its investors totally in the dark about a massive data breach,” the SEC’s San Francisco Regional Director Jina Choi said in a statement. “Public companies should have controls and procedures in place to properly evaluate cyber incidents and disclose material information to investors.”\nAlthough Yahoo filed multiple quarterly and annual reports following the 2014 data breach, the company never mentioned it and instead only included warnings about the possible negative impact from a data breach if one or several were to occur, the SEC said.\nFrom the SEC:\nFinally, the SEC’s order finds that Yahoo failed to maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that reports from Yahoo’s information security team concerning cyber breaches, or the risk of such breaches, were properly and timely assessed for potential disclosure.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nAltaba was officially created in the summer of 2017 when Verizon completed its $4.5 billion purchase of Yahoo’s core internet business.
