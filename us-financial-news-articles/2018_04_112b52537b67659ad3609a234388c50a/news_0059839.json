The distribution is payable on May 11, 2018, to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 7, 2018.\nRecent Commercial Developments\nDuring March and April 2018, the initial customer of the Stroud terminal (“Stroud customer”), an investment grade multi-national energy company, secured the remaining available capacity at the Stroud terminal from USD Marketing LLC for periods beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and ending in June 2019 and January 2020, pursuant to the Marketing Services Agreement established with the Partnership at the time of the Stroud acquisition.\nSimilarly, the Partnership obtained origination capacity from customers of the Hardisty terminal and immediately contracted with the Stroud customer for this capacity at the same economic terms as the initial customer agreements. Consistent with the new agreements for destination capacity at the Stroud terminal, the Hardisty origination capacity was contracted for corresponding periods beginning in the second quarter of 2018 and ending in June 2019 and January 2020 (the later representing a seven month extension over the original Hardisty contract term). As a result, the Stroud customer increased its contracted position from approximately 25% to nearly half of the existing capacity at the Hardisty terminal.\nThe terminalling services agreements related to the portion of the Stroud customer’s origination and destination capacity through June 2019 contemplate a deadline of August 31, 2018, to extend the terms of these agreements at both the Hardisty and Stroud terminals.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Date and Conference Call Information\nThe Partnership plans to report first quarter 2018 financial and operating results after market close on Monday, May 7, 2018.
