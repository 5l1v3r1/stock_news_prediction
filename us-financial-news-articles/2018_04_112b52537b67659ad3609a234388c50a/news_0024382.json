REUTERS/Luke MacGregor \nThe owner of ale brands such as Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale said weather over the last 12 weeks impacted trading. \nThe weather system dubbed “the Beast from the East” brought rare snow and sub-zero temperatures to much of Britain in late February and early March bringing normal life to a standstill. \nOn an underlying basis, excluding the impact of snow, comparable sales in the year-to-date were 1.2 lower, Greene King said.
