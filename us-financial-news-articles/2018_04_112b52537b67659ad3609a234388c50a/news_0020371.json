The court ordered her release on Thursday. \nEfimova was employed for three months in 2016 by the Maltese-registered Pilatus Bank [RIC:RIC:PILAT.UL]. The journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, named her as the source of internal bank documents which Galizia said indicated that Michelle Muscat, wife of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat, owned a secret company in Panama. \nJoseph Muscat and his wife have denied the accusations. \nA group of 36 European parliament members signed a letter this month calling for Efimova not to be extradited to Malta. \nCaruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017. Three men have been charged with killing her but police have yet to give motive. \nPilatus Bank has accused Efimova of embezzlement. Efimova denies all charges and has counter-sued the bank for failing to pay her salary.
