REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo “It became just a huge impasse,” the band’s drummer and co-founder Mick Fleetwood said on “CBS This Morning.” “We hit a brick wall where we decided we had to part company.”\nThe British-American band behind 1970s hits “Go Your Own Way” and “Don’t Stop,” said two weeks ago they would tour without the 68-year-old songwriter and guitarist, but declined to give a reason.\nFleetwood, 70, refused to say whether Buckingham had been fired.\n“We don’t use that word because I think it’s ugly and it’s not a question of that,” Fleetwood said.\n“But it’s like a marriage that came to an end and there are reasons why and as a band, we needed to move on and we have,” he added.\nFILE PHOTO: Honorees Stevie Nicks, Mick Fleetwood, and Lindsey Buckingham of the group Fleetwood Mac perform during the 2018 MusiCares Person of the Year show honoring Fleetwood Mac at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 26, 2018. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Buckingham has not commented on the split.\nFleetwood Mac, which first formed in 1967, has been plagued by behind-the-scenes romantic and creative tensions among its members as well as a shifting lineup over the years. But Buckingham joined Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and John McVie for a 2014 reunion tour and a MusicCares ceremony in New York in January.\nNicks said Buckingham did not want to commit to the 52-date, six-month-long tour the band announced on Wednesday.\n“When you’re in a band, it’s a team. I have a solo career and I love my solo career and I’m the boss,” Nicks said. “But I’m not the boss in this band.”\nFleetwood Mac’s tour of the United States and Canada begins on Oct. 3, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and ends in Philadelphia in April 2019. The band also said it had added former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell and Crowded House guitarist and singer Neil Finn to the tour.\nReporting by Eric Kelsey, editing by G Crosse\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T00:08:17.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
