Golden State wound up with its 15th consecutive victory over Phoenix.\nThompson, who is in contention for the NBA’s 3-point-shooting-percentage title, connected on 6 of 13 from 3-point range to account for a majority of his point total.\nThe 30-point game was Thompson’s third of the season, his first since he put up a season-high 38 at Chicago on Jan. 17.\nKevin Durant had 17 points, Draymond Green and Quinn Cook 14 apiece, JaVale McGee 11 and Shaun Livingston 10 for the Warriors, who await the results from a crowded playoff race among the fourth through eighth seeds in the West to determine their first-round postseason opponent.\nGolden State can have a hand in who lands where in the West when it wraps up the regular season at fourth-place Utah on Tuesday night.\nBefore they take the court against the Jazz, the Warriors must make a decision on Cook, a two-way player who is not yet eligible to play in the postseason.\nThe Warriors reportedly have entered into negotiations with Duke product on a full-season or long-term deal, which is required in order for Cook to be eligible for postseason play.\nThe deadline for such a contract is Tuesday.\nCook has been starting in place of injured Stephen Curry, who is not expected back for at least the first week of the playoffs.\nDanuel House Jr. had 22 points to pace the Suns, who clinched the worst record in the NBA with a 61st loss.\nAlex Len had 16 points, Tyler Ulis 15, Dragan Bender 14 and Jared Dudley 11 for Phoenix, which wraps up its season Tuesday at Dallas.\nBender was the game’s leading rebounder with 14, while Len (10 rebounds) and Ulis (game-high 10 assists) also completed double-doubles.\nDurant handed out nine assists.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T11:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:40:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
