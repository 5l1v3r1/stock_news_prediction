It was Canha’s third home run of the season. Jed Lowrie and Matt Olson hit RBI doubles in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively, for Oakland. That was enough for Triggs (2-0) and the A’s bullpen.\nTriggs bounced back from a rough performance his last time out. He gave up six runs in a 1 1/3 innings in a loss to the Chicago White Sox but was strong against the Rangers.\nRelievers Ryan Dull, Blake Treinen and Lou Trivino and Santiago Casilla held the lead for the A’s. The scoreless ninth inning gave Casilla his first save of the season. He got Jurickson Profar, Robinson Chirinos and Ronald Guzman on fly balls.\nAdrian Beltre drove in both runs for the Rangers. His RBI single in the eighth inning scored Shin-Soo Choo and brought Texas back within 3-2, but Beltre also injured his left hamstring in the inning, and the Rangers weren’t sure of his status for Wednesday’s game.\n“We’ll continue to evaluate it and see where we are tomorrow,” manager Jeff Banister said.\nMarcus Semien, who hit the go-ahead home run in the ninth inning of Oakland’s win in Monday’s series opener, had a hit and scored a run Tuesday. Matt Chapman also had a hit and scored a run for the A’s.\nHamels (1-4) allowed two runs on five hits in 6 1/3 innings, with five strikeouts and two walks. He lost his fourth straight decision at home and took his fourth loss of the season before the end of April for the first time in his career.\nTexas right-hander Doug Fister is set to come off the disabled list and start in Wednesday’s series finale. Fister has been recovering from a right hip strain. The A’s will counter with right-hander Kendal Graveman.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:32:41.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
