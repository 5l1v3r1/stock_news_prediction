The online resource and its affiliated websites were seized last week by U.S. federal law enforcement authorities and taken off the internet.\nFerrer agreed to permanently shut the website as part of his plea deal.\nReporting by David Schwartz in Phoenix; Writing by Gina Cherelus in New York and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Dan Grebler and Richard Chang\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T02:17:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
