But to really be able to (do that), it has to be not just (fundraising) in Malaysia but internationally,” he said in a group interview on Wednesday.\nHe said Malaysia has attracted foreign companies to issue sukuk, but they were predominantly in ringgit and largely domestically bought.\nMohieddine said there should be more transactions in international currencies like the U.S. dollar, and a currency regime or some central bank support that facilitates that.\n“If you want to have a more global role, you need to be able to cater to demand that’s outside of Malaysia,” he said.\n“That happens when the currency is a little more freely convertible and when you have issues in different currencies.”\nMohieddine said the Chinese interest in sukuk is nascent but the appetite for sukuk would likely start with big issuers like Chinese real estate and financial services companies.\n“If the sukuk market remains healthy and policy makers take steps to make the Malaysian market more international, and the Chinese look to diversify their source of funding ... (it’s) feasible, arguably, to happen in the next few years,” he said.\nFranklin Templeton Investments projects global sukuk growth at 15-20 percent this year on the back of stable oil prices, better growth outlook in markets that issue sukuks and sustained demand for Islamic finance.
