We resumed selling the guaranteed portion of these loans into the secondary market and recorded a net gain on the sale totaling $3,054,000 during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $192,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1,636,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Our governmental guaranteed lending division originated loans of $81 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. With $61 million in loans held for sale as of March 31, 2018, we are like-wise well positioned for the second quarter of 2018.

The increase in noninterest income was primarily attributable to increased sales volume to the secondary market as the Company unwound a portion of its “originate and hold” strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other notable changes in the noninterest income category, as compared to the linked quarter, are an increase in income from Windsor due to an increase in secondary market fees; a reduction in mortgage revenue primarily due to seasonal effects on new originations; and a decrease in other noninterest income as the fourth quarter 2017 was elevated due to a gain on the sale of fixed assets at West Town Bank & Trust.\nIn comparison to the prior year, comparative quarter noninterest income increased $965,000, or 27% as compared to the first quarter 2017 primarily due to a $1,418,000, or 87%, increase in governmental lending revenue. Mortgage revenue was down $1,100,000, or 71%, from the first quarter 2017 due to the Company’s shift away from a national mortgage operation that was completed in mid-year 2017. Income earned from the Company’s investment in Windsor totaled $564,000 for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $205,000 for the same period last year. This $359,000 or 175% increase is due to the timing of the Company’s investment which was made in mid-February 2017 as well as increased secondary market fees earned by Windsor for the first quarter of 2018. Service charge revenue increased $202,000 or 1,188% as compared to the first quarter of 2017 due to the inclusion of Sound Bank in the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal noninterest expense was $5,795,000 for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $102,000, or 2%, from the $5,897,000 for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2017. The only notable increase was communication expense which increased $47,000, or 25%, due to the integration of the two banks’ networks. Notable decreases include professional services declining $39,000, or 12%, due to lower litigation and audit costs; advertising costs decreasing $55,000, or 50%, due to elevated promotional expenses in the fourth quarter 2017; and transaction-related expenses decreasing $46,000, or 77%, due to the Sound Bank transaction costs being primarily completed by December 31, 2017.\nTotal noninterest expense increased $1,373,000, or 31%, from the $4,422,000 recorded in the first quarter 2017. The increases are primarily related to first quarter 2018 activity for Sound Bank. The only decreases were advertising and transaction-related costs.\nSelected Consolidated Balance Sheet Data Dollars in thousands; unaudited Ending Balance 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Portfolio loans: Originated loans $ 265,887 $ 242,744 $ 206,133 $ 200,863 $ 175,862 Acquired loans, net 124,919 135,808 144,994 0 0 Allowance for loan losses (3,791 ) (3,427 ) (2,841 ) (2,580 ) (2,537 ) Portfolio loans, net 387,015 375,125 348,286 198,283 173,325 Loans held for sale 61,286 66,706 21,023 30,166 45,266 Investment securities and deposits 44,470 48,080 64,970 25,953 26,807 Total interest-earning assets 492,771 489,911 433,896 254,402 245,398 Loan servicing rights 4,969 5,237 5,568 5,721 5,624 Goodwill 7,016 7,016 7,016 0 0 Other intangible assets, net 2,102 2,272 2,450 0 0 Total assets 549,427 544,134 487,904 283,628 275,343 Deposits Noninterest bearing deposits $ 86,561 $ 84,178 $ 70,984 $ 24,141 $ 22,926 Interest-bearing deposits 298,711 308,556 317,714 201,072 201,179 Total deposits 385,272 392,734 388,698 225,213 224,105 Borrowings 87,814 78,903 19,309 22,599 16,000 Total fundings 473,086 471,637 408,007 247,812 240,105 Shareholders’ equity: Preferred equity $ 0 $ 0 $ 7,570 $ 500 $ 500 Common equity 47,337 47,300 39,485 13,218 13,159 Retained earnings 20,765 18,284 17,895 16,949 16,434 Accumulated other comprehensive income (134 ) (4 ) 28 50 42 Total shareholders’ equity $ 67,968 $ 65,580 $ 64,978 $ 30,717 $ 30,135 Total assets were $549,427,000, an increase of $5,293,000 or 1% as compared to total assets of $544,134,000 at December 31, 2017.

Loans held for sale decreased $5,420,000 or 8% to $61,286,000 as compared to $66,706,000 at December 31, 2017. The decreases in loans held for sale is primarily attributable to the partial unwinding of the “originate and hold” strategy implemented in the fourth quarter of 2017 offset by new originations totaling $81 million during the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal deposits were $385,272,000 at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $7,462,000, or 2%, as compared to total deposits of $392,734,000 at December 31, 2017. The deposit account balance reductions were balance fluctuations on consumer interest-bearing deposit products. Borrowings increased $8,911,000, or 11%, as compared to the linked quarter to offset the deposit reductions.\nTotal shareholders’ equity was $67,968,000 at March 31, 2018, an increase of $2,388,000 or 4% as compared to $65,580,000 at December 31, 2017.

The reduction is due to $9,139,000 in net principal payments and $1,855,000 in renewals which moved to the originated category at the time of renewal. The PCI loan pool decreased $93,000 during the first quarter due to net principal payments.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company’s nonperforming assets to total assets ratio decreased 9 basis points during the first quarter of 2018 from 1.35% at December 31, 2017 to 1.26% at March 31, 2018. Excluding acquired loans, nonperforming assets to total loans and OREO declined 25 basis points, from 2.56% at December 31, 2017 to 2.31% at March 31, 2018. The reduction is related to the net charge-offs during the quarter and a decline in nonaccrual balances. In comparison to the prior year, the Company’s nonperforming assets to total loans and OREOs ratio increased 5 basis points from 2.26% at March 31, 2017.\nThe Company recorded a $469,000 provision for loan losses during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to a provision of $1,129,000 in the fourth quarter 2017 and $276,000 in first quarter 2017. The decreased provision expense compared to the fourth quarter 2017 is primarily due to a $438,000 decrease in net charge-offs in comparison to the fourth quarter 2017. Excluding acquired loans, the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total non-acquired loans decreased 1 basis point from one year earlier, from 1.44% at March 31, 2017, to 1.43% at March 31, 2018.\nDollars in thousands Ending Balance 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Nonaccrual loans – non-acquired $ 5,910 $ 6,218 $ 6,803 $ 6,967 $ 3,717 Nonaccrual loans – acquired 182 413 0 0 0 OREO – non-acquired 54 0 0 270 270 OREO – acquired 0 0 0 0 0 90 days past due – non-acquired 186 0 0 0 0 90 days past due – acquired 594 697 1,396 0 0 Total nonperforming assets 6,926 7,328 8,199 7,237 3,987 Total nonperforming assets – non-acquired 6,150 6,218 6,803 7,237 3,987 Net charge-offs, QTD $ 105 $ 543 $ 230 $ 238 $ 58 Annualized net charge-offs to total average portfolio loans 0.09% 0.54% 0.34% 0.43% 0.10% Ratio of total nonperforming assets to total assets 1.26% 1.35% 1.68% 2.55% 1.45% Ratio of total nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.78% 1.95% 2.35% 3.51% 2.14% Ratio of total allowance for loan losses to total portfolio loans 0.97% 0.91% 0.81% 1.28% 1.44% Excluding acquired (Non-GAAP) Ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and OREO 2.31% 2.56% 3.30% 3.60% 2.26% Ratio of nonperforming loans to loans 2.29% 2.56% 3.30% 3.47% 2.11% Ratio of allowance for loan losses to loans 1.43% 1.41% 1.38% 1.28% 1.44%\nNet Interest Income and Margin\n(Includes Sound Bank as of 9/1/2017) Dollars in thousands Three Months Ended Year-to-Date 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 3/31/18 3/31/17 Quarterly average balances: Loans $ 446,857 $ 400,324 $ 273,225 $ 222,099 $ 226,218 $ 446,857 $ 226,218 Investment securities 11,353 7,346 6,944 4,778 4,954 11,353 4,954 Interest-bearing balances and other 24,803 37,640 27,171 16,482 15,384 24,803 15,384 Total interest-earning assets 483,013 445,310 307,340 243,359 246,556 483,013 246,556 Noninterest deposits 82,849 75,707 40,028 21,089 22,576 82,849 22,576 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest bearing deposits 302,119 312,155 239,475 201,027 199,399 302,119 199,399 Borrowed funds 76,422 31,574 13,748 15,680 16,249 76,422 16,249 Total interest-bearing liabilities 378,541 343,729 253,223 216,707 215,648 378,541 215,648 Total assets 536,185 495,958 343,328 274,137 272,015 536,185 272,015 Common shareholders’ equity 67,013 60,432 40,848 29,629 28,334 67,013 28,334 Tangible common equity 57,799 50,795 37,617 29,629 28,334 57,799 28,334\nDollars in thousands Three Months Ended Year-to-Date 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 3/31/18 3/31/17 Interest Income/Expense: Loans $ 6,036 $ 6,061 $ 4,223 $ 3,288 $ 3,373 $ 6,036 $ 3,373 Investment securities, tax 64 39 47 29 29 64 29 Interest-bearing balances and other 120 117 95 49 44 120 44 Total interest income 6,220 6,217 4,365 3,366 3,446 6,220 3,446 Deposits 771 791 712 684 677 771 677 Borrowings 378 192 102 92 56 378 56 Total interest expense 1,149 983 814 776 733 1,149 733 Net interest income $ 5,071 $ 5,234 $ 3,551 $ 2,590 $ 2,713 $ 5,071 $ 2,713 Average Yields and Costs: Loans 5.48% 6.01% 6.13% 5.94% 6.05% 5.48% 6.05% Investment securities 2.25% 2.12% 2.71% 2.43% 2.34% 2.25% 2.34% Interest-bearing balances and other 1.96% 1.23% 1.39% 1.19% 1.16% 1.96% 1.16% Total interest-earning assets 5.22% 5.54% 5.63% 5.55% 5.67% 5.22% 5.67% Total interest-bearing deposits 1.03% 1.01% 1.18% 1.36% 1.38% 1.03% 1.38% Borrowed funds 2.01% 2.41% 2.94% 2.35% 1.40% 2.01% 1.40% Total interest-bearing liabilities 1.23% 1.13% 1.28% 1.44% 1.38% 1.23% 1.38% Cost of funds 1.01% 0.93% 1.10% 1.31% 1.25% 1.01% 1.25% Net interest margin 4.26% 4.66% 4.58% 4.27% 4.46% 4.26% 4.46% Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5,071,000, a decrease from $5,234,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWest Town Bank & Trust contributed $3,256,000 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $3,453,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $197,000 or 6%. The decrease is due to elevated funding costs and decreased accretion income on early loan payoffs. Sound Bank contributed $1,925,000 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $1,896,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $29,000 or 2%. Interest expense at the holding company totaled $111,000 for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $115,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin was 4.26% for the first quarter of 2018, a 40 basis point decrease as compared to 4.66% for the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWest Town Bank & Trust net interest margin was 4.30% for the first quarter 2018, as compared to 5.03% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The drivers for the decrease include 10 basis point lower start rates for new government guaranteed lending originations specifically in the solar farm loans as compared to our seasoned solar farm loan portfolio; increased overnight borrowing costs due to recent rate hikes; and lower prepayments in government lending. Sound Bank net interest margin was 4.45% for the first quarter 2018, as compared to 4.35% for the fourth quarter. The primary increase in the margin was the purchase of $7.7 million of investment securities with excess cash. Excluding accretion of the loan and deposit fair value marks, the Sound Bank net interest margin was 3.95% for the first quarter 2018, as compared to 3.82% for the fourth quarter of 2017. On a consolidated basis, the Company’s cost of funds increased 8 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This is primarily due to an increase in overnight borrowing costs and CD campaigns with a 2.00% interest rate.\nAverage interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2018 were $483,013,000, an increase of $37,703,000, or 9% as compared to $445,310,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the “originate and hold” strategy that began to unwind with loan sales occurring primarily in March 2018. Likewise, average interest-bearing liabilities were $378,541,000, an increase of $34,812,000, or 10%, as compared to the $343,729,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAbout West Town Bancorp, Inc.\nWest Town Bancorp, Inc. is the multi-bank holding company for West Town Bank & Trust, a North Riverside, IL based state-chartered bank and Sound Bank, a Morehead City, NC based state-chartered bank.
