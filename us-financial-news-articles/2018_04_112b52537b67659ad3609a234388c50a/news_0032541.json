Although Tina was able to pay off the last $28,000 of her debt in 10 months, she lacked a repayment strategy for the first six years.\n\"It felt like freedom,\" Tina remembers. \"Like I was on top of a mountain, breathing fresh air.\"\nAnd then the feeling was gone. Still fearing debt, Tina was immediately preoccupied with repaying her boyfriend's student loans, too.\nFind out how Tina conquered her aversion to debt and kicked her repayment strategy into overdrive.\nSetting up a 10-month repayment strategy to pay off $28,000 Tina recalls the panic she felt when the six-month grace period on her student debt ended. \"I remember a brief conversation with my parents … where I was like, 'Oh man, now it's a reality, now I have to actually pay this back,'\" she says.\nTina earned her undergraduate degree in social work in 2008 before returning for a master's degree in 2011. With a $15-per-hour job out of college, Tina moved her federal Direct Loans to an income-driven repayment plan . She made minimum automatic payments without giving much thought to her debt.\nLater, when her salary crept up into the $50,000-plus range, her minimum payments increased from $200 to $300. It wasn't until 2014 when she got serious about zeroing her balance.\n\"I had felt trapped [because] I wanted to start my own business,\" says Tina, a social worker-turned-business and life coach. \"I felt like I couldn't have that [opportunity] when I had student loans.\"\nTina dipped into her savings and started her 10-month payoff journey in June 2014 with a payment of $5,400 to her servicers. Check out the roadmap she made herself below.\nMaking the last student loan and car loan payment By April 15, 2015, Tina realized she was $1,000 short of reaching her goal. In order to get to the finish line, she made small sacrifices every day, including:\nTaking road trips instead of vacations Making and bringing lunch to work instead of buying it Learning how to politely say no to friends to avoid overspending on nights out All of Tina's sacrifices paid off when she got her final student loan payment notice from Great Lakes .\nSoon after submitting her final loan payment, Tina and her boyfriend, Justin, splurged by going out for dinner.\n\"And then immediately, I was like, 'Now I need to pay off all [your] student loans,'\" Tina recalls. She says she had gotten into the mentality that she and her boyfriend wouldn't have true freedom until their debt was repaid.\nAdditionally, Tina explains, \"I was in this really frugal mindset where I wasn't letting myself have any luxury or joy in my life.\"\nEven though Tina was making good money, she says she was, \"Pouring it all into student loans. It didn't feel joyful because of my obsessive mentality.\"\nshow chapters This couple is trying to pay off $600,000 of student loans in 5 years      9:53 AM ET Wed, 2 Aug 2017 | 01:21 Overcoming a fear of debt That's when Tina's relationship with money began affecting her relationship at home.\nJustin was less afraid of his student loan debt than Tina. He was aware of it, but he wasn't ready to make the kind of sacrifices Tina had made to clear her balance.\nNevertheless, Tina kept her momentum going and put about $10,000 toward her boyfriend's loans. This isn't that uncommon; about 55 percent of borrowers say their significant other helped them make payments, according to our survey on couples and student loans .\n\"I would get judgmental when he would want to eat out during the week,\" Tina recalls. \"I was almost a little controlling, like, 'I'm contributing money to you now, so you have to abide by my rules.' It was silly.\"\nTina says she would also feel guilty for wanting to use her income to start her coaching business . Her mindset about debt made her want to prioritize paying off Justin's loans first.\nA revelation made Tina reverse course. She saw her struggle as a teaching point for her future coaching clients.\n\"It was the perfect segue for me to begin to 'walk my talk' … rather than be judgmental or be harsh or not be collaborative,\" Tina says. \"I started learning about my connection to money and debt.\"\nJustin, who's still in repayment, also learned from their struggles as a couple.\n\"He became more independent and accountable,\" Tina says. \"And I became less fearful of debt. We were able to really learn from one another and [found] a happy medium.\nUltimately, Tina says, \"We could still enjoy some luxuries, vacations, and time together while still being responsible with money.\"\nshow chapters Here's where students have the hardest and easiest time paying off loans      6:49 PM ET Tue, 23 May 2017 | 01:13 Work toward your last payment — with the right mindset Tina went from passively making minimum loan payments to attacking her debt with all her might. Although she's happy with the results, she learned not to let a fear of debt take over her life.\nIf you're whittling down your student loan debt, Tina recommends organizing your payoff strategy and figuring out how much you can put toward student loan payments ASAP.\nBut she also says to make some space for a healthy life balance. If going on a vacation or spending more time with friends lengthens your debt payoff plan by a couple of months, you might decide that's worth it.\nYour relationship with money is perhaps even more important if you have a personal relationship to maintain too. Tina's advice for you includes:\nTeam up on your debt and find common ground, such as a long-term financial goal. Keep the process fun and light to avoid money-related fights . Set time for open dialogue where you plan but also celebrate milestones. Keep these tips in mind as you work toward your last student loan payment.
