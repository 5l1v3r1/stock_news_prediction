Americas and Rest of World continued to drive qualified referral growth in the first quarter of 2018, increasing to 59.9 million and 59.5 million, respectively. Qualified Referrals in Developed Europe decreased to 70.1 million Total revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was broadly stable at €259.4 million, showing a slight decline of 3% year-over-year, compared to €267.6 million in a strong first quarter of 2017. This was due to a decline in commercialization and significant headwinds from foreign exchange effects Net loss was €21.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of €7.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and was a result of lower commercialization across all segments against increased advertising spend Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of €21.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of €19.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 Expected Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2018 to be between negative €50 million and negative €25 million Total revenues are expected to return to a growth trajectory in the second half of 2018, leading to overall flat revenues in 2018 vs 2017\nOperational Highlights\nAfter a period of increased marketplace volatility and testing activities, revenue shares of our largest advertisers are relatively stable in the first quarter of 2018 compared to recent quarters We continued to implement measures aimed at optimizing our platforms and product, with the intention of increasing user retention and booking conversion Continued trend towards improved traffic quality for our advertisers, both coming from marketing and product optimizations Decline in commercialization as advertisers sought to increase their profitability targets for their advertising on our platform Significant investment in technology, content and personnel during the period Investment in the creative production of our advertisements focused on further educating users on unique product features Alternative accommodation integration continues with over 350,000 units of alternative accommodation available as of March 31, 2018, increasing choice for users The construction of the new headquarters in Düsseldorf is on track and we expect to move in summer to the new campus, improving overall office atmosphere and productivity\nRolf Schrömgens, CEO and Founder , \"Over the course of 2017 we invested heavily into building up both our team and technology to promote long-term growth. While impacting our operating costs, we believe the effects of this investment will become increasingly visible. Our product teams continuously make improvements to our platform on the backend, with a strong focus on personalized technologies and user experience. On the brand side, having already established a very high brand awareness globally, our new ad creatives are focused on advancing the user's understanding of our product's features in order to further increase usage.\"\nAxel Hefer, CFO , \"We managed to grow the usage on our platforms, enabling us to almost match a very strong Q1 17 in terms of revenues. We achieved this despite strong headwinds from currency movements in the Americas and Rest of the World and a drop in commercialization as our advertisers appeared to have increased their profitability targets for their spend on our marketplace compared to the first quarter of 2017.\"\nFinancial Summary & Operating Metrics (€ millions, otherwise stated)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 ^ Y/Y Total Revenue 259.4 267.6 (3)% Qualified Referrals (in millions) 189.5 177.2 7% Revenue per Qualified Referral (in €) 1.35 1.49 (9)% Operating income/(loss) (29.2) 12.5 n.m.

The webcast will be open to the public and available via http://ir.trivago.com . trivago N.V. expects to provide access to the webcast on the IR website for at least three months subsequent to the initial broadcast.\nNotes & Definitions:\nQR: We define a qualified referral as a unique visitor per day that generates at least one referral. For example, if a single visitor clicks on multiple hotel offers in our search results in a given day, they count as multiple referrals, but as only one qualified referral.\nRPQR: We use average revenue per qualified referral, to measure how effectively we convert qualified referrals to revenue. RPQR is calculated as referral revenue divided by the total number of qualified referrals in a given period.\nReferral Revenue: We use the term \"referral\" to describe each time a visitor to one of our websites or apps clicks on a hotel offer in our search results and is referred to one of our advertisers. We charge our advertisers for each referral on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss):\nLess: income/(loss) from equity method investment Plus: expense/(benefit) for income taxes, Plus: total other (income)/expense, net, Plus: depreciation of property and equipment, including amortization of internal use software and website development Plus: amortization of intangible assets, and Plus: share-based compensation\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A \"non-GAAP financial measure\" refers to a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes (or includes) amounts that are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in such company's financial statements. We present this non-GAAP financial measure because it is used by management to evaluate our operating performance, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions on capital allocation. We also believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance and consolidated results of operations in the same manner as our management and in comparing financial results across accounting periods. Our use of adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including net loss. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and Other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nTabular Reconciliations for Non-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA (Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Share Based Compensation)\nThree months ended March 31, (€ millions) 2018 2017 Net income/(loss) € (21.8 ) € 7.7 Income/(loss) from equity method investment (0.0 ) 0.0 Income before equity method investment\n€ (21.8 ) € 7.7 Expense/(benefit) for income taxes (7.4 ) 4.7 Income/(loss) before income taxes € (29.1 ) € 12.4 Add/(less): Interest expense 0.0 0.0 Other, net (0.1 ) 0.1 Operating income/(loss) € (29.2 ) € 12.5 Depreciation 2.4 1.5 Amortization of intangible assets 0.4 2.0 EBITDA € (26.4 ) € 16.0 Share-based compensation 4.5 3.3 Adjusted EBITDA € (21.9 ) € 19.3 Note: Some figures may not add due to rounding.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
