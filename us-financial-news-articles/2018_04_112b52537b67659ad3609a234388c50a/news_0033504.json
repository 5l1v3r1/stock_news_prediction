The president has previously said that Washington would only join if the landmark pact was \"substantially better\" than the version offered to former President Barack Obama. \nOfficially known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the landmark agreement was signed last month and will cut tariffs between 11 member countries, which include Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia and Mexico. It is currently awaiting ratification from six of the nations. show chapters 10:42 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:38 \nAbe has long vocalized a desire for Washington to rejoin the landmark deal following Trump's decision to withdraw in January 2017.
