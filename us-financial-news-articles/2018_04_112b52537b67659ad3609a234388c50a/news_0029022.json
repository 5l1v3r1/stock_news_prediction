As a result, demand for Aveda’s transportation services is generally linked to the economic conditions of the energy industry and the level of drilling activity in the US and the WCSB.\nRelative to 2017, both oil and natural gas prices have rebounded and rig counts in both Canada and the United States have risen in the first quarter of 2018. Based both on general market enthusiasm with respect to commodity prices and discussions with Aveda’s customers, management expects 2018 to be an even stronger year in terms of drilling activity. Preliminary results for the first quarter of 2018 indicate that the Company expects to report revenue of $59.0 million to $60.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $4.4 million to $4.6 million and a net loss of $0.5 million to $1.0 million. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company generated revenue of $40.1 million, Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $2.6 million and a net loss of $3.4 million. Using the first quarter of 2018 versus 2017 as a proxy, the Company expects activity levels to be robust. Accordingly, the Company is planning to invest $12.0 million in its capital program in 2018, with approximately $4.0 to $5.0 million allocated towards maintenance capital and the remainder towards purchasing and reengineering hoisting and revenue producing equipment.\nBased on the information above, Aveda expects to see continued improvements in revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and net income results in 2018.\nAbout Aveda Transportation and Energy Services\nAveda provides specialized transportation services and equipment required for the exploration, development and production of petroleum resources in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and in the United States of America principally in and around the states of Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio and North Dakota.

Aveda believes the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date hereof but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements should not be unduly relied upon.\nVarious material factors and assumptions are typically applied in drawing conclusions or making the forecasts or projections set out in forward-looking statements. Those material factors and assumptions are based on information currently available to Aveda, including information obtained from third party industry analysts and other third party sources. In some instances, material assumptions and material factors are presented elsewhere in this News Release in connection with the forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that the following list of material factors and assumptions is not exhaustive. Specific material factors and assumptions include, but are not limited to:\nthe performance of Aveda’s businesses, including current business and economic trends; oil and natural gas commodity prices and production levels; the effect of the rebranding on Aveda’s businesses; capital expenditure programs and other expenditures by Aveda and its customers: the ability of Aveda to retain and hire qualified personnel; the ability of Aveda to obtain parts, consumables, equipment, technology, and supplies in a timely manner to carry out its activities; the ability of Aveda to maintain good working relationships with key suppliers; the ability of Aveda to market its services successfully to existing and new customers; the ability of Aveda to obtain timely financing on acceptable terms; currency exchange and interest rates; risks associated with foreign operations; changes under governmental regulatory regimes and tax, environmental and other laws in Canada and the United States; and a stable competitive environment.\nThe forward-looking statements regarding Aveda's potential revenue, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are included herein to provide readers with an understanding of Aveda's anticipated cash flow and Aveda's ability to fund its expenditures based on the assumptions described herein.

Such forward-looking statements necessarily involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Aveda’s actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks identified in Aveda’s annual information form and management discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"MD&A\"), which are available for viewing on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Any forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and, except as required by law, Aveda assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise such statements to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise.\nThis News Release contains the terms “EBITDA”, “Adjusted EBITDA”, “gross profit” “gross profit margin”, “gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization” and “gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization” which are defined in the MD&A. The above terms as presented do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by international financial reporting standards (“IFRS”) and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. Management uses EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, gross profit, gross profit margin, gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization, and gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization to analyze the operating performance of the business. These non-IFRS measures presented are not intended to represent cash provided by operating activities, net earnings or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nThis News Release contains the terms \"cash flow\", \"working capital\" and \"working capital ratio\", which do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities. As an indicator of the Company's performance, cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS. The Company considers cash flow to be a key measure as it demonstrates the Company's underlying ability to generate the cash necessary to fund operations and support activities related to its major assets. Cash flow is determined by adding back changes in non-cash operating working capital to cash from operating activities. Management calculates working capital as current assets less current liabilities and uses this measure to analyze operating performance and leverage.\nNotes:\n(1) See MD&A Section 8.\n(2) Current ratio calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities.\n(3) Debt includes loans and borrowings and note payable as per their carrying amounts on the balance sheet.\n(4) Gross margin is calculated as gross profit divided by revenue.\n(5) Gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization is calculated by dividing gross profit excluding depreciation and amortization by revenue.\n(6) Net asset value per share calculated by dividing total equity ($34.4 million) by common shares outstanding (57.4 million).\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource: Aveda Transportation and Energy Services Inc", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/25d9132f-4fc0-4a01-8aac-27ba6d0eba45"], "published": "2018-04-16T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T18:35:54.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
