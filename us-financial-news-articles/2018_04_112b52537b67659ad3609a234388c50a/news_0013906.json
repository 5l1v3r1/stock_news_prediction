REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon McCaughan said the ongoing trade spat between the United States and China is likely to ultimately lead to a compromise, rather than a full-scale trade war.\n“Most likely, you get concessions, you get a face-saving compromise and both can declare a victory,” McCaughan told Reuters in an interview, but warned that the risk of a trade war was not negligible.\n“It’s more serious than a ‘tail risk,’ which is usually a 5 percent probability or less... Diversification can act as a counter balance,” he said.\nHeadline risks stemming from a potential U.S.-China trade war and geopolitical tensions on the Korean Peninsula and Iran could lead to higher market volatility, said McCaughan, estimating an about 20-30 percent negative tail risk.\n“In many of our strategies, we have a strategic allocation and we’ll rebalance when they get out of whack. So weakness in equities would tend to make us a buyer,” he said.\n“In terms of volatility, markets so far this year have actually been more like the markets in the 80s and 90s. Back then, 1 percent move (in a day) was pretty common. Those days were back.”\nDespite the market volatility, McCaughan expects U.S. economy to continue to grow between 2-3 percent with inflation well-contained around 2 percent in the next three years.\nHe expects only one more U.S. interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve this year, while many market participants estimate two to three rate raises.\n“On a 70 or 80 percent probability, you’ll probably see equities going up and you’ll see bond yields stay pretty close to the current levels, maybe go up a little bit. My best guess of the 10 year treasury yield US10YT=RR, a year from now, is 2.80 percent.”\nPGI is the asset management arm of Principal Financial Group, headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa, and had $454 billion in assets under management as of Dec. 31.\n“We have been quite bullish of U.S. equities for a number of years. That has paid off well, and we’ll continue to do so. Our favorite areas will be small- and mid-cap U.S. equities,” McCaughan said.\nReporting by Tomo Uetake; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T12:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T12:57:52.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
