Washington has a 3-2 lead and can close it out in Game 6 Monday at Columbus.\nThis was the fourth overtime game in this series.\nBackstrom simply deflected a shot from Dmitry Orlov past Columbus goalie Sergei Bobrovsky from between the circles.\nBackstrom finished with two goals and one assist.\nBoth goalies made crucial saves in the third period and overtime. Washington goalie Braden Holtby had some spectacular stops and finished with 39 saves while Bobrovsky had 25.\nColumbus scored the first goal for the first time in this series. Matt Calvert (two goals) got a short-handed goal with 9:52 left in the period.\nThe Capitals then got a bit of a lucky bounce - or two - to tie the game when Backstrom scored with 6:38 left in the first period.\nBackstrom was behind the goal and trying to make a centering pass. However, the puck hit the skate of Columbus defenseman David Savard and bounced off the left shoulder of goalie Sergei Bobrovsky and into the net.\nEvgeny Kuznetsov of Washington and Calvert then traded second-period goals 84 seconds apart. Kuznetsov scored as the Capitals caught the Blue Jackets changing while Calvert tied it even though he initially whiffed on his breakaway shot.\nOshie deflected a John Carlson shot in with 3:18 left in the second period for a 3-2 lead before the Blue Jackets tied it on their own deflected goal.\nOliver Bjorkstrand tipped an Ian Cole shot past goalie Braden Holtby 2:30 into the third period for a 3-3 tie. Columbus outshot Washington 16-1 in that period but Holtby stood tall.\nThe Capitals said Friday that Andre Burakovsky will undergo minor surgery for an “upper body” injury that is going to sideline him for the rest of this series but possibly not the remainder of the playoffs.\nFor Columbus, Alexander Wennberg returned to the lineup after missing the past three games with an “upper body” injury of his own.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
