(NASDAQ:UNB) today announced results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and declared a regular quarterly cash dividend. Consolidated net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.7 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to $1.9 million, or $0.43 per share, for the same period in 2017.\nInterest income was $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $6.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $732 thousand, or 10.7%. The increase during the comparison period is primarily the result of increased volumes of interest earning assets, and to a lesser extent the impact of prime rate increases since March 31, 2017. Interest expense was $647 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $537 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $110 thousand, or 20.5%. Similar to the improvement in interest income, the increase in interest expense for the comparison periods is due to increased volumes of interest bearing liabilities, and to a lesser extent an increase in the cost of funding.\nTotal noninterest income amounted to $2.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase during the comparison period is the result of a gain on the sale of a former branch building and proceeds from a bank owned insurance policy. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the gain on sale of residential loans.\nTotal noninterest expenses were $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $5.9 million for the same period in 2017. Increases of $81 thousand in salaries and wages, $79 thousand in employee benefits, and $28 thousand in other expenses occurred during the comparison periods.\nIncome tax expense was $513 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 resulting in an effective tax rate of 15.7% compared to $664 thousand, or an effective tax rate of 25.6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal assets increased $46.3 million, or 6.8% to reach $722.7 million as of March 31, 2018 from $676.5 million as of March 31, 2017. Total loans increased $54.4 million, or 10.1% to $595.4 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $541.0 million as of March 31, 2017. Sales of qualifying residential mortgages to the secondary market totaled $23.1 million for the first three months of 2018 compared to $28.5 million for the same period in 2017. The Company has retained the servicing on loans totaling $504.8 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $466.5 million as of March 31, 2017. Total deposits reached $623.8 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $582.1 million a year ago, or growth of $41.8 million, or 7.2%. The Company had total capital of $59.2 million with a book value per share of $13.25 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $57.2 million and $12.81 per share as of March 31, 2017.\nOn April 18, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share payable May 10, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 30, 2018.\nAbout Union Bankshares, Inc.\nUnion Bankshares, Inc., headquartered in Morrisville, Vermont, is the bank holding company parent of Union Bank, which provides commercial, retail, and municipal banking services, as well as, asset management services throughout northern Vermont and New Hampshire.
