The team is preparing to deploy to Syria shortly.”\nThe suspected chemical weapons attack late on Saturday injured more than 1,000 people at several sites in Douma, a town near the capital Damascus, according to the Union of Medical Care Organizations. The Syrian government and its backer Russia deny that chemical weapons were used.\nDoctors and eyewitnesses have said victims showed symptoms of poisoning, possibly by a nerve agent, and reported the smell of chlorine gas.\nThe OPCW has an ongoing mandate to investigate suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria. Its fact finding mission will determine whether banned munitions were used, but will not assign blame.\nLater on Tuesday, the United States will put to a vote at the United Nations Security Council a proposal for a new inquiry to identify the culprits behind systematic chemical weapons use in the Syria conflict.\nDiplomats said that the resolution would likely be vetoed by Russia, which has blocked similar efforts in the past.
