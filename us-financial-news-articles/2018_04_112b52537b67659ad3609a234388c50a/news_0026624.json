The company also owns Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. \nPatrick McGrade, Tim Hortons spokesman, said the company has been told there is no investigation underway. \n“Every year we have reported to the government on meeting our undertakings, without complaint. We have always been and remain committed to doing good business in Canada,” McGrade said. \nThe relationship between Tim Hortons and its franchisees has become increasingly contentious. \nTim Hortons has also been dealing with the fallout of bad publicity from its reaction to minimum wage increases in the country. Many Tim Hortons franchises cut back on employee perks and benefits when the province of Ontario raised minimum wages by 21 percent to C$14 ($11.11). \nBy Friday afternoon, the stock was down 1.3 percent, while the benchmark Canada share index was up 0.3 percent.
