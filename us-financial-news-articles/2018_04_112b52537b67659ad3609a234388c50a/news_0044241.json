ASIC would get the power to intercept internal communications of companies if necessary. \n“They are not victimless crimes,” Morrison told a press conference. \n“We need to set the tone ... so people understand that misleading regulators about serious issues such as this is no victimless offence, and it won’t carry a victimless penalty.” \nThe changes were the result of years of planning and were not a knee-jerk reaction to the inquiry, he said. \nThe Liberal Party-led government holds power with a one-seat majority and has trailed the opposition Labor Party in opinion polls for more than two years. \n“They will want to be seen to be acting strongly,” said John Warhurst, an emeritus professor of political science at Australian National University. “PERSONALLY DEVASTATED” \nAMP executives admitted in testimony this week that the company had lied to the corporate watchdog for almost a decade to cover a practice of charging customers for services it did not provide. \nChairman Catherine Brenner issued an unreserved apology for “misconduct and failures in regulatory disclosures in our advice business”, as she announced Meller’s exit along with a review of the company’s governance. \nGovernment data prepared for the Royal Commission, which has the power to subpoena documents and compel top executives to testify in public, shows over 80,000 consumers have been given bad advice by financial institutions over the past decade, costing them a total A$5 billion ($3.9 billion). \nThis week’s hearings have been particularly brutal. A nurse gave tearful testimony on Thursday about losing her home after taking advice from Westpac Banking Corp, while lawyers presented evidence that Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s biggest bank, knowingly charged dead clients for counsel for years. \nBut the revelations about AMP for the first time showed direct board-level involvement in hiding misconduct from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the corporate regulator, leading to calls for the watchdog to play a far more aggressive role than it has in the past. \nAMP shares have lost over A$1.2 billion ($926 million) in market value since the revelations came to light on Tuesday. The stock rose as much as 2 percent in early trading on Friday, in a weaker overall market. \nMeller said he was “personally devastated by the issues which have been raised publicly this week”, and while he did not condone making misleading statements to the regulator they had occurred under his watch so his resignation was appropriate. \n“This is not the AMP I know and these are not the actions our customers should expect from the company,” he said in the AMP statement. \nAMP director Mike Wilkins, a former CEO of Australia’s biggest general insurer, Insurance Australia Group Ltd, would step in as AMP’s acting chief until it found a permanent replacement for Meller, the company added. $1 = 1.2953 Australian dollars Reporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru and Paulina Duran in Sydney; Writing by Jane Wardell and Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T08:32:59.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
