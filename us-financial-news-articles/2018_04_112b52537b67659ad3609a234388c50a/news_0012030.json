There was a lot of things that I did well, so I think if I just focus on what I was doing well and what I need to do, then I’m not really concerned about who’s on the other side.” \nKristyna Pliskova followed up Wednesday’s impressive win over second seed Petra Kvitova with a 6-3 1-6 6-2 upset of sixteenth-seeded Elena Vesnina. \nPliskova dominated from the service line, winning 88 percent of her first serves while firing five aces. \nNext up for the Czech is a quarter-final against Latvian eighth seed Anastasija Sevastova, who dispatched Australian Ashleigh Barty in straight sets. \nDefending champion Daria Kasatkina needed just over an hour to power past Irina-Camelia Begu 6-2 6-1 to defeat the Romanian for the sixth time in seven meetings. \nThe 20-year-old Russian will next face fifth seed Julia Gorges in the quarter-finals on Friday after the German dispatched Indian Wells champion Naomi Osaka 7-6(4) 6-3.
