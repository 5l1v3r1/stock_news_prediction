Spokespeople for Cox, Deutsche Bank, Uria Menendez and Linklaters declined to comment.\nCox owns solar plants in Spain and Portugal with potential capacity to supply 1,300 gigawatt hours per year. Last month, it signed a deal to supply fellow Spanish firm Audax Renovables with enough energy to power around 400,000 homes.\nIt has projects with a potential capacity of 5,000 megawatts in the pipeline, according to its website. It aims to start supplying electricity from its solar plants - none of which are yet in operation - during the next two years.\n“The group needs to fund its investments. It has a very ambitious pipeline but it still doesn’t generate enough income,” one of the sources said.\nSmaller renewable energy stocks were outperforming on Friday, while Madrid’s bourse fell slightly. Shares in Audax - which have surged 174 percent in the last month - gained 10 percent. Solar plant operator Solaria climbed 3.4 percent.\nReporting by Andres Gonzalez and Jose Elias Rodriguez; Writing by Isla Binnie; Editing by Sonya Dowsett and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:33:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
