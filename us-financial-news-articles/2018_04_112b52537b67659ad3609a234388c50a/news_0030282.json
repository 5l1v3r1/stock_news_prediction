If they make another transformation acquisition, like Documentum — or sell the company, which is always possible in the software space — their return opportunities could be significantly higher than this.\"\n\"They're really great at M&A and have a private equity approach,\" he added. It's a \"very mispriced and inexpensive company.\"\nHe delivered his comments at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York. With a $400 million investment, Blue Harbour currently holds roughly 4 percent of shares.\nShares rallied more than 4 percent after Robbins' remarks. Open Text declined to comment on this story.\nFounded in 1991, Open Text is a software company with products including enterprise content management and cloud technology. It acquired enterprise content platform Documentum from Dell EMC's enterprise content division for $1.62 billion in 2017. Its current market cap is about $10 billion.\nRobbins founded Blue Harbour in 2004 and invests in undervalued companies and engages with management teams and boards of directors to try to create value in the company. Blue Harbour made headlines last year after it revealed a roughly 6.2 percent position in Adient , making the activist investor one of the automotive-seat supplier's biggest shareholders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T16:30:33.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
