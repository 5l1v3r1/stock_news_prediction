But Buckingham joined Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie and John McVie for a 2014 reunion tour and a MusicCares ceremony in New York in January.\nNicks said Buckingham did not want to commit to the 52-date, six-month-long tour the band announced on Wednesday.\n“When you’re in a band, it’s a team. I have a solo career and I love my solo career and I’m the boss,” Nicks said. “But I’m not the boss in this band.”\nFleetwood Mac’s tour of the United States and Canada begins on Oct. 3, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and ends in Philadelphia in April 2019. The band also said it had added former Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers guitarist Mike Campbell and Crowded House guitarist and singer Neil Finn to the tour.
