Everyone talks about volatility as a detriment to markets and investors, but no one talks about the opportunities that arise for investors during periods of market volatility.\nWhat is market volatility? Market volatility is the statistical measure of a market or security's tendency to rise or fall sharply within a short period of time.

Here are two strategies to help you leverage volatility for your own benefit.\n1. Ignore short-term chaos and leave investments until the volatility passes.

Typically, you would be better off to stay the course than attempt to time things and not do it well. This bad timing can further exacerbate your losses during these volatile times.\n2. Purchase additional shares at lower prices. Market volatility can also create opportunities an astute investor can use to their advantage. Volatility can provide entry points for those investors whose time horizon and investment strategy is long-term.
