In February, Bradesco had set a cautious tone with its guidance for the year, with loan book growth between 3 percent and 7 percent.\nWith lower losses to consumers and small-sized companies, Bradesco’s 90-day default ratio declined 0.3 percent in the quarter, to 4.4 percent.\nBradesco’s profit was also boosted by higher fee revenues and lower administrative expenses.
