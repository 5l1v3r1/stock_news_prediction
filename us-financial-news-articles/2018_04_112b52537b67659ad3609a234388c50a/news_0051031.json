The S&P technology index rose 2.2 percent, the biggest gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors.\nFacebook reported a strong 63 percent rise in profit and an increase in users, with no sign that business was hurt by a scandal over the mishandling of personal data.\nOf the 227 S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter earnings so far, 79.7 percent topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAnalysts now expect earnings growth of 23.1 percent, compared with 18.6 percent at the start of the season.\nDespite strong results from most U.S. firms that have reported so far, investors have been reacting to signs that rising inflation could take a toll on corporate profits.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, pulled back from the 3 percent level it hit on Tuesday for the first time in four years.\n“The rising yields are having an impact and there are some concerns that we’re in an environment where we’re seeing a peak in terms of earnings growth,” said Emily Roland, head of capital markets research at John Hancock Investments in Boston.\n“But some these factors are overshadowing the fact we have sturdy fundamental backdrop, both earnings and economic.”\nAt 11:27 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 184.07 points, or 0.76 percent, at 24,267.90, the S&P 500 was up 19.57 points, or 0.74 percent, at 2,658.97 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 99.16 points, or 1.42 percent, at 7,102.89.\nVisa’s 4.5 percent jump, following the payments network’s better-than-expected profit and earnings forecast raise, provided the biggest boost to the Dow.\nAdvanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm were up 14.3 percent and 0.3 percent after the chipmakers posted quarterly results that beat Wall Street estimates, offsetting the recent worries over slowing smartphone chips demand.\nThe gains pushed the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up by more than 1.8 percent.\nThe Dow Jones Transport index fell 0.8 percent, led by 2.7 percent decline after Union Pacific, the No. 1 U.S. railroad, warned on a key operating metric.\nGeneral Motors fell 2.3 percent after the automaker reported a decline in quarterly profit and said it expected material costs to continue rising.\nAT&T shares slumped 6.6 percent as the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier lost subscribers from its pay TV business, hurting its profits. The three-member S&P telecom index fell 3.6 percent.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.86-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.73-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 42 new highs and 37 new lows.
