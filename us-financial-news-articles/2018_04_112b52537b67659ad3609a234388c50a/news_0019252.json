It's an attack on our country in a true sense.\"\nTrump also spoke against his attorney general, Jeff Sessions , who became a regular target of the president's ire in public and private after recusing himself from the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Sessions' command of the special counsel was ceded to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.\n\"The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this,\" Trump said of Sessions. Had Sessions let Trump know he was planning to recuse himself over failing to report contacts with a Russian ambassador in congressional testimony, \"we would have used a â€” put a different attorney general in.\"\nAsked if he would fire Mueller, Trump said the investigation is a \"disgrace.\"\n\"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.' Again, they found nothing,\" Trump said of Mueller and his team.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T03:26:47.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
