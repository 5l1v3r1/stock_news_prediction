VAR CONFUSION \nThe use of VARs in leagues has been surrounded by confusion among the fans and even coaching staff. \nThere have been cases of players in Serie A waiting to take a penalty for several minutes before the referee has reversed the decision and awarded a free kick to their opponents amid general bewilderment. \nIn others, players have scored goals, the entire stadium has celebrated and the score has flashed across on live scoring websites, only for the incident to be reviewed as the other team is about to re-start the game and the goal annulled. \nPierluigi Collina, the head of FIFA’s refereeing committee, said that VAR should only be used to correct obvious mistakes in match-changing incidents. \n“The goal of VAR is not to have clear and obvious mistakes committed on the field of play,” he said. \n“VAR won’t provide a final answer. There will continue to be incidents where a final answer cannot be given....the target is to avoid major mistakes, not to scrutinise every single decision.” Reporting by Brian Homewood, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T23:24:15.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
