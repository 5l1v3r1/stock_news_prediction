My motivation to continue work for sustainable growth and economic stability is high,” Rehn said in an email to Reuters, confirming reports in Finnish media.\nMajor policy changes are not expected after the departure of Liikanen, who is known for largely backing ECB President Mario Draghi.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:44:34.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
