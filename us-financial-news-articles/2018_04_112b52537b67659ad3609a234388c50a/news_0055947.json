They killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance.\n“All these crimes were committed by Uwe Boehnhardt and Uwe Mundlos alone,” Grasel said, adding Zschaepe had never belonged to a terrorist organization. She never fired a shot and knew nothing of her friends’ plans, he said.\nGrasel stressed that Zschaepe, as the last survivor, should not be made responsible for the crimes of the others. Sharing a home, paying bills for the group or procuring mobile phones for it does not make her an accomplice in the murders, he said.\nZschaepe has been in custody for several years.\nThe court is hearing the defense’s closing statements in the case after more than four years of evidence.\nThe NSU attacks were the most violent by a guerrilla group in Germany since the end of the far-left Red Army Faction’s two-decade spree in 1991, in which 34 people are estimated to have been killed.\nWriting by Alexander Huebner and Michelle Martin; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T19:01:05.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
