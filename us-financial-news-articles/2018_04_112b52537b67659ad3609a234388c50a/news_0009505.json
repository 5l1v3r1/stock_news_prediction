He also sees advertising revenue growing at a slower rate in 2018 and 2019. Facebook shares declined 1.8 percent on Wednesday to $153.28. Morgan Stanley's new price target implies a 28 percent upside from Facebook's closing price on Tuesday. \nFacebook was one of the best-performing stocks during the past year before the scandal broke last month that political research firm Cambridge Analytica had gathered data from 50 million Facebook profiles without permission. \nThat resulted in a stock decline of more than 10 percent as investors grew concerned that Facebook's handling of personal data could lead to government regulation and a decrease in daily active users, a key metric for the company. \nStill, the Morgan Stanley analyst remains bullish on the stock long term. \"We have spoken with 8 agencies/advertisers now and don't sense any material reduction in ad spend,\" he said. \"In fact, over the long-term, we think the elimination of third parties is smart strategically as it will highlight FB's leading reach and first party data advantage.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T15:52:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
