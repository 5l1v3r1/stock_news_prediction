Under a revised constitution approved by referendum in 2015, the prime minister will hold power while the presidency becomes largely ceremonial.\nSarksyan’s ally Armen Sarkissian was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament and in March Sarksyan said he would become prime minister to allow him to share the benefit of his experience.\n“I have enough influence and power to make the executive and legislative branches of power work effectively,” Sarksyan told parliament on Tuesday. Parliament voted 77 to 17 in favour of his appointment.\nArmenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.\nPeople walk during a protest after parliament voted to allow former President Serzh Sarksyan to become Prime Minister in Yerevan, Armenia April 18, 2018.

The protesters massed in the main square and surrounded or blocked entrances to governments buildings and organised sit-ins.\nLocal media said protests were also underway in Armenia’s two other big cities - Gyumri and Vanadzor. Police warned demonstrators to disperse or face tear gas.\nOn Monday, dozens were injured in scuffles with police and around 80 protesters were arrested, police said.\nOpposition activists also held rallies in recent weeks to protest Sarksyan’s campaign to become prime minister and thousands blocked the centre of the capital Yerevan.\n“I am declaring a start of a peaceful, velvet revolution in Armenia,” opposition MP Nikol Pashinyan told protesters in central Yerevan, many of whom were young people with no affiliation to a political party.\nWriting by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:44:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
