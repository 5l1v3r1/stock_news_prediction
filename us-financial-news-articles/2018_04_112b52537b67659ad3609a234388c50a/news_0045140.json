(NASDAQ: SNMX), a leading company using proprietary taste science technologies to discover, develop, and commercialize novel flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners, will issue its financial results on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 4:05 p.m. Eastern time (1:05 p.m. Pacific time) for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nGiven the commencement of the strategic review process to explore and evaluate all available strategic options, as announced last month, Senomyx has decided to only issue an earnings press release and will not be conducting its usual concurrent conference call.

Under its direct sales program, Senomyx sells its Complimyx 速 brand flavor ingredients, Sweetmyx 速 , Savorymyx 速 , and Bittermyx 速 , to flavor companies for use in a wide variety of foods and beverages.
