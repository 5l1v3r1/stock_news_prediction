(TSX.V:AEC) (OTCQB:ANLDF) (FRANKFURT:0AD) (“Anfield” or “the Company”) is pleased to announce the acquisition of an extensive exploration database of mining projects focused primarily on uranium and vanadium properties in the Western United States. This new database, together with Anfield’s already substantial uranium database, constitutes one of the largest depositories of uranium exploration data in the Western United States.\nCorey Dias, Anfield CEO, states “This acquisition will help to further our efforts to update, or potentially expand, our uranium resources on our 25 Wyoming uranium properties in an even more timely fashion, while allowing us to identify complementary claims or projects. Given that we have completed resource reports on only three of our 25 projects, we believe that the acquired data could provide us with an accelerated path to resource delineation. This remains an integral part of Anfield’s strategy: seek out data on current or prospective projects which would allow the Company to more rapidly verify uranium resources in order to create an expansive project portfolio with a clear path to production through a well-defined project pipeline”.\nThe database includes extensive physical and digital files. The database covers over 50 years of exploration and development activity and includes maps, geological studies, prospects, drilling data, exploration reports, resource evaluations and other strategic data. The analogue files are housed in a shipping container which is now in possession of the Company.\nThe database will be utilized by the Company to further define and expand Anfield’s extensive portfolio of uranium and vanadium holdings. The data will be catalogued and integrated with Anfield’s existing database, and used by the Company to not only enhance its current project portfolio but also target properties that will complement its current uranium and vanadium properties.\nAbout Anfield\nAnfield is a uranium and vanadium development and near-term production company that is committed to becoming a top-tier energy-related fuels supplier by creating value through sustainable, efficient growth in its assets. Anfield is a publicly-traded corporation listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange (AEC-V), the OTCQB Marketplace (ANLDF) and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (0AD). Anfield is focused on two production centres, as summarized below:\nWyoming – Irigaray ISR Processing Plant (Resin Processing Agreement)\nAnfield has signed a Resin Processing Agreement with Uranium One whereby Anfield would process up to 500,000 pounds per annum of its mined material at Uranium One’s Irigaray processing plant in Wyoming. In addition, the Company can both buy and borrow uranium from Uranium One in order to fulfill some or all of its sales contracts.\nAnfield’s 24 ISR mining projects are located in the Black Hills, Powder River Basin, Great Divide Basin, Laramie Basin, Shirley Basin and Wind River Basin areas in Wyoming. Anfield’s two projects in Wyoming for which NI 43-101 resource reports have been completed are Red Rim and Clarkson Hill.\nThe Charlie Project, acquired from Cotter Corporation is located in the Pumpkin Buttes Uranium District in Johnson County, Wyoming. The Charlie Project consists of a 720-acre Wyoming State uranium lease which has been in development since 1969.\nArizona/Utah – Shootaring Canyon Mill\nA key asset in Anfield’s portfolio is the Shootaring Canyon Mill in Garfield County, Utah. The Shootaring Canyon Mill is strategically located within one of the historically most prolific uranium production areas in the United States, and is one of only three licensed uranium mills in the United States.\nAnfield’s conventional uranium assets consist of mining claims and state leases in southeastern Utah and Arizona, targeting areas where past uranium mining or prospecting occurred. Anfield’s conventional uranium assets include the Velvet-Wood Project, the Frank M Uranium Project, as well as the Findlay Tank breccia pipe. An NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Assessment has been completed for the Velvet-Wood Project. All conventional uranium assets are situated within a 125-mile radius of the Shootaring Mill.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors\nANFIELD ENERGY INC.\nCorey Dias, Chief Executive Officer\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nContact:\nAnfield Energy, Inc.\nClive Mostert\nCorporate Communications\n780-920-5044\ncontact@anfieldenergy.com\nwww.anfieldenergy.com\nSafe Harbor Statement\nTHIS NEWS RELEASE CONTAINS “FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS”.
