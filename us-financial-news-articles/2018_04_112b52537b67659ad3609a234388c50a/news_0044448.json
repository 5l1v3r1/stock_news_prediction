(NYSE:PZN) reported the following U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) basic and diluted net income and earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nGAAP Basis For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) Basic Net Income $ 3,523 $ 2,336 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 0.20 $ 0.13 Diluted Net Income $ 14,226 $ 8,704 Diluted Earnings Per Share $ 0.20 $ 0.12 GAAP diluted net income and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $14.2 million and $0.20, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $8.7 million and $0.12, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nIn evaluating the results of operations, management also reviews non-GAAP measures of earnings, which are adjusted to exclude accounting items that add a measure of non-operational complexity which obscures the underlying performance of the business. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, no adjustments were made to GAAP earnings, resulting in the same GAAP and non-GAAP measures of earnings. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, GAAP earnings were adjusted to exclude changes to the deferred tax asset and corresponding liability to the Company's selling and converting shareholders during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Management uses the non-GAAP measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business. It believes the non-GAAP measures provide information to further analyze the Company's operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider the non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nNet income for diluted earnings per share generally assume all operating company membership units are converted into Company stock at the beginning of the reporting period, and the resulting change to Company net income associated with its increased interest in the operating company is taxed at the Company's effective tax rate, exclusive of the adjustments noted above and other adjustments. When this conversion results in an increase in earnings per share or a decrease in loss per share, diluted net income and diluted earnings per share are assumed to be equal to basic net income and basic earnings per share for the reporting period.\nIn December 2017, the Company changed the classification of assets under management (\"AUM\") to better reflect the composition of its client base. The Company now groups its assets into three categories: Separately Managed Accounts, Sub-Advised Accounts, and Pzena Funds, which better illustrate the characteristics inherent in its client relationships. Historical data has been reclassified for all periods presented and did not impact reported totals of AUM.\nAssets Under Management (unaudited) 1 ($ billions) For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2018 2017 Separately Managed Accounts Assets Beginning of Period $ 15.0 $ 14.3 $ 12.5 $ 13.0 $ 10.5 Inflows 0.4 0.3 0.5 1.3 2.0 Outflows (0.6 ) (0.5 ) (0.7 ) (1.6 ) (2.0 ) Net Flows (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.2 ) (0.3 ) — Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (0.2 ) 0.9 0.7 1.9 2.5 End of Period $ 14.6 $ 15.0 $ 13.0 $ 14.6 $ 13.0 Sub-Advised Accounts Assets Beginning of Period Assets $ 21.8 $ 19.7 $ 16.3 $ 17.6 $ 14.6 Inflows 0.6 1.3 0.9 3.2 2.6 Outflows (0.7 ) (0.7 ) (0.4 ) (2.0 ) (3.1 ) Net Flows (0.1 ) 0.6 0.5 1.2 (0.5 ) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (0.4 ) 1.5 0.8 2.5 3.5 End of Period $ 21.3 $ 21.8 $ 17.6 $ 21.3 $ 17.6 Pzena Funds Assets Beginning of Period Assets $ 1.7 $ 1.4 $ 1.2 $ 1.4 $ 1.0 Inflows 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.5 0.3 Outflows — — — (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Net Flows 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.2 0.1 Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) — — 0.1 0.2 0.3 End of Period $ 1.8 $ 1.7 $ 1.4 $ 1.8 $ 1.4 Total Assets Beginning of Period $ 38.5 $ 35.4 $ 30.0 $ 32.0 $ 26.1 Inflows 1.1 1.9 1.5 5.0 4.9 Outflows (1.3 ) (1.2 ) (1.1 ) (3.9 ) (5.3 ) Net Flows (0.2 ) 0.7 0.4 1.1 (0.4 ) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) (0.6 ) 2.4 1.6 4.6 6.3 End of Period $ 37.7 $ 38.5 $ 32.0 $ 37.7 $ 32.0 Financial Discussion\nRevenue (unaudited) ($ thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Separately Managed Accounts $ 20,082 $ 20,416 $ 17,640 Sub-Advised Accounts 16,451 15,565 12,233 Pzena Funds 2,719 2,928 2,171 Total $ 39,252 $ 38,909 $ 32,044 Revenue was $39.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 0.9% from $38.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 22.5% from $32.0 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nIncluded in these amounts for the first quarter of 2018 were performance fees recognized of $0.9 million, a decrease from $1.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase from $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nAverage assets under management for the first quarter of 2018 were $38.8 billion, increasing 5.4% from $36.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 24.0% from $31.3 billion for the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflects market appreciation during the first half of the first quarter of 2018. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 primarily reflects market appreciation and net inflows.\nThe weighted average fee rate was 0.405% for the first quarter of 2018, decreasing from 0.423% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and from 0.410% for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe weighted average fee rate for separately managed accounts was 0.534% for the first quarter of 2018, decreasing from 0.560% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and from 0.549% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth and first quarters of 2017 reflects a decrease in assets in our Focused Value strategies that generally carry higher fee rates. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflects a decrease in performance fees recognized during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe weighted average fee rate for sub-advised accounts was 0.300% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.302% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 0.286% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 reflects an increase in performance fees recognized.\nThe weighted average fee rate for Pzena funds was 0.599% for the first quarter of 2018, decreasing from 0.737% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and from 0.660% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from the fourth and first quarters of 2017 reflects the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, which requires fund expense cap reimbursements to be presented net against revenue. The Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard as of January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach, and thus prior periods have not been restated. Excluding the impact of the revenue recognition presentation change, the weighted average fee rate for Pzena funds was 0.660% for the first quarter of 2018. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017 also reflects a decrease in performance fees recognized.\nTotal operating expenses were $19.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, increasing from $18.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and from $18.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses from the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflects an increase in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative costs during the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2018 and 2017 compensation expenses include expenses associated with tax payments and the Company's employee profit sharing and savings plan, which generally do not recur during the year. The remainder of the increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 and from the first quarter of 2017 reflects an increase in compensation rates. The decrease in general and administrative costs from the fourth and first quarters of 2017 reflects the change in presentation of fund expense cap reimbursements associated with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, as well as fluctuations in other business activities.\nOperating Expenses (unaudited) ($ thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 16,174 $ 14,223 $ 15,622 General and Administrative Expense 3,155 3,752 3,325 Operating Expenses $ 19,329 $ 17,975 $ 18,947 As of March 31, 2018, employee headcount was 105, compared to 105 at December 31, 2017 and 104 at March 31, 2017.\nThe operating margin was 50.8% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 53.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 40.9% for the first quarter of 2017.\nOther (expense)/ income was an expense of approximately $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, income of $22.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and income of $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Other (expense)/ income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $20.8 million of income associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, other (expense)/ income includes a portion of (losses)/ gains and other investment income associated with the investments of outside interests, which are offset in net income attributable to non-controlling interests.\nExcluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Act in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the outside interests of the Company's investment partnerships, other (expense)/ income was an expense of approximately $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 and income of $1.1 million for both the fourth and first quarters of 2017. Other (expense)/ income primarily reflects the fluctuations in the (losses)/ gains and other investment income recognized by the Company on its direct investments, the majority of which are held to satisfy obligations under its deferred compensation plan, as well as those recognized by external investors on their investments in investment partnerships that the Company consolidates.

The Company recognized income tax expenses of $2.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, $28.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $26.5 million in income tax expense resulting from the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the United States.\nExcluding changes in the realizability and expected future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company has recognized income tax expenses of $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, and fourth and first quarters of 2017, respectively. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 reflects an increase in income before income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate as a result of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Details of the income tax expense, as well as a reconciliation of the related GAAP and non-GAAP measures, are shown below:\nIncome Tax Expense (unaudited) ($ thousands) For the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 GAAP Income Tax Expense $ 2,207 $ 28,052 $ 1,726 Non-GAAP Corporate Income Tax Expense $ 1,469 $ 1,775 $ 1,098 Non-GAAP Unincorporated and Other Business Tax Expense 738 815 628 Non-GAAP Income Tax Expense 2,207 2,590 1,726 Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 1 — 26,468 — Impact of Change in Historical 754 Step-Up Calculations 2 — (1,006 ) — GAAP Income Tax Expense $ 2,207 $ 28,052 $ 1,726 1 Reflects income tax expense resulting from the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the United States during the fourth quarter of 2017. 2 Reflects the net impact of a change in the calculation of historical 754 step-ups and related deferred tax asset and corresponding liability to selling and converting shareholders recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017.
