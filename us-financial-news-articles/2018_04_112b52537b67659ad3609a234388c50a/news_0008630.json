The situation is still very fluid, and currencies, like dollar/yen, will remain hostage to each turn in equities,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.\n“Focus shifts to Friday’s U.S. jobs report for now, as steady economic fundamentals are about the only factor that can neutralise the negative effects stemming from political risks,” Ishikawa said.\nAgainst the Swiss currency, another perceived safe haven along with the yen, the dollar was little changed at 0.9601 franc after rising 0.2 percent overnight.\nThe euro nudged up 0.05 percent to $1.2285, adding to the previous day’s modest gains.\nThe common currency still remained within reach of a two-week low of $1.2254 plumbed on Tuesday after a survey showed the euro zone’s manufacturing boom stumbled for a third month in March as optimism waned and demand ebbed.\nThe Australian dollar extended the previous day’s surge, when it was lifted by better-than-expected domestic retail sales data, to reach a nine-day high of $0.7726.
