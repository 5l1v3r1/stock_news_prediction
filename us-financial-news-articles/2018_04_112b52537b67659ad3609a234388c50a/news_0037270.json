The Company has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation who owns 25% of the mine. The Copper Mountain mine has a large resource of copper that remains open laterally and at depth. This large exploration potential is being explored over the next few years in order to fully appreciate the property's full development potential. Recently, Copper Mountain's acquisition of Altona Mining Limited has been completed which brings with it approximately A$30M cash, the Cloncurry project with development-ready Eva Copper Project and an extensive exploration potential in the acquired ~ 4,000 square km (379,000 hectare) mineralized land package within the highly prospective Mt. Isa inlier area in Queensland, Australia.\nAdditional information is available on the Company's web page at www.CuMtn.com .\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of\nCOPPER MOUNTAIN MINING CORPORATION\n\"Jim O'Rourke\"\nJim O'Rourke, P.Eng.\nPresident & CEO\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (together, \"forward-looking statements\") within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
