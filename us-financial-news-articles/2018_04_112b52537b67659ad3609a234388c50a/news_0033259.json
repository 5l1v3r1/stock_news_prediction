Banks have long complained the tests are too opaque.\nHe will also propose easing liquidity requirements for big banks that are not global, as part of a broader effort to tailor rules to firms’ size and risk profile. During his six months in office, Quarles has already proposed easing other aspects of annual bank stress tests and begun work to simplify the so-called Volcker Rule banning banks from making profit-seeking trades on their own account.\nLast week, the Fed also proposed simplifying capital rules by making them more sensitive to firms’ business models, a move that could potentially ease the capital burden for some banks.\nReporting by Katanga Johnson Editing by Michelle Price and Meredith Mazzilli\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:57:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
