Some of those more than 40 Syrian missile interceptors, he suggested, might have hit civilian targets. \n“When you shoot iron into the sky without guidance, it will inevitably fall to earth,” McKenzie told reporters. \nPentagon spokeswoman Dana White warned that Russia was actively attempting to sow confusion about the attack. \n“The Russian disinformation campaign has already begun. There has been a 2,000 percent increase in Russian trolls in the last 24 hours,” White said. \nThe prime target of the operation was the Barza Research and Development Center in the greater Damascus area, which McKenzie noted was “one of the most heavily defended aerospace areas in the world.” \nBarza took the brunt of the fire, with 57 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 19 Joint Air to Surface Stand-off missiles. \nThough some of Syria’s chemical weapons infrastructure was still left, “I think we’ve dealt them a severe blow,” McKenzie said, adding it would set the program back for years. \nDespite severely damaging the infrastructure with the strikes, McKenzie said the Pentagon would not rule out that the Assad government still had capability to use such weapons again. \n“There’s still a residual element of the Syrian program that’s out there,” he said. \n“I’m not going to say that they’re going to be unable to continue to conduct a chemical attack in the future. I suspect, however, they’ll think long and hard about it.” The U.S. Navy guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey fires a Tomahawk land attack missile April 14, 2018.
