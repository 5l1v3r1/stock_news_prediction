The export ban imposed by the U.S. on China-based telecommunications company ZTE Corp. should serve as a lesson to other businesses about what happens when a company lies to the U.S. government.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department stung ZTE with a seven-year ban this week after it accused the company of making false statements since striking a $1.19 billion settlement last year over export-controls and sanctions violations. “Law enforcement hates nothing more than being lied to,” Douglas Jacobson, a partner at the international trade-focused firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, told Risk & Compliance Journal’s Samuel Rubenfeld .
