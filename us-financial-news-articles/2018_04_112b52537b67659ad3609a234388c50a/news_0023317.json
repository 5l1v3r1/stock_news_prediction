Yi said foreign ownership caps on Chinese securities and life insurers — which are currently being raised to 51% from 49% — will be totally abolished in three years. \nBy the end of this year, Yi said China will launch a trading link connecting the Shanghai stock market to London’s. Talks to do that, he said, are making “good progress.” \nIn addition, Yi introduced several new measures. He said that by the end of June, China will expand the permitted business scope for foreign insurance agents and will quadruple the daily quota allowed for foreign investors to buy mainland-traded stocks and for Chinese investors to purchase Hong Kong-traded stocks.
