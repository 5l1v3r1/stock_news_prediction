Ludovic Marin/Pool via Reuters \nFormer prime minister Manuel Valls and Socialist Party head Olivier Faure said the separation of church and state must remain a mainstay of political life, in a country where public service employees are banned from wearing Muslim veils and other dress with religious connotation. \nGay rights groups, who fought a bitter campaign against the Church over the introduction of same-sex marriage in 2013, were also critical. THE ROLE OF ISLAM \nRaised in a non-religious family, Macron was baptised a Roman Catholic at his own request when he was 12.
