He stopped 15 of 16 shots in the final period.\nThe Hurricanes pressed for a tying goal, first pulling goalie Cam Ward and then going on a power play when Hayes went to the penalty box with 1:14 to play.\nCarolina required a miracle, as even after winning Friday night at Washington, it needed to win its remaining four games and have the New Jersey Devils go without a point the rest of the season in order to have a chance to slide into the Eastern Conference playoff field. The Hurricanes had won four of their previous five games.\nThe Rangers, who had been previously eliminated from postseason contention, won for only the second time in their last eight games.\nJeff Skinner scored Carolina’s goal. Ward made 18 saves.\nThe goal for Sproul, a 25-year-old defenseman, was his first of the season and the second of his career.\nHayes scored in a short-handed situation as the Rangers posted two goals on five shots in the second period. Hayes’ goal continued a frustration for the Hurricanes on special teams as they had a tough time with penalty killing earlier in the week.\nSkinner put the Hurricanes on the board with 11:53 remaining with his 24th goal of the season, taking a pass from Derek Ryan.\nThis was the first of four consecutive games to end the season for the Rangers against Metropolitan Division opponents.\nThe Rangers won their first three meetings with the Hurricanes by a combined score of 17-5, so this was a tighter contest, with Carolina dominating the shots (41-20).\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:33:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
