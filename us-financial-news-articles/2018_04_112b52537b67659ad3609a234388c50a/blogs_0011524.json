Bregman struck against Baltimore right-hander Miguel Castro (0-1) immediately after Derek Fisher moved into scoring position with a steal of second base.\nBregman followed by dumping a slider into left field, providing Houston its first lead of the day en route to beating Baltimore for the third straight time.\nOne inning earlier, the Astros erased a 2-1 deficit against Bundy, with Marwin Gonzalez dropping a bunt that scored Jose Altuve from third. Altuve advanced an extra base when Josh Reddick singled to right and Anthony Santander followed with an errant toss to the infield.\nBundy allowed just one earned run on five hits and two walks with eight strikeouts over six innings. That tally came on an out, with Astros center fielder Jake Marisnick driving home Reddick with a run-scoring groundout in the second inning, pulling the Astros even at 1-1.\nAstros left-hander Dallas Keuchel labored through his five innings, tossing 104 pitches while issuing four walks. His defense offered spotty support, with Altuve losing a popup in the first inning that allowed Beckham to score the first run with one out in the top of the first inning.\nThe Orioles (1-5) extended their lead to 2-1 in the fourth when first baseman Danny Valencia scored on a throwing error by Gonzalez at shortstop. That was the first of two errors for Gonzalez, who was filling in for Carlos Correa. Keuchel allowed two runs (one earned) on five hits while striking out three batters.\nThe Houston bullpen enjoyed greater efficiency. Hector Rondon fanned two batters in the sixth inning before fellow right-hander Brad Peacock (1-0) worked three scoreless innings to earn the victory, allowing two hits while posting five strikeouts. With the tying run on base in the ninth, Peacock struck out Orioles second baseman Jonathan Schoop, who had three hits on Wednesday and went 7-for-13 in the series.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T14:16:54.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
