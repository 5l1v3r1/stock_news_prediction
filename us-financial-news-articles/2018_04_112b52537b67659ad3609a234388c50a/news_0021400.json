REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nBroadcaster SBS has reported that a prosecution investigation into the corruption scandal that led to the downfall of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye had uncovered e-mails linking the tech giant to efforts to secure votes for Pyeongchang’s third bid to host the Games. \nSBS said it had obtained copies of e-mails between Samsung officials and Papa Massata Diack, who has been accused by France’s financial prosecutor of being part of a corruption racket involved in determining the Olympic host cities. \nDiack is the son of the former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Lamine Diack, who is under investigation for alleged corruption in France.
