I think you can expect a strong focus from us in this area.”\nASIC will also highlight information on how Australian law prohibiting misleading or deceptive conduct will apply in this space.\nThe cryptocurrency or ICO market is still small in Australia but Price said there was a “certain level of opportunism... because it is seen as an easy, low regulation, low cost option which could lead to immature businesses coming to market.”\nASIC is wary that the stories that come out about such businesses will have a negative impact on investor confidence over time, Price added.\nICOs are popular with start-ups as a way to finance projects. But regulators in several countries including China and South Korea are trying to rein in the global boom in trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nSouth Korea prohibited ICOs in September but they are creeping back into the country by using overseas listings for local trading.
