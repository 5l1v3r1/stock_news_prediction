He pointed to how data out of the euro zone and the U.K. had missed expectations whereas U.S. economic data had surpassed projections.\nExpectations about inflation are also set to play a role in the dollar's move higher, Kathy Lien, managing director of foreign exchange strategy at BK Asset Management, said in a note.\n\"[S]teady growth and rising inflation expectations should foster further gains in the dollar ... as investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve will use the May meeting to prepare the market for a June hike,\" Lien said.\nAhead, the Federal Open Market Committee's May policy meeting and the release of nonfarm payrolls later this week will likely be in focus.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
