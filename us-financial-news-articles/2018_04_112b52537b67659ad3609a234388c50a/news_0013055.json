A Tesla logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nTesla said on March 29 that it would voluntarily recall about 123,000 Model S sedans built before April 2016 and sold globally in order to replace bolts in the power steering component. The company said in the original announcement that the bolts could corrode in very cold climates. A failure would result in a loss of power steering assist, the company said.
