Last quarter, Citigroup’s effective tax rate fell to 24 percent from 31 percent in the first quarter of 2017. \nRevenue from Citigroup’s fixed income trading business fell 7 percent to $3.4 billion in the first quarter, but that was offset by a 38 percent hike in equity trading sales. Overall trading revenue grew by 3 percent in the first quarter to $5 billion. \nCitigroup said the sharp rise in stock trading revenue was a byproduct of increased market volatility in equity markets. The S&P 500 has posted 28 moves of at least 1 percent. The index posted just eight moves of that magnitude all of last year. \nThe company also said its global consumer banking business saw a revenue increase of 7 percent to $8.4 billion amid “growth across all regions.” Revenue in North America rose 4 percent to $5.2 billion while Latin America sales gained 15 percent to $1.3 billion. \nHowever, Citigroup’s net interest income and margin both fell just short of expectations. Net interest income totaled $11.17 billion for the first quarter, while net interest margin came in at 2.64 percent.
