However, the Red Sox had already roughed up the Japanese star for three runs and four hits in the opening two frames.\nIt was clear right from the start that Ohtani’s fate would be quite different than his previous start on April 8, when he didn’t allow an Oakland A’s batter to reach base until the seventh inning. Betts led off the game with the first of his three homers. The Boston right fielder also homered in the third and eighth innings.\nIn the second inning, Ohtani (2-1) gave up an RBI single to Brock Holt and a sacrifice fly to Andrew Benintendi as Boston increased its lead to 3-0. Ohtani also walked two in the inning, matching his walk total in his first two starts combined, covering 13 innings.\nOhtani, who made 66 pitches in the two innings, was replaced to start the third, and things only got worse for Los Angeles. Luke Bard was tagged for five runs in the inning, all five coming in on home runs. Jackie Bradley Jr. and Holt each had a two-run shot, and Betts hit a solo homer for an 8-0 lead.\nOhtani saw his ERA jump from 2.08 to 3.60 after having eight days between starts. He was originally scheduled to start Sunday in Kansas City, but that game was rained out. The Angels were idle Monday.\nThe Red Sox wound up with 15 hits, including six home runs. Rafael Devers joined Betts, Bradley Jr. and Holt as the Boston players who went deep.\nRed Sox starter David Price (2-1) got the win after a leisurely five innings, giving up one run and three hits. He struggled some with his control, walking four, but he also struck out six while making 78 pitches.\nThe Angels’ only run came on an RBI single by Albert Pujols in the third inning. Pujols, though, was ejected after arguing a called third strike that ended the fifth inning. It was his ninth career ejection.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
