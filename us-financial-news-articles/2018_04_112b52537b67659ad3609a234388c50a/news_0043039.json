The new issue sent the Norwegian firm’s shares down 10 percent.\nAkastor, an investment company controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, also plans to invest $75 million to help finance the acquisition.\n“Financially it’s a very attractive deal, which should give us a return of 12 to 20 percent over the next six years,” Akastor Chief Financial Officer Leif Borge told Reuters, adding that his firm wanted closer ties with Odfjell.\nIn total, Odfjell plans to raise $618 million, including $325 million in secured bank debt, to pay for the rig, upgrades, project supervision and working capital.\nOdfjell told investors it was talking with yards for pricing potential newbuilds for further fleet expansion to compete with companies such as Transocean or Seadrill.\nOdfjell operates four modern harsh-environment floating rigs, working in the North Sea under long-term contracts with BP , Statoil and Aker BP.\nThe North Sea has seen the biggest increase in demand for harsh-environment floating rigs, with utilisation rates rising to more than 90 percent in 2018, Odfjell’s presentation to investors showed.\nHistorically, utilisation rates at 85 percent or above were needed for drillers to demand higher prices from oil companies.\nTo finance its new rig, Odfjell issued 38 million new shares on Thursday at 36 Norwegian crowns ($4.61). The company also said it planned to offer 4.3 million shares at the same price to other shareholders to reach the initial target of 1.56 billion crowns.\nThe stock was trading at 35.55 crowns at 1305 GMT.\n$1 = 7.8171 Norwegian crowns Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:07:14.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
