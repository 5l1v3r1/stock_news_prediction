The former Catalan leader was arrested as he entered Germany last month on a Spanish-issued arrest warrant. \nThe ruling means Puigdemont, who fled Spain five months ago for Belgium after Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy dismissed his regional administration, cannot be tried for rebellion in Spain once extradited on the lesser charge, a German court spokeswoman said. \n“The court must now decide if extradition for embezzlement is a possibility,” said spokeswoman Frauke Holmer.

REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nAsked by Reuters whether the German court was correct to say Puigdemont could not now be put on trial for rebellion, neither the Spanish government nor the Supreme Court would comment. \nThe German court said the rebellion charge Puigdemont faced in Spain was not a criminal offence in Germany, while the violence component that would justify a high treason charge was also lacking. \n“The actions for which the subject is being prosecuted would not be criminal under German law,” the court spokeswoman said. \nThe charge of rebellion can bring up to 25 years in prison in Spain. \nThe German court set bail at 75,000 euros ($92,000). \n“There is a risk of flight,” the court said in its explanation of its decision to grant bail. “But since extradition on rebellion charges is impermissible, the risk of flight is substantially lessened.” \nPuigdemont entered Germany on his way back from Finland to Belgium, where he had been living in self-imposed exile.
