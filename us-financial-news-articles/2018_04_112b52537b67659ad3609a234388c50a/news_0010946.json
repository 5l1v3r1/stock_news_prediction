Outlook on growth, inflation and the way RBI perceives the developments abroad will be important to watch out for,” Jasani said.\nThe Nifty bank index gained as much as 1.6 percent, with State Bank of India and ICICI Bank Ltd up more than 2 percent each.\nReporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T08:53:05.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
