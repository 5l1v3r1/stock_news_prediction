REUTERS/Thomas Peter The plan comes after the government seized control of Anbang in February and said its chairman had been prosecuted, highlighting Beijing’s willingness to curb acquisitive conglomerates as it moves forward with a campaign against risk.\nThe money will come from a non-government bailout insurance security fund for the insurance industry which will temporarily take a stake in Anbang during the restructuring of its shareholding, the government work group said in Wednesday’s statement.\nThe insurer will start the selection of new private strategic investors as the capital injection takes place, the work group said.\nLarge private companies in elderly care, healthcare and fintech are welcome to take part in the restructuring, it said.\nAnbang’s current registered capital remains at 61.9 billion yuan.\nReporting by David Lin and Engen Tham in Shanghai and Shu Zhang in Beijing; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T06:25:04.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
