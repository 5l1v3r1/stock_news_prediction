Left-handed closer Brad Hand induced a game-ending double play to earn his fifth save.\nBlach had allowed only one walk through the first four innings when Padres third baseman Christian Villanueva opened the fifth with a swinging bunt single for the Padres’ first hit since the third inning Thursday.\nAlthough Villanueva was forced out at second on a grounder by Freddy Galvis, Austin Hedges followed with a single, and an error by Giants first baseman Brandon Belt on Carlos Asuaje’s grounder loaded the bases. Asuaje was originally called out but the call was reversed on appeal.\nRoss then hit an opposite-field liner to right to break the scoreless tie. After a force out at the plate, Jose Pirela also lined an opposite-field drive to right to make it 2-0.\nThe Padres widened the lead to 4-0 on three straight hits to open the sixth — back-to-back doubles by Hunter Renfroe and Villanueva and a run-scoring single by Galvis.\nBlach gave up four runs (three earned) on seven hits and a walk with three strikeouts in five-plus innings.\nThe Giants scored an unearned run in the seventh on Joe Panik’s second single of the game. Padres center fielder Franchy Cordero returned it to a four-run margin with his second homer in three games in the bottom of the seventh.\nEarlier Friday, the Padres announced that right-handed starting pitcher Dinelson Lamet will have “Tommy John” elbow reconstruction surgery and miss the entire 2018 season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:04:13.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
