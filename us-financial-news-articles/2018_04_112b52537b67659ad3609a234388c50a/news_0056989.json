[L8N1S13Y8]\nThe authorities say that nearly 1,200 migrants mostly from Syria, Pakistan, Libya and Afghanistan have entered Bosnia since the start of 2018 and almost as many were intercepted at the border.\nThey have warned that impoverished Bosnia cannot cope with a steep increase in the number of migrants expected with warmer weather. It has only one center for asylum seekers and another one for illegal migrants, both of which are full.\n“Migrants who have entered Bosnia and Herzegovina will be adequately assisted and authorities are already trying to find new locations to accommodate them in a human and dignified manner,” the government said in a statement.\nMany volunteers, non-governmental organizations and ordinary residents, some of whom were also refugees in Western countries after Bosnia’s 1992-95 war, are providing food and accommodation to migrants, many of whom sleep outdoors.\nThey say their numbers are double the official estimates.\nReporting by Maja Zuvela; Editing by Daria Sito-Sucic and Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T17:52:24.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
