That will be overkill or counter productive to economic growth and the momentum that is currently happening,” said Dody Budi Waluyo, a Bank Indonesia (BI) deputy governor. \nHe also said the room for any more cuts was “small” and the board of governors had taken into account global risks when deciding the level of the rate, including the possibility of a trade war and rising interest rates in the United States.
