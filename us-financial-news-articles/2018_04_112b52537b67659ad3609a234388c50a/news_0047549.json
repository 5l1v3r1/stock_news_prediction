From the beginning, I’ve said—including to the president—that Mr. Mueller’s investigation must be allowed to run its course. But I will vote against the bill, because it is unconstitutional.\nI believe it is in President Trump’s best interest to allow the investigation to run its course, because I believe it will vindicate him. It is in the country’s best interest, because it will provide definitive answers to questions that have embroiled our politics now for over a year. Firing Mr. Mueller would be a grave error. It would trigger a crisis, possibly even impeachment. It would threaten many of the administration’s accomplishments and make continued progress virtually impossible.\nI endorse the message the special-counsel bill is meant to send. But I take seriously the responsibility to ensure that the laws Congress passes comport with the Constitution. The concept of an independent prosecutor, insulated from political pressure, has an appeal. In a nation like ours, governed by the rule of law, what grounds could there possibly be for a president to retain the power to fire a prosecutor investigating potential presidential misconduct?\nBut whatever the superficial attractiveness of an independent prosecutor, it is foreign to our system of government. The Constitution divides authority among three branches. The executive, legislative and judicial departments are meant to guard jealously their own prerogatives. Through this separation of powers, the American system assures that no branch may subvert the others. It ensures the long-term security of citizens’ rights and liberties by preventing any branch or individual from becoming too powerful.\nMany, myself included, have supported independent prosecutors in the past. Experience has shown that was a mistake. Freed from political accountability and meaningful oversight, independent prosecutors become a law unto themselves. They rove about seeking charges to bring to justify their existence. Justice Antonin Scalia, in his famous dissent in Morrison v. Olson (1988), made plain why prosecution must be an executive function. Decisions to prosecute or not involve a variety of considerations—legal, practical and political. Resources are finite. Someone must be held accountable when an investigation goes awry, and that person is the president.\nThe special counsel must be permitted to complete his investigation. President Trump should not, and I believe will not, end the investigation. That is why I plan to join several colleagues in supporting a resolution to convey to the White House the sense of the Senate that Robert Mueller should be left to complete his work.\nWhat I will not do—and what I urge my colleagues to reject—is subvert our constitutional design in favor of momentary urgencies. You cannot protect the rule of law by violating the supreme law of the land.\nMr. Hatch, a Utah Republican, is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T07:47:19.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
