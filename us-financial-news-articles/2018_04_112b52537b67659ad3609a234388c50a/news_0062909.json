In the United States only accredited investors, or those with a net worth of $1 million, will be able to participate, Haba said. Non-U.S. individual investors can purchase the token depending on regulations in their countries.\nBlockchain, which first emerged as the system powering cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared database that is maintained by a network of computers connected to the internet.\nAndra’s new coin is one of many ventures that have sought funding through public offerings: creating tokens on a blockchain and selling them to investors.\nAbout 80 percent of Andra’s portfolio is in late-stage firms that have raised at least two rounds of funding from established venture capital companies, according to a company document that explains the offering. The remaining 20 percent will be in early-stage ventures.\nMany late-stage private investments, which currently total about $500 billion, are limited to affluent limited partners and a few institutional investors, Haba said.\nAndra has created 1 billion coins, priced at $1 per token, to raise $1 billion overall, Haba said.\nAndra says it hopes investors can post significant capital appreciation over 30 to 60 months - the estimated investment time frame to maximize returns for late-stage companies.\nMost VCs have an average fund life of eight to 12 years. When a fund attracts investors, Andra said there is no system to determine the period in which the capital will be available.\nAndra’s coin, on the other hand, can be immediately sold following the initial issuance.\nAndra Capital said over a 10-year period, it is targeting an internal rate of return (IRR) of 30 percent.\nThe top 5 percent of VCs have a 40 percent IRR over eight to 12 years, but they are very exclusive and limited to the well-connected and wealthy. Meanwhile, the average IRR for the median and top quartile VCs over the past ten years are 12 percent and 20 percent, respectively, according to the Andra document.
