He recorded his 41st career double-digit strikeout game and second this season and narrowly missed his 17th career complete game.\nThe right-hander threw 79 of 116 pitches for strikes and held Seattle’s left-handed hitters to one in 13 at-bats before Kyle Seager singled with two outs in the ninth. He recorded eight strikeouts on three pitches while throwing first-pitch strikes to 21 hitters.\nThe Indians won for the 67th straight time when providing Kluber with at least four runs.\nCody Allen allowed a two-out double to Mitch Haniger and a three-run homer to Mike Zunino. Allen recovered and ended the game by retiring Ben Gamel on a lineout to shortstop Francisco Lindor.\nLindor, Michael Brantley, and Edwin Encarnacion homered in the first inning off Erasmo Ramirez (0-2). Yonder Alonso and Yan Gomes hit back-to-back homers in the sixth.\nBrantley lifted a sacrifice fly for the other run.\nThe Indians hit five homers for the first time since Sept. 7 in an 11-2 win over the Chicago White Sox. Cleveland homered five times at home for the first time since a 10-2 win over the New York Yankees on July 8, 2016, in a game also started by Kluber.\nIt was the first time five different Indians players homered in the same game since April 30, 2013, against the Philadelphia Phillies.\nCleveland also hit three homers in an inning for the first time since the second inning on Aug. 27 at Kansas City. The Indians hit three homers in the first inning for the first time since July 8, 2016, against the Yankees.\nRamirez became the first Mariner since Jason Vargas on June 20, 2012, at Arizona to allow five homers. He also became the fourth Mariner to allow five homers in a game, tying a team record.\nHe also became the first starting pitcher to give up at least five homers to the Indians since Toronto’s Pat Hentgen on May 26, 1995.\nRamirez allowed six runs and nine hits in five-plus innings.\nHaniger hit a two-run homer for the Mariners, who allowed five homers for the first time since June 13 at Minnesota and 49th time in team history.\nLindor made it 1-0 eight pitches into the game by lifting a 2-2 fastball into the right-center field seats for his fifth career leadoff homer.\nWith two outs, Brantley slugged drove a 1-0 fastball over the center field fence and Encarnacion hit a 0-2 slider into the right field seats.\nAfter Brantley’s sacrifice fly in the fifth, Alonso made it 5-0 with a drive to straightaway center Two pitches later, Gomes made 6-0 with a drive down the left field line.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:45:05.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
