He gave no further details on the identity of the suspect. \nChina’s embassy in Stockholm declined to comment. \nChinese forces entered Tibet in 1950 and took control in what the government terms a “peaceful liberation”. \nInternational human rights groups and exiles routinely condemn what they call China’s oppressive rule. They say pervasive surveillance and displays of military force are being used to intimidate and quell dissent. \nChina rejects the accusations. \nThere are around 140 Tibetans living in Sweden, according to the Tibetan Community in Sweden.
