He said he agreed after they promised he wouldn’t appear on TV.\nThen dosed with a tranquilizer pill and fitted into an orange prison vest, he found himself blinking before state-television cameras. He apologized for violating the law and then spent almost two years in prison on the outskirts of Shanghai. \n“They had cheated me very explicitly,” Mr. Humphrey wrote, in a report released Tuesday by human-rights group Safeguard Defenders. \nRelated \nChina Confirms Detention of Hong Kong Bookseller Snatched From Train (Feb. 6, 2018) Chinese Activist Wang Yu Seen ‘Confessing’ in Video (Aug. 1, 2016) Swede’s Crime Confession on China TV Rattles Foreign Groups (Jan. 21, 2016) British Investigator Says Chinese Officials Tried to Force Confession (June 18, 2015) The report exposes new details about the forced televised confessions that have become a fixture of China’s justice system since President Xi Jinping came to power five years ago. The Asia-based Safeguard Defenders in its report documents 45 televised confessions by activists, business executives, journalists and others in what many describe as a humiliating ordeal. \n“Among all the tactics we have seen President Xi’s government deploy to silence its critics, this one is the most eerie,” said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch. \nThe report cites accounts from Mr. Humphrey and that of at least four others alleging that police gave them false assurances that video recordings of their confessions wouldn’t be made public.\nSwedish human-rights activist Peter Dahlin said he was given a script to memorize and told that the recording of it was meant for the judges. That the video would be broadcast became obvious, he said, after a state television reporter showed up and he was told to do repeated takes in front of cameras.\nHuman-rights lawyer Wang Yu said police told her they had detained her son to pressure her into making the video confession , which was supposed to be shown to the officers’ superior. \nChina’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that anyone who violated the law in the country would be punished according to law, with their rights protected. The Public Security Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment, nor did the police authorities in Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, where Mr. Humphrey, Mr. Dahlin and Ms. Wang were held respectively. \nMr. Dahlin’s detention on suspicion of endangering state security in 2016 for his work with a legal and human-rights group he co-founded drew international attention. His group, Chinese Urgent Action Working Group, was shut down after his detention. One of the group’s co-founders went on to start Safeguard Defenders.\nMr. Dahlin said in an interview that he recently felt compelled to speak more about his own forced confession after seeing another televised statement—that of Gui Minhai, a Hong Kong bookseller and naturalized Swedish citizen. \nMr. Gui sold gossipy books about China’s leaders. In 2016, he gave a televised confession, claiming culpability for an old drunk-driving death. Later released, he was seized by Chinese security from a train in January while accompanied by Swedish diplomats. He resurfaced on video in February, saying his “wonderful life has been ruined” by Sweden’s meddling. \nMr. Dahlin said the scripted appearance appeared aimed at deflecting international criticism and preventing Swedish diplomats from accessing Mr. Gui. “I realized, OK, this is not just propaganda,” said Mr. Dahlin. “It became so clear to me that this is politically directed foreign policy. It changed my mind quite a lot.”\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T16:06:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
