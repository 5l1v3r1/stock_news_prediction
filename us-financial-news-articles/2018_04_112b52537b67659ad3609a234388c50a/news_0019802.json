This form of the disease accounts for about 85 percent of initial diagnoses, the companies said.\nMapi has tested the drug in a mid-stage study and is preparing for a late-stage trial to support marketing applications to global health regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe companies also said Mylan would invest in Mapi but did not disclose financial details.\nAccording to Israeli news website Haaretz.com here , Mylan is expected to invest a $20 million private placement in Mapi.\nBoth companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNearly 1 million people in the United States suffer from multiple sclerosis, a lifelong disease that affects the brain and spinal cord.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T16:24:22.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
