Aerial strikes and bombardment have pounded residential areas for days.\nFatimah has taken sanctuary in a relative’s house with her husband and two daughters, aged two and six months, but she cannot escape the violent sounds of war.\n“The sound of the jet is so close it feels like it is going straight through your house. The airstrikes are happening right next to you,” she said.\n“The kids are very tired and anxious from not sleeping. They don’t understand what is going on - they are scared. I know what’s going on, and I am even scared.”\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Katy Migiro.
