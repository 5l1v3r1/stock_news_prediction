He threatened to fire Mueller after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, on Monday, based partly on a referral by the special counsel.\nOther groups behind the planned protests include Friends of the Earth, the American Federation of Teachers, and veterans organizations, MoveOn said.\n“If Trump fires special counsel Robert Mueller, it will create a constitutional crisis,” said MoveOn, which recently supported the March For Our Lives gun control protest in Washington.\nThe White House said on Tuesday that Trump “believes he has the power” to fire Mueller, who has widened his probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow.\nRussia has denied that it meddled in the election, and Trump has said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia.\nFiring Mueller or Rosenstein would be akin to President Richard Nixon’s “Saturday Night Massacre” in which he ousted a number of officials investigating the Watergate scandal, said MoveOn campaign director David Sievers.\nMoveOn has called for Trump’s impeachment and is urging U.S. lawmakers to consider taking that step in the event the president fires officials involved in the Russia probe, Sievers said in a telephone interview.\nA bipartisan group of senators is expected to introduce legislation on Wednesday to protect the office of the special counsel.\nReporting By Andrew Hay in New Mexico; Editing by Frank McGurty and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T19:14:09.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
