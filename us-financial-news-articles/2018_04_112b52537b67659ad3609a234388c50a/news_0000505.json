FIRST MAJOR \nThe American world number two, and winner of his first major at the PGA Championship last August, is making only his third appearance at the Masters. \n“You want to try to win ... but just try not to win so much,” he said, raising the conundrum all golfers face in a game where only a certain level of arousal is optimal. \nThomas is channelling his inner Nicklaus. The Golden Bear was the master of just hanging around and letting others fall on their own swords. \nNicklaus won 18 major titles and was runner-up 19 times. \n“Every Sunday, when there’s anywhere from five-to-10 people who have a chance to win, about five-to-seven are going to take themselves out of it,” Thomas said. \nThe favourites in a field where everybody is 10/1 or longer odds include 2015 champion Jordan Spieth, 2017 runner-up Justin Rose, world number one Dustin Johnson and two-times champion Bubba Watson. \nBut the list of potential winners goes on an on — including, but not limited to, Jason Day, Phil Mickelson, Jon Rahm, Rickie Fowler, Paul Casey, Sergio Garcia, Hideki Matsuyama and Henrik Stenson. \nAnd occasionally the Masters throws up an unlikely winner, most recently Danny Willett in 2016. \nSo is this the year for Sweden’s Alex Noren? Probably not, but stranger things have happened.
