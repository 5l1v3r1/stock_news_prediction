Revenue was $356.5 million in this year’s first quarter compared to $341.4 million in last year’s first quarter. Operating income was $55.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 and $24.0 million in last year’s first quarter.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company completed its restructuring activities in 2017 and did not incur any restructuring or other costs in the first quarter of 2018. Therefore, no adjustments were made to the GAAP results in the first quarter of 2018. Any reference to “adjusted results” refers to the results in the comparable period in 2017. The 2017 reported results include restructuring and other costs, which are described in more detail under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Amounts” below. Restructuring and other costs reduced 2017 first quarter operating income by $31.3 million ($23.4 million after-tax or 53 cents per share).\nThe adjusted results, discussed below, eliminate the impact of the restructuring and other costs in last year’s results, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s performance when viewed together with our GAAP results. Refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Amounts” below. Sensient’s earnings per share increased approximately 9% to 89 cents in this year’s first quarter, compared to adjusted earnings per share of 82 cents in the comparable period last year. First quarter operating income was $55.7 million, compared to adjusted operating income of $55.3 million reported in last year’s first quarter. Foreign currency translation increased revenue, operating income, and earnings per share by approximately 5% compared to the adjusted results in 2017.\nThe Company completed the acquisition of the natural colors business of GlobeNatural, a natural food and ingredient company based in Lima, Peru, in the first quarter. The natural colors of this business are used in a wide range of food and beverage applications and give Sensient expanded natural colors production capacity.\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nThe Color Group reported revenue of $147.2 million in the quarter and $134.1 million in last year’s first quarter, an increase of approximately 10%. Segment operating income increased approximately 11% to $33.7 million in the quarter from $30.2 million in last year’s first quarter. Foreign exchange rates increased both revenue and operating income by approximately 6% in the quarter. The Group’s strong performance was driven primarily by outstanding new wins in cosmetics and natural colors.\nThe Flavors & Fragrances Group reported revenue of $188.3 million in the quarter and $186.9 million in last year’s first quarter. Segment operating income decreased to $25.3 million in the quarter from $28.8 million in last year’s first quarter. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by approximately 4% and operating profit by approximately 1% in the quarter. The Group’s lower profit was a result of higher onion costs, lower onion pricing, and higher fragrance raw material costs. The Company now expects the onion headwind to continue through the end of the third quarter. The Group was also impacted by higher costs and lower volumes at the production site affected by last year’s plant consolidation. The lower volumes are also due to unfavorable trends in the North American dairy industry. The European Flavor businesses, Fragrances, and BioNutrients delivered strong results in the quarter.\nThe Asia Pacific Group reported revenue of $30.3 million in the current quarter compared to $29.6 million in last year’s first quarter. Segment operating income decreased to $4.9 million in the quarter from $5.2 million in the comparable period last year. Foreign exchange rates increased revenue by approximately 4% and operating income by approximately 6% in the quarter.\nCorporate & Other reported operating costs of $8.2 million in the quarter and $40.1 million in last year’s first quarter. Last year’s first quarter includes $31.3 million of restructuring and other costs.\n2018 OUTLOOK\n“The Color Group had another strong quarter, led by cosmetics and food and beverage colors,” said Paul Manning, Chairman, President and CEO of Sensient Technologies Corporation. “We are off to a strong start in the second quarter in the Color Group. Results in our Asia Pacific Group are also off to a strong start in the second quarter. Within Flavors & Fragrances, many of the businesses continue to perform well, and the completion of the restructuring program has created a strong foundation for growth. While we now expect the onion headwind to continue through the end of the third quarter, this is a short-term issue that will resolve itself this year. I remain very optimistic about the Company’s future.”\nAs a result of higher onion costs and continued pricing pressure in the onion market the Company is updating its guidance. Sensient now expects diluted earnings per share for 2018 to be between $3.70 and $3.80. The Company’s previous guidance had been between $3.70 and $3.90.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its 2018 first quarter financial results at 10:00 a.m. CDT on Wednesday, April 25, 2018.
