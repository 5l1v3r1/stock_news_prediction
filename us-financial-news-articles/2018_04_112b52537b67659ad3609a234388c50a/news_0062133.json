I think we had a great week and without them I would not have the trophy.” Slideshow (3 Images)\nFormer world number one Pliskova trailed 2-0 in the tiebreak at the end of a tight first set but reeled off seven points in a row for an early advantage in the contest.\nAfter Vandeweghe called for the trainer following a tumble early in the second set, Pliskova raised her level and broke her bruised opponent’s serve to go up 3-2.\nPliskova saved a breakpoint in the next game to increase her lead. She then broke Vandeweghe again to make it 5-2 before the American attempted a late fightback with a break of her own.\nPliskova, however, maintained focus to serve out the match.\nVictory in Stuttgart gave world number six Pliskova a 10th career title and her first since winning the trophy in Eastbourne last year.
