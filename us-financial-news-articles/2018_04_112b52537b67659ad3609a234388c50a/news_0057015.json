Squaring off against Colorado’s No. 1 pitcher, Ross surrendered a single to the second batter he faced, gave up a run-scoring single in the second inning and lost his control in the third.\nHe started the frame with consecutive walks to Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado. Dahl followed with a triple to right field to drive in both runners. Trevor Story hit a sacrifice fly to center to make it 4-0.\nRoss (2-2) issued a two-out walk to rookie Ryan McMahon but settled down after that to get through four innings. He allowed four runs on six hits, struck out seven and walked three.\nManuel Margot had a sacrifice fly in the seventh to get the Padres within 4-1 but Tony Wolters, who had two RBIs, got the run back with a sacrifice fly in the eighth.\nThe Padres got one more run off Wade Davis in the ninth.\nThe win salvaged a split six-game homestand for Colorado, which has struggled at home. The Rockies are now 5-7 at Coors Field but are two games above .500 overall (14-12) because of a 9-5 record on the road.\nGray (2-4) had another impressive outing in his sixth start and his third against the Padres this season. In his first start against them in San Diego three weeks ago, he tossed seven scoreless innings. He lasted six Wednesday but recorded his ninth career double-digit strikeout game of his career. He allowed three hits and walked one.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:45:03.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
