These may be overhauled next week according to a report in the New York Times .\nYet, while studies have shown that the rules have led to less gasoline consumption than might otherwise have been the case, loopholes for light trucks and vehicles that can burn ethanol but rarely do have allowed manufacturers to remain within them. Meanwhile, technology has made engines far more efficient, but consumers have chosen to use most of those gains to drive bigger vehicles like SUVs.\nBy putting the onus on manufacturers rather than incentivizing consumers to translate more of that power into mileage gains, the market becomes warped. Gas guzzlers become even more profitable to sell and, because the supply of new ones is restricted, they depreciate less and consumers are less likely to scrap them as soon. That keeps them on the road longer, which matters for fuel use.\nA more direct way to affect the car fleet, and one that could raise revenue, is for consumers to pay more for actual fuel consumed through higher excise taxes. In California, for example, average pump prices are $3.49 a gallon and the most popular car is a Honda Civic which gets 42 miles per gallon on the highway. In Texas gasoline costs $2.43 and the most popular vehicle is a 26 mpg Ford F 150.\nUnfortunately such a move, while good policy, would cause much wider public outcry than endangering the environment. That probably makes it a nonstarter.\nWrite to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T08:40:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
