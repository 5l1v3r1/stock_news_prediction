This was an increase of 180 percent from the bank’s 2017 first quarter earnings of $796,000. The growth in earnings is the result of the bank’s expansion into South Florida, in addition to the continued high performance of its Central Florida offices.\n“Our team of outstanding bankers continues to impress me through their ability to outmaneuver their larger and usually cheaper competition on lending to small and mid-sized companies,” said Keith Costello, President & CEO of First GREEN Bank. “It truly is a testament to the fact that business owners still recognize the value of a local banking relationship.”\nAssets of the bank also increased substantially from $578 million to $731 million from the end of March 2017 to end of March 2018. This 30 percent balance sheet growth was seen in loan as well as deposit growth.\n“Prioritizing ethical business practices is often a rarity in the financial sector,” said founder and chairman of First GREEN Bank, Ken LaRoe. “We are proud to differentiate ourselves from the big banks out there by continuing to succeed in our goal to do banking differently – in a way that is socially and environmentally responsible, without sacrificing profit.”\nFirst GREEN Bank is a full-service financial institution, offering personal and commercial banking services such as loans, mortgages, checking and savings, CDs, IRAs and money markets.
