Wikistrat was founded in Israel in 2010.\nDuring the meeting, Zamel was asked about his business relationship with George Nader, an adviser to the U.A.E. and a witness in the special counsel's investigation , according to the report. Mueller's team also asked about Zamel's work for certain clients, the report added.\nIt wasn't clear where the questioning was leading, according to the report. The Journal suggested that Mueller's probe may be \"looking more deeply at foreign influence in Washington\" â€” beyond Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer representing Wikistrat, said neither Zamel nor the company are targets of the Mueller investigation.\n\"Neither Mr. Zamel nor Wikistrat are the targets of any investigation. Mr. Zamel is a well respected and ethical businessman with a fantastic company and a great reputation,\" Mukasey told CNBC in an email late Monday.\nThe office of the special counsel didn't respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nFor the full report on Wikistrat, read the Wall Street Journal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T08:31:14.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
