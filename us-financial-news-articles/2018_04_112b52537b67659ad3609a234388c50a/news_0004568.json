Servier will have the exclusive rights to all other countries, Pfizer said.\nAllogene is a Two River portfolio company, which was formed with $300 million from an investment consortium that includes TPG Capital, Vida Ventures, BellCo Capital, the University of California Office of the Chief Investment Officer and Pfizer.\nU.S.-listed shares of Cellectis rose 16.2 percent to $35.72.
