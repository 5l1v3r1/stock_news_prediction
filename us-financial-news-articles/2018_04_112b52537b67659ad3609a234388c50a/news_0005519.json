It is currently sold online to a 20-30 year old female, predominantly American market.\nSince being founded in 2013, Flat Tummy has grown rapidly, largely attributed to the strength of its branding and its innovative and effective use of social media marketing.

FOCUSfactor is clinically tested with results demonstrating improvements in focus, concentration and memory in healthy adults.

Developed by Kara Harshbarger and renowned celebrity dermatologist Dr. Alex Khadavi, Hand MD’s extensive clinical trials show significant improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, skin hydration, hyper-pigmentation and radiance. HAND MD launched on QVC and sold out in an astonishing 5 minutes. More information on Hand MD can be found at www.hand-md.com .\nNeuragen ®\nNeuragen ® is a topical product that works directly at the site of the pain as opposed to oral products. Neuragen ® reduces the spontaneous firing of damaged peripheral nerves. By calming these firings at the source, Neuragen ® is clinically shown to reduce shooting and burning pains quickly and without the side effects of orally taken medications. This is in part due to the small lipophilic molecules found in Neuragen ® which rapidly carry the active ingredients through the rough outer layer of the skin to the site of the pain. Neuragen ® is available over the counter in most local pharmacies either in the diabetic section or the analgesic (pain) section. For more information, please visit www.neuragen.ca .\nThe Synergy Effect ®\nThe Synergy Effect is Synergy’s fast-growth online marketing platform, a growth engine built to grow brands exponentially online. Launched in 2017, The Synergy Effect powers Synergy’s brands online, driving revenue using best-in-class digital strategy and its proprietary ROI algorithm.
