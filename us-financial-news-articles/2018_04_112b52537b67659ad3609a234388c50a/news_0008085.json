REUTERS/Paul Childs \nRiding a wave of frenetic home support, Leigh Howard, Sam Welsford, Kelland O’Brien and Alex Porter set a new benchmark in the men’s 4km team pursuit as they routed rivals England in the gold medal decider. \nThe classy quartet blazed around the Brisbane circuit in three minutes 49.804 seconds, smashing the mark of 3:50.265 seconds set by Great Britain at the Rio Olympics. \n“We’re in our home country. That is what dreams are made of. This is what we strive for every day,” said an ecstatic Welsford. \n“When I looked at the board, I had to have a second glance — 3.49 — then it was pure happiness. I just screamed and let out all the emotion. \n“I never knew how fast we were going. But we knew we were on a good one. The first under 3.50. Unreal.” \nThe Australians crossed nearly six seconds ahead of the Englishmen, striking an emphatic early blow in the track cycling battle that local media have dubbed the “the Ashes on wheels”, a reference to the nations’ fierce cricket rivalry. \nThe triumph came soon after their female compatriots set a Commonwealth record (4:15.214) in the same event, humbling silver medallists New Zealand for the gold.
