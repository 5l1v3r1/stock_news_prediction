A Goldman Sachs sign is displayed inside the company's post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nBuying Clarity Money, a free app that helps consumers manage their personal finances, is expected to add over 1 million customers to the financial service firmâ€™s Marcus business. Marcus offers tools to help customers save and borrow. Clarity Money will be re-branded as Marcus by Goldman Sachs over time, the company said. \nTerms were not disclosed. \nGoldman launched Marcus in October 2016 as a way to court Main Street borrowers saddled with credit card debt. It offers loans from $3,500 to $40,000 and targets credit card borrowers who can benefit from consolidating debt into a single loan with a lower interest rate. \nGS Bank, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, is making the acquisition. Clarity Money CEO Adam Dell will join Goldman Sachs as a partner. \n(This version of the story corrects in paragraph 4 to say that Marcus offers loans up to $40,000, not $30,000) Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault; Editing by Nick Zieminski", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T02:10:07.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
