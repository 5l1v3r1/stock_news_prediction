But that is not well understood. So we ask people, ‘what exactly do you need in your home or to run your business?’” he said.\nAccess to reliable energy is not just about providing electricity, he said.\n“It’s a catalyst for true democracy in India, for providing business opportunities. With reliable and affordable energy, everyone has the chance to run a business,” he said.\nHande has turned the business into an umbrella of organizations, each tasked with addressing gaps in energy access through marketing, selling, installing and servicing products in homes, schools and health centers across India.\nHande estimates Selco has reached 7.5 million people in India, and the model is being replicated in the Philippines and Tanzania.\n($1 = 65.2800 Indian rupees)\nReporting by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert , Editing by Katy Migiro.Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
