Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Chelsea - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - April 19, 2018 Chelsea's Victor Moses celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Andrew Yates \nChelsea had taken a 20th-minute lead through a Kevin Long own goal after the Burnley defenders attempt to clear a Moses cross ended up in his own net. \nThe Londoners were well in control of the game, making effective use of two target strikers in Alvaro Morata and Olivier Giroud after Conte opted to start with Eden Hazard on the bench ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Southampton. \nChelsea should have doubled their lead after the break when Morata broke clear but shot wide when he was one-on-one with Burnley keeper Nick Pope.

We are doing fantastic but still there is a gap in front of teams like us and many other teams,” he added, praising the way his team took the game on after falling behind.
