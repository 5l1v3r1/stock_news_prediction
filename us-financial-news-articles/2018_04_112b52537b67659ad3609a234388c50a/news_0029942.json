That would raise the risk that dealers or investors could horde bonds, which are prized as collateral in money markets, with no risk of being penalized for doing so.\nSome analysts questioned the effectiveness of the penalty to curb failed trades, while other argued its absence would have resulted in fails to be even higher.\nFails “would be even higher without it,” said Mark Cabana, head of short rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. He called the 1.0-percent floor, which will take effect on July 1, “quite reasonable.”\nThe level of fails has been on the rise in the last year or so compared with the first several years after the financial crisis receded in 2009. Over the last year it has averaged about $145 billion per week, more than twice the level in 2014, New York Fed data shows.\nBut the current level of fails is still a fraction of the huge spike seen at the peak of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, when the volume of failed trades reached nearly $2.7 trillion.\n(GRAPHIC: Failed U.S. Treasury Trades - reut.rs/2GVsSaU )\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Burns\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://reut.rs/2GVsSaU", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T04:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T06:51:33.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
