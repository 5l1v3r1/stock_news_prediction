Photo: Associated Press \nWD-40 Co. is applying some of the benefits of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate toward brand building and expanding the company’s online presence, said finance chief Jay Rembolt.\nThe company expects a blended tax rate of around 26% for the current fiscal year, about nine percentage points lower than the 2017 fiscal year, which ended in August.\nThe federal tax overhaul, completed in December, lowered the U.S. corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The legislation became effective in the middle of WD-40’s fiscal year and the company expects its full-year tax rate will eventually settle in the range between 22% and 23%.\nSome of those tax savings will be channelled into branding and online marketing. The San Diego-based company is spending an additional $1 million in the effort, Mr. Rembolt said. For the 2017 fiscal year the company posted $138 million in operating expenses, with $20.5 million in advertising and sales promotion, according to regulatory filings.\n“This is an opportunity to advance our activities across the globe digitally,” said Mr. Rembolt, who has been company CFO since 2008.\nWD-40 makes cleaning and maintenance products, including its namesake lubricant. The company’s products, packaged in distinctive blue and yellow cans, enjoy broad appeal in the U.S., Mr. Rembolt said.\n“That’s the beauty of our product, if you look in a Walmart in the U.S. you can find us in five or six different places in a store,” he said.\nIn some overseas markets, however, the product can be limited to industrial and trade channels, he added. “We want our online presence to be just as impactful as in the physical store,” Mr. Rembolt said.\nFor 2017, the company posted net sales of $380.5 million, about flat compared to the prior year, according to regulatory filings. Net income registered at $52.9 million in 2017.\nIn other capital allocation plans, the company has purchased buildings in San Diego and the U.K., Mr. Rembolt said.\nWD-40 is still seeking to clarify some aspects of the new tax legislation, he said. The company is still considering how much overseas profits to bring home, Mr. Rembolt said, hoping for further regulatory direction.\nCompanies now are required to pay a one-time tax of 15.5% on overseas profits in cash and other liquid assets and have the option to then bring those funds home. Some companies have hesitated to repatriate the cash, however, hoping for more regulatory guidance. Among the concerns executives cite is how state governments will move to capture some of the returning funds as state legislators reconcile the federal tax legislation with local law.\n“We’re evaluating these issues as we speak, we have yet to make a final determination,” Mr. Rembolt said. “We are finding some of the nuances of the new law a little less clear.”\n \nShare this: CORPORATE BRANDS strategy tax Previous The Morning Ledger: European Buyers Go on the Hunt for U.S. Targets  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T11:23:15.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
