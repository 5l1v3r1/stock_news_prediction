The migrants and rights groups say they are seeking asylum and are fleeing war and persecution. \nAbout 4,000 migrants have left Israel for Rwanda and Uganda since 2013 under a voluntary programme, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has come under pressure from his right-wing voter base to expel thousands more. \nOn Friday Uganda acknowledged for the first time that it was in talks to take in some 500 migrants, though it said it would only accept people who left voluntarily and not by forced deportation. \nIsrael started handing out notices to male migrants from Eritrea and Sudan in January, giving them three months to take the voluntary deal with a plane ticket and $3,500 or risk being thrown in jail until they are deported. \nIsrael’s Supreme Court, however, has issued temporary injunctions to give more time for petitioners to argue against the plan. \nOn Tuesday government representatives told the court that an envoy was in an African country finalising a deportation deal after an arrangement with Rwanda fell through. \nOfficial documents submitted to the court said authorities have identified close to 8,000 Eritrean and Sudanese migrants it would potentially deport under compulsory expulsion.
