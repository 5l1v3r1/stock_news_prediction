Both are Dubai government owned.\nFlydubai has taken delivery so far of six of the 250 737 MAX aircraft it has on order.\nOver 400,000 passengers used a codeshare agreement that covers 90 flights between the two airlines from November to March, Emirates said in a statement.\nFlydubai and Emirates started developing closer commercial ties last year.\nReporting by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T21:00:25.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
