It also gets support from the Swedish aid agency SIDA, the World Bank, United Kingdom’s DfID and the United States Aid Agency USAid.\nThe fund was formally registered in November, but it had been working on the bond plan for three years, Bunyi said, adding that once it takes off in Kenya, it will be replicated elsewhere.
