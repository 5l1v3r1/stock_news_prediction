Summy and LeBlanc are two of 24 attorneys across the nation who were honored in this category.\nIn 2017, Scott Summy played a key role in representing hundreds of victims of the 2017 California wildfires, led a team that successfully defeated a Monsanto Co. motion to dismiss PCB contamination lawsuits, and introduced the first GenX water contamination lawsuit in the country against Chemours. In January 2018, Summy and his team successfully won their petition to coordinate all North Bay Fire-related litigation brought against PG&E in the San Francisco Superior Court. Summy is one of the most successful water contamination litigators in the U.S. He has recovered more than $1 billion for clients.\n“I am honored to be named by the National Law Journal and my peers to the Plaintiff’s Lawyers Trailblazer List,” said Summy, who leads the firm’s Environmental Litigation Group. “For nearly 30 years, I have worked alongside many talented individuals to expose environmental contamination concerns across the nation and hold those responsible accountable for their actions. Our work on behalf of our clients and the environment is truly rewarding on its own; receiving this honor only strengthens our commitment to what we do.”\nBurton LeBlanc, who manages Baron & Budd’s Baton Rouge and New Orleans offices, started practicing law in the 1990s to help secure justice for people in his home state of Louisiana who were injured by their exposure to carcinogenic materials, such as asbestos. Today, he is filing lawsuits on behalf of public entities across the country against the manufacturers and distributors of prescription opioids, tackling one of our nation’s most pressing public health issues in what is already being compared to the historic 1990s litigation against tobacco companies. Baron & Budd now represents 275 cities and counties and 10 percent of the U.S. population that have been severely impacted by the opioid epidemic.\n“All of us at Baron & Budd care deeply about the work we do for our clients,” said LeBlanc. “My passion for the law started many years ago when I saw my community suffering from the effects of harmful corporate negligence and continues today through my work fighting the companies responsible for the opioid epidemic. While we don’t do what we do for the awards, it is certainly an honor to be recognized by the National Law Journal in this way. I pledge to continue ‘blazing trails’ along with my colleagues in the pursuit of justice.”\nABOUT BARON & BUDD, P.C.\nBaron & Budd, P.C. is among the largest and most accomplished plaintiffs’ law firms in the country.
