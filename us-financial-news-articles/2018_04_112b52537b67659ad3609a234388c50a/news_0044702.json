There’s not much happening in EM today, and on a Friday there’s a lot of position squaring and that’s weighing on the rand,” said currency dealer at TreasuryOne Andre Botha.\nThe dollar was up 0.42 percent at 1500 GMT against a basket of major currencies, while the two-year U.S. Treasury yield at 2.449 percent, its highest level since around September 2008.\nIn the equities market, the Johannesburg all share index rose 0.1 percent to 57,581 points, while the benchmark top 40 index inched 0.07 percent higher to 50,765 points.\nEmbattled retailer Steinhoff International, which held its much anticipated annual general meeting, pared gains after earlier rising to 3.23 rand. It closed 1.95 percent higher to 2.61 rand after it said it was in talks with creditors about restructuring its debt.\nSteinhoff, which runs chains such as Poundland and Mattress Fir, is fighting for survival after discovering holes in its accounts. The scandal has wiped billions off its stock market value and triggered a cash crunch.\n“They say that they will have their results finalised by December. It is a year later but at least we know when to expect audited results,” said an equities trader at Independent Securities Vasili Girasis.\nTobacco company British American Tobacco recovered slightly from Thursday’s slump when weak results from Philip Morris in the U.S. dented cigarette makers. It closed 1.17 percent higher to 626.25 rand.\nReporting by Patricia Aruo and Mfuneko Toyana Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:56:13.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
