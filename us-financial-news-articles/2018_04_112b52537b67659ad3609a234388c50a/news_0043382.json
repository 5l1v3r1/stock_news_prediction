Chris Goodney—Bloomberg via Getty Images By Sy Mukherjee April 19, 2018 \nIn what would make for a blockbuster acquisition, Japanese pharmaceutical giant Takeda is continuing its hunt for rare disease drug maker Shire. But Shire isn’t making things easy: The firm has already rebuffed Takeda’s advances on three separate occasions, including a recent cash-and-stock offer that would value the deal at $62.5 billion . And Reuters reports that another huge industry player , Botox maker Allergan, may try to scoop up Shire from under Takeda’s nose (see our update below). Shire stock (shpg) was up 4% in early Thursday trading while Allergan (agn) shares fell 5%. \nTakeda confirmed the M&A rumors amid mounting speculation, stating Thursday that the company was “notified that the Board of Shire had rejected” its most recent buyout proposal. “Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing,” the company said. Allergan released a statement shortly thereafter confirming that “it is in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire” but has not yet made an official offer. ( UPDATE: Allergan put out a second statement Thursday indicating that it may not be interested in buying Shire after all: “In order to comply with the requirements of the UK Takeover Code, Allergan announced that it does not intend to make an offer for Shire.”) \nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations. \nSnatching up Shire, whose portfolio includes the best-selling ADHD drug Vyvanse, would be a transformative deal for either Takeda or Allergan. Takeda, Japan’s largest drug maker, has been on the hunt to expand its global footprint , particularly through acquisitions and partnerships. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders is notorious as a serial acquirer and bolt-on biotech M&A evangelist. But a deal to buy Shire would be a far bigger move for the company, which itself was slated to be bought by Pfizer in a mega-deal that was ultimately scuttled in 2016 . \nShire raked in $15.2 billion in 2017 revenues . An acquisition of the company would be the biggest pharmaceutical deal of the year, which might hearten investors who lamented the laggard pace of M&A in the industry last year. \nThis post has been updated to reflect Allergan’s new statement indicating it may not pursue Shire after all.
