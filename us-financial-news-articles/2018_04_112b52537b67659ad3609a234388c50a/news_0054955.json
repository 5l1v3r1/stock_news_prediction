It would keep its dividend unchanged at 0.40 euros per share.\nOperating income before depreciation and amortisation (Oibda) was 3.86 billion euros ($4.70 billion) compared with analysts’ forecast of 3.86 billion euros.\nTelefonica - which also offers services in Britain, Germany and throughout Latin America - had revenues of 12.19 billion euros in the first quarter compared to 13.13 billion euros a year earlier while net profit was 837 million euros compared to 779 million euros.
