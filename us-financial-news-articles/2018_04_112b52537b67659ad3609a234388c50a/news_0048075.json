Whitt and Thomas S. Gayner, Co-Chief Executive Officers, commented, \"Our underwriting results for the quarter were solid and reflect profitable growth from recent acquisitions as well as our continued focus on underwriting discipline. Comprehensive loss to shareholders and book value per share were impacted by declines in both our fixed income and equity portfolios, driven by an increase in interest rates and unfavorable movements in the equity markets during the period. However, we continue to maintain a long-term focus with our investment strategy. Contributions from our Markel Ventures operations reflect both organic growth and the recent acquisition of Costa Farms.\"\nThe Company also announced today it has filed its Form 10-Q 2018 A copy of the Form 10-Q is available on the Company's website at www.markelcorp.com or on the SEC website at www.sec.gov .
