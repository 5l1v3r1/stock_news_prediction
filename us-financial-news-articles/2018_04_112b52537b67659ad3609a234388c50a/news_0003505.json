Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Liverpool - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - March 31, 2018 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring their second goal with Trent Alexander-Arnold REUTERS/Dylan Martinez \nRunaway Premier League leaders Manchester City travel to Liverpool in the first leg of an all-English Champions League quarter-final clash on Wednesday. \nSalah is set to pose the biggest attacking threat to City, having already scored 37 goals in all competitions this season, including one in Liverpool’s 4-3 league victory over Pep Guardiola’s side in January. \nWhen asked if Salah has the attributes to beat City’s well-drilled defensive line, Van Dijk said, “That’s what everyone knows. That’s how we feel as well. \n“He’s that kind of player that you just need to be on your best. When he is 100 percent and in the zone then he can beat anyone.

Nobody feels better than each other, everybody is working hard for each other to get the win,” the Dutch centre back added. \n“That’s a very good thing to have in a team. Everyone knows our team spirit and without all of us Mo wouldn’t have scored his goals. Everyone needs to be giving 100 per cent and I think we do that.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T07:32:54.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
