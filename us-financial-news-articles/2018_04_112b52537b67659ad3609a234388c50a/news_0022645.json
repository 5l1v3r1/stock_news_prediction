The newspaper said it’s unclear what terms the two sides are considering. \nThe failure of those talks left Sprint alone to face a competitive wireless market, invest in its long-starved network, address billions of dollars in debt and figure out a way to gain subscribers without losing money. The company will need to spend as much as $6 billion annually in the next several fiscal years on upgrades, officials said in March. \nTo stabilize its finances and obtain funds, No. 4 Sprint has issued more than $7 billion in bonds backed by its wireless spectrum. \nBoth companies have controlling shareholders. Japan’s SoftBank Corp. owns almost 85 percent of Sprint, while T-Mobile is controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom AG. \nDave Tovar, a spokesman for Sprint, declined to comment. T-Mobile didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. \nOverland Park, Kansas-based Sprint jumped as much as 17 percent to $6.41 in New York trading, its largest intraday gain since mid 2016. T-Mobile, based in Bellevue, Washington, climbed as much as 8.1 percent to $64.56, the biggest increase since October 2016. \nSprint Capital Corp. 8.75% notes due 2032 climbed as much as 9 cents to trade at 113.5 cents on the dollar Tuesday, the biggest jump since 2015, according to Trace bond price reporting data.
