However, thanks to gains earlier in the week all were on track for weekly gains.\nMeanwhile Mexico’s peso, treading water on the day, was on track to rack up a 2 percent loss over the week - the biggest such fall since December. Mexican markets were spooked by the strong performance in opinion polls by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. A late Wednesday poll by polling firm Mitofsky showed Obrador pulling further ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) (Reporting by Karin Strohecker Additional reporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Peter Graff)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:47:37.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
