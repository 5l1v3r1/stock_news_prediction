The portfolio includes 1,006 existing apartment homes, 110 apartment homes under construction, and 185,000 square feet of office and retail space. This “A” quality portfolio is located primarily in the Center City and University City submarkets of Philadelphia. Details on all six communities are:\nResidential Year Opened/ Community Submarket Units Renovated The Left Bank University City 282 2001/2017 777 South Broad Center City 146 2010 Locust on the Park Center City 152 1999/2017 SouthStar Lofts Center City 85 2014 The Victor Camden 341 2004 One Ardmore Place Lower Merion 110 Expected Completion: 2019 Total 1,116 The acquisition will be initially funded with $290 million of existing property debt, $65 million borrowed on the Aimco bank line, and $90 million in operating partnership (“OP”) units issued at Aimco Net Asset Value of $53 per share. Consistent with its paired trade discipline, Aimco plans to sell lower-rated apartment communities to reduce debt making the acquisition leverage neutral. One of the communities expected to be sold is Chestnut Hill Village, a 704-home community built in 1963 and located in northeast Philadelphia.\nThe transaction is expected to be neutral to property level free cash flow and to increase expected future returns (as measured by free cash flow internal rate of return) by about 150 bps considering the properties to be sold and the OP units to be issued. In addition, Aimco expects that certain of the properties have the potential for accretive expansion opportunities which could further enhance investment returns.\nPro forma the paired trade, Aimco will own 3,208 apartment homes in the Philadelphia area, representing about 10% of its GAV, up from 8% today. The acquisitions are expected to close in 2Q18, except for the purchase of One Ardmore Place which is expected to close in 1H19, after completion of construction.\nCitigroup acted as exclusive financial advisor to Aimco on the transaction.\nAbout Aimco\nAimco is a real estate investment trust focused on the ownership and management of quality apartment communities located in select markets in the United States.
