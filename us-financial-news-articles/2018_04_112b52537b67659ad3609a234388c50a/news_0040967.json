If we split the match into periods we were the best team for many of these periods,” United manager Jose Mourinho, bidding for a third trophy for United since taking over from Louis van Gaal in 2016, said. \n“We lost control after the 1-0. At halftime we spoke — we came back late for the second half because we spoke a lot — and organised ourselves.” \nSanchez, who has struggled to hit the heights since joining United from Tottenham’s arch-rivals Arsenal in January, finds Wembley an inspiring backdrop and took his goal tally there for club and country to eight with a tireless display.

CRUCIAL INTERVENTION \nAlli was also denied a second as Phil Jones made a crucial intervention while at the other end Romelu Lukaku headed over after a rare United foray forward. Slideshow (14 Images) \nUnited, however, weathered the storm and were level after 24 minutes. Mousa Dembele was out-muscled by Paul Pogba out wide and the Frenchman’s cross was headed expertly past Michel Vorm by Sanchez — one of the smallest players on the pitch. \nTottenham were the width of the post away from re-taking the lead on the stroke of halftime when Eric Dier’s daisy-cutter flicked off Chris Smalling’s shin and on to the upright. \nTottenham’s superior possession lacked conviction in the opening stages of the second half and there was a sense that Mourinho’s United were in game-management mode. \nThey struck in the 62nd minute with Sanchez this time cutting a pass across the area which fell to Herrera who steadied himself before firing a shot through the legs of Ben Davies and past a slow-to-react Vorm. \nWith United’s fans in full voice and a sea of red at Wembley’s west end, Spurs barely threatened David de Gea’s goal in the closing stages as their 10-year trophy drought continued. \nUnited could even have added to their lead with Pogba forcing a smart save from Vorm. \nPochettino has now suffered a League Cup final defeat and successive FA Cup semi-final losses with Tottenham. \n“We are disappointed because we are so close,” he said. \n“We need to think, move on, finish the season and try to finish in the top four.” Reporting by Martyn Herman;  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T21:53:14.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
