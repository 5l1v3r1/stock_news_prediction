The University is already taking steps that must be further expanded in the areas of its investments, research, education, estate and policy decisions,” Toope’s letter said.\nWhen asked about Dudley’s comment, a spokesman for the activist group said “if the University is unable to divest its endowment in line with the democratic wishes of students and staff due to these threats, then there is no longer academic independence at Cambridge.”\nThe world’s top oil and gas companies are facing rising pressure from investors to shift to cleaner energy and renewables in order to meet international targets to sharply reduce carbon emissions by the end of the century.\nDudley said that BP was going to invest around $500 million per year in renewables in the coming years, but that the world will need oil and gas “for many years to come.”\n$1 = 0.7154 pounds Reporting by Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-24T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:27:13.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
