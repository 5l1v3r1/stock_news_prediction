Citizenship status in Italy is commonly registered by local town halls.\nKatumbi’s spokesman did not respond to multiple requests for comment about his boss’s nationality. In a video released on Monday, Katumbi said no one could contest his Congolese nationality, but did not deny he had held Italian citizenship.\nThe millionaire businessman is seen as the opposition’s leading candidate in December’s election. He has said the accusations were the latest attempt by President Joseph Kabila’s government to derail his candidacy.\nKabila, in power since 2001, is barred by term limits from standing for re-election. But opponents suspect he intends to try to change the constitution to run again, or further delay the poll, which was originally due in 2016.\nKabila has refused to publicly commit to not standing again and blamed election delays on a slow voter registration process. That uncertainty has stoked violent street protests in which dozens of people have been killed.\nKatumbi was forced into exile in May 2016 when prosecutors accused him of hiring foreign mercenaries and he was sentenced the following month to three years in prison for real estate fraud. He denies all the charges against him.\nAccording to a poll released last week, Katumbi would place first in the presidential election with 24 percent of the vote.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T13:44:31.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
