[ reut.rs/2HwpC5n ]\nSingapore’s reputation for a good education system attracts students from across Asia and beyond.\nTan Jia Yan, 32, worked for a tuition centre that offered money-back guarantees to Chinese students if they failed to pass exams and get a place in a Singapore polytechnic.\nTan pleaded guilty on Monday to 27 charges of cheating.\nTogether with her colleagues, Tan helped attach “wearable Bluetooth devices” and skin-coloured earphones to the students which were connected to discreetly placed mobile phones when they sat their exams in 2016.\nTan then sat the exams herself as a private candidate and used a camera phone attached to her chest to send video footage of the paper to her colleagues via Facebook’s Facetime app .\nHer colleagues would then call the students to tell them the answers.\nCourt documents said the “highly sophisticated” operation ran between Oct. 19 and Oct. 24, 2016, before it was uncovered by an invigilator.\nTan faces up to 3 years in prison or a fine, or both, per charge.\nThree of her colleagues, including principal of the Zeus Education Centre, had also been charged, but were contesting the charges, media reported.\nThe principal allegedly worked with a Chinese associate, who would refer students to him, court documents said.\nFor each student referred, the associate allegedly received S$8,000 ($6,100) in deposit fees and another S$1,000 ($763) in admission fees.\nThe court documents said the six students were witnesses in the case.
