Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal and soyoil. \n\"We're very rapidly seeing a realignment in soybean trading,\" said international agricultural trade and policy consultant John Baize, president of John C. Baize and Associates. \nBaize said Argentina could import 500,000 to 1 million tonnes of U.S. soybeans this year. \nBulk imports of U.S. soybeans are rare, although Argentina typically brings in some soybeans from neighboring Paraguay. \nArgentina will need soybeans by October, a time when crushers in the South American country usually lack sufficient domestic supplies, and the crushers want to make sure they have enough after this year's drought. Argentina exporter chamber spokesman Andr√©s Alcaraz said the U.S. soybeans sold this week would be crushed and exported as soymeal and soyoil. \n\"The industry already had a lot of idled capacity and now it is going to have even more because it does not have grain,\" Ezequiel de Freijo, chief economist at Argentinas Rural Society producers' group, said of soybeans. \nEuropean buyers have also scooped up cargoes of U.S. soybeans in recent days. U.S. soybeans have been a relative bargain due to surging prices in Brazil. \nChina, which buys about two-thirds of global soy exports, was favoring Brazilian supplies and threatening to impose tariffs on U.S. soybean imports to retaliate against U.S. tariffs on China's electronics and other goods. \nSoybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade initially plunged 5 percent after China announced the proposed tariffs but have recovered all of those declines. \nCBOT May soybeans finished up 3 cents at $10.50 per bushel, after earlier reaching $10.64, the highest since March 9.
