Slideshow (2 Images) \nIt would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster haemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs. \nBut it would be a big financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds, is worth a lot more than Japan’s biggest drugmaker, which has a market capitalisation of 4.1 trillion yen (22.11 billion pounds). \nTakeda’s shares lost almost 5 percent of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the size of any deal the Japanese firm would have to make to seal its record-breaking purchase of the London-listed company. \nShire’s shares were trading at 38.71 pounds shortly after Takeda confirmed its latest bid. \nBritish Botox maker Allergan PLC ( AGN.N ) said on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire before deciding otherwise.
