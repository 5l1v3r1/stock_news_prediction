There is no change to the policy Turkey has been carrying out,” Bozdag told reporters in Qatar.\n“We do not have a united policy with the United States on the YPG issue, and Turkey’s stance has not changed. We are also against the unconditional support for the (Syrian) regime and we are at odds with Iran and Russia on this,” he said.\nWhile Turkey is cooperating with both Russia and Iran to wind down some of the violence in Syria, Ankara has long demanded that President Bashar al-Assad must go and has backed rebels against him. Assad’s main supporters are Moscow and Tehran.\nTurkey has also been at loggerheads with Washington over U.S. support for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers a terrorist organisation linked to Kurdish militants waging a decades-long insurgency in Turkish soil.\nTurkey supported the air strikes by U.S., British and French forces, saying the move sent a message to Assad.\nBozdag said Turkey did not hesitate to work together with any country who defended “correct principles” on Syria.
