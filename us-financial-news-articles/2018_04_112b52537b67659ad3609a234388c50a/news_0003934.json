I’m very pleased with my six-under,” said the three-times major winner. “Goal accomplished for the week.” \nMost pleasing for Spieth on Sunday was his short putting, which has been a weak link in his game recently. \n“On and around the greens I’ve been looking for what’s been off,” said the Texan. \n“Today was able to have pressure-packed putts where I trusted what I have been working on from the beginning of the week and it still looked good to me and the ball started on line. \n“That combination is how I get back to the putting I’m used to seeing. I’ll just try to nail it in the next few days.” Spieth acknowledged he would probably would need further improvement to have a chance of a second green jacket, but was optimistic. \n“I’ve made some big strides from my last couple of tournaments so I’m very excited for what next week holds,” he said.
