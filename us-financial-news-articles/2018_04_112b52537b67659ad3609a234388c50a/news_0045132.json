Trump abandoned it during his first weeks in office, saying it was not a good deal for the United States.\n\"I don't want to go back into TPP, but if they offered us a deal that I can't refuse on behalf of the United States, I would do it,\" Trump said.\n\"But I like bilateral better. I think it's better for our country. I think it's better for our workers, and I much would prefer a bilateral deal, a deal directly with Japan,\" he added.\nTrump last month imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports that have been in place for about three weeks.\nHe said the tariffs had brought many countries to the negotiating able and that he may take them off of steel and aluminum imported from Japan if the two countries can come to a trade agreement.\nThe Trump administration granted temporary tariff exemptions to several other U.S. allies but not Japan. Just after the tariffs took effect, South Korea agreed to a permanent steel exemption in exchange for a new quota that effectively cuts its steel shipments by 30 percent.\nAbe said that Japanese steel and aluminum did not \"exert any negative influence\" on U.S. security.\n\"It's our position that the quality of Japanese products is high and many of these products are difficult to be replaced with. They are greatly contributing to U.S. industries and employment,\" Abe said.
