All four will start at Goodwin upon completion of their notice period.\n“Graham, Kristopher, Jonathan, and Andrew make up a truly unique, cross-border team that represents the life sciences industry’s key players – from emerging and later stage biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies across their full life cycles, to boards and venture firms across all of their dealmaking needs – on both continents,” said Mitchell Bloom , Chair of Goodwin’s Life Sciences practice. “The type of deals they focus on, their networks, a loyal client following, and industry expertise make this team a perfect fit for our growing life sciences platform and significantly expand our cross-border capabilities.
