Photo: The Wall Street Journal\nThe insurance industry faces unintended exposure to added tax liability on routine payments, due to a provision in the U.S. tax overhaul, according to the head of global tax for American International Group Inc.\nInsurance companies must often conduct business through a foreign affiliate in an overseas jurisdiction. Those payments — for actual insurance losses and other costs — are subject to the base-erosion and anti-abuse tax provision, dubbed BEAT, said Angela Bekker, head of global tax for AIG. The measure was designed to make it harder for companies to shift profits offshore.\nPayments such as commissions, claims and benefits disbursed overseas could leave companies vulnerable, she said during the 18th Annual New York University/KPMG Tax Lecture conference in New York Wednesday.\n“It seems counterintuitive to the intention of the provision. This situation poses an issue for insurance companies.”\nCompanies subject to BEAT must have averaged at least $500 million in gross receipts annually for the prior-three year period in the U.S. The American units of these companies must also make over a specified level of tax-deductible payments to related companies abroad.\nWith those conditions met, U.S. units have to pay a minimum tax on their U.S. profits after adding back in certain types of deductions. The minimum rate is 5% in 2018, but rises to 10% in 2019 and 12.5% in 2026.\nA call to the Internal Revenue Service seeking comment was not immediately returned.\nMs. Bekker didn’t specify how much greater AIG’s tax liability could be because of the new provision. She said that she expected addition guidance and regulation would come trickling out of Washington to help clarify the grey area of the new tax legislation, signed in December.\nBEAT “could impact us dramatically, especially in a year where we have high claims,” Ms. Bekker said.\nShare this: AIG INSURANCE U.S. TAX OVERHAUL Previous Denmark’s Ørsted “Ready” for Projects in the U.S., Taiwan, CFO Says Next The Morning Ledger: Merkel in Last-Ditch Effort to Dodge Trade Fight Between U.S., EU ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T13:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T15:49:25.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
