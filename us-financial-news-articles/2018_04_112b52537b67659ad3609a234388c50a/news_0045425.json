China has ramped up military exercises around the island over the past year.\nThe Chinese manoeuvres come at a time of heightened tension between Beijing and Taipei and follow strong warnings by Chinese President Xi Jinping last month against Taiwan separatism.\nXi presided over the navy’s largest-ever military display this month in the South China Sea, which involved 76 fighter jets and a flotilla of 48 warships and submarines.\nChina’s military activities and growing assertiveness has worried its neighbours as well as the United States, whose Pacific command called China a “disruptive force” in January.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T12:00:20.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
