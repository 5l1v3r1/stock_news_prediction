The S&P 500 fell 0.31 percent to 2,654.7 and the Nasdaq Composite declined 0.26 percent to 7,058.23.\nThe list of decliners were similar to Wednesday’s, when the United States and China announced tariffs on $50 billion of each others’ imports.\nBoeing, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, fell 1.12 percent. Caterpillar declined 1.3 percent and Deere dropped about 2 percent.\nChipmakers, which as a group rely on China for about a quarter of their revenue, also declined. The Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 0.54 percent.\nEight of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, led by a 0.6 percent drop in financial stocks as the case for further rate hikes dimmed after soft jobs data.\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 103,000 last month, the Labor Department said, the fewest in six months and lower than economists’ forecast of 193,000 jobs.\nAverage hourly earnings rose eight cents or 0.3 percent last month, above the expected 0.2 percent increase. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 percent for a sixth straight month.\n“That’s not showing us wage inflation where the Fed would have to step in. This seems to be a natural improvement,” said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy, Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Omaha, Nebraska.\nInvestors will also tune into Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech at an event later in the day for signs the central bank could raise rates more than the expected two more times this year.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 1.41-to-1 ratio and for a 1.28-to-1 ratio favoring decliners on the Nasdaq.
