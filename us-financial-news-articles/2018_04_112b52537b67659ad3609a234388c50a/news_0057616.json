The deal fulfills requirements set by the European Commission and other regulatory authorities.\nThe deal is subject to the closing of the Monsanto acquisition.\nThe businesses being sold include the global vegetable seeds business, certain seed treatment products, the research platform for wheat hybrids and certain glyphosate-based herbicides in Europe. The businesses generated total sales of about $899 million, or 745 million euros.\nBayer sold other crop science units to BASF in October.\nReuters reported earlier this week that Bayer's takeover of Monsanto was on track to receive U.S. antitrust approval by the end of May, if there are no last-minute complications. The companies have said they hope to have the deal complete in the second quarter.\nMore from St. Louis Business Journal:\nGNC to close 200 stores\nUniversity of Missouri system has $5.4 billion impact on state economy\nMoviePass says all is well.
