(Nasdaq:QNST), a leader in performance marketing products and technologies, today announced preliminary financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFor the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects to report revenue of over $115 million, representing growth of more than 45% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be greater than 8%. There were no acquisitions in the quarter.\nFurther details and final results will be released in the Company’s normally scheduled quarterly earnings call, on May 1. Guidance on FYQ4 and full FY2018 will also be covered on that call. The Company expects positive business momentum to continue. Dial-in details are discussed below.\n“Our strong and improving financial performance continues to be driven by good results for our clients and media partners, and by our significant competitive advantages,” commented Doug Valenti, CEO of QuinStreet.\n“We have reviewed the negative report published about QuinStreet by Kerrisdale Capital Management and feel compelled to respond given its invalid claims and conclusions, and its negative impact on our stock price. QuinStreet management has never been contacted by Kerrisdale. We are disappointed they would make such sweeping claims without contacting us. Kerrisdale claims are inaccurate, out-of-context and exaggerated, and their conclusions about our prospects are demonstrably wrong.\n“QuinStreet’s business model and relationships with clients are based on the performance of our marketing and media programs for them. That means both consumers and our clients must be satisfied for us to sustain our business, let alone grow revenue. We believe that our financial results are evidence of the continuing success of our model and results in media and with clients,” concluded Valenti.\nConference Call Tuesday, May 1, 2018 at 2:00 P.M.
