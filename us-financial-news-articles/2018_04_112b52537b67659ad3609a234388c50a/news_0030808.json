Many in recent years have removed themselves from consideration, either scared off by the size and cost of the Games or pressured by local opposition. \nA bid exploration committee estimated last year that Calgary would need C$2.4 billion ($1.91 billion) in funding to cover the shortfall between revenue and costs if it were to host the sporting extravaganza. \nAustria’s Graz, Swedish capital Stockholm, Sion in Switzerland, Turkey’s Erzurum, Japan’s Sapporo and an Italian bid involving Cortina d’Ampezzo, Milan and Turin have all expressed interest in hosting the 2026 Games. \nThe International Olympic Committee session in October will invite candidates to bid formally and a host city will be selected in September, 2019. \n($1 = 1.2576 Canadian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T21:47:07.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
