Increased Financial Results Includes Earnings Per Share of $0.51 for Year Ending 2017\nKiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Corporation ( KWBT ) (“Kiwa Bio-Tech” or the “Company”), a leading manufacturer of biological fertilizers promoting eco-friendly agriculture and smart-soil technology, is pleased to announce the financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 that included earnings per share of $0.51.\nFiscal 2017\nRevenues of $17,270,069 up 80% compared to 2016 of $9,620,929.

Although accounting for only 10 percent of arable land throughout the world, China produces food for 20 percent of the world population. Our goal is tied closely to the demand of safe food and green agriculture for the world largest population. In 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has issued Circular No. 2017-02 to target zero growth in the use of chemical fertilizers. In February 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture of PRC has carried out measures to replace 20% of chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers for fruits, teas, and vegetables by 2020, which created a 30-billion-dollar market for eco-friendly fertilizer products. In 2017, the PRC State Council issued statements to promote agricultural structural reform on accelerating the cultivation in the agricultural development. The company expanded its business operations to include soil restoration for farmland in China. The Kiwa smart-soil technology is already being supported by the government in China.\n\"We are pleased to report solid results for the fiscal year in which we achieved or surpassed all of our 2017 financial outlook metrics. Our results continue to validate the strength of our market positions. Over the past year, our brand continues to gain market share in China.
