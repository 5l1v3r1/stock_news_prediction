I think he’s a fantastic person,” Mr. Trump said in comments aboard Air Force One, returning to Washington from an event in West Virginia.\nAsked whether he was bothered by the controversies tied to Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Trump said: “I have to look at them. ... I’ll make that determination. But he’s a good man, he’s done a terrific job. But I’ll take a look at it.” Earlier, asked if he has confidence in Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Trump responded: “yes.”\nThe White House said this week it was conducting a review of Mr. Pruitt’s activities after news reports that he had rented accommodations in Washington at below-market rates from the family of an energy lobbyist. Mr. Pruitt also has faced questions over his travel expenses and had a testy interview with Fox News when he was pressed over large pay raises reportedly given to two EPA employees.\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters that Mr. Trump was aware of the controversies.\n“He knows. I mean, he reads the papers, he watches TV, he knows the reports that are floating around out there. And they do raise questions and we expect that Administrator Pruitt answer those questions.”\nMr. Gidley said the president expected Mr. Pruitt to adhere to the “highest levels” of ethical standards.\nMr. Pruitt has defended his living arrangements and said he reversed the pay raises given to two staff members once he found out about them. On the travel costs, the EPA has said that Mr. Pruitt’s protective service detail moved him to a higher class due to security protocols.\nA White House official said Thursday that Mr. Trump likes Mr. Pruitt personally but believes the controversies surrounding the EPA chief are “troubling.”\nMr. Pruitt has been contrite in his explanations to the White House, but aides were also unhappy about news reports that Mr. Trump made a supportive phone call to Mr. Pruitt on Monday night. News of the call came from the EPA, not the White House, the White House official said.\nA separate White House official said Mr. Pruitt’s interview on Fox News, in which the secretary blamed pay raises on his staff and took umbrage over other questions, was “a disaster.”\nThe New York Times reported late Thursday that Mr. Pruitt had reassigned or demoted several officials who raised concerns about spending and management at the EPA.\nAn EPA spokesman responded to the report by calling the officials “disgruntled employees who have either been dismissed or reassigned.” \n—Peter Nicholas and Michael C.
