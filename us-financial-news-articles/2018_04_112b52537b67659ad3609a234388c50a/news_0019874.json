CONSTRUCTION SAGS AGAIN, TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS \nConstruction output in February dropped 1.6 percent month-on-month after a 3.1 percent plunge in January - confounding the consensus expectation for a 0.7 percent rebound. \nThere was some anecdotal evidence that heavy snow in late February had hurt construction output, although the effect was difficult to quantify, the ONS said. \nSeparate figures on Britain’s trade performance brought better news, however. \nBritain’s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world narrowed to 10.203 billion pounds ($14.48 billion) in February from 12.228 billion pounds in January - the smallest gap since September and better than all forecasts in a Reuters poll which had pointed to a deficit of 11.95 billion pounds. \nThe fall reflected a sharp drop in imports rather than an improvement in exports, both in value and volume terms. \nMarc Ostwald, a market strategist at ADM Investor Services, part of farm commodities company Archer Daniels Midland, said snow had disrupted truck drivers at ports on Britain’s west coast. \n“There are days when ports do more loading or offloading, and so the impact on the trade balance depends on the days hit by the weather,” he said. \n($1 = 0.7045 pounds) FILE PHOTO: A worker attaches electrical wires to a component on the factory floor of PP Control and Automation near Cannock, Britain July 6, 2016.
