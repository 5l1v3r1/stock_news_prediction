(Nasdaq:MKTX), the operator of a leading electronic trading platform for fixed-income securities, and the provider of market data and post-trade services for the global fixed-income markets, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"Trading volumes and commission revenue benefited from a modest improvement in market volatility during the quarter,\" said Rick McVey, Chairman and CEO of MarketAxess. \"MiFID II implementation led to record trading volumes and post-trade revenue. Open Trading activity continues to grow, driving meaningful transaction cost savings and improved liquidity for our clients.\"\nFirst Quarter Results\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 11.4% to $114.7 million, compared to $103.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income was $60.2 million, compared to $55.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 9.1%. Operating margin was 52.5%, compared to 53.6% for the first quarter of 2017. Net income totaled $47.9 million, or $1.27 per share on a diluted basis, compared to $42.5 million, or $1.11 per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nCommission revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 9.3% to $102.8 million, compared to $94.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Variable transaction fees increased 2.5% to $79.8 million on total trading volume of $465.0 billion for the first quarter of 2018, compared to variable transaction fees of $77.8 million on total trading volume of $394.4 billion for the first quarter of 2017. U.S. high-grade trading volume as a percentage of FINRA’s high-grade TRACE trading volume increased to an estimated 18.0% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to an estimated 15.9% for the first quarter of 2017.\nAll other revenue, which consists of information services, post-trade services and other revenue, increased to $11.9 million, compared to $8.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in all other revenue was principally due to higher post-trade services revenue of $2.1 million and information services revenue of $0.9 million.\nTotal expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased 14.1% to $54.5 million, compared to $47.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in total expenses was largely due to higher occupancy costs of $1.9 million, employee compensation and benefit costs, mainly due to an increase in headcount, of $1.6 million and technology and communication costs of $1.2 million. Occupancy costs in the first quarter of 2018 include duplicate expense recognized during the build-out phase of the Company’s new corporate offices in New York. The duplicate expense had the effect of increasing total expenses by $1.7 million and reducing diluted EPS by $0.03. Other income (expense) increased to $0.8 million from $0.4 million due to a $0.4 million increase in investment income as a result of higher investment balances and an increase in interest rates.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 21.4%, compared to 23.6% for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 income tax provision reflected a reduction in the federal income tax rate and other changes associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) and $1.8 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the quarter. The first quarter of 2017 income tax provision included $5.8 million of excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. The Company continues to monitor guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury that could cause changes to the interpretations and assumptions made by the Company to account for the impact of the Tax Act.\nEmployee headcount was 429 as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 compared to 391 as of March 31, 2017.\nDividend\nThe Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per share of common stock outstanding, to be paid on May 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2018.\nShare Repurchases\nA total of 30,500 shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2018 at a cost of $6.3 million.\nBalance Sheet Data\nAs of March 31, 2018, total assets were $589.3 million and included $400.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Total stockholders’ equity as of March 31, 2018 was $537.2 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nTo supplement the Company’s unaudited financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and free cash flow. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken into consideration with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, are important in understanding the Company's operating results. See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of GAAP net income to EBITDA and GAAP cash flow from operating activities to free cash flow.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nRichard M.
