The often violent demonstrations over four months last year left 125 people dead.\nThat song is by the band The Ministry of Supreme Unhappiness, a play on the widely mocked Vice Ministry of Supreme Happiness that Maduro created in 2013 just as the country’s economy was unraveling.\nThe effort is being organized by rights group Provea, which says rock music is more likely to reach young people than human rights reports that are typically clogged with statistics and complex legal language.\nThe 1,000 discs will be handed out as part of activities for civil society organizations, said Provea coordinator Rafael Uzcategui, though the music is also available online.\nThe United States hopes to use the Summit of the Americas in Peru, which starts on Friday, to urge greater regional pressure on Venezuela.\nThe event is likely to gain less regional attention after U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made disparaging comments about Latin American immigrants, canceled his attendance.\nIn the past, the summit has gotten more attention from what happens on the sidelines rather than the agreements themselves. The 2012 gathering in Cartagena, Colombia, for example, was dominated by scandal over U.S. Secret Service agents hiring prostitutes.\nEditing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:00:46.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
