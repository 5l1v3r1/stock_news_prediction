The bus was transporting them to their shifts at the Modikwa platinum mine operated by African Rainbow Minerals and Amplats.\nThe compiled incidents range from roadblocks to wildcat strikes to physical assaults against miners.\nOn average over the period, either a roadblock, wildcat strike, march or act of violence took place in the region every second day which affected a mining operation in some way.\nThe data does not give estimates on production or revenue losses and does not compare with earlier periods. But it provides a sobering snapshot of a region in a perpetual state of unrest that has undermined the viability of some operations.\nIt shows that from Jan. 1 2016 to March 31 of this year, there were 225 roadblocks in the region that disrupted mining operations. These typically involve protesters who halt traffic with burning tyres and other debris.\nOver the same period, there were 14 marches that were sanctioned by authorities and 107 illegal marches, which meant they did not receive police permission in advance.\nThe period also saw 40 wildcat strikes or work stoppages and there were at least 55 recorded acts of violence.\nThe operations most affected in terms of the sheer number of incidents were Bokoni, a mothballed joint venture shared by Amplats and Atlatsa Resources, which recorded 122, and Impala Platinum’s (Implats) Marula mine, which had 102.\nBokoni suffered 68 roadblocks over the period while Marula was hit by 56. A spokesman for Impala said the local police and the companies shared such data among themselves which is updated on a regular basis.\nIn the 2016 financial year, Marula lost 10,000 ounces of almost 80,000 ounces of production.\nThe often violent disruptions of its operations had raised concerns about Marula’s viability last year.\nA nearby community chrome project, which had triggered violent protests by locals who felt excluded from its revenue stream, was restarted earlier year, leading to a decline in community disruptions and a return to profit for the mine.\nThe least affected was Amplats’ Twickenham operation, which is now used for research and development. It only suffered one roadblock during the period and had no other incidents recorded.\nModikwa had 19 roadblocks and three acts of violence. The data was compiled before last week’s killings took place.\nMuch of the discontent stems from the stark juxtaposition of joblessness and grinding poverty atop some of the world’s richest platinum reserves. Amplats says the unemployment in the area, set amid rolling green hills, is close to 80 percent.\nLocal resident Tumi Shai, in his mid-20s, idly played a makeshift board game for gambling with dice fashioned from a piece of cardboard set on top of plastic crates. He has a high school diploma but no job.\n“They could do more there’s lots of money here. These business people make millions. We just survive by gambling,” he told Reuters.\nEditing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:57:59.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
