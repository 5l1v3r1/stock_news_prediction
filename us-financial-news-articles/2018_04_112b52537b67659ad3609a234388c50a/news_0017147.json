The rouble plunged more than 4 percent against the dollar to its lowest since late-2016.\nSpeaking at the Boao Forum for Asia in Hainan province, Xi vowed to open China’s economy further, protect intellectual property of foreign firms and he criticised a “Cold War mentality” as obsolete, in his first public comments since the trade dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration erupted.\nXi’s comments prompted a largely positive reaction in financial markets, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat U.S.-China tariffs will escalate into a full-scale trade war that would threaten global growth.\nEuropean markets followed Asia with solid gains. Germany’s DAX rose 0.8 percent, France’s CAC 40 0.51 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 0.59 percent.\nThe U.S. S&P 500 E-mini futures gained 1.15 percent, suggesting U.S. shares would open positively.\nThe MSCI World Index rose 0.34 percent.\n“In the current environment markets are grabbing at the slightest hint. Today’s message from Xi contained nothing really new but it seemed like a conciliatory tone and so the market is just grabbing at that,” said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank in Copenhagen.\n“It goes back to the fact that there is still uncertainty on trade wars and even if we get a slight indication that it won’t be the worst case scenario, the market reacts positively,” he said, while predicting ongoing trade tensions throughout 2018.\nOil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. Brent crude futures climbed more 2 percent to $70.12.\nAfter trading flat for most of the day, the euro surged when European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters that the central bank could stagger the process of raising euro zone interest rates by first lifting its sub-zero deposit rate back toward positive territory.\nThe euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.2378 and left the dollar down across most major currencies aside from the Japanese yen.\nThe yen, which traditionally rises in times of market stress, fell versus both the dollar and euro. The dollar rose to as high as 107.245 before giving up some of those gains.\nSafe haven bond prices including 10-year Treasuries initially dropped as risk appetite recovered.\nGold rose 0.2 percent.\nThe Australian dollar, which has fallen in recent weeks because of the economy’s exposure to global trade flows, gained against the dollar, as did Asian currencies including the Chinese yuan\n“Xi explicitly did not continue the trade war rhetoric so this is going to be risk-friendly and the market will be relieved,” said Kit Juckes, a macro strategist at Societe Generale.\nRUSSIAN FALLS Russian financial markets sold off sharply.\nThe rouble tumbled 4.2 percent, bringing its losses against the dollar since last Friday to around 10 percent.\nRouble-denominated shares rose 0.8 percent, bouncing off multi-month lows hit on Monday when the Moscow bourse dropped 8.3 percent\nThe shares of Rusal, the aluminium giant, which, with its boss Oleg Deripaska, was highlighted prominently in the sanctions, fell a further 7.5 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday.\nIts dollar bonds maturing 2022 were trading at record lows around 52 cents, having lost half their value since the sanctions were announced.\n“It is very serious, it’s very rare that you see a country literally force a company from another country towards bankruptcy. When you are shut out of dollar funding markets, a lot of your business will just stop working,” Saxo Bank’s Garnry said, adding that Russia’s smaller role in global financial markets would limit the wider fallout.\nThe MSCI Emerging markets index was up 0.63 percent as other larger markets outside of Russia rallied.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar\nAdditional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE and Sujata Rao and Tom Finn in LONDON; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-04-10T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:05:16.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
