March was even worse with full-time positions falling 19,900.\nThe news was not all bad with annual job growth of 3.0 percent still twice the pace of U.S. job creation.\nThe unemployment rate was steady at 5.5 percent, after a downward revision to February. It has hovered between 5.4 percent and 5.6 percent for 11 months now.\nThe participation rate dipped to 65.5 percent, having peaked at 65.7 percent in January as more women entered the labour force.\nThe strength of employment has been one of the brightest parts of economy, so Thursday’s soft report would likely cause some unease at the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Growth in the resource-rich economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year as bad weather hit exports.\nJust last week the head of the central bank had predicted further gains in jobs, even as he reiterated there was no strong case for a rate rise given wage growth continued to lag.\nInvestors reacted by further paring back the chance of a hike at all this year, with rate futures implying only a 22 percent probability of a move by December.\nA rise in the 1.5 percent cash rate is still not fully priced in until June 2019. The Australian dollar was duly knocked down to $0.7767, from an early high of $0.7796.\nGareth Aird, a senior economist at CBA, suspected unemployment would have to fall quite a bit further to generate anything like the wage growth of past years.\nPartly that was due to stubbornly high levels of underemployment, where workers wanted more hours but were unable to get them. Underemployment used to track unemployment closely but has diverged markedly in the last couple of years.\nCombined with strong levels of skilled migration and the increasing participation of women, the result was to make it harder for workers to demand larger wage rises.\n“Skills shortages are not manifesting themselves for a sufficient period of time to allow workers to push for higher pay,” said Aird.\n“It might be less likely that the RBA lifts the cash rate over the next year given that it must become clear that wages growth is on a sustained upward trend before monetary policy is tightened.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole Editing by Shri Navaratnam)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T08:03:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
