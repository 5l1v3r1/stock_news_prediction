Parliament, dominated by the ruling party, will make a final choice on April 17.\nSarksyan’s ally - Armen Sarkissian, a former prime minister and ambassador to Britain - was inaugurated as president on Monday after being elected by parliament on March 2 in a vote that was meant to herald the start of a power shift to the prime minister and parliament.\nUnder the terms of an amended constitution approved in 2015 by a referendum, the presidency is meant to become largely ceremonial.\nOpposition leaders have accused Sarksyan of changing the system to ensure he stays in power, and have been holding protest rallies in recent weeks. Hundreds of protesters gathered in the centre of Yerevan again on Monday.\nArmenia, a country of around 3 million people in the southern Caucasus, seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991, but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling the economy.\nReporting by Maria Tsvetkova and Hasmik Mkrtchyan; writing by Margarita Antidze; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:01:08.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
