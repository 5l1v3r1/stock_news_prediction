The reading of 53.1 still indicates a fairly solid pace of improvement in business conditions.”\nThe final index for new orders was 53.1, below the preliminary reading of 53.2 and down from 54.7 in the previous month.\nThe new export orders index was unchanged from the advance estimate at 52.5, but down compared with a final 54.1 in February.\nJapan’s economy has expanded for eight consecutive quarters, the longest uninterrupted streak since a 12-quarter run of growth during the mid-to-late 1980s boom.\nSome economists have cautioned that the pace of growth could moderate this year because consumer spending may ebb slightly, even though strong exports performance of Japan Inc. continues to underpin the world’s third-biggest economy.
