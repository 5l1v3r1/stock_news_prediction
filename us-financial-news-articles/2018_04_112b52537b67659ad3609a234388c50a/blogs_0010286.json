And of course the value of the gift cards won’t be matched dollar for dollar. While prices vary, a $100 gift certificate, for example, would be worth $64 and some change in store credit at Bed Bath & Beyond.\nFor exact exchange rates, customers can check the Bed Bath & Beyond website . And if you really want to use that gift card to buy a toy for your kids, they will continue to be accepted at Toys “R” Us stores through April 21 (the Toys “R” Us and Babies “R” Us websites have already been shut down , so don’t try redeeming that gift card online.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T13:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T13:55:27.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
