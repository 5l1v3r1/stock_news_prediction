HSBC, BNP Paribas and Santander were top gainers, up 1.2 to 2.1 percent.\nVideo games maker Ubisoft jumped 6.7 percent, with traders and analysts pointing to the success of its latest video game Far Cry 5, which broke the franchise’s sales records.\nElectrocomponents, Britain’s largest industrial distribution firm, gained 4.7 percent after results.\nCiti strategists recommended investors “buy the dip” in stocks.\nThey also upgraded UK equities to “overweight”, arguing recent underperformance and cheap valuations made them attractive, and downgraded continental European equities to “neutral”.
