The majority of the victims were women, ranging in age from their mid-20s to early 80s.\nBefore the attack, Minassian expressed his support for incel, short for “involuntary celibate,” on a Facebook account believed to be his. The account was taken down after the rampage.\nThe following are some facts about incel:\n- On a Facebook account linked to Minassian, a posting praised Elliot Rodger a 22-year-old who killed six people in 2014 in California and who posted YouTube videos saying he was motivated by rage against women. Minassian’s Facebook posting read in part: “The Incel Rebellion has already begun.”\n- Rodger had posted three videos on YouTube entitled “Spring break sucks when you’re lonely,” “My reaction to seeing a couple at the beach ... envy,” and “Retribution.” In the clips he said he was determined to punish women who had rejected him.\n- Shortly after the 2014 murders, a 23-year-old University of Washington student, Keshav Mukund Bhide, was charged in federal court with making threatening comments over the internet, including pledging to kill women and praising Rodger.\n- Reddit, which hosts online chatrooms and bulletin boards, banned a group with 40,000 members called r/Incels in November. It said the group had violated its policy that prohibits calls for violence. Some members had lauded Rodger as a hero of the incel movement.\n- r/IncelsWithoutHate, a support group created a year ago, remains active on Reddit “for all the people ... who don’t feel the same hatred that is often expressed” in the r/Incels group.\n- Reddit also hosts IncelTears, a watchdog group that exposes extremist incel views.\nReporting by Peter Szekely; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T02:04:18.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
