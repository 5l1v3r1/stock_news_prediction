Her lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs China has become increasingly affluent, more Chinese students have been enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities, attracted by the prospect of a prestigious American education and good jobs.\nThe number of Chinese students studying in the United States in the 2016-17 academic year rose by 6.8 percent to 350,755, the Institute of International Education reported in November.\nAccording to court papers, Huang admitted to authorities that she paid $3,000 to have someone take the TOEFL exam for her and, following instructions from a broker, mailed her Chinese passport to an address in Massachusetts.\nThat passport was used by Yue Wang, a Chinese student at Hult International Business School in Cambridge who prosecutors said took the TOEFL on behalf of Huang and at least two other Chinese women seeking to gain admission to U.S. universities.\nIn each case, the women were issued student visas based on their admission to universities, prosecutors said.\nThey said that as a result of the scheme, Huang defrauded the United States by impeding the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in its administration of a program that sets standards for an international student to obtain a visa.\nWang, Huang and the two other women were arrested on immigration-related charges in May 2017. Like Huang, they later pleaded guilty and were sentenced to time served after agreeing to be deported.\nReporting by Nate Raymond; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T00:12:39.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
