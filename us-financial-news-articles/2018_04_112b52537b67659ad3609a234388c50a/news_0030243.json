Amassing over 24 million social followers, LittleThings expanded to rollout a steady stream of lifestyle content including real-life stories and videos, recipes and DIY projects. Reaching a total audience of nearly 60 million comScore unique monthly visitors, with seven million of those being millennials, the site’s exceptional video programming included the daily show “Refresh,” created and hosted by the millennial married couple Cassie and Paul Morris, and “The Hostess Next Door,” starring Chef Vanessa Cantave. LittleThings announced its last post to readers on February 28, 2018. As RockYou Media transitions LittleThings into the next phase of its life cycle, reengaging loyal followers and retaining audience engagement will be of utmost importance.\n“We are thrilled to revive LittleThings and re-engage its passionate and dedicated audience. We remain committed to the original values of the brand and will continue creating exceptional content for its followers, while expanding LittleThings onto new platforms,” said Lisa Marino, CEO, RockYou Media. “LittleThings is a terrific complement to Vocally.com and gives us further valuable insight into millennial habits as we move forward.”\nAs part of the LittleThings relaunch, RockYou Media will bring over key leaders of their executive team to keep consistency and continuity across content. RockYou Media will also retain members of the best-in-class content and social video team from LittleThings that contributed to building a digital property with such a dedicated and passionate following. While re-engaging the LittleThings audience by providing the type of content they know and love, RockYou Media is also setting out to attract new followers leveraging their stellar platform to spread the word and grow the channel’s footprint.\nMaia McCann joins RockYou Media as Editor-in-Chief and VP of Content.
