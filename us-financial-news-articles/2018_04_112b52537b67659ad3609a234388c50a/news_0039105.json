REUTERS/Murad Sezer Expectations that Western strikes on Syria last week will not escalate have also supported the greenback. [FRX/]\nThe dollar index against a group of major currencies traded 0.1 percent up at 0245 GMT.\nAmong the biggest shifts in investor sentiment, bullish bets on the Korean won and the Malaysian ringgit plummeted to their weakest in nearly eight months.\nSentiment on the Thai baht dipped to levels last seen in October.\n“The pruning of long positions in most AXJ currencies appears quite modest considering the simmering global trade and geo-political tensions,” said Reuters FX analyst Krishna Kumar.\n“The position adjustments have scarcely moved these currencies, particularly the yuan, which reflects the underlying bullish sentiment for them.”\nLong positions in the Chinese yuan and the Taiwan dollar touched a three-month low and a five-month low, respectively.\nChina’s central bank surprised markets earlier this week by cutting the amount of reserves banks must keep on reserve.\nWhile most analysts categorized the move as more of a liquidity management exercise, not a monetary policy shift, it has stirred some concerns over the health of the economy and future policy direction as a U.S.-China trade row intensifies.\nThe hefty reserve cut came hours after data showed the world’s second-biggest grew at a slightly faster-than-expected pace in the first quarter, but despite an upbeat view, economists still expect China’s economic growth to slow this year, a Reuters poll revealed.\nBullish bets on the Singapore dollar were also cut slightly, according to the poll of 10 analysts, traders and fund managers.\nBets on the Indian rupee turned bearish again after turning slightly bullish in the last poll, while investors grew even more bearish on the Indonesian rupiah and the Philippine peso.\n“The rupee is a justified exception with the jump in bearish bets reflecting its rising string of woes such as deficit concerns, political uncertainty and the rally in oil prices,” explained Kumar.\nThe peso has lost over 4 percent so far this year, making it the worst performer in the region, followed by the rupee which has fallen 2.9 percent since the start of 2018.\nThe poll was conducted between Wednesday and Thursday, with the bulk of the responses coming in by Wednesday.\nThe Asian currency positioning poll is focused on what analysts and fund managers believe are the current market positions in nine Asian emerging market currencies: the Chinese yuan, South Korean won, Singapore dollar, Indonesian rupiah, Taiwan dollar, Indian rupee, Philippine peso, Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht.\nThe poll uses estimates of net long or short positions on a scale of minus 3 to plus 3. A score of plus 3 indicates the market is significantly long in U.S. dollars.\nThe figures include positions held through non-deliverable forwards (NDFs).\nReporting by Christina Martin in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Nicole Pinto, Chris Thomas and Aaron Saldanha; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T07:58:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
