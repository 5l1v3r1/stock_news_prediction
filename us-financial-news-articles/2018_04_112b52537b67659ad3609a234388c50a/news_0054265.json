Consistent with the expectation expressed in our press release of April 9, 2018, Income before income taxes was $107 million and net income attributable to Leucadia National Corporation common shareholders was $125 million, or $0.34 per diluted share.\nRich Handler, CEO of Leucadia, and Brian Friedman, President of Leucadia, said: \"We are pleased with another quarter of solid performance across Leucadia. Jefferies' first quarter results reflect continued strong performances in Investment Banking, with net revenues of $434 million, and solid performance in both Equities and Fixed Income, with total revenues of $369 million. Investment Banking results reflect a good new-issue equity and debt environment, and another strong quarter in mergers and acquisitions. Fixed Income revenues were a strong $213 million and relatively consistent across the quarter. Equities revenues were $156 million. Our share of Berkadia’s income was $26 million, buoyed by strong originations during the quarter, and our share of HomeFed’s income was also higher than previous quarters, due to a gain from the sale of one of its assets.\n\"Our Leucadia Merchant Banking portfolio also continues to deliver strong results, with National Beef generating pre-tax income of $69 million during a typically lighter seasonal quarter for beef processing. The remainder of our merchant banking portfolio produced solid results, through either cash generation or value-building, offset partly by a $21 million mark-to-market reduction in the value of our HRG position.\n“We patiently continue to develop our alternative asset management platform. During the first quarter, we recorded losses of $78 million mainly due to two strategies impacted by exceptional volatility during the quarter.\n“Our recently announced strategic transactions, including the agreed upon sale of 48% of National Beef, the agreed upon sale of 100% of our equity interest in Garcadia and the acquisition by Vitesse Energy Finance of $190 million of additional Bakken oil and gas assets, will complete an ongoing transformation of Leucadia to a diversified financial services company. We expect these to close in the next four months.”\nAfter the end of the first quarter, through April 26, 2018, Leucadia repurchased a total of 10.3 million common shares at an average price of $24.40 per share. 14.7 million shares remain authorized for repurchase.\n* * * *\nMore information on the Company’s results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 will be provided upon filing of the Company’s Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
