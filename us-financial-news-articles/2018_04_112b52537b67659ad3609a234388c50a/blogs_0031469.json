The masks covered only their mouths, whereas safety demonstrations instruct passengers to cover their nose and mouth. @BobbyLaurie: PEOPLE: Listen to your flight attendants! ALMOST EVERYONE in this photo from @ SouthwestAir # SWA1380 today is wearing their mask WRONG. Put down the phone, stop with the selfies.. and LISTEN. **Cover your NOSE & MOUTH. # crewlife # psa # listen # travel # news # wn1380 Jeff Greenberg | Getty Images \nThe masks provide oxygen to passengers in emergencies up to 40,000 feet, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. When cabin pressure drops in a plane, passengers need the masks in order to receive a sufficient flow of oxygen. \nThe masks prevent hypoxia, when the body lacks enough oxygen to maintain normal physiological function. Amask will work for a short time, during which the pilot must get the plane to a safe altitude where it is no longer needed. \nOne woman was killed after the plane en route from New York to Dallas blew an engine and made an emergency landing in Philadelphia, Southwest said on Tuesday. It marked the first fatal U.S. commercial plane accident since 2009. \nThe victim was Jennifer Riordan, a New Mexico resident and mother of two, who served as vice president for community relations at Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, according to her LinkedIn profile . She managed employee volunteer service to nonprofit groups. show chapters 22 Hours Ago | 00:46 \nRiordan died in the hospital after she was reportedly almost sucked out of a shattered window before fellow passengers pulled her back in. \nThe passenger's death breaks a nearly decade-long stretch without a fatality aboard a commercial airplane in the U.S., said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant based in Long Island, New York. Southwest said it was the first onboard passenger fatality due to an accident in its history. \nThe aircraft involved in Tuesday's incident, a Boeing 737-700, had 144 passengers and five crew members on board, according to Southwest.
