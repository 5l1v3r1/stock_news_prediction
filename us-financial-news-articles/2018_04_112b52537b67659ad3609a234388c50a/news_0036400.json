The government owes you money instead of the other way around. Congratulations.\nThe average 2018 refund so far this year, according to the IRS , is $2,864.

So when will you get your tax refund?\nThe good news is it might not take as long as you would expect.\nSome 90% of refunds are issued within three weeks of the day the return is filed. And if you’re wondering where yours stands (and don’t want to bother your tax preparer ), the IRS has a tool that can help you track its progress.\nThe Where’s My Refund? tool lets users check the status of their tax refund, with information updated daily.
