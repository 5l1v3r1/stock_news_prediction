Total segment revenue was $2,080 million for the quarter, up 11% versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , up 10% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or up 5% on an organic constant currency basis (c) . Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2,282 million, impacted by the adoption of ASC 606.\nNet income attributable to First Data for the first quarter of 2018 was $101 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, up 181% and 175%, respectively, from comparable figures in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net income attributable to First Data was primarily driven by the non-recurrence of $56 million of debt extinguishment charges that were incurred in the prior year period and improved operating results in the current period.\nAdjusted net income, which modifies net income for items such as debt extinguishment charges, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring costs, certain discrete tax items and other items, was $279 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, up 8% and 6%, respectively, from comparable figures in the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by improved operating results partially offset by a normalized adjusted effective tax rate in the current period.\nTotal segment earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (total segment EBITDA) in the first quarter of 2018 was $730 million, up 12% versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , up 14% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or up 10% on an organic constant currency basis (c) . Total segment EBITDA margin was 35.1%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , or up 110 basis points on a comparable accounting basis (b) .\n“We had an excellent start to 2018. We continued to execute against key initiatives across our business, delivering strong financial performance and positioning us to raise our guidance for the year,” said First Data Chairman and CEO Frank Bisignano. “We further expanded Clover's market presence, our cutting-edge ISV business continued to rapidly gain share, our international businesses again delivered strong growth, and our backlog of new enterprise deals continued to expand and ramp,” Bisignano added.\nSegment Results\nGlobal Business Solutions (GBS)\nFirst quarter 2018 GBS segment revenue was $1,318 million, up 18% versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , up 15% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or up 7% on an organic constant currency basis (c) . Within geographic regions, North America revenue of $1,014 million was up 15% versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , up 12% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or up 4% on an organic constant currency basis (c) , driven by strong growth in the Partner Solutions and the Direct channels, partially offset by a modest decline in JV channel revenue. EMEA revenue was $168 million, up 20% on a reported basis (a) , up 19% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or up 4% on an organic constant currency basis (c) .

Within geographic regions, North America revenue of $228 million was down 3% on a reported basis (a) , down 2% on both a comparable accounting basis and on an organic constant currency basis (b) (c) , driven by recent long-term renewals.

Latin America revenue was $31 million, down 6% versus the prior year period on a reported basis, down 17% on a comparable accounting basis (b) , or down 11% on an organic constant currency basis (c) , driven by the non-recurrence of license resolution fees in the prior year period.

Reported segment EBITDA margin was 48.3% in the quarter, up 510 basis points versus the prior year period on a reported basis (a) , or up 330 basis points on a comparable accounting basis.\nCash Flow\nIn the first quarter 2018, cash flow from operations was $534 million, up $113 million compared to $421 million in the prior year period. Free cash flow, which the Company defines as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, distributions to minority interests and other, was $368 million in the current quarter, up $107 million compared to $261 million in the prior year period, primarily driven by improved operating results and working capital improvements in the current period.\nCapital Structure\nFirst Data's total borrowings at March 31, 2018 decreased by $186 million to $19,012 million, from $19,198 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by debt paydowns during the period. Net debt at March 31, 2018 decreased by $239 million to $18,382 million, from $18,621 million at December 31, 2017.\nUpdated 2018 Full Year Financial Guidance\nThe updated guidance provided below holds foreign exchange rates constant versus the year-ago comparable period (\"constant currency\"), and applies the New Reporting Standards to the referenced year ago period.\nTotal segment revenue growth: 6% to 7%, compared to previously disclosed guidance of 5% to 7%.

These non-GAAP measures include total segment revenue, total segment expense, total segment EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, free cash flow and net debt. The company has included non-GAAP measures because management believes that they help to facilitate comparisons of the company's operating results between periods. The company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and users of our financial statements by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. Additional information about non-GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures can be found in the tables included in this press release.\nAbout First Data\nFirst Data (NYSE: FDC) is a global leader in commerce-enabling technology and solutions, serving approximately six million business locations and 4,000 financial institutions in more than 100 countries around the world.
