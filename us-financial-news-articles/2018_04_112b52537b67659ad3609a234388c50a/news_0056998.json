The whereabouts of the second of the prop weapons is unknown, Julien’s said.\nFord is seen using the hero blaster in many scenes from “Return of the Jedi,” and the powerful weapon, like the lightsaber, is among the best known movie props from the sci-fi franchise.\nThe hero blaster up for auction in June is being sold for the first time. It was made for the movie by U.S. art director on “Return of the Jedi,” James L. Schoppe, who was gifted the gun after filming on the movie ended, along with other mementoes that he has kept for 35 years.\nThe hero blaster will be auctioned in Las Vegas and online at juliensauctions.com on June 23 and has a pre-sale estimate of $300,000 to $500,000.\n“Star Wars” memorabilia is among the most sought-after pop culture collectibles. Luke Skywalker’s original lightsaber prop sold for $450,000 last year and an R2-D2 droid used in several films sold for $2.7 million. Harrison Ford’s \"Han Solo\" hero blaster movie prop used in the original Star Wars trilogy film Episode VI: Return of the Jedi, built on a metal working replica Mauser C96 Broomhandle with additional found parts, greblies and cast resin pieces added on, is shown in this Julien’s Auctions image released on April 24, 2018.
