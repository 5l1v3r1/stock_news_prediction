However it required formal approval from Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe.\nDonohoe said on Thursday that the government would launch a review of banking remuneration policy and as a minority shareholder, also abstain in a Bank of Ireland vote on Friday seeking approval to engage with shareholders on a future incentive scheme.\nDublin capped executive pay and banned bonuses during its banking crisis a decade ago. Donohoe said he acknowledged that in light of firms moving to Ireland as a result of Brexit, remuneration restrictions could act as a barrier to the retention of staff in some areas.
