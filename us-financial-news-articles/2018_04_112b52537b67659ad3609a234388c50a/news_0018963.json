REUTERS/David Gray The 23-year-old produced a Games record time of 52.27 seconds as she stormed home in the final 15 meters to overtake her former world record holding older sister and clinch her first individual Commonwealth Games gold.\n“It’s incredibly surprising. I don’t know how it happened but I’m glad it did,” said Bronte, who had mentioned after claiming silver behind Cate in the 50m freestyle she would not mind if the order was reversed every now and then.\n“I definitely didn’t think I was going to go that quick.”\nSwimming - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Women's 100m Freestyle - Final - Optus Aquatic Centre - Gold Coast, Australia - April 9, 2018.

I didn’t really expect to get all these medals so I’m really humbled,” Ruck said.\n“I’m just so humbled to be able to tie with Elaine. She’s an amazing person and I look up to her a lot.”\nRuck has the possibility of earning an eighth medal on the final day of competition in the pool on Tuesday if she is named in Canada’s 4x100m medley relay team.\nReporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:35:45.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
