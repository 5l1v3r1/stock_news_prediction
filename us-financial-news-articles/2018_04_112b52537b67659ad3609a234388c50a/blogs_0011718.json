Michael is my attorney. You’ll have to ask Michael.”\nMs. Clifford has said the payment was intended to keep quiet allegations of a sexual encounter with the president.\nHe said he didn’t know where the money for the payment had come from. “No, I don’t know,” Mr. Trump said. He ignored a question on whether he ever set up a fund of money that Mr. Cohen could draw from.\nThe remarks mark the first time Mr. Trump has discussed the payment to Ms. Clifford, who has in recent weeks given interviews about the alleged encounter she had with Mr. Trump more than a decade ago , including a “60 Minutes” interview .\nMichael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, said in a tweet: “We very much look forward to testing the truthfulness of Mr. Trump’s feigned lack of knowledge concerning the $130k payment as stated on Air Force One. As history teaches us, it is one thing to deceive the press and quite another to do so under oath.”\nMr. Cohen has said the Trump campaign and the Trump Organization didn’t reimburse him for the payment, but hasn’t specifically said the president hadn’t done so.\nMs. Clifford last month sued Mr. Cohen for defamation , saying in a court filing that he publicly portrayed her as having lied about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump. In the lawsuit, Ms. Clifford is seeking to extricate herself from the October 2016 nondisclosure agreement she had reached with Mr. Cohen.\nBoth the White House and Mr. Cohen have denied a sexual encounter took place.\n“The president doesn’t believe any of the claims [Stormy] Daniels made in the [60 Minutes] interview last night were accurate,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said at a briefing with reporters last month. “There’s nothing to corroborate her claim.”\nLawyers for Mr. Trump and a company Mr. Cohen used to pay Ms. Clifford have said in court filings that Ms. Clifford could be liable for more than $20 million in damages for breaching the nondisclosure agreement.\nAfter the Journal story in January, the government watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department asking them to investigate the potential violation of campaign-finance laws.\nThe groups has asked the FEC to determine whether the payment should have been documented in campaign-finance reports and whether Mr. Cohen or another entity made what amounted to an illegal contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign by paying Ms. Clifford to keep her story under wraps.\nBut any violation would have to involve coordination with Mr. Trump or his campaign, according to campaign-finance experts. Mr. Trump’s comments Thursday distanced him from the deal.\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump’s comments could help Ms. Clifford in her effort to break free of the agreement , according to some legal experts. They say the contract language requires the assent of Mr. Trump, as well as Ms. Clifford and the limited liability company Mr. Cohen used in the deal. Mr. Trump is identified in the agreement under the pseudonym David Dennison. Ms. Clifford has alleged in her lawsuit that the contract is invalid because Mr. Trump didn’t sign it.\nMr. Cohen has sought to compel the lawsuit into arbitration and said the contract is valid. A lawyer for Mr. Trump has joined the effort.\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com\nAppeared in the April 6, 2018, print edition as 'Trump Denies Knowing of Payment to Actress.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:35:24.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
