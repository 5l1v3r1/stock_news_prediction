(“KEW” or the “Company”) (TSX:KEW and KEW.WT) today announced that the Company has agreed to acquire Essential Quail Media Group (“EQ Media”) for an initial purchase price of AUD$32.8 million (C$31.9 million based on the current CAD/AUD FX rate of approximately 0.972), comprised of AUD$20.0 million (C$19.4 million) in cash and AUD$12.8 million (C$12.4 million) in Class B shares of KEW valued at C$10.00 per share.\nEQ Media combines several entities with aggregate pro forma revenue of over AUD$60 million (C$58 million). The initial purchase price represents a transaction multiple of approximately 3.2x EQ Media's estimated Adjusted EBITDA of AUD$10.2 million (C$9.9 million) for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. The cash portion of the initial purchase price will be funded through cash on hand and KEW's credit facilities. The vendors may receive additional consideration in the future, conditional upon EQ Media meeting certain financial targets and other tests, which are described below.\nPeter Sussman, KEW Founder & Executive Chairman said, “I first got to know EQ Media CEO Chris Hilton more than 10 years ago and have always been very impressed with what the EQ Media team have been able to accomplish. This acquisition bolsters KEW’s presence in the U.S. and provides KEW with a diversified revenue platform in Australia.”\nSteven Silver, KEW Founder & CEO, said, “EQ Media is an exciting addition to the KEW group and the transaction purchase price is an attractive valuation for such a prominent content producer. We expect the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings and to free cash flow. In addition, we expect to generate meaningful synergies from the sale of additional EQ Media content through KEW's global distribution platform.”\nThe EQ Media Business\nEQ Media is a leading independent producer of high quality content for international audiences operating from offices in Los Angeles and Dallas-Fort Worth in the U.S. and Sydney, Australia. EQ Media produces top-rated content in a variety of genres, particularly non-scripted television series, for broadcast customers worldwide. Buyers of EQ Media’s programming include DIY, HGTV, Cooking Channel, Animal Planet, ABC Australia, SBS, Foxtel Networks 7, 9 & 10, BBC, National Geographic, PBS, Discovery, Sundance, History Channel, Arte, Netflix and Fox Network. EQ Media also has a longstanding relationship with Scripps Networks (now part of Discovery Inc.), producing more than a dozen full series orders and pilots together.\nAmong EQ Media’s recent U.S. non-scripted programs are: (i) Texas Flip ‘n Move, produced for DIY channel, now in production on Season 9 with an additional four seasons commissioned; (ii) Restored also for DIY channel with production on the third season commencing soon; (iii) Mom and Me, currently in production for HGTV; and (iv) Holiday Cookie Builds, in production for Cooking Channel.\nSince 2006, Essential Media & Entertainment (“Essential”) and Quail Entertainment have collectively provided premium content for all Australian networks, with recent productions such as (i) Find My Family (7 Network), the highest rated documentary series in Australian television history; (ii) the 2017 ratings hit and Logie-nominated adventure science series Todd Sampson's Body Hack; (iii) the scandalous front page ratings-winning scripted comedy At Home With Julia (ABC); (iv) Kriv Stenders-directed music feature documentary The Go-Betweens: Right Here, which won Best Feature Documentary at the 2017 Australian SPAA awards; (v) the factual series Afghanistan: Inside Australia's War, which won the 2016 NSW Premier's History Award Media Prize, the SPAA Award and was nominated for a Walkley Award; and (vi) standout lifestyle hits Gourmet Farmer and Shane Delia’s Spice Journey.\nFollowing the completion of the transaction, EQ Media's senior management team, which has driven the company’s impressive growth, will continue to guide its future.\n“Since founding Essential in 2006, we have grown the business to become a leading content producer,” said Chris Hilton, CEO of EQ Media. “We now have the opportunity to take it to the next level by partnering with KEW and accessing its strong international distribution platform.” Greg Quail, Chief Content Officer, added “for storytellers there has never been a better time; the explosion of streaming, the consolidation of cable and the enduring broadcast environment around the globe offer more platforms than ever to build audiences. We are delighted to join KEW’s drive to deliver top-rated content to the world.”\nAdditional Transaction Details\nEQ Media’s vendors can earn up to an additional AUD$32.5 million (C$31.6 million) in aggregate contingent consideration based on EQ Media meeting certain financial and other tests over the next three years. In the event that all of the contingent consideration is paid, the total purchase price would be AUD$65.3 million (C$63.5 million) and EQ Media's fiscal 2020 (June year-end) Adjusted EBITDA would be, at a minimum, AUD$13.7 million (C$13.3 million), implying an acquisition multiple of 4.8x. Based on EQ Media's estimated Adjusted EBITDA for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, KEW expects to pay approximately AUD$10 million (C$9.7 million) of the total AUD$32.5 million (C$31.6 million) of aggregate contingent consideration during 2018, which would result in a transaction multiple of 4.2x based upon EQ Media's estimated Adjusted EBITDA for its fiscal 2018 period.\nIn addition to the contingent consideration, EQ Media’s vendors can also earn a one-time additional purchase price amount equal to 3.625 times the amount by which EQ Media's fiscal 2019 (June year-end) Adjusted EBITDA exceeds a minimum threshold of AUD$11.9 million (C$11.6 million). This additional purchase price would be payable in three equal annual instalments in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Assuming the minimum threshold is exceeded in 2019, the 2020 and 2021 payments are contingent on EQ Media maintaining at least the same level of (or not being less than 95% of) 2019 Adjusted EBITDA in 2020 and 2021.\nAny of the above-referenced contingent consideration and additional purchase price are payable, at KEW’s sole option, in cash or (subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange) Class B shares, provided that at least 20% of such consideration is paid in cash.\nSteven Silver added, “Management of both KEW and EQ Media were united in the belief that the transaction structure, including the contingent consideration mechanisms and level of initial share consideration, should provide for strong alignment between the vendors and KEW shareholders going forward.”\nThe transaction is expected to close in early July 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain third party consents and approval by the Toronto Stock Exchange of the listing of the Class B Shares issued to EQ Media's vendors.\nAssuming an early July 2018 closing, KEW’s revised Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2018 is approximately C$26.5 million.\nOn an annualized pro forma basis, EQ Media would grow KEW’s revenue to over C$300 million and its Adjusted EBITDA to approximately C$31.5 million, before any potential revenue synergies.\nTD Securities Inc. is acting as financial advisor to KEW. Goodmans LLP is acting as legal advisor to KEW. Evra Media Solutions Inc. and Industry Media provided advisory and due diligence services for the transaction. SunTrust Bank is the lead agent in a syndicate including TD Bank and BMO providing credit financing for the transaction.\nDane Phillips at NOR Capital (London) is acting as financial advisor to the EQ Media and Gilbert & Tobin (Sydney) is acting as its legal advisor.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis news release contains references to certain measures that do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS as issued by the IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Rather, these measures are provided as additional information to complement IFRS measures by providing a further understanding of operations from management’s perspective. Accordingly, non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of financial information reported under IFRS. This release makes reference to Adjusted EBITDA of the Company which is a non-IFRS financial measure. The Company believes this non-IFRS financial measure is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and it is therefore helpful to provide this supplemental measure. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net Income with add-backs made for interest expense (net of interest income), taxation expense, depreciation, other intangible asset amortization, transaction costs, reorganization and exceptional costs, stock-based compensation, gain/loss on the change in fair value of financial liabilities less the proportion of Adjusted EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests. References to Adjusted EBITDA of EQ Media are based on the calculations of such Adjusted EBITDA pursuant to the agreement entered into between KEW and the vendors of EQ Media.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may include forward-looking statements.
