Much of last month's gains — as well as the yearly uptick — came from durable goods manufacturing, the department said.\nBusiness services also posted strong numbers, up 33,000 in March after increases in hiring by insurance, securities and commodities companies led to a strong gain in February.\nHere are the net changes by industry for the month of February, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nAs for the strong yearly gains in manufacturing, \"the expectation is you've had a big boost in business sentiment as well as corporate tax cuts,\" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James. \"There's an expectation you'll get more capital spending in the months ahead and the stronger global economy has also been a factor.\"\nTrump has made strengthening U.S. manufacturing a priority for economic policy. Both the president and Republican lawmakers passed tax cuts during Trump's first year in office, which included incentives the GOP hopes will encourage manufacturing investments.\nEmployment in manufacturing has steadily increased since Trump's election; the manufacturing industry has added 293,000 jobs since November 2016, according to the Department of Labor.\nOverall, nonfarm payrolls rose 103,000 in March and the unemployment rate held at 4.1 percent, coming up short of Wall Street expectations. Economists had been expecting a payrolls gain of 193,000 and the unemployment rate to decline one-tenth of a point to 4 percent.\nThe construction industry was the jobs loser for the month, cutting 15,000 jobs in March after adding more than 60,000 in February.\nThe retail industry — which has fluctuated between net job gains and losses over the past few months — cut 4,400 jobs in March. The government said that employment declined by 13,000 in general merchandise stores, offsetting a gain of the same size in February. Over the past 12 months, employment in retail trade has shown little net change.\nCorrection: The retail industry cut 4,400 jobs in March. An earlier version misstated the month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:54:49.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
