There is nothing complete,” he said.\nAurubis produces copper by smelting copper concentrate (ore) and recycling scrap metal, and also makes copper products including wire, rod and shapes.\nThe company in January made its first major acquisition since 2011, taking full control of German copper wire and rod maker Deutsche Giessdraht.\nAsked whether any further acquisitions would be announced this year, Schachler said, “I hope so,” adding that these were unlikely to be smelting operations.\nAurubis has said it could borrow up to three times its core earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, currently around 400 million euros, to fund expansion.\nAdding to that cash pool, the company said in February it was selling its flat-rolled products sector, with annual sales of about 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion), to German group Wieland. It has not disclosed the sale price.\n“Its quite a significant amount that we would have” for acquisitions, Schachler said.\nReporting by Peter Hobson; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:34:56.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
