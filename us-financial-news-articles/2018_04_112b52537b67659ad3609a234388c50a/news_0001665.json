A third company, Faiveley Transport S.A., also participated in the agreement until it was purchased by Wabtec in 2016. \nNo-poach agreements are illegal under antitrust law since they restrict competition for employees, and potentially deprive workers of better job opportunities, the department said. \nWabtec said in a statement that it had settled even though it committed no wrongdoing. \n“We firmly believe that our recruiting policies have been consistent with the antitrust laws and have in no way diminished competition for talent in the marketplace,” the company said. “We have elected to settle this matter to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation.” \nThe companies supply rail companies with train control, braking and door equipment for passenger rail vehicles. They are each other’s top competitors, the department said in its complaint.
