The victim was forced to perform sex acts at gun point, choked until she had seizures and gang-raped.\nAnother 15-year-old girl was forced to do in-calls at hotels.\nA third victim who was advertised under the name “Nadia” was later stabbed to death, while a fourth victim was murdered in 2015 by a customer who then tried to burn her corpse.\nIn addition to charging Larkin and Lacey, the indictment also charged Backpage.com’s executive vice president Scott Spear, its chief financial officer John “Jed” Brunst, its sales and marketing director Dan Hyer, operations manager Andrew Padilla and its assistant operations manager Joye Vaught.\nMichael Piccarreta, a lawyer for Padilla, said his client was employed by a company that hosted third-party content.\n“He is not legally responsible for any actions of third parties under U.S. law. He is no more responsible than the owner of a community billboard when someone places an ad on it,” he said.\nHe added that his client has since been released on his own recognizance.\nAttorneys for the remaining defendants could not immediately be reached.\nIn the indictment, the U.S. Justice Department accuses Backpage of earning $500 million in prostitution-related revenue since its inception in 2004, and of money laundering that entailed routing funds through seemingly unrelated entities, wiring money in and out of foreign accounts and converting it into and out of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nBackpage associates were also actively involved in editing ads and advising on how they should be worded, according to the indictment.\nProsecutors also alleged that the website’s employees sought to actively mislead the public about its sincerity of efforts to prevent prostitution ads.\nThe indictment said that in private, Lacey “bragged about the company’s contributions to the prostitution industry, writing in one internal document ‘Backpage is part of the solution.’”\nNEW LEGISLATION The indictment relies on the same law used in a similar case in California several years ago against the founder of MyRedbook.com, who pleaded guilty to charges that the website hosted ads largely posted by prostitutes.\nA Justice Department official said the case against Backpage does not rely on sex trafficking charges, but rather on charges connected to prostitution, which are easier to prosecute.\nTo prove sex trafficking, prosecutors would need to show each individual ad either involved a minor, or featured an adult who was selling sex through force or coercion.\nLast month, Congress passed legislation that makes it easier for state prosecutors and sex-trafficking victims to sue website operators that facilitate online sex trafficking.\nThe bill, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law this week, amends the Communications Decency Act, which largely shielded website operators from state criminal charges or civil liability if they were facilitating sex ads or prostitution.\nEfforts to get that law changed were featured prominently in a Netflix documentary called “I am Jane Doe.”\nReporting by Sarah N.
