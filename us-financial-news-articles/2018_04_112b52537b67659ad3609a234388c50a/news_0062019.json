Debt decrease of $102.6 million.\nMEXICO CITY, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Grupo TMM, S.A.B. (OTC:GTMAY) (BMV:TMM A) (“TMM” or the “Company” ), a Mexican Maritime-management transportation and logistics Company, reported today its financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nMANAGEMENT OVERVIEW\nJosé F. Serrano, chairman and chief executive officer of Grupo TMM, said, “Through the gradual progress in the energy industry in Mexico, as well as the Company’s client diversification strategy and cost optimization plans, each of Grupo TMM’s business units have shown improved performance in the first quarter and a positive trend in their operations.”\n“Additionally, due to the corporate reorganization approved by the shareholders in December, Grupo TMM’s balance sheet has also improved, with lower debt and better financial ratios. We believe this will provide opportunities for our Maritime and Ports and Terminals divisions to expand their operations in the complex national and international markets.”\n“With all these measures, Grupo TMM maintains its commitment to its stockholders to increase the value of their investment.”\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\nConsolidated revenues were $386.8 million, compared to $509.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The 2017 first quarter included the revenues from TMM Division Maritima (\"TMMDM\") which, as a result of the Company's corporate reorganization in December of 2017, was deconsolidated from Grupo TMM. Year over year, Ports and Terminals revenue improved 25.0 percent and Warehousing Services revenues increased 25.2 percent in the 2018 first quarter.\nConsolidated operating profit was $17.8 million compared to a loss of $32.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. The 2017 first quarter included the operating profit from TMMDM. Year over year, operating results in all divisions improved in the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome from non-recurrent operations was $6.8 million compared to $51.2 million in the same period of 2017.\nConsolidated EBITDA was $38.5 million compared to $101.6 million in the same period last year. The 2017 first quarter included the EBITDA from TMMDM.\nMaritime revenues were $233.6 million compared to $386.8 million for the 2017 first quarter. The 2017 first quarter included the revenues from TMMDM. Partially offsetting the decrease was increased revenues of $9.9 million in Parcel Tankers, $23.5 million in Shipyard and $37.4 million due to the new Bulk Carriers segment which mainly transports steel from Veracruz to Colombia.\nMaritime operating profit was $30.9 million compared to a loss of $35.9 million in the 2017 first quarter. The 2017 first quarter included the operating profit from TMMDM. Partially offsetting the decrease was increased performance at Shipyard and improved mix.\nMaritime EBITDA was $46.7 million compared to $93.1 million in the same period of 2017. The 2017 first quarter included the EBITDA from TMMDM. EBITDA margin was 19.8 percent.\nPorts and Terminal revenues increased 25.0 percent to a record $114.3 million compared to $91.5 million in the same period of 2017 mainly due to an increase of $22.6 million in the Maintenance and Repair segment as a result of improved containers volume and improved volume at the division’s main locations.\nPorts and Terminals operating profit improved 19.9 percent to $23.9 million compared to $19.9 million in the same period of 2017 mainly due to the improved performance at the Maintenance and Repair segment and at API Acapulco as a result of increased volume of transported cars, partially offset by decreased profit from the Terminal in Tampico.\nPorts and Terminals EBITDA was $26.7 million compared to $23.1 million in the same period last year. EBITDA margin was 23.3 percent.\nWarehousing Services revenue increased 25.2 percent to $38.9 million compared to $31.1 million in the same period of the previous year mainly due to a higher volume of services.\nWarehousing Services operating loss improved to $5.8 million from a loss of $9.0 million in the 2017 first quarter due to the Company’s client diversification strategy and cost optimization plans. The division’s operating loss has improved over the last several quarters, a trend the Company believes will continue due to improvement in its agribusiness with the support of FIRA, as well as continuing development in other sectors including the steel and fuel industries.\nDEBT\nAs of March 31, 2018, Grupo TMM's net debt was $367.7 million, with $439.2 million of short-term debt and cash of $428.3 million.\nTotal Debt*\n– Millions of Mexican Pesos –\nTo 3/31/17 To 12/31/17 Short Term Debt $439.2 $502.4 Long Term Debt 356.8 396.2 Total Debt $ 796.0 $ 898.6 Cash 428.3 461.6 Net Debt $ 367.7 $ 437.0 Net Short Term Debt $ 10.9 $ 40.8 Stockholders’ Equity $2,256.9 $2,229.1 Book value per share $22.09 $21.89 Book Value\nHeadquartered in Mexico City, Grupo TMM is a Latin American Maritime transportation company.
