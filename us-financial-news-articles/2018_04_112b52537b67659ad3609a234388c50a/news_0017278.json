REUTERS/Iqro Rinaldi/File photo Standard Chartered and Indonesian conglomerate PT Astra International ( ASII.JK ) jointly control the Indonesia bank, each owning 44.56 percent.\nShares in Bank Permata surged on the report by the Kontan daily, trading 6 percent higher to give it a market value of some $1.2 billion. It rose as much as 12.9 percent at one stage but pared gains after an Astra spokesman said the conglomerate has not held talks with the U.S. hedge fund.\nThere has been persistent speculation in the last few years that the ownership structure of Bank Permata could change, with the bank linked to takeover talk.\n“With regard to our stake in Permata Bank, the Bank (Standard Chartered) has not reached a decision. Having been operating in Indonesia for more than 150 years, we maintain our longstanding commitment to the country,” Standard Chartered said in a statement.\nAstra said also said it and Standard Chartered were still committed to improving the health of Permata Bank.\nFarallon could not immediately be reached for comment.\nReporting by Cindy Silviana and Anshuman Daga; Editing by Stephen Coates and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:32:43.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
