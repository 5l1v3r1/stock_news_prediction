But ... you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.”\nThe next major hurdle will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday.\nRUSSIA PAIN Russian stock indexes and the rouble both fell on Monday after the United States hit Russian companies and officials as part of an aggressive round of new sanctions to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\nThe dollar-denominated RTS stock market index was down 4.5 percent, its worst single day in over a year, while the rouble was 0.9 percent weaker against the dollar.\nShares in some Russian companies targeted by the new sanctions, notably those associated with Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, plunged on Monday.\nHong Kong-listed shares in Deripaska’s aluminium producer Rusal tumbled by nearly half after the company said it could default on some of its debt due to the sanctions.\nElsewhere in currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 107.07, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49.\nThe euro was flat at $1.2280, and above the recent trough of $1.2212, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 90.138.\nOil prices edged up with Brent crude futures for June up 0.58 percent to $67.49 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 gained rose 0.53 percent to $62.38 a barrel.
