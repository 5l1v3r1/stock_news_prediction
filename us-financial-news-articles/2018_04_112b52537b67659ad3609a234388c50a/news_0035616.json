U.S. commercial airline accident deaths are extremely rare. \nTelevision images showed that most of the outer casing around the left engine of the Boeing Co 737-700 had ripped away and a window near the engine on the plane’s left side was missing. \nTodd Baur, who identified himself as the father of a passenger from the plane, told Philadelphia’s NBC-10 television that a female passenger was injured when she was partially sucked into a window near the afflicted engine before being pulled back into the aircraft by other passengers. \nSouthwest said the aircraft was bound for Dallas Love Field in Texas from New York’s LaGuardia Airport before it diverted to Philadelphia. It did not immediately provide an explanation for the diversion. \n“We are in the process of transporting customers and crew into the terminal,” Southwest said in a statement. Emergency personnel monitor the damaged engine of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, which diverted to the Philadelphia International Airport this morning after the airline crew reported damage to one of the aircraft's engines, on a runway in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania U.S. April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Mark Makela \nA passenger on the flight described feeling the aircraft drop. \n“All of a sudden, we heard this loud bang, rattling, it felt like one of the engines went out. The oxygen masks dropped,” the passenger, Kristopher Johnson, told CNN. “It just shredded the left-side engine completely. ... It was scary.” \nMajor safety issues aboard U.S. airlines are rare, with no accidental deaths recorded last year, according to groups that track crashes. \nSouthwest shares fell more than 3 percent after the NTSB reported the fatality, then cut losses and was last down 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThe aircraft’s maker, Boeing, said on Twitter that it was aware of the incident and was “gathering more information.” \nThe plane’s engines are made by CFM International, a French-U.S. venture co-owned by Safran and General Electric, which was not immediately available for comment.
