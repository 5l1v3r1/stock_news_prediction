Picture taken July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Callidus said it made a fourth-quarter net loss of C$171.6 million in the quarter, compared to a net loss of C$58.5 million in the year-ago period, primarily caused by a C$131.9 million loan loss provision related to an unnamed energy company. For the whole of 2017 it reported a net loss of C$218.5 million, compared to income of C$1.2 million for 2016.\nIts shares fell as much 42 percent in morning trading to an all-time low of C$3.76, later paring losses to trade at C$4.75.\nFILE PHOTO: Canadian financier Newton Glassman is pictured in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in this undated handout photo.

The decline below C$5 comes after more than a year of Catalyst Capital’s attempts to sell Callidus to a private buyer, saying last year it was targeting a price of C$18 to C$22 a share.\nCatalyst and Callidus head Newton Glassman said on an earnings call early on Tuesday that the effort to take the company private continues, with “numerous parties” still part of the process. He declined to provide additional details.\n“The noise in the market, in my opinion likely created in part by short selling, et cetera, has succeeded in reducing the stock price to a level that we don’t believe reflects the real value of the assets,” Glassman said.\n“We currently have every reason to be optimistic about 2018 and the future,” Glassman added.\nThe stock price decline Tuesday extends a sharp drop in recent weeks. On March 23, Reuters published an investigation that raised questions about how Catalyst values the companies in its portfolios, including Callidus, a core holding across its private equity funds.\nCatalyst last week took out full-page advertisements in the New York Times, USA Today and National Post to dispute reporting by Reuters.\nReporting by Lawrence Delevingne and John Tilak; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:13:29.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
