It allocated at 99.5 on March 7 and was Quote: d at 99 on the break, TRLPC data shows.\n“There were losses on the zloty - it hurts,” the trader said.\nKKR was not immediately available to comment.\nHITTING RESISTANCE Flora’s performance follows the downward trajectory of the broader secondary leveraged loan market which has been dragged lower by wider market volatility.\nAverage bids on Europe’s top 40 leveraged loans fell to 99.42 on April 9 from 99.85 on March 7.\nSome investors also rejected Flora’s loan due to aggressive features within the documentation, several sources said.\nInvestors are becoming less willing to accept weaker terms after aggressive documentation on recent loans such as petrol forecourt operator EG Group and French telecom network service provider Circet Groupe.\n“Documentation is near a tipping point,” a syndicate head in London said.\nSecondary bids could soften further due to the sheer volume of deals that are expected to be launched in the second quarter in Europe.\nDeals in the pipeline include Carlyle’s €10.1bn carve-out of Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals business and Blackstone’s US$20bn carve-out of Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk division.\nBlackstone is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk unit, which includes LPC.\nFlora Food Group raised €4.7bn-equivalent of leveraged loans backing its buyout by KKR, after attracting around 80 major investors into the jumbo cross-border deal.\nEditing by Claire Ruckin and Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:05:39.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
