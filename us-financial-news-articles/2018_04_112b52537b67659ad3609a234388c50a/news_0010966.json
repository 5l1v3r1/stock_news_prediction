(“ Movit ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX.V:MV.H) is pleased to announce that it has received conditional approval for the listing of its common shares on the Aequitas NEO Exchange (“ NEO Exchange ”). Movit has been seeking listing approval from the NEO Exchange in connection with its previously announced acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ethereum Capital Inc. (“ Ethereum Capital ”) pursuant to a three-cornered amalgamation, which will result in a reverse takeover of Movit (the “ Transaction ”). Movit expects to have its common shares listed on the NEO Exchange under the symbol “ETHC” and delist its shares from the TSX Venture Exchange following the closing of the Transaction. The Company will issue a further press release announcing when trading in the Company's common shares will commence once that date is known.\nMovit is also pleased to announce that it has filed a filing statement dated April 3, 2018, in respect of the Transaction (the “ Filing Statement ”). A copy of the Filing Statement is available under Movit’s corporate profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nAs previously announced, the terms of the transition agreement (“ Transition Agreement ”) setting out the terms and conditions to the Transaction provide that Ethereum Capital will amalgamate with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Movit (the “ Amalgamation ”) and continue as one corporation (“ Amalco ”). On the Amalgamation, each share of Ethereum Capital (“ Ethereum Share ”) will be cancelled and holders of Ethereum Shares will receive one common share of Movit (“ Movit Share ”) for each Ethereum Share. On the completion of the Amalgamation, holders of Ethereum Shares will become holders of Movit and Amalco will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Movit.\nAt the annual and special meeting of Movit shareholders to be held on April 13th, 2018, Movit shareholders will be asked, among other matters, to consider, and if deemed appropriate, to pass resolutions (collectively, the “ Transaction Resolutions ”) approving certain matters in connection with the Transaction, including (i) the continuance of Movit's corporate existence from British Columbia to Ontario (the “ Continuance ”); (ii) consolidation of the issued and outstanding Movit Shares on the basis of one post-consolidation common share for every 12.5 issued and outstanding common shares (the “ Consolidation ”); (iii) a change of name to “Ether Capital Corporation” (the “ Name Change ”); (iv) reconstitution of the board of directors (the “ Movit Board ”) with nominees of Ethereum Capital effective on the completion of the Amalgamation; (v) adoption of a new by-law relating generally to its business and affairs (the “ By-law ”); and (vi) adoption of a share compensation plan (“ Share Compensation Plan ”). The Continuance, Consolidation and Name Change will require the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast at the Meeting while the By-law and Share Compensation Plan will require approval of the holders of a simple majority of the votes cast.\nThe Movit Board has unanimously determined that the Transaction, including the Amalgamation, is in the best interests of Movit and determined to recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the Transaction Resolutions. Holders of approximately 76% of the outstanding common shares of Movit entitled to vote at the Meeting have entered into voting agreements with Movit pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their Movit Shares for the Transaction Resolutions, subject to the right to terminate such voting agreements in certain circumstances.\nShareholders are urged to review the press release issued by Movit on January 29, 2018 announcing the entering into of the Transition Agreement, Movit’s management information circular dated March 16, 2018, and the Filing Statement as such documents contain important disclosure regarding the Transaction.\nThe closing of the Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions customary for this type of transaction, including the receipt of requisite approvals from Movit shareholders. Subject to receipt of all approvals, the Transaction is currently scheduled to close shortly after the date of the Meeting.\nAbout Ethereum Capital\nEthereum Capital is a technology company whose objective is to become the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem. The Company aims to both acquire Ether, Ethereum’s native crypto-asset, as a strategic asset, and make selective acquisitions in Ethereum-based businesses. Through its highly experienced Board of Directors and management team, Ethereum Capital expects to see a robust opportunity pipeline and invest in industry-shifting disruptive technologies.
