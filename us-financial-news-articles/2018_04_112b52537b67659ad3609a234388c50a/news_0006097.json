[JP20YTN=JBTC] [JP30YTN=JBTC] \nNippon Life’s holdings of JGBs stood at 19.26 trillion yen ($180.9 billion) at the end of March last year, down from 19.62 trillion yen a year earlier. \nShimizu said lower promised returns on new policies, 0.4 percent for whole life insurance for instance, allow it to buy JGBs at current yield levels. The yield on 20-year notes is around 0.505 percent. \nStill, he said JGB yields remain too low for old insurance policies, which have far higher promised returns. “We are not at the stage yet to fully resume buying JGBs. We will keep shifting money to investments such as overseas assets, credit products and growth areas,” he said. \nShimizu, 57, joined Nippon Life in 1983. He is a certified actuary - a professional with mathematical expertise to calculate risks and probabilities for insurance products. \nNippon Life has become one of the most acquisitive Japanese insurers, making a string of deals at home and abroad recently. \n“Our presence in North America and Europe is small. We would like to seek opportunities in these regions,” Shimizu said. “M&A remains an important strategic option.” Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T18:29:59.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
