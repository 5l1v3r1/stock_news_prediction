REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo \nThe transaction, financial details of which were not disclosed, is part of India’s new bankruptcy law, which is aimed at cutting close to $150 billion of accumulated soured loans by pushing loan defaulter firms into insolvency. \nElectrosteel Steels, which is setting up a 2.5 million tonnes a year steel plant in eastern India, is among India’s 12 biggest loan defaulters which were pushed to bankruptcy proceedings last year. The company had received claims totaling 133 billion rupees from its creditors. \nVedanta said in a statement late on Saturday it had received and accepted a letter of intent from Electrosteel Steels’ creditors’ group, led by top lender State Bank of India. \nThe closure of the deal is subject to regulatory compliance and approval by the National Company Law Tribunal, India’s designated court for bankruptcy cases, the statement added. \nTata Steel, privately-held Renaissance Steel and Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors Pte Ltd were the suitors for Electrosteel Steels.
