The former Secretary of State and her supporters have blamed Comey's 11th hour disclosure of the investigation for her loss. \nComey, however, couldn't say definitively whether his letter to Congress actually killed her chances, but said he would do it again, even if he knew it would help Trump. When asked about if the letter had hurt Clinton, Comey told ABC: \"I hope not. I don't know. I honestly don't know. I sure hope not.\" \nThe interview is tied to the release of Comey's book, \"A Highly Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\" scheduled to be released on Monday. \nIn recent days, a war of words has erupted between Comey and his former boss, President Donald Trump . The president has heaped much of the blame for his ongoing legal troubles on the FBI, and just Friday blasted Comey as an \"untruthful slime ball.\" \nSince his abrupt firing last year, Comey has been wont to using social media to take cryptic and subliminal digs at his former boss. Yet ahead of the publication of his book, he issued an uncharacteristically blunt response to Trump , vowing last month that the public would hear his side of the story \"very soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T23:45:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
