The S&P 500 fell 0.09 percent to 2,661.58 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.17 percent to 7,127.82.\nThe bank results blow the starting whistle on U.S. earnings season, with Thomson Reuters data predicting profits at S&P 500 companies increased by 18.4 percent from a year ago, their biggest rise in seven years.\nWhile the U.S. economy is performing well, geopolitical issues are weighing this year on stock markets after almost a decade of uninterrupted gains.\nSenior lawmakers said on Friday that Russia’s lower house of parliament would consider draft legislation giving the Kremlin powers to ban or restrict a list of U.S. imports, reacting to new U.S. sanctions on Russian tycoons and officials.\n“I have been up to this point, pretty adamant that a trade war is going to be much less of a war and more of a skirmish,” said Thomas. “I’m starting to come around to maybe this almost inevitable.”\nBoeing fell 2.14 percent after a Russian senator said the company could be a casualty, with ongoing issues with engines for its 787 Dreamliner planes also weighing.\nThe top gainer among S&P sectors was the energy sector , up 1 percent as oil prices rose.\nTesla rose 2.54 percent after founder Elon Musk said the electric car maker would be profitable in the third and fourth quarters of this year and would not have to raise any money from investors.
