Mechel did not explain why its net profit had fallen both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.\n“Net income undermined by a 6.1 billion rouble impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets,” Russian brokerage Aton said in a note, without elaborating further. Mechel is due to hold a conference call later on Thursday.\nMechel shares underperformed the market, falling more than 2 percent compared with a 0.5 percent in the benchmark stock market index MOEX.\nFor 2017 as a whole, Mechel made 11.56 billion roubles in net profit, a 62 percent increase from 2016, it said.\n“High coal prices greatly supported our mining division’s results. The steel division last year had to work in a more difficult environment, but by the end of the year the situation stabilised and the division attained good results,” Mechel chief executive Oleg Korzhov said in a statement.\nLooking ahead, the company said it planned to increase capital investment in 2018 after increasing spending by more than 25 percent to 11 billion roubles in 2017.
