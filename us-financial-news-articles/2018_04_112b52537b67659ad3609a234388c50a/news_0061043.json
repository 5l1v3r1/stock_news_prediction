We knew it would come down to the wire and we were lucky to take those key moments,” said Highlanders captain Ben Smith.\nThe Highlanders made a bright start as Aaron Smith chased down a kick to go over inside the opening five minutes.\nThe Bulls were level after being awarded a penalty try in the 23rd minute as Fletcher Smith tackled Warrick Gelant, chasing down a forward kick.\nAn intercept try from flyhalf Handre Pollard allowed the hosts to go ahead for the first time in the match on the half-hour mark but Sopoaga’s penalty reduced the half-time score to 14-10.\nSopoaga slotted another over just after the interval and the Highlanders went back in front when the three Smiths – Aaron, Ben and Fletcher – put together a smart inter change of passes for Fletcher to go over.\nSopoaga kept up his accurate kicking to stretch the lead to 23-14 but just before the hour mark the Bulls prop Lizo Gqoboka burst through to set up a try for Jason Jenkins, who stretched over the line for the score.\nThe high altitude left the Highlanders looking exhausted as they went into the last 10 minutes with a tenuous 26-21 lead and in the 75th minute their tigerish defence was breached as Pollard popped Jesse Kriel into space and he went over to level with Pollard converting for a 28-26.\nDefeat kept the Bulls outside the top half of the standings with the Highlanders moving up into fifth place overall on 28 points.
