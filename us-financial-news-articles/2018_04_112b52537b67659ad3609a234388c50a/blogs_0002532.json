Thaddaeus McAdams WireImage Among other things, Centra’s co-founders Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farkas claimed that they had partnered with Visa and MasterCard to create a debit card that allowed users to immediately spend or covert their Centra tokens into legal tender--a partnership that did not exist, the SEC alleged.\nThousands of investors are said to be impacted by the alleged fraud. Centra was first hit with a class action lawsuit in December. \nNeither Mayweather nor DJ Khaled were named in the suit, though both were named “official brand ambassador and managing partner” at the firm. Nor have they responded to requests for comment from Fortune . Since questions were raised about Centra, Mayweather has deleted some posts in connection to the ICO.\nThe SEC did, however, warn celebrities that they could be violating securities law by promoting an ICO without disclosing the nature and amount of their compensation.\n“A failure to disclose this information is a violation of the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws,” the SEC said in November. \nThat came after several prominent celebrities began touting less well-known ICOs in 2017. Mayweather has touted the Hubii Network and Stox, neither of which seemed to have much more than a website and plan to launch before their coin offerings . Paris Hilton, meanwhile, touted the Lydian Coin.\nRegulators and investors, though, have generally been far more wary of the ICO space, with the lack of regulatory oversight and the youth of the industry making it an easy space for fraudulent schemes.\nWhile posts promoting Centra on Mayweather’s Twitter page still stand, links pointing to a Facebook post are now dead.\nCentra's (CTR) ICO starts in a few hours.
