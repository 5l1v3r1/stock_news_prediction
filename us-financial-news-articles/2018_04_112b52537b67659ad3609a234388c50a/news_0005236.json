He estimated that Turner lost $30 million in licensing fees and advertising revenue when it was dropped DISH for a month in 2014 when they could not reach a contract. \n“I lose money the minute I go dark, and I also get a share of the blame in the eyes of the subscribers,” he told the court. \nBreland also noted that Time Warner and other content makers faced competition online from Netflix, Amazon and others. “They are very impressive competitors that want to pull eyeballs away,” he said. \nThe trial, which is taking place in the U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to take six to eight weeks.
