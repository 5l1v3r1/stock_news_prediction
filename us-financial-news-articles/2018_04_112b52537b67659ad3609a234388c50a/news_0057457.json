In a July 2017 interview with the Wall Street Journal , Veselnitskaya said she \"personally\" knows the prosecutor general.\n\"I shared information with\" Chaika, she told the newspaper, in the course of her investigation into a hedge fund manager who was a driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. sanctions law that locked certain Russians out of their overseas funds, among other punishments.\nVeselnitskaya first became widely known in the American media landscape in summer 2017, after reports surfaced that she and other Russians met with Trump campaign officials in Manhattan's Trump Tower in June 2016.\nThe Trump campaign members, including Donald Trump Jr . and then-campaign chief Paul Manafort , attended the meeting under the impression that the Russians could provide damaging information on candidate Donald Trump 's political opponent, Hillary Clinton.\nAt the meeting, Veselnitskaya instead discussed what she said were unjust U.S. sanctions on Russia â€” a hobbyhorse of the Kremlin since the passage of the Magnitsky Act in 2012.\nThe Trump Tower meeting, which appeared to demonstrate the willingness of Trump campaign officials to coordinate with Russia in the election, has reportedly become a focus of special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating Russian links to the 2016 campaign.\nTrump Jr. initially claimed that the meeting was about Russian adoption, but later released emails showed him responding positively to an intermediary of Veselnitskaya promising \"information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\"\n\"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer,\" Trump Jr. responded.\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nWATCH: Browder says Veselnitskaya on a mission show chapters William Browder: Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was on a mission 6:11 PM ET Wed, 12 July 2017 | 03:40", "external_links": ["https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/us/natalya-veselnitskaya-trump-tower-russian-prosecutor-general.html"], "published": "2018-04-27T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:10:41.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
