They are also demanding that Microsoft include alerts for consumers when they install the software, so that they better understand \"the consequences of authorizing the transfer of data.\"\nThe Brazilian authorities added that their lawsuit was asking that Microsoft be fined 10 million reais ($2.87 million) and 100,000 reais for each day it does not comply with prosecutors' demands.\nIt was not clear when a judge may issue a ruling.\nProsecutors said users were able to opt out of allowing Microsoft 10 to sweep up much of their personal information - but that installing it in that manner was \"labor intensive and complex\" for consumers, and that the software still collected some information.\nThe statement said Microsoft was trying to increase profits on the back of the data collected by Windows 10, for instance by aiming targeted advertising at specific groups of consumers.\nProsecutors added that several federal government entities, including the judicial system and electoral agencies, used the Microsoft software, creating a risk that legally private information could be made public.\n($1 = 3.4843 reais)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:15:22.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
