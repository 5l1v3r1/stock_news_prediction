Gyarfas is one of FINA’s eight-member executive, according to the body’s website. \nFenyo, who was killed at a stop light on Feb. 11, 1998, owned a portfolio of newspapers and magazines and a television network. \nPolice said in a statement they detained a 69-year-old Budapest man on Tuesday. They gave his name as Tamas Gy and said Gy and 50-year-old Tamas P are suspected of instigating the killing. The statement said police questioned Tamas P last month. \nA separate statement said Gy had been questioned and was then formally arrested. \nMTI named the man as Gyarfas. It also named Tamas Portik and said he was sentenced last year to 13 years in jail after conviction for another crime. \nA Hungarian court sentenced a Slovak man, Jozef Rohac, to life in jail last May for Fenyo’s murder but did not say who ordered the killing. \nHungarian police said on their website a week ago they had reopened the investigation into the case last October. \nThey also said they questioned a 50-year-old Hungarian man, cited as “Tamas P.” in the case on March 22. \nGyarfas was head of the Hungarian Swimming Association until November 2016 when he resigned under pressure over his leadership from the country’s leading swimmers including triple Olympic champion Katinka Hosszu.
