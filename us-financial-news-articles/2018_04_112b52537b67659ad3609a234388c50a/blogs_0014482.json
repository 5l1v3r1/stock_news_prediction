Protectionism could change monetary policy direction Coeure's comments come as concerns rise over a trade war between the U.S. and China with both economic superpowers threatening to target each other's key exports with import tariffs.\nEarlier at the European House Ambrosetti Forum, Coeure warned that changes in global tariffs would mean the baseline economic forecast for the U.S. would fall 2.5 percent. According to ECB staff simulations, world trade in goods could contract by up to 3 percent just in the first year after the change in tariffs and global growth by up to 1 percent.\n\"An economy imposing a tariff which is retaliated by other countries would clearly be worse off. Its living standards would fall and jobs would be lost,\" Coeure said in a speech.\n\"The effects on other economies would primarily depend on their size, trade openness and how much they trade with the tariff-imposing country,\" he added.\nThe French economist also said that higher tariffs could have implications for monetary policy and equity markets.\n\"The first is the effects higher tariffs would have on growth and inflation in the near to medium term … The second main implication is the possible impact on long-run potential output growth, and how that may influence the conduct of monetary policy,\" Coeure said.\nshow chapters Coeure: Monetary accommodation remains needed, trade war or not 7 Hours Ago | 02:59", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T12:36:51.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
