Your editorial “ The Job Corps Failure ” (April 23) paints an unfair picture of the program. The editorial cherry-picks sections of a recent audit report to suggest that the Job Corps isn’t fulfilling its mission. Yet the conclusion of the audit was that the Job Corps needed additional documentation requirements—now in place—not that the program was unsuccessful.\nLongitudinal evaluations of the Job Corps’ effectiveness have found that the program improves wages, literacy and credential attainment while decreasing criminal activity and reliance on public assistance. Eighty-eight percent of all Job Corps graduates are placed in jobs, higher education or the military. Students leave the program with industry-recognized credentials, trained and ready to contribute in high-demand jobs including health care, manufacturing and construction. The Job Corps works.\nThe Job Corps has positioned itself as the premiere preapprenticeship program and has developed valuable relationships with industry leaders. An example is Toyota’s Technician Training and Education Network—an industry-leading program that develops and places thousands of factory-certified technicians in challenging, rewarding and well-paid positions in more than 1,400 Toyota and Lexus dealerships across the country.\nAs you note, the economy is desperately short of skilled workers. The Job Corps is indispensable in addressing that skills gap and ensuring disadvantaged, minority and unemployed young people in both urban and rural communities gain the skills and education needed for today’s jobs.\nRoberts T. Jones\nAlexandria, Va.\nI know that the students at the Job Corps facility near me suffer from extremely high “adverse childhood experiences” scores or adverse life events. The majority have lived with toxic stressors the likes of which most Journal readers wouldn’t imagine. I would consider the Job Corps a success if the students get their GEDs, are not homeless, in jail or are holding any kind of job. Often the Job Corps is a last-ditch effort to make extremely poorly functioning young people get needed skills and education.\nWe should worry more about the college-educated young people with expensive degrees working in fields that require a high-school diploma or less. I agree that getting rid of the overpriced contractors would be a great tweak of a basically good program.\nAnn Farash, M.D.\nPisgah Forest, N.C.\nYour editorial highlights the irrational review and support of politically favored programs. Imagine if such a report had been written about proprietary (for-profit) schools? We should support all education providers where the results justify the costs, rather than squandering taxpayers’ money, harming real people in very real ways.\nWilliam Calhoun\nChapel Hill, N.C.\nRather than make government grants to training organizations, why not let the employers, who know best what they need, be incentivized to train applicants without the right experience appropriately? The government could reimburse the cost of training an unqualified candidate who remained on the payroll for one, two or three years in the skill for which their training was covered. To claim the funds, let the employer specify and certify the training that was done, have the employee agree and co-sign, and attach a résumé. The company’s financial auditors can then also audit the certifications annually.\nRobert L.
