Soccer Football - Champions League Semi Final First Leg - Liverpool vs AS Roma - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 24, 2018 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring their first goal with team mates Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine\nNothing is ever clear with Juergen Klopp’s side who ended up kicking themselves after the whistle went at Anfield on Tuesday despite ending up the right side of a 5-2 first-leg scoreline.\nLiverpool also conceded twice late on in their previous league game at West Bromwich Albion to prove that, no matter what magic Mohamed Salah provides, there is always hope against them if you hang in long enough.\nOr, at least, that will probably be the gist of Stoke manager Paul Lambert’s team talk as he contemplates the daunting challenge of securing an away win in the battle against relegation. Related Coverage Bullet point previews of Premier League matches\nFour points off safety with only three games remaining, Stoke could even go down if they lose and Swansea City beat Chelsea, who are still intent on denying Liverpool a top-four finish.\nThat should be motivation enough for Liverpool to ensure they do not slip up again although Klopp faces a tricky job in deciding his line-up after injuries reduced him to three fit midfielders. Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City v Burnley - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - April 22, 2018 Stoke City's Papa Ndiaye celebrates scoring their first goal with team mates REUTERS/Peter Powell\nEven that may not be too much of a problem, however, if Salah continues in his current form as he chases down the five goals required to beat Ian Rush’s club record of 47 goals in a season.\nChampions Manchester City will also be in the mood for records at West Ham United on Sunday. City need just six more goals and two wins from their final four games to establish new Premier League scoring and points records, both of which look well within their grasp.\nBut, as one of 11 teams still scrapping to avoid relegation, West Ham have every incentive to put up a fight. The Hammers are six points above the drop zone, where Southampton sit just above Stoke and West Brom, who must beat Newcastle to stand any hope of survival.\nSaints manager Mark Hughes has never experienced relegation as manager or player but, having also been in charge of Stoke this season, he could yet break his record by helping to take two teams down in one campaign.\nOnly victory will do on Saturday at home to neighbours Bournemouth, who probably need just a point to secure their own safety. Crystal Palace and Huddersfield Town look to have winnable games against Leicester City and Everton respectively while Brighton and Hove Albion travel to Burnley.\nTime was when Manchester United v Arsenal at this time of the year would have been a title decider but on Sunday most interest will centre on whether Jose Mourinho pitches Alexis Sanchez against his former side as United seek to consolidate their hold on second place.\nTottenham Hotspur, who they beat in last week’s FA Cup semi-final, play Watford on Monday. Like Liverpool, Spurs must keep their momentum to hang on to a top-four position.
