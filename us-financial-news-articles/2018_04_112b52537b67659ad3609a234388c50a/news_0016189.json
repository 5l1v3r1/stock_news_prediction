Russia denies any involvement. The crisis has led to the worst diplomatic crisis between Russia and Western nations since the Cold War.\nYakovenko was part-way through a news conference at his official residence in London when Yulia Skripal said in a statement issued on her behalf by British police that she had woken up a week ago and her strength was growing daily.\nAsked about the statement by a reporter, Yakovenko said: “I am really happy and I hope that Sergei Skripal will also recover. I am quite sure that one day Yulia will come back to Moscow.” (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Stephen Addison)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:01:42.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
