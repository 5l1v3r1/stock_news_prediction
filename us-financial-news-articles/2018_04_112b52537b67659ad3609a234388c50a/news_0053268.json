The Quaker business - which includes the eponymous porridge oats - showed flat sales in North America due to cuts in pricing.\n“All North American units miss (but) LatAm (was) surprisingly strong,” Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein said.\nExcluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 4.3 percent to $12.56 billion, topping analysts’ estimate of $12.40 billion.\nPepsiCo also stuck to its full-year 2018 guidance.\nFILE PHOTO: Bottles of Pepsi are pictured at a grocery store in Pasadena, California, U.S., July 11, 2017.
