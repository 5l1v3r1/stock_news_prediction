It’s been five months already,” said Armand Kersten of VEB. “Every single decision that shareholders make, they have to make in the absence of information, and the company’s directors are responsible for that.”\nOutside Cape Town convention centre, dozens of protesters, led by civil servants union Public Service Union (PSA), held up placards that read: “arrogance is not the solution” and “hands off our provident funds”.\n“Our main concern is that the current board that is sitting in Steinhoff are the ones that are responsible for the loss of pension money, which directly affects our members and pensioners. So they must do the honourable thing and just resign,” Reuben Maleka, a member of trade union PSA. Steinhoff’s accounting problems stretch back to at least the 2015 financial year, it has said. It has asked auditors PwC to get to the bottom of the problems.\nSeparately, the company, which moved its primary share listing from Johannesburg to Frankfurt two years ago, has been under investigation for suspected accounting fraud in Germany since 2015.\nIt has previously said that investigation relates to whether revenues were booked properly and whether taxable profits were correctly declared.
