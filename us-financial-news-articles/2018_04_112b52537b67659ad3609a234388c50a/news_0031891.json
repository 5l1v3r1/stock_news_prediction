(\"Horizon North\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX: HNL.TO) announced today that the Corporation has successfully completed the previously announced acquisition of Shelter Modular Inc. (\"Shelter Modular\"). Horizon North has taken-up and paid for all common shares of Shelter Modular (\"Shelter Shares\") deposited under Horizon North's previously announced offer (the \"Offer\") by way of exempt take-over bid for Shelter Modular, and now holds approximately 96.6% of the outstanding Shelter Shares.\nThe successful acquisition of Shelter Modular, based in Aldergrove, British Columbia, provides Horizon North with immediate manufacturing capacity to meet increasing demand in the Modular Solutions division, and provides exposure to future opportunities to grow the modular business. Horizon North and Shelter Modular agreed to a purchase price of $4.75 million, payable in a mix of common shares of Horizon North and assumption of existing debt. As the holders of not less than 90% of the Shelter Shares outstanding (on a fully-diluted basis) have accepted the Offer, Horizon North intends to exercise its statutory rights under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta) to acquire the remaining Shelter Shares that Horizon North did not acquire under the Offer (the \"Compulsory Acquisition\"). A notice of the Compulsory Acquisition will be sent to the remaining holders of Shelter Shares.\n\"In addition to growing our manufacturing capacity, this acquisition also exposes Horizon North to future opportunities to grow modular business and gain additional market share,\" says Rod Graham, President and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon North. \"The facility's location in lower mainland British Columbia means lower transportation costs and increased labour efficiency for existing municipal and provincial government clients in BC, further enhancing our best in class service.\"\nHorizon North continues to execute on several contracts to provide modular housing solutions in the lower mainland for the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency (\"VAHA\") and across other centres in British Columbia for the BC Housing Management Commission (\"BC Housing\"). The construction of modular housing is part of a commitment from the Government of British Columbia (the \"Province\") to build supportive homes for those struggling with homelessness. The Province allocated $291 million in 2017 to support the construction of 2,000 modular housing units across various centres in British Columbia, and the 2018 provincial budget provides for substantial additional funding over the next three years to continue building affordable and student housing infrastructure.\n\"Adding this new manufacturing facility in Aldergrove to our existing facility on traditional Tk'eml√∫ps te Secwe'pemc land in Kamloops positions us to build on our current successful projects with VAHA and BC Housing and provide a made-in-British-Columbia solution to support the efforts of these government agencies to introduce critically needed housing for vulnerable BC citizens,\" adds Rod Graham.\nAbout Horizon North\nHorizon North is a publicly listed corporation (TSX: HNL.TO) providing a full range of industrial, commercial, and residential products and services.
