(Mandy Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow are both fans.) She soon noticed that the science of nutrition often took a backseat to her clients’ emotional issues. “The crux of my work would play out like a food therapy session,” she says. Lenchewski now focuses on untangling her clients’ relationships with eating and their bodies, an ethos that’s also at the heart of her new book, titled, fittingly, The Food Therapist. shirard.com \nPhoto: Susan Wood/Getty Images; Courtesy of Birkenstock; Courtesy of Block Shop; © A24/Courtesy of Everett Collection; Suthee Treewatanawong/Shutterstock; © aerolatte; John von Pamer; Aurora Photos/Offset/Shutterstock; F.

I found that there was just a different level of commitment to wellness there.\nPhoto: Mark Seliger Frank Lipman New York \nIn the wellness world, Frank Lipman, 63, would be considered a first-waver. Originally from South Africa, Dr. Lipman emigrated to the U.S. in 1984 to practice internal medicine at New York’s Lincoln Hospital, where he began to discover the limitations of his field. “My training was wonderful for the 15 percent of my patients who were acutely ill, but [I found] that the majority are not taken care of by Western medicine. So I started to explore other modalities,” he explains. In 1992, Lipman opened Eleven Eleven Wellness Center, where acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine and meditation are part of patient protocol, and in 2010, he launched Be Well, a collection of supplements. Along the way he has amassed a coterie of celebrity devotees—Michelle Williams, Sienna Miller and Arianna Huffington among them. Lipman’s latest book, How to Be Well , is a compendium of advice on all aspects of wellness, a topic Lipman is thrilled to see come to the fore. “The biggest shift is I’ve gone from being a quack to a guru,” he jokes. bewell.com \nPhoto: EyeBrowz/Alamy Stock Photo; Kerry and Luis/Offset/Shutterstock; Jack Robinson/Getty Images; Ricardo D’Angelo/Netflix; Jordi Huisman/Offset/Shutterstock; Randy Duchaine/Alamy Stock Photo; Courtesy of Rancho La Puerta; courtesy of Vitamix; Courtesy of Frank Lipman, M.D./Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; Paul Sirisalee/Offset/Shutterstock 1.

What’s the most important take-away from your new book? \nIt’s a simple manual built on what has always been the foundation of my practice: When it comes to good health, it’s about the choices we make on a daily basis. I feel passionately that if people take responsibility, they can make a huge difference in their own health with proper guidance and information.\n10. What hotel or resort do you find to be the most restorative? \nRancho La Puerta, in Tecate, Mexico.\nPhoto: Andreas Lind/CAMERALINK Food Pharmacy Lina Nertby Aurell and Mia Clase, both 40, like to say that it took them almost 25 years to understand the real reason they became friends as teens in Gothenburg, Sweden: so that they could eventually work together. In 2014, they both abandoned their careers—Aurell was a trade promoter, Clase an advertising creative director—and joined forces to launch Food Pharmacy, a Stockholm-based health blog focused on inflammation and the digestive system. Their career shift was prompted by the cancer deaths of three people close to them. “We’ve both always been hypochondriacs,” says Clase, “but after that we started investigating what we could do to live healthier.”\nClase’s father connected the pair with Stig Bengmark, a professor of medicine who studies intestinal health, and Food Pharmacy was born shortly thereafter. The pair’s philosophy, espoused both on their blog and in their new book, Food Pharmacy: A Guide to Gut Bacteria, Anti-Inflammatory Foods, and Eating for Health , is that rehabbing your gut flora is about adding key ingredients into your diet to help good bacteria propagate. “Focus on adding healthy stuff on a daily basis, instead of excluding things you like,” says Clase. foodpharmacy.blog \nPhoto: Topseller/Shutterstock; Africa Studio/Shutterstock; Ronald Dumont/Getty Images; Johnér/Offset/Shutterstock; F.
