The company hopes to use her skill set to develop a new portable water-testing unit for incorporation in the company's existing water recycling appliance. \"Lauren has the ability and track record to take the basic suite of water sensors we already have and add into it high quality optical recognition systems and AI that take the product to an entirely new level,\" said Kitzen from the company's test facility in Vancouver.\n\"I get dozens of requests from companies to help them build out products and services, but this work here, for Demizine, is important to me because it impacts lives. For me, work that has higher purpose and helps people is extremely important,\" said Dr. Barghout. \"It's a challenge, but all of AI can be challenging depending on the level of fidelity you want to achieve!\"\nAbout Demizine Technologies Inc.\nDemizine Technologies Inc. is a Canadian-based green technology company that creates breakthrough clean technology water and septic systems that promises to free homes from water and septic connection.\nMedia Contact:\nSandra Herve\n192638@email4pr.com\n416-732-0363\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lauren-barghout-joins-demizine-technologies-300623798.html\nSOURCE Demizine Technologies", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lauren-barghout-joins-demizine-technologies-300623798.html"], "published": "2018-04-04T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T17:42:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
