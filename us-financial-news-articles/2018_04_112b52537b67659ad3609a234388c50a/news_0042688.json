But there is no provision currently for that to occur,” the official said, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.\nThe Commerce Department has an appeals process for companies to try to get off the list, but it is unclear whether that would be available to ZTE because the case had been previously subject to a settlement, according to people familiar with the matter.\nEven so, ZTE would have little recourse in the near term because appeals would have to be approved by the BIS, the same agency that issued the ban.\nCompanies must submit appeals to a committee that would issue a ruling within 30 days, according to the agency’s website.\nVisitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Sergio Perez/Files ZTE said it will not give up efforts to solve problems through communication, and it is determined to take judicial measures to protect the legal rights and interests of the company.\nA state-backed Chinese trade body said the ZTE case represented a “milestone” for China Inc and highlighted compliance risks its corporate sector is facing.\nIt urged the Chinese government to speed up implementation of national guidelines on corporate oversight, and go through informal channels and seek leniency with U.S. Congress members to resolve the ZTE case.\nTRADE WAR The ban has ratcheted up tensions between China and the United States at a time when they have already threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs, fanning worries of a full-blown trade war.\nIn China, there has been a patriotic backlash with an outpouring of support for ZTE on social media and most domestic newspapers have chosen to put the lion’s share of the blame for ZTE’s troubles on the country’s heavy reliance on foreign semiconductors.\nZTE chairman Yin Yimin told domestic media on Friday at its Shenzhen headquarters that the firm would increase research and development as “relying on oneself is better than relying on others,” state media Xinhua reported.\nE-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said on Friday it had acquired a Chinese chipmaker that it said underlines its commitment to driving the development of the chip industry.\nA ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken April 17, 2018.

As of Monday’s close, they were worth some $19 billion.
