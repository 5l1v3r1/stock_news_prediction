(NASDAQ:AAL) today reported its first-quarter results, including these highlights:\nReported a first-quarter 2018 pre-tax profit of $273 million, or $468 million excluding net special items 1 , and a first-quarter net profit of $186 million, or $357 million excluding net special items\nFirst-quarter 2018 earnings were $0.39 per diluted share, or $0.75 per diluted share excluding net special items\nReturned $498 million to shareholders, including the repurchase of 8.4 million shares and dividend payments of $48 million. Announced a new $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization 2 to be completed by December 31, 2020\n“American’s team members continue to deliver solid results, including record first quarter revenue performance. Higher fuel prices led to a decline in year-over-year earnings, but we are excited about the future,” said Chairman and CEO Doug Parker. “With the youngest fleet in the industry among our large network peer competitors, a significantly improved product, and a team of 130,000 who demonstrate extraordinary care for our customers, we are well positioned for long-term success.”\nFirst-Quarter Revenue and Expenses\nPre-tax earnings excluding net special items for the first quarter of 2018 were $468 million, a $193 million decrease from the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP Non-GAAP 1 1Q18\n1Q17\n1Q18\n1Q17\nTotal operating revenues ($ mil) $ 10,401 $ 9,820 $ 10,401 $ 9,820 Total operating expenses ($ mil) 9,970 9,083 9,775 8,962 Operating income ($ mil) 431 737 626 858 Pre-tax income ($ mil) 273 535 468 661 Pre-tax margin 2.6 % 5.4 % 4.5 % 6.7 % Net income ($ mil) 186 340 357 414 Earnings per diluted share $ 0.39 $ 0.67 $ 0.75 $ 0.82 Robust demand for air travel drove a 5.9 percent year-over-year increase in first-quarter 2018 total revenue, to a first quarter record $10.4 billion. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) grew in all geographic regions, with notable strength in Latin America. Cargo revenue was up 18.8 percent to $227 million due primarily to a 10.9 percent increase in volume and a 7.1 percent increase in cargo yield. Other revenue was up 10.0 percent to $694 million. First-quarter total revenue per available seat mile increased by 3.5 percent compared to the first quarter 2017 on a 2.3 percent increase in total available seat miles. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth and the second quarter in a row where all geographic regions showed PRASM growth on a year-over-year basis.\nTotal first-quarter 2018 operating expenses were $10.0 billion, up 9.8 percent year-over-year driven by a 25.7 percent increase in consolidated fuel expense. Had fuel prices remained unchanged versus the first quarter 2017, total expenses would have been $412 million lower. Total first-quarter 2018 cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 15.15 cents, up 7.3 percent from first-quarter 2017. Excluding fuel and special items, total first-quarter CASM was 11.57 cents, up 2.8 percent year-over-year.\n“We made significant progress on several key initiatives during the first quarter, including fleet simplification and adding more travel options for customers by expanding Basic Economy,” said President Robert Isom.\n“Our recently announced order for 47 Boeing 787s enables the retirement of older aircraft, including the Airbus A330-300, the Boeing 767, and certain Boeing 777-200s. These replacement aircraft will provide improved fuel efficiency, lower maintenance costs, greater range, and an enhanced customer experience.\n“In April, we launched trans-Atlantic Basic Economy together with our Atlantic partners. Basic Economy is now rolled out in the U.S. and certain markets in Mexico and the Caribbean. We continue to look for more opportunities to launch this popular travel option for our customers,” Isom said.\nStrategic Objectives\nAmerican Airlines is focused on four long-term strategic objectives: Create a World-Class Customer Experience, Make Culture a Competitive Advantage, Ensure Long-Term Financial Strength, and Think Forward, Lead Forward.\nCreate a World-Class Customer Experience\nAmerican is committed to delivering a world-class product by creating value and building trust with customers, driving operational excellence, and strengthening its network, especially where the company has a competitive advantage. During the first quarter, American:\nFiled an application along with Qantas to the U.S. Department of Transportation seeking approval to form a joint business to better serve customers flying between North America and Australia and New Zealand. The proposed joint business will significantly improve service and stimulate demand, and is expected to unlock more than $300 million annually in consumer benefits that are not achievable through any other form of cooperation\nEnhanced the travel experience between New York LaGuardia and Chicago for business customers by adding that route to the company’s shuttle portfolio. The shuttle is highly valued by top business customers and offers an hourly schedule and dedicated gates and check-in areas\nExpanded Basic Economy to its first trans-Atlantic routes on April 11, including Dallas/Fort Worth-London Heathrow, giving customers a new option for American’s lowest fares in partnership with American’s Atlantic joint business partners\nIntroduced new wine sommelier Bobby Stuckey to lead American’s wine program, selecting premium wines for customers to enjoy in Admirals Club lounges, Flagship Lounges, Flagship First Dining and in flight\nIntroduced new meals on certain Pacific flights. Japan Airlines’ Chef Jun Kurogi has designed a traditional Japanese meal in premium cabins on flights from Tokyo, and Chef Sean Connolly has designed dishes for premium cabins on flights from Auckland and Sydney\nMake Culture a Competitive Advantage\nAmerican is creating an environment that cares for frontline team members, provides competitive pay, and equips its team with the right tools to support its customers. During the first quarter, American:\nHosted 7,000 American Airlines leaders at its Annual Leadership Conference in Dallas. Team members who oversee people spent a full day learning about American’s four strategic objectives and how to implement them in partnership with their teams\nHonored 103 team members at the company’s Annual Chairman’s Award celebration in Dallas earlier this month. The Chairman’s Award is the airline’s highest recognition, and recipients this year were recognized for accomplishments including making complicated maintenance tasks easier and safer, caring for colleagues during personal tragedies, and making customers feel like family\nAccrued $29 million for the company’s 2018 profit sharing program during the quarter\nCompleted the transition to a new cloud-based HR information system which provides seamless integration of team member data and hiring, onboarding, compensation and performance-related tasks. In April, American also implemented a new payroll system for U.S.-based management and support staff, with the remaining team members to transition on a phased basis\nEnsure Long-Term Financial Strength\nAmerican is focused on capturing the efficiencies created by the merger, delivering on its earnings potential, and creating value for its owners. In the first quarter, American:\nReturned $498 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing the total since mid-2014 to $11.9 billion. These repurchases have reduced the share count by 38 percent to 467.4 million shares as of March 31, 2018\nIn April, announced an order for 47 new Boeing 787 widebody aircraft consisting of 22 787-8s scheduled to begin arriving in 2020 and 25 787-9s scheduled to begin arriving in 2023. The 787-8s will replace American’s Boeing 767-300s, while later 787-9 deliveries will replace Airbus A330-300s and older 777-200 widebody aircraft. In addition, American deferred 40 737 MAX aircraft and 3 Airbus A321neo aircraft. These changes better align future aircraft deliveries with planned aircraft retirements and reduce planned capital expenditures by approximately $200 million in 2019 and $800 million in 2020\nOn April 26, 2018 declared a dividend of $0.10 per share, to be paid on May 22, 2018, to stockholders of record as of May 8, 2018\nThink Forward, Lead Forward\nAmerican is committed to re-establishing itself as an industry leader by creating an action-oriented culture that moves quickly to bring products to market, embraces technological change, and quickly seizes upon new opportunities for its network and product. In the first quarter, American:\nReached a new lease agreement with the city of Chicago that clears the way for an $8.5 billion redevelopment plan at O’Hare that includes more gates, a better structure for connecting travelers, and a better overall customer experience that will help close the competitive gate gap there\nReached an agreement earlier this month to get access to 15 additional gates in DFW Terminal E. This allows the company to significantly grow departures at its largest hub to more than 900 per day, enabling more customers to access our global network\nCompleted all customer-facing renovations in Terminal B, where American’s regional operation at Dallas/Fort Worth is located\nIn April, opened five new gates at Chicago O’Hare Terminal 3, permitting American to provide improved service to its customers at this key competitive hub\nGuidance and Investor Update\nAmerican expects its second-quarter 2018 TRASM to increase approximately 1.5 to 3.5 percent year-over-year, which reflects expected continued strength in demand for both business and leisure travel. The company also expects its second-quarter 2018 pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 7.5 and 9.5 percent. 3 Due to higher fuel prices included in the guidance provided today, American now expects its 2018 diluted earnings per share excluding net special items to be between $5.00 and $6.00. 3\nFor additional financial forecasting detail, please refer to the company’s investor relations update, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K. This filing will be available at aa.com/investorrelations .\nConference Call / Webcast Details\nThe company will conduct a live audio webcast of its earnings call today at 7:30 a.m. CT, which will be available to the public on a listen-only basis at aa.com/investorrelations . An archive of the webcast will be available on the website through May 26.\nNotes\nIn the first quarter, the company recognized $195 million in net special items before the effect of income taxes. First quarter special items principally included $82 million of fleet restructuring expenses and $59 million of merger integration expenses. See the accompanying notes in the Financial Tables section of this press release for further explanation, including a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP financial information. Share repurchases under the buyback program may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. The program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific number of shares or continue a dividend for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at the company's discretion. American is unable to reconcile certain forward-looking projections to GAAP as the nature or amount of special items cannot be determined at this time.\nAbout American Airlines Group\nAmerican Airlines and American Eagle offer an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries.

Note: Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.\nReconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information American Airlines Group Inc. (the “Company”) sometimes uses financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate its current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company is providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.\nThe tables below present the reconciliations of the following GAAP measures to their non-GAAP measures:\n- Pre-Tax Income (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Income Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP measure)\n- Pre-Tax Margin (GAAP measure) to Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP measure)\n- Net Income (GAAP measure) to Net Income Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP measure)\n- Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share (GAAP measure) to Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP measure)\n- Operating Income (GAAP measure) to Operating Income Excluding Special Items (non-GAAP measure)\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude special items allows management an additional tool to better understand the Company’s core operating performance.\nAdditionally, the tables below present the reconciliations of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses total operating costs excluding special items and fuel to evaluate the Company's current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which the Company has no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and special items allows management an additional tool to better understand and analyze the Company’s non-fuel costs and core operating performance. 3 Months Ended\nMarch 31, Percent\nChange Reconciliation of Pre-Tax Income Excluding Special Items 2018 2017 (1) (in millions) Pre-tax income as reported $ 273 $ 535 Pre-tax special items: Special items, net (2) 195 119 Regional operating special items, net - 2 Nonoperating special items, net - 5 Total pre-tax special items 195 126 Pre-tax income excluding special items $ 468 $ 661 -29 % Calculation of Pre-Tax Margin Pre-tax income as reported $ 273 $ 535 Total operating revenues as reported $ 10,401 $ 9,820 Pre-tax margin 2.6 % 5.4 % Calculation of Pre-Tax Margin Excluding Special Items Pre-tax income excluding special items $ 468 $ 661 Total operating revenues as reported $ 10,401 $ 9,820 Pre-tax margin excluding special items 4.5 % 6.7 % Reconciliation of Net Income Excluding Special Items Net income as reported $ 186 $ 340 Special items: Total pre-tax special items (2) 195 126 Income tax special items (3) 22 - Net tax effect of special items (46 ) (52 ) Net income excluding special items $ 357 $ 414 -14 % Reconciliation of Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share Excluding 3 Months Ended\nMarch 31, Special Items 2018 2017 (1) (in millions, except per share amounts) Net income excluding special items $ 357 $ 414 Shares used for computation (in thousands): Basic 472,297 503,902 Diluted 474,598 507,797 Earnings per share excluding special items: Basic $ 0.76 $ 0.82 Diluted $ 0.75 $ 0.82 Reconciliation of Operating Income Excluding Special Items Operating income as reported $ 431 $ 737 Special items: Special items, net (2) 195 119 Regional operating special items, net - 2 Operating income excluding special items $ 626 $ 858 Reconciliation of Total Operating Cost per ASM Excluding Special 3 Months Ended\nMarch 31, Items and Fuel 2018 2017 (1) (in millions) Total operating expenses as reported $ 9,970 $ 9,083 Special items: Special items, net (2) (195 ) (119 ) Regional operating special items, net - (2 ) Total operating expenses, excluding special items 9,775 8,962 Fuel: Aircraft fuel and related taxes - mainline (1,763 ) (1,402 ) Aircraft fuel and related taxes - regional (398 ) (318 ) Total operating expenses, excluding special items and fuel $ 7,614 $ 7,242 (in cents) Total operating expenses per ASM as reported 15.15 14.12 Special items per ASM: Special items, net (2) (0.30 ) (0.18 ) Total operating expenses per ASM, excluding special items 14.85 13.93 Fuel per ASM: Aircraft fuel and related taxes - mainline (2.68 ) (2.18 ) Aircraft fuel and related taxes - regional (0.60 ) (0.49 ) Total operating expenses per ASM, excluding special items and fuel 11.57 11.25 Note: Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.
