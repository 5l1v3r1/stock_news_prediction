Clayton went to explain the SEC’s steps to combat fraud will help the cryptocurrency industry develop. \nThe remarks from SEC’s highest-ranking official may signal a softening approach to ICOs. \nFor more on cryptocurrency, see Fortune’s video: \nClayton’s remarks follow the SEC’s recent charges against the co-founders of Centra Tech. The agency stopped an ICO and charged Sohrab Sharma and Robert Farka with fraud after they raised $32 million by selling “unregistered securities,” CoinDesk reported earlier. \nClayton said that such actions were in the industry’s best interests. “I think if we don’t stop the fraudsters, there is a serious risk [of a] regulatory pendulum — the regulatory actions will be so severe that they will restrict the capacity of this new security,” he reportedly told the audience.
