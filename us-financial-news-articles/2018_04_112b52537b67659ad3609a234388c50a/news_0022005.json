The hackers replaced the “ Despacito ” cover image on YouTube with a photo of people wearing masks and pointing guns at the camera, according to a screenshot taken by the BBC, and sprinkled their own names, nicknames and messages — including “Free Palestine” — across videos from artists including Taylor Swift, Drake, Shakira, and Selena Gomez. \nThe videos were temporarily taken down once the problem was discovered, the BBC adds. @Vevo for us it was just a game. you can dm me @Prosoxhacker or Kuroi'SH ( @sh_kuroi or @GKimiaie , sh_kuroi unless he prooves he's the real.) I know Kuroi'SH since 2015. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T07:21:04.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
