First quarter 2018 value-added sales grew 22% to a record $181.3 million, from prior-year value-added sales of $149.0 million. First quarter 2018 net income was $0.51 per share, diluted, compared to $0.15 per share in the prior year first quarter. Adjusted earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were up 76% at $0.51 per share, diluted, from $0.29 per share in the prior year. The Company confirms its previously announced full-year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share, diluted.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nNet sales for first quarter 2018 were $303.5 million, compared to $240.7 million for the prior year. Value-added sales grew 22% to a record $181.3 million, compared to $149.0 million for the prior year. Growth was driven by a 14% increase in the base business, plus the acquisition of Heraeus’ high-performance target materials business (HTB), which contributed incremental year-over-year growth of $12.2 million. New product sales were $30.7 million in the quarter, representing 17% of total value-added sales.\nOperating profit for the quarter totaled $13.3 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior year. Excluding special items, first quarter adjusted operating profit improved 75% to $14.0 million from $8.0 million in 2017.\nFirst quarter net income was $10.6 million, or $0.51 per share, diluted, compared to net income of $3.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2018, which exclude special items related to a legacy legal matter and discrete tax adjustment, were $0.51 per share, diluted, up 76% compared to $0.29 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\nJugal Vijayvargiya, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased with the strong start to the year as we continue to build on the momentum gained in 2017. This quarter represents the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in both value-added sales and adjusted earnings. Our recently announced organizational changes, our multi-pillar strategy, and laser-like focus on execution are enabling us to consistently deliver profitable growth. We are affirming our previously announced full-year 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share.”\nBUSINESS SEGMENT FIRST QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nAdvanced Materials\nAdvanced Materials’ net sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $153.5 million, versus $114.7 million in the prior year. Value-added sales increased 23% to $58.3 million, versus $47.3 million in the prior year quarter. The HTB acquisition contributed $12.2 million of incremental value-added sales year over year. Adjusted operating profit was $5.9 million, compared to $7.4 million in the prior year due to softer demand in the consumer electronics end market, unfavorable product mix, and planned integration expenses related to the move of HTB to a new, state-of-the-art target manufacturing facility in Alzenau, Germany.\nPerformance Alloys and Composites\nNet sales for Performance Alloys and Composites were $118.3 million for first quarter 2018 compared to $92.6 million in the prior year. Value-added sales were $100.3 million versus $79.2 million in the prior year. This significant 27% sales increase was primarily driven by new product sales growth, improved product mix, and end market demand.\nAdjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.9 million, or 10% of value-added sales compared to $0.7 million in the prior year quarter. The significant year-over-year profit increase was led by performance improvements across the business and sales growth.\nPrecision Coatings\nPrecision Coatings’ net sales for the first quarter of 2018 were $31.7 million versus prior-year sales of $33.4 million. Value-added sales of $23.6 million were up $0.3 million compared to $23.3 million for the same period of 2017. Operating profit increased 55% to $3.4 million, or 14% of value-added sales in the first quarter of 2018, versus $2.2 million in the prior year led by favorable product mix and operational performance improvements.\nOUTLOOK\nThe Company delivered favorable first quarter 2018 financial results for both top and bottom line, led by performance improvements, increased new product sales, and improved end market demand. We expect to continue the strong performance improvements across the business and complete the relocation of HTB’s European manufacturing operations to a new German facility. As a result, we are affirming our 2018 full-year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.95 to $2.10 per share, diluted, which represents a 13 to 22 percent increase over the prior year.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS GUIDANCE\nIt is not possible for the Company to identify the amount or significance of future adjustments associated with potential insurance and litigation claims, legacy environmental costs, acquisition and integration costs, certain income tax items, or other special items that the Company adjusts in the presentation of adjusted earnings guidance. These items are dependent on future events that are not reasonably estimable at this time. Accordingly, the Company is unable to reconcile without unreasonable effort the forecasted range of adjusted earnings guidance for the full year to a comparable GAAP range. However, items excluded from the Company's adjusted earnings guidance include the historical adjustments noted in Attachments 4 and 5 to this press release.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nMaterion Corporation will host an investor conference call with analysts at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, April 26, 2018.

Internally, management also reviews net sales on a value-added basis. Value-added sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that deducts the value of the pass-through metals sold from net sales. Value-added sales allows management to assess the impact of differences in net sales between periods or segments and analyze the resulting margins and profitability without the distortion of the movements in pass-through metal prices. The dollar amount of gross margin and operating profit is not affected by the value-added sales calculation. The Company sells other metals and materials that are not considered direct pass throughs, and these costs are not deducted from net sales to calculate value-added sales.\nThe Company’s pricing policy is to pass the cost of these metals on to customers in order to mitigate the impact of price volatility on the Company’s results from operations. Value-added information is being presented since changes in metal prices may not directly impact profitability. It is the Company’s intent to allow users of the financial statements to review sales with and without the impact of the pass-through metals.\nAttachment 5\nMaterion Corporation and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Profitability (Unaudited)\nFirst Quarter Ended Fourth Quarter Ended (Millions except per share amounts) March 30, 2018 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 GAAP as Reported Net Sales $ 303.5 $ 240.7 $ 308.7 Operating profit 13.3 3.7 14.3 Net income (loss) 10.6 3.1 (8.2 ) EPS - Diluted $ 0.51 $ 0.15 $ (0.41 ) Operating Profit Special Items Cost reductions $ — $ 0.7 $ (1.3 ) Legacy legal & environmental costs 0.7 0.2 0.3 CEO transition — 1.7 0.7 Acquisition costs — 1.7 — Total operating profit special items $ 0.7 $ 4.3 $ (0.3 ) Operating Profit Special Items - net of tax $ 0.6 $ 2.8 $ (0.2 ) Tax Special Item $ (0.6 ) $ — $ 18.9 Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Profitability Value-added (VA) sales $ 181.3 $ 149.0 $ 181.2 Operating profit 14.0 8.0 14.0 Operating profit % of VA 7.7 % 5.4 % 7.7 % Net income 10.6 5.9 10.5 EPS - Diluted $ 0.51 $ 0.29 $ 0.51 In addition to presenting financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this earnings release contains financial measures, including operating profit, segment operating profit, net income, and earnings per share, on a non-GAAP basis. As detailed in the above reconciliation and Attachment 4, we have adjusted the results for certain special items such as CEO transition costs, cost reduction initiatives (i.e., asset impairment charges and severance), legacy environmental costs, merger and acquisition costs, and certain income tax items from the applicable GAAP financial measure. Internally, management reviews the results of operations without the impact of these costs in order to assess the profitability from ongoing activities. We are providing this information because we believe it will assist investors in analyzing our financial results and, when viewed in conjunction with the GAAP results, provide a more comprehensive understanding of the factors and trends affecting our operations.\nAttachment 6\nMaterion Corporation and Subsidiaries Value-added sales by Market (Unaudited)\nFirst Quarter Ended Fourth Quarter Ended (Millions) March 30, 2018 March 31, 2017 % Change December 31, 2017 % Change Materion Corporation Consumer Electronics $ 53.6 $ 46.1 16.3 % $ 57.9 (7.4 )% Industrial Components 32.1 23.6 36.0 % 26.9 19.3 % Energy 17.4 8.9 95.5 % 14.8 17.6 % Medical 15.5 16.1 (3.7 )% 13.0 19.2 % Automotive Electronics 14.8 12.5 18.4 % 12.6 17.5 % Defense 12.3 11.9 3.4 % 18.5 (33.5 )% Telecom Infrastructure 8.7 6.7 29.9 % 8.2 6.1 % Other 26.9 23.2 15.9 % 29.3 (8.2 )% Total $ 181.3 $ 149.0 21.7 % $ 181.2 0.1 % Performance Alloy and Composites Consumer Electronics $ 20.0 $ 16.5 21.2 % $ 20.4 (2.0 )% Industrial Components 25.8 17.6 46.6 % 21.0 22.9 % Energy 6.4 5.0 28.0 % 5.9 8.5 % Medical 1.6 2.0 (20.0 )% 1.6 — % Automotive Electronics 14.6 12.1 20.7 % 12.4 17.7 % Defense 6.6 7.4 (10.8 )% 13.2 (50.0 )% Telecom Infrastructure 7.1 5.1 39.2 % 6.6 7.6 % Other 18.2 13.5 34.8 % 19.9 (8.5 )% Total $ 100.3 $ 79.2 26.6 % $ 101.0 (0.7 )% Advanced Materials Consumer Electronics $ 29.3 $ 26.1 12.3 % $ 32.1 (8.7 )% Industrial Components 3.8 3.1 22.6 % 3.3 15.2 % Energy 11.0 3.9 182.1 % 8.9 23.6 % Medical 2.9 2.4 20.8 % 2.3 26.1 % Automotive Electronics — — — % — — % Defense 1.4 1.2 16.7 % 1.4 — % Telecom Infrastructure 1.5 1.6 (6.3 )% 1.6 (6.3 )% Other 8.4 9.0 (6.7 )% 8.7 (3.4 )% Total $ 58.3 $ 47.3 23.3 % $ 58.3 — % Precision Coatings Consumer Electronics $ 4.3 $ 3.5 22.9 % $ 5.4 (20.4 )% Industrial Components 2.5 2.9 (13.8 )% 2.6 (3.8 )% Energy — — — % — — % Medical 11.0 11.7 (6.0 )% 9.1 20.9 % Automotive Electronics 0.2 0.4 (50.0 )% 0.2 — % Defense 4.3 3.3 30.3 % 3.9 10.3 % Telecom Infrastructure 0.1 — — % — — % Other 1.2 1.5 (20.0 )% 1.7 (29.4 )% Total $ 23.6 $ 23.3 1.3 % $ 22.9 3.1 % Eliminations $ (0.9 ) $ (0.8 ) $ (1.0 ) Prior year numbers have been restated to conform to the current year presentation.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005870/en/\nMaterion Corporation\nInvestor Contact:\nStephen F.
