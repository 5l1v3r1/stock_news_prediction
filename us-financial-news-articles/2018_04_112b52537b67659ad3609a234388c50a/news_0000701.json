REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini \nThe baptism took place during a long Holy Saturday, or Easter eve, Mass for some 10,000 people in St. Peter’s Basilica. \nThe church, the largest in Christendom, was dark at the start of the service before lights were turned on, signifying the passage from darkness to light when the Bible says Jesus rose from the dead. \nThe pope traditionally welcomes new members of the Church during the Saturday night service.

The Nigerian now works as a stockman at a warehouse for a charity organisation. \nThe other newly baptised at the service came from Albania, Peru, Italy and the United States. \nFrancis has made defence of migrants a key part of his papacy. \nOn Sunday, the pope ends Holy See services by celebrating an Easter Mass and then delivers his twice-yearly “Urbi et Orbi” (“to the city and the world”) blessing and message from the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica.
