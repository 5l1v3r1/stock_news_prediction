One potential solution is to lower your expenses. No one wants to surrender the things they enjoy – whether it's a sports activity, a trip to the mall or a warm home in winter – but sometimes we can achieve our objectives by going about things in a different way. Here are five ideas for retiring on less money, without feeling any pain.\n1. Downsize. It's not difficult to find a cheaper place to live, but make sure you will want to live there. Your priorities are likely to change as you approach retirement. You might be compelled to hang onto an old suburban home because it's familiar, or in case the kids want to move back in. But familiar isn't always best, especially if the house is too much work and no longer fits your needs.

If you do want to travel, drive a few hundred miles, rather than fly a few thousand miles. You'll save money on airfare, rental cars, currency exchange and a host of other charges. You can also save money by staying with family . Spending a few nights with friends or relatives is a low cost alternative to an overpriced hotel, and they may also have tips about the sites you want to see. There's money to be saved if you don't go too far or else stay with family.\nMore from US News & World Report:\nCity perks, suburb life\nWhen will my tax refund arrive?\nHow to get the biggest tax refund this year\n3. Develop a support network. Almost anything we do in a group costs less than doing it by ourselves – and is usually more fun. Sharing expenses is one benefit of having a network of friends and family. Sharing work and responsibilities is another. When my mother-in-law got too old to drive, instead of giving up her car, she made an arrangement with a friend. The friend drives her to the supermarket and doctor appointments, and in return the friend can use the car whenever else she wants. Many people make these reciprocal arrangements: pet sitting for one another, sharing a vacation home or trading yard work for cooking. Beyond the financial benefit, having a network of", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T00:24:29.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
