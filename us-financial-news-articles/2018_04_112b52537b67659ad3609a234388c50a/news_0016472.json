Specifically he wants to sell the April 25 weekly 260-strike put and buy the April 25 weekly 255-strike put for a credit of $1.25, or $125 per options spread. This means that if SPY rallies and closes above $260 on April 25 expiration, then Gordon would make the $125 credit on the trade.\nHowever, should SPY close below $255 on April 25, then Gordon could lose up to $380. To prevent such a loss, Gordon wants to establish a point at which to stop out of the trade.\n\"If the market begins to push back below the $255 mark, if we go for a third test of this support level, I think there's going to be sufficient momentum to push through,\" Gordon said.\nAll three major indexes had their best day of April on Tuesday and are now positive for the month, surging as words from Chinese President Xi Jinping momentarily assuaged fears of an impending trade war.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
