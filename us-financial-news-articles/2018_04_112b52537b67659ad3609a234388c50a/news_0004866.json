REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo \nUnion leaders said in a statement more shift agreements could be canceled if wage talks broke down. \nUnions have said they could call a strike in May if no deal is agreed and said on Wednesday they would seek a 14 percent wage rise for the next 12 months. \nLast week, they rejected management’s offer of a 10 percent increase. \nStrikes are a rare event in the central European country whose economic growth is propelled by the car sector. \nWith strong growth in recent years and unemployment dropping to its lowest level in two decades, wages have been rising rapidly across sectors, putting pressure on employers. \nSkoda, the country’s biggest exporter, has blossomed under nearly 30 years of Volkswagen ownership to become one of the group’s profit drivers, even beating luxury brand Audi’s ( NSUG.DE ) and BMW’s ( BMWG.DE ) operating margins last year.
