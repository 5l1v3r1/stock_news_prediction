REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\nThe European Commission and Britain’s finance ministry said they had asked the two central banks to convene a working group on “risk management in the period around 30 March 2019 in the area of financial services”.\nThe two central banks are the main banking supervisors in Britain and the euro zone.\n“The European Commission and (Britain’s) HM Treasury will attend as observers and other relevant authorities will be invited on an issue-specific basis,” they added.\n“The primary responsibility to prepare for Brexit remains with market participants.” FILE PHOTO: Central Bank Governors Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Mark Carney of the Bank of England attend ECB's Central Bank Communications Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, November 14, 2017. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo\nThe work will be separate from negotiations between Britain and the bloc over their divorce settlement, and on the future shape of trading relations.\nBritain and the EU have agreed on a “standstill” transition deal from Brexit Day to the end of 2020 but it won’t be ratified until October or later.\nIt could be derailed by failure to agree on other issues like border relations between Britain and Ireland, leaving banks facing a “hard” Brexit next March.
