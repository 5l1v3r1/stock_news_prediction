Numerous studies and recent news articles show that CBD use is increasing worldwide and the timing of our entry into this market space could not be better.”\n“Prior to our acquisition of the assets and IP, CanniPlus launched a new line of CBD products. In addition, CanniPlus signed exclusive consulting and distribution agreements with Florida based Medical Marijuana Consulting Group (”MMCG”) and HL Medical, Inc.” said Reid. “MMCG has five retail locations in South Florida where they assist with the application process for clients seeking a State of Florida Medical Marijuana Card. HL Medical is a network of 20 clinics and 109 certified and experienced medical marijuana physicians in the State of Florida.”\nReid continued, “Our exclusive agreements with MMCG and HL Medical will provide consulting services and an immediate vertical distribution channel for our line of CBD tinctures, edibles and topicals. Studies suggest that CBDs may lead to relief of pain, stress, and anxiety. Our HL Medical Doctor network will provide clients with evaluations and recommendations on the use of our CBD products.”\nCannabidiol, also known as CBD is found throughout the seeds, stalk, and flowers of cannabis plants including hemp and marijuana.
