Paulo newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio/File Photo The Boeing and Embraer partnership would create a new company in which the U.S. planemaker would have an 80.01 percent stake and the Brazilian firm 19.99 percent, the paper said, adding this was a model supported by the Brazilian government.\nThe Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo Boeing, Embraer and Brazil’s Defense Ministry did not have an immediate comment on the report.\nThe two jet manufacturers said in December they were discussing “a potential combination,” but the Brazilian government, which holds veto power over strategic moves at Embraer, needs to approve the deal.\nThe paper said one of the points still under discussion was the appointment of a government representative to the board of the new company. Boeing is against this, O Estado said, but the Brazilian government is strongly in support of the move.\nThe joint venture will only include Embraer’s commercial jet operation, and exclude its defense and executive jet businesses, O Estado said. Boeing’s initial expectation was to include all three Embraer business units in the tie-up, the paper said.\nReporting by Ana Mano; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T15:22:09.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
