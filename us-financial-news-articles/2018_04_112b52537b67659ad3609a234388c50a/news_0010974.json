It says no other personal details about customers, such as their passport, security or frequent-flyer account information, was affected.\nThe Atlanta-based airline says (24)7.ai informed it of the breach last week. Delta brought in federal law enforcement and forensic teams and confirmed that the unauthorized access was cut off by October.\nDelta says it will make sure customers aren't held responsible if their payment cards were used fraudulently. It will create a website Thursday to update customers.\n(24)7.ai, which is based in San Jose, California, said a \"small number\" of its client companies had their online customer payment information potentially exposed. It said it is confident that its platform is now secure and is working with its clients to determine if any of their customer information was accessed.\nThe company says it works with industries ranging from financial services to healthcare and e-commerce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T02:45:49.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
