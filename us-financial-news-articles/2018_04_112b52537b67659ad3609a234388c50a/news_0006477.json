It simply used registry data to track weights at ages seven, 13 and in early adulthood to look for correlations to diet-dependent diabetes by age 30 to 60. \nWhat they found was that more time spent having a normal weight generally provided more protection. \n“There’s a constant reduction in risk” if the weight stays off longer, said Baker, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Copenhagen. “The game is never over, so to speak.” \nMore than 23 percent of children worldwide are regarded as overweight or obese. \nMost of the focus of past research has been on obesity, but the new study looked at people who were overweight. “We’re not talking the extremes of obesity,” said Baker. “This is lowering the bar to say we need to be concerned, even if levels are not classified as obese.” \nThe Baker team found that 72 percent of the males who developed type 2 diabetes between ages 30 and 60 were never overweight. \nBut in the remaining men, the age when they were overweight made a difference. \nBeing overweight at age seven, 13 and in early adulthood made it four times more likely that the person would develop diabetes. \nAdding extra pounds by the time puberty arrives and keeping them on as an adult posed a 3.87-fold greater risk. \n“Since overweight during puberty appears to be a particularly important factor involved in increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes in middle and late adulthood, normalization of BMI (body-mass index) before these ages may reduce this risk,” the researchers said. \nBMI is a ratio of height to weight.
