The goal of that project is to help with Kingdom's digital goals, the company said. \nThe project will unfold over a period of four years and include the establishment of a public cloud data center in the country, an open platform for local developers, and a center to support Saudi start-ups and other companies. \nVision 2030 was formulated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the country's economy and make it less dependent on oil. The plan includes a greater focus on technology, including a network of data centers. \nLast month, Saudi Arabia signed memorandums of understanding with U.S. companies including Google , Raytheon and J.P. Morgan Chase . Social media platform Snap is also reportedly in talks to set up shop in the Kingdom. China now SAP's third-largest market \nMucic said SAP is seeing growth in China after investing \"billions of euros\" over the last five-to-six years and building distribution a well as research and development capacity in the country. \n\"We have seen tremendous high double-digit growth in China as a result of that,\" he said, adding the country made \"more or less into the number 3 spot of our global markets worldwide.\" The Middle East is one of the top six markets for the firm, Mucic added. \nHe explained that he isn't worried about SAP getting caught in the crossfire amid ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. \n\"SAP is a global firm,\" he said. \"One of our core strengths is that we're active, and we have a leading position in virtually all mature, but also emerging, markets.\" \nOperating in many markets at the same time prevents any one of them from having too great of a negative effect on the company, he said. \n— CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T09:56:52.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
