FILE PHOTO: Aluminium ingots are seen stored at the foundry shop of the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, July 27, 2016. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin//File Photo \nThe United States on April 6 imposed sanctions against several Russian entities and individuals, including Rusal ( 0486.HK ) and its major shareholder Oleg Deripaska, to punish Moscow for its suspected meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other alleged “malign activity.” \nRusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminum producer, has been particularly hard hit as the sanctions have caused concern among some customers, suppliers and creditors that they could be blacklisted too through association with the company. \nA “temporary nationalization” is an option for some sanctions-hit companies, but not Rusal, Siluanov was quoted as saying. He did not name the companies he was referring to. \nA Kremlin spokesman had said on Thursday that temporary nationalization was one of the options for helping Rusal. \nAccording to another news agency, RIA, Rusal has only requested government support with liquidity and with demand for aluminum so far, Siluanov said. \nRIA quoted the minister as saying the government was not considering state purchases of aluminum for now.
