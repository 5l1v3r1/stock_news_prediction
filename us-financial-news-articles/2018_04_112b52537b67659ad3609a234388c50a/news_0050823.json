REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon The Trump administration last week rolled out an overhaul of U.S. arms export policy aimed at expanding sales to allies, saying it would bolster the American defence industry and create jobs at home.\nRick Edwards, executive vice president of Lockheed Martin International, told Reuters the initiative should help speed up progress on foreign weapons sales that have already helped fuel his company’s growth in recent years.\n“It will reassure some of our allies that we’re going to move the process faster,” he said in an interview on the eve of the ILA Berlin Air Show. “They get frustrated with how long it takes to get through all the wickets.”\nForeign sales accounted for about 30 percent of Lockheed’s revenues in 2017 and should expand further in coming years, Edwards said, although he declined to name a specific target.\nLockheed on Tuesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast, helped in part by sales of its stealthy F-35 combat jets.\nEdwards said that he would not be surprised if U.S. allies in the Gulf began requesting information about the F-35 during the Trump presidency, although future sales would depend on political decisions in that region and the United States.\n“These countries are very strong allies, and they’re buying a lot of American equipment, so the logical next step is that they’ll pursue the rest of American capabilities,” he said.\nAt the same time, he said, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours were working to beef up their air and missile defence capabilities and meet other military needs, which would probably take precedence before they moved ahead on any F-35 purchases.\nA planned sale of Lockheed’s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system is currently in the contract review process in Saudi Arabia, he said.\nLockheed is working closely with Saudi Arabian Military Industries, or SAMI, to work out details on local jobs and local sovereignty, and is likely to wind up with hundreds of Lockheed employees in the kingdom, Edwards said.\nSaudi Arabia has announced “ambitious” plans to increase the percentage of local work done on weapons contracts to around 50 percent from 2 to 3 percent currently by 2030, he said.\nLockheed is also “bullish” on sales in Europe, where it already has 3,500 employees and eight offices, Edwards added.\nThe company is focused heavily on several German competitions, including a multi-billion-euro heavy-lift helicopter competition in which its CH-53K King Stallion will square off against Boeing’s twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. The CH-53K will make its international debut at the air show this week.\nEdwards said he was confident that the company’s joint venture with European missile maker MBDA would be able to make a deal with Germany for a missile defence system after years of negotiations. “I don’t see any showstoppers and the messaging from our customers has been great,” he said.\nLockheed is also hoping to score Germany as a new buyer for its F-35 stealth combat jets. The U.S. government on Tuesday provided data to the German defence ministry on the F-35 and the F-15E and F/A-18E/F fighter jets built by Boeing Co ( BA.N ).\nAdditional reporting by Mike Stone in Washington, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T00:11:19.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
