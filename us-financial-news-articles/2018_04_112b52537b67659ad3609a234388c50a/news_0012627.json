That’s the Hungarian stance.”\n“We do not want to see a significant minority among ourselves that has different cultural characteristics and background. We would like to keep Hungary as Hungary,” he said.\nIn August 2015, hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers entered Hungary from the Balkans, en route to western Europe.\nIn September, Orban’s government erected a fence on the Serbian border to keep them out, and the unrelenting anti-immigration stance has been central to his policies ever since.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses the supporters after the announcement of the partial results of parliamentary election in Budapest, Hungary, April 8, 2018.REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger This has earned Orban respect from prominent far-right politicians in western Europe.\n“Orban has more backbone and character than all the cowards of the EU combined,” Geert Wilders, chairman of the Dutch anti-Islam Party for Freedom said in a tweet in April 2017.\n“I respect Viktor Orban and his courage because he had the strength to face the European Union that threatened and blackmailed him,” French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, president of the National Front, said in an interview to Hungarian Echo TV via an interpreter last month.\nA FIGHTER Orban rose to fame when, in 1989, he stood up and demanded Soviet troops get out of Hungary during a ceremony for the reburial of former prime minister Imre Nagy, who led an anti-Soviet uprising.\nSince the first post-communist democratic election in 1990, when his liberal party first got into parliament, he has transformed Fidesz into a mainstream right-wing conservative group.\nSome analysts said during the 2018 election campaign, Orban’s Fidesz actually swapped places with former far right party Jobbik, which has been trying to rebrand itself as a more moderate force.\n“He (Orban) is a true fighter, and he even needs the fight in order to survive,” political scientist Hansen said.\nA trained lawyer who studied political philosophy at Oxford University, Orban is a strategist planning for the long term.\nThe big question is what he will use his renewed political mandate for.\nGabor Borokai, a former government spokesman for Orban, said the campaign diverted public discourse from key issues, such as the emigration of Hungarians to western Europe, or the poor state of the health care system.\nIn an editorial in the weekly Heti Valasz before the vote, editor-in-chief Borokai cited Orban’s recent track record in a decades-long list of political disappointments, saying the key question of the election was whether it would produce any change.\nCurrent Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban leaves a polling booth to cast his ballot during Hungarian parliamentary election in Budapest, Hungary, April 8, 2018.
