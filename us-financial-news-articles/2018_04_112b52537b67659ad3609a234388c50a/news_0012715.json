None of those countries keeps a publicly available aircraft register.\nTracking planes to those countries requires a different resource: flight-tracking websites, which pick up and record the physical movement of civil aircraft.\nIn essence, they crowd-source aircraft data.\nA vast network of people on the ground, often amateur enthusiasts, use commercially available equipment to pick up real-time data emitted by airliners flying overhead. They then share that data with nonofficial websites that collate it and make it publicly available.\nThe data includes the aircraft’s location when in the air, the MSN, the tail number and the call sign, which contains a code identifying the company operating the aircraft.\nReuters drew on data primarily from three flight-tracking websites:\nwww.flightradar24.com, www.planefinder.net and usii.qsl.udm.ru/VirtualRadar\nEach flight was checked across the three sites to ensure the data was accurate. In almost all cases, the data matched across the three sites, although there were a handful of discrepancies. In one case, two of the sites gave different Syrian destinations for a flight, possibly because the spotters picking up and sharing the data inside Syria are thinner on the ground than elsewhere.\nAn extra layer of corroboration was provided by amateur plane-spotters who post photographs of aircraft, with their tail numbers, on the tarmac at airports. Those photographs are shared on sites such as jetphotos.com, and on the personal social media pages of plane-spotters.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://usii.qsl.udm.ru/VirtualRadar", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:58:38.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
