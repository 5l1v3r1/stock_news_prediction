Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, sounded a similar warning. In a Twitter post, he said additional subsidies for American farmers would escalate trade tensions beyond the two largest economies in the world.\nFarmers in Europe, Canada , Australia , Brazil and Argentina who have been \"suffering because of Trump subsidies\" would demand retaliatory actions from their governments, Bown said.\nChad P. Bown on Twitter: How THIS escalates beyond US-China. Trump slaps tariffs on China • China retaliates on US agriculture • Trump subsidizes US agriculture to pay them off • Farmers in EU, CAN, AUS, BRA, ARG, etc - now suffering because of Trump subsidies - demand retaliatory tariffs/subsidies\nThere have already been complaints about American agriculture on the world stage.\nChinese state-run media Global Times said in an editorial last month that subsidies from the U.S. government have given American soybean farmers an unfair competitive advantage in selling to China. Subsequently, Beijing on Wednesday announced tariffs on 106 U.S. products , including soybeans — the most valuable U.S. agricultural export to China.\nIn response, Trump on Thursday proposed an additional $100 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese products and asked the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture \"to use his broad authority to implement a plan to protect our farmers and agricultural interests.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture told Reuters after the president's statement that it first needs to \"see the reaction of what tariffs will be and what the reaction of markets are\" in deciding on ways to shield farmers from the trade conflict.\nTrump can't really help US farmers after all Whatever measures the USDA eventually comes up with, it's unlikely that they would be effective because China can always impose counter-measures, experts said.\nSuch tit-for-tat could actually benefit other agricultural exporters because China may end up buying more from them instead of the U.S., Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit, told CNBC in an email.\nshow chapters Soybean farmer: China is going against middle America 7:01 PM ET Wed, 4 April 2018 | 04:26 \"Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural products will likely result in significant trade diversion to other agricultural exporters, as Chinese buyers switch import orders for items such as beef, wine, fruits, soybeans and cereals to other nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and the EU,\" he said.\nThat would mean the U.S. loses market share in a major consumer, even if additional subsidies help its farmers stay competitive internationally, Baptist said.\n\"It is basically impossible for the U.S. to be confident that any actions it takes will protect its agricultural sector from Chinese tariffs, given the ways that other countries will respond to it,\" he added.\n—Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T10:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T10:45:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
