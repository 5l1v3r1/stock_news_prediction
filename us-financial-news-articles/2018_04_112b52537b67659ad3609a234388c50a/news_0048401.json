With this in mind, our key strategic objectives and our current outlook are:\nWe continue to maintain a strong net interest margin and have done so since the fourth quarter of 2016. Our focus is on loan and deposit pricing to ensure a well maintained and healthy margin. Commercial and consumer loan growth continues to show improvement with several new loan products, all while maintaining strong asset quality. While these new offerings bring added benefits to the Company and our clients, we continue to have credit standards that do not compromise our credit quality. The origination and sales of secondary market loans continues to provide an additional source of noninterest income, along with our Wealth Management services and fee income tied to our retail products. Noninterest expenses have stabilized, however we recognize room for improvement. Our management team continues to evaluate process efficiencies to continue to reduce operating costs.\nFauquier Bankshares, through its operating subsidiary, The Fauquier Bank, is an independent, locally-owned, community bank offering a full range of financial services, including internet banking, mobile banking with mobile deposit, commercial, retail, insurance, wealth management, and financial planning services through eleven banking offices throughout Fauquier and Prince William counties in Virginia.
