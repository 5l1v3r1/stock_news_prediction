They say the air strikes on Saturday had been aimed at deterring his further use of chemical weapons.\nShi’ite-led Iraq has kept good relations with Assad’s government and Iran, while also receiving massive military and financial support from the United States, Britain and France.\nA U.S-led military coalition provided key air and ground support to the Iraqi government forces last year to recapture Mosul and other cities seized by Islamic State in 2014.\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi last month said he wants “to keep away” from the conflict between the United States and Iran.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T16:21:14.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
