Another Renova-linked board member, Vladimir Polienko, is not standing for re-election. \nA spokesman for Schmolz & Bickenbach said the decision for Eichler to cancel his contract with Renova came amid general discussions with banks over how best to navigate the U.S. sanctions. \n“It’s definitely a decision to reduce our dependence on them, it has nothing to do with an upcoming bond,” said spokesman Ulrich Steiner. \nSchmolz & Bickenbach has a bridging loan of 50 million euros ($62 million) after agreeing in January to buy French steelmaker Ascometal and also used part of a 375 million euro revolving credit facility for the deal. \nSteiner declined to comment on any bond placement or name banks with which the company is working. \n“We don’t have an immediate need for external financing,” Steiner said, adding that the Swiss company will be able to arrange financing to replace the bridging loan when the timing is right. \nVekselberg also owns significant stakes in Swiss companies OC Oerlikon and Zueblin Immobilien. \nHaving grown wealthy in the 1990s with Russian aluminum and oil, Vekselberg spent about $90 million on nine jeweled eggs in 2004 from the czar’s imperial court and other art objects from the Forbes family.
