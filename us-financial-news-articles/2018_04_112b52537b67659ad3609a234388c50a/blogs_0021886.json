And there's a category of emerging start-ups doing it right. \nEmerging health-tech companies like CityBlock and BehaveCare are focusing on vulnerable populations who have social determinant needs, and they understand the importance of the real humans who already work with them. Instead of scraping data, they are making the case manager and social worker more effective by deploying teams into communities and engaging patients where they reside to assess these needs and provide solutions.\nOthers like Nuna Health are building sophisticated data graphs that pull in information from patients' insurance claims as well as clinical data and other socio-economic information to develop a rich picture of a patient's needs.\n\nHealthify , Aunt Bertha , and Unite Us are another group of start-ups solely focused on assessing and mapping", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:55:01.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
