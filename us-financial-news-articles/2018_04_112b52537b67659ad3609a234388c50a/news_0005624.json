He did not provide any further details about the suspect.\nHe stressed that the officers are still conducting an “active investigation” and would reveal more details later. He disclosed no motive for the shooting, however the Daily Beast , citing a unnamed federal law enforcement source, reported that the suspect shot her boyfriend.\nAt 12:46 pm PST, Barberini said that San Bruno police officers “received numerous 911 calls” regarding gunshots at YouTube’s headquarters. Police officers arrived on the scene minutes later as YouTube employees fled the building.\nUpon entry, police found a wounded individual. Several minutes later, they located the likely suspect, who had what resembled a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Two more shooting victims were discovered several minutes later. The San Bruno Police Department said later in a press release that “a total of four people were transported to local hospitals, three of which had gunshot wounds.”\nThe wounded have been sent to San Francisco General Hospital, according to news reports. The hospital’s spokesperson Brent Andrew, told the Associated Press that it received three patients. “A 36-year-old man is in critical condition, a 32-year-old woman is in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman is in fair condition,” the news service reported.\nThe San Bruno Police Department had posted a tweet this afternoon at 1:01 pm PST warning residents to avoid the area around YouTube’s headquarters.\nPolice activity at 901 Cherry Ave, please stay out of the area. pic.twitter.com/H6iAj0g7ra\n— San Bruno Police (@SanBrunoPolice) April 3, 2018\nPolice then confirmed that they were “responding to an active shooter.”\nWe are responding to an active shooter.
