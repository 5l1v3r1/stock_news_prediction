So today is a truly historic milestone for us—and it’s another step on our exciting journey ahead.”\n“As organizations undergo digital transformations to meet the accelerated needs of clients and employees, DocuSign provides an innovative solution that addresses these demands by reimagining a fundamental part of doing business,” said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq. “We are proud to be DocuSign’s exchange partner, and we welcome them to our family of forward-thinking companies that are helping businesses navigate a digital world.”\nThe information contained above is provided for informational and educational purposes only, and nothing contained herein should be construed as investment advice, either on behalf of a particular security or an overall investment strategy.
