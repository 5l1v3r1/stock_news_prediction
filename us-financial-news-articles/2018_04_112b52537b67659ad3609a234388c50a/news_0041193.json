It was trading at 7.74 percent by 0635 GMT. \nThe Indian rupee was at 66.01/02 per dollar versus its previous close of 65.7950. It touched 66.08 in early deals, its weakest level since March 14, 2017. \n“Higher oil prices, foreign institutional investors selling in the debt markets and the government buying dollars to make some defence payments are the reasons the dollar/rupee moved up,” said Murthy Nagarajan, head of fixed income at Tata Asset Management. \nTraders said expectations for a rate hike in 2018 have risen in the wake of the minutes. The said they would continue to be cautious while buying more debt and monitor the inflation data for further guidance as well as global crude oil prices which have been a major driver for bonds in recent months. \nThe stock market took the minutes calmly with India’s broader NSE share index trading down 0.25 percent on Friday in line with its Asian peers while the banking index was down 0.8 percent. \nIndia’s headline inflation was 4.28 percent in March versus a year earlier, easing from 4.44 percent February, but well above the central bank’s medium-term target of 4 percent.
