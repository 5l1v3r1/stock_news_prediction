It’s possible there were too few people with these medical issues to determine whether the conditions might be associated with occupational noise, Masterson said.\nHearing difficulty was linked to all three heart conditions, and it’s possible that both occupational noise exposure and hearing loss might independently influence the risk of heart problems, she added.\nThe study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how occupational noise exposure might directly cause risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol or lead to heart attacks and strokes.\nAnother drawback is that researchers lacked data on the intensity or duration of noise exposure, the study team notes.\n“The study itself does not establish a cause and effect relationship between noise exposure and the coronary heart disease outcomes,” said John Dement, an occupational health researcher and professor emeritus at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.\nIt’s unclear, for example, whether noise exposure might cause high blood pressure or if high blood pressure might be a risk factor for hearing loss with or without occupational noise exposure, Dement, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.\n“I think it’s premature to draw too many conclusions about implications for patients beyond what we already know about preventing noise exposures and managing cardiovascular disease risk factors,” Dement added.\nStill, workers can take steps to reduce noise exposure by using quieter equipment when possible, keeping machinery well maintained and lubricated, and erecting barriers between noise sources and work areas, Masterson advised. Workers can also wear hearing protection in noisy areas, and keep any music at a safe volume.\nRoutine hearing tests are also key.\n“Hearing loss is a permanent condition,” Masterson said. “However, workers with even mild hearing impairment can benefit from clinical rehabilitation, which includes learning lip-reading, fitting hearing aids and adopting other compensation strategies to optimize hearing.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2pzpPtJ American Journal of Industrial Medicine, online March 14, 2018.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://bit.ly/2pzpPtJ", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:48:42.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
