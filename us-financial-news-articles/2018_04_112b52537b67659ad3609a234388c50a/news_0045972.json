This is something we are closely following. But there is no link between the growth and sales efficiency,” he told a meeting with reporters and analysts.\nTelenor said capital expenditure, excluding licenses and spectrum, is expected to be 17 billion-18 billion crowns this year against previous guidance of 18 billion-19 billion crowns.\nOver the past year, the firm’s shares have risen 24 percent after it boosted profits, raised its dividend and bought back shares, outperforming the European telecoms index which has fallen 8 percent.\n($1 = 0.8185 euros)\n($1 = 7.8797 Norwegian crowns)\nEditing by Terje Solsvik and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "https://reut.rs/2K4UjwS"], "published": "2018-04-24T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T15:00:51.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
