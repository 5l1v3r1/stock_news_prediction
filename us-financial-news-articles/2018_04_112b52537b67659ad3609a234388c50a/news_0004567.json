With this, the broker will join other online securities brokerages such as GMO Internet Inc and Money Partners Group. \nMonex shares surged 23 percent by the daily limit to 424 yen in Tokyo. \nCoincheck's Chief Executive Koichiro Wada and another executive will be replaced, the Nikkei reported, adding that Coincheck and Monex have already charted the plan out to regulators and major investors. \nCoincheck, which in January suffered one of the biggest digital money heists ever, was asked by the Financial Services Agency to improve risk management and prevent further criminal use of digital money. \nThe Coincheck heist underscored the risks faced by policymakers in regulating cryptocurrency trading and had rattled Japan, which became the first country to regulate the cryptocurrency industry by requiring all exchanges to register with the authorities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T11:16:33.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
