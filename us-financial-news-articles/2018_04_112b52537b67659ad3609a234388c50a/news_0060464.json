But the Labor Department this week warned that these investments may not be appropriate for company-sponsored savings plans.\nSo-called ESG funds, which take environmental, social and governance factors into account when investing, have been touted by financial executives as a growth opportunity across Wall Street. Assets invested in these types of funds grew to $95 billion in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc., up nearly 60% from the prior year.\nWhile that represents a tiny slice of industrywide assets today, firms are marketing ESG as a bankable trend. Getting such products into retirement plans is considered an important step that would enable money managers to gain a steady flow of investor cash that is likely to stay in funds for a long time. Few 401(k) plans—just 2.4%—offer such ESG funds as an investment option today, according to research on more than 500 such plans by the Plan Sponsor Council of America, a trade group for employer retirement plans.\nThe Labor Department issued a notice this week, however, that could damp the prospects of so-called ESG funds in retirement accounts .\nThe department, which oversees 401(k) plans, said in a new bulletin that America’s companies “must not too readily treat ESG factors as economically relevant” to investing choices.\n“It does not ineluctably follow from the fact that an investment promotes ESG factors, or that it arguably promotes positive general market trends or industry growth, that the investment is a prudent choice for retirement or other investors,” the department wrote in its guidance.\nEmployers that offer 401(k) plans must act, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as so-called fiduciaries, or in the best interests of participants. The Labor Department periodically issues guidance on how that law is applied.\nIn recent years, the department has issued guidance that said employers offering 401(k) plans must not put their own social goals ahead of the financial interests of savers or take on more risk or settle for lower returns in the name of advancing environmental or social causes. But the most recent guidance goes further, by telling plan sponsors and money managers not to give too much weight to those factors as risks or return drivers.\nIn its bulletin this week the Labor Department said plans’ investment policy guidelines don’t necessarily have to cover ESG factors, and even if they do, money managers don’t always have to comply with them. Plan fiduciaries including investment managers should not spend too much money on shareholder issues or initiating proxy fights, it added.\nThe notice also made it less likely that ESG-focused target-date funds will become default investment choices in 401(k) retirement savings plans. Target-date funds tailor the risks of their investments to a saver’s expected retirement date and many plans automatically channel their employees into a certain product unless they opt out.\nA company choosing an ESG-themed fund that appeals to its policy preferences “without regard to possibly different or competing views of plan participants and beneficiaries” would raise compliance questions, the Labor Department said.\nSome advocates of ESG investing said the guidance marked a shift in tone for the department.\nFiona Reynolds, chief executive of the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investment, said the guidance “could generate unnecessary confusion” and said “no one should doubt the benefits of ESG integration.”\nHer organization is a network of investors that agree to implement a set of principles that include incorporating ESG factors into their investing practices.\nWrite to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T05:24:22.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
