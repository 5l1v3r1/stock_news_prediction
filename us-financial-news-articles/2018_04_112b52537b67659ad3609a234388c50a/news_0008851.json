Management believes EBITDA is a useful measure that facilitates period-to-period operating comparisons.\nEBITDA does not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Readers are cautioned that EBITDA is not an alternative to measures determined in accordance with IFRS and should not, on its own, be construed as indicators of performance, cash flow or profitability.\n*Future-Oriented Financial Information, Anticipated Annualized Revenues and Anticipated Annualized EBITDA\nThis news release contains future-oriented financial information and financial outlook information (FOFI) about ImmunoPrecise's additional anticipated revenues from the acquisition of ModiQuest.
