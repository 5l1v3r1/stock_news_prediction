In such patients, TRK genes abnormally attach to other genes, triggering accelerated cancer cell growth.\nWall Street analysts expect U.S. approval for larotrectinib this year and forecast annual sales of $500 million to $1 billion.\nThe deal will result in a sequencing-based companion diagnostic with a pan-cancer indication, the companies said.\nA companion diagnostic is a medical device that provides information essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product.\nUp to 5,000 U.S. patients a year are diagnosed with the TRK defect. Comprehensive genetic testing can detect TRK fusion and more specific tests are being developed.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T16:24:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
