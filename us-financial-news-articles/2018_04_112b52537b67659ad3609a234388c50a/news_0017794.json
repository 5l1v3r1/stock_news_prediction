In addition to strengthening its team, iNovia is expanding internationally, opening an office in London and broadening its scope into growth investing.\n\"We have been supporting our portfolio of innovative high-growth companies, including Lightspeed POS , WorkFusion , AppDirect , Clearpath Robotics and Top Hat , with both capital and insights for years,\" said Chris Arsenault, General Partner at iNovia Capital. \"While the costs of starting a company have never been lower, the challenges in scaling businesses have never been more complex. We believe that startups need a full-stack venture capital firm that can grow with them. Patrick and Dennis both bring a hard-to-match expertise of scaling businesses.\"\nAbout the new General Partners:\nPatrick Pichette has 25+ years of operational experience, including seven years at Google as Senior Vice President & CFO, where he oversaw finance and most corporate functions and actively participated in the creation of the Alphabet structure.

Kavelman is also angel investor and board member of Vidyard and Thalmic Labs and a founder of The Kavelman Fonn Foundation.\nCanadian venture capital firms including iNovia have been at the forefront of a boom in growth VC, which tripled between 2014 and 2017.

I look forward to mentoring and coaching them to help successfully navigate the many challenges of exponential growth.\"\nDennis Kavelman, General Partner, iNovia Capital added, \"Over the next decade, massive technological innovations, including machine learning, will completely redefine industries. Many of the world's top founders will come from Canada — a hotbed in AI innovation — as well as the U.S. and the U.K. By leveraging iNovia's extensive reach and its proven acceleration practices we have a rare opportunity to turn these companies into global leaders.\"\nAbout iNovia Capital\niNovia is a full-stack venture capital firm that partners with audacious founders to build enduring technology companies.
