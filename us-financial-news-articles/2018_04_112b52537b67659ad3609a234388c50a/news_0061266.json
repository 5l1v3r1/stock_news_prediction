State prosecutors said they would appeal.\nIn Spanish law, the crime of sexual aggression or rape includes specific violence, such as threatening the victim with a knife or dealing physical blows. The five were given nine-year prison sentences instead of the 22 years the prosecution had sought.\nThe government said last week that Catala will consult with its legal advisers to decide whether the classification of sexual crimes, which dates from 1995, should be updated.
