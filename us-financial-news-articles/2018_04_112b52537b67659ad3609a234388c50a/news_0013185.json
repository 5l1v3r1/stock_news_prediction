You gave it to me. No backsies,” exclaims Moffat’s Zuckerberg. “And if you don’t like it you can ‘Zuck’ it. HA!” \nWhile clearly a riff on the embattled social media company’s ongoing privacy scandal, the skit hit close to home for many viewers who are unhappy with the company’s handling of their personal information. The sketch did have lighter moments, with Moffat physically poking Jost and reminding him that Facebook’s poking feature was “flirting for cowards.” \nBut overall, the sketch hit the nail on the head when it came to mocking Zuckerberg’s attitude and handling of Facebook’s current data controversy. \n“Sure, maybe Facebook sold out our democracy to Russian troll farms. My bad?” Moffat says as Zuckerberg, without a hint of remorse. \nAs CEO of Facebook, which is the world’s largest social media company, Zuckerberg will testify before Congress on April 11 to answer questions about the unfolding scandal, which has affected at least 87 million users so far.
