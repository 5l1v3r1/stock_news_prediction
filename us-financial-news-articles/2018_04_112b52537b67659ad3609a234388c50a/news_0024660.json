Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa, admonished President Donald Trump for his recent remarks entertaining the idea of firing special counsel Robert Mueller , who is investigating potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n\"I have confidence in Mueller, the president ought to have confidence in Mueller, and I think to answer your question, it would be suicide for the president to want—to talk about firing Mueller,\" Grassley said Tuesday in an interview on Fox Business.\nGrassley is the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own separate inquiry into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election. \nshow chapters Trump blasts FBI on 'witch hunt' raid      5 Hours Ago | 02:36 The president tore into the special counsel 's investigation Monday evening, calling it a \"witch hunt\" and \"an attack on our country in a true sense.\"\nAsked whether he would fire Mueller, Trump said: \"Many people have said, 'You should fire him.' Again, they found nothing.\"\nHe also called \"disgraceful\" reports that the FBI, reportedly acting on a referral from Mueller, searched the office and residence of Trump's longtime personal lawyer, Michael Cohen.

In a Fox News interview on Tuesday, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he believes Mueller \"has abused his authority\" in giving the referral to search Cohen's property.\n\"Going after someone's personal attorney is a great overstep I think, in the authority of the prosecutor,\" said Paul, who often espouses libertarian views about privacy protections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T18:18:27.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
