Threatening to remove the country from the court’s jurisdiction, he shot from the margins to the top of a 13-candidate field, and won the first round of voting in February.\n“We’re united... in defending life and family, but also to defend ethics and transparency and the battle against corruption,” the singer, who is a member of the Protestant Pentecostal movement, said on the eve of Sunday’s vote in a video appeal to Catholics, who account for more than six out 10 people in the country, seeking to forge common cause.\nSince 2017, the government of President Luis Guillermo Solis has grown increasingly unpopular, in part over a corruption scandal involving Chinese cement.\nA voter prepares to cast her ballot during the presidential election at a polling station in San Jose, Costa Rica, April 1, 2018.
