It was the fifth week in a row that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week after being below previous weeks in the year.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 77.5 percent of volumes last week, down from 81.4 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 221 tonnes from 679 tonnes in same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 274 tonnes last week from 182 tonnes in same week last year.
