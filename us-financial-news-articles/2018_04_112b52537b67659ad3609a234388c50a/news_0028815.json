That is the prerogative of parliamentarians and therefore, the rest who are speaking (on the repeal), are just making noises that will change nothing,” Njomo was Quote: d as saying.\nThe government had said when it introduced the policy that banks were reaping high returns without benefiting customers.\nBut the central bank, bankers and economists have said the policy would stifle the lending needed to spur on the economy.\nWith the International Monetary Fund putting pressure on Kenya to drop or modify the lending cap, Finance Minister Henry Rotich said in March that it was unsustainable and the government was planning modifications.
