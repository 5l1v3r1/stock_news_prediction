Daimler already has a Chinese joint venture partner BAIC.\nLi and his firm Zhejiang Geely Holding control Sweden’s Volvo Cars, London black-cab maker LEVC as well as its own Hong Kong-listed unit Geely Automobile Holdings. It has also agreed to buy a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks.\nSeveral major deals last year raised German sensitivities about multi-billion euro foreign takeovers, notably Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group buying German robotics firm Kuka, and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing buying German metering firm Ista.
