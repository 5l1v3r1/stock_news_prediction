INVESTOR BACKING \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Andrew Gibb said there was some relief that the rights issue was underwritten and trading was no worse than feared. \n“However, a very complicated and costly transformation plan needs to be executed in market conditions that will remain tough,” he said. \nLewis said he needed help to deliver his plan, which was why Capita was asking its shareholders to support the rights issue that would underpin the transformation. \nThe three-for-two issue, announced three days ahead of expectations on Monday, will raise 662 million pounds in net proceeds, partly to pay off about 1.0 billion in net debt. It already has the backing of two of its key investors — Woodford, with a 10 percent stake, and Invesco, with a 9 percent stake. \nNew shares will be offered at 70 pence, a 34 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price of 105.9 pence calculated in reference to the closing price on Friday. \nLewis aims to simplify and unify an unwieldy structure in which more than 250 different business units have operated separately. \nHe said his reshaped Capita will focus on five divisions: software, HR, customer management, government and IT services - the areas where long-term profitable growth is available in the outsourcing sector. \nHe is targeting a “double digit” earnings before interest, tax and amortisation margin within three years, and at least 200 million pounds in free cashflow in 2020. \nCapita kept its forecast for underlying pretax profits, before significant new contracts and restructuring costs unchanged at 270-300 million pounds for 2018. \n“It’s the end of a difficult chapter but there is a well-defined plan and it’s about executing on that plan,” Lewis told Reuters.
