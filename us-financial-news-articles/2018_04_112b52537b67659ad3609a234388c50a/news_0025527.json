It hit eight-months highs of 162 bps on Wednesday.\nThe average bond yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index narrowed 3 bps to 232 bps. However, the spread remains more than 50 bps more than where it was towards the end of last week.\nThe rouble also firmed 0.3 percent against the dollar, edging off the November 2016 lows it matched on Wednesday. The currency has lost around 10 percent since the sanctions were announced.\nRelations between Russia and the U.S. had deteriorated following the imposition of fresh sanctions by the U.S. on Russian businessmen and companies last Friday. Tensions subsequently escalated with a dispute over Syria.
