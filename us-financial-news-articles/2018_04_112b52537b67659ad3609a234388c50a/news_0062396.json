The North had claimed the tests were a necessary deterrent to an attack from the U.S. or South Korea, the latter of which is home to more than 23,000 U.S. troops. All of this has left regional experts skeptical over the promise of disarmament and normalized relations.\nThe countries have technically been at war since fighting began in 1950 â€” an armistice was signed to end the violence in 1953, rather than a peace treaty. The peninsula has been divided since 1954, and the presidents' meeting was the first to take place in more than a decade.\nThe Fitch comments came amid an outpouring of speculation around the world as to the intentions of the rogue state's authoritarian leader. Many regional experts question whether North Korea's government is simply buying time, engendering goodwill in order to loosen economic sanctions that have crippled the country's already poor and state-controlled economy. Two previous summits, held in 2000 and 2007, failed to produce positive results despite similar promises from the North.\nKim Hong-ji | Reuters A man burns a North Korean flag with pictures of late North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as he takes part in a rally opposing the inter-Korean summit, near the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, in Paju, South Korea, April 27, 2018. Observers also worry that the agreements made during the summit lacked crucial details , such as a mutually accepted definition of \"denuclearization.\"\n\"The joint declaration is simply a signed statement between two leaders and is not legally binding,\" experts at risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group said in a note at the weekend.\nCosts of reunification The long-term standoff poses geopolitical risks to South Korea's sovereign balance sheet, according to Fitch, that involve both the potential for conflict and possible costs of reunification. South Korea's National Budget Office estimates reunification costs at an average of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) yearly over 45 years.\nStill, the unexpected vows from the two leaders \"should ease the heightened tensions\" created by an escalation in nuclear activity by the North over the last year, Fitch said, adding that this \"period of detente\" lowers the risk of outright conflict.\nRatings agency Moody's meanwhile had a brighter outlook for inter-Korean relations, describing the summit as a prelude to more substantial relations that will \"help to lower geopolitical risk,\" although it still regarded full disarmament as \"unlikely.\"\nBut the likelihood of a permanent reduction in tensions remains unclear and further developments impossible to predict, Fitch cautioned. \"Tensions could re-escalate quickly if the U.S. feels that summit diplomacy is not achieving its aim of denuclearization.\"\nThe North and South will hold high-level military meetings next month, and Moon has been scheduled to visit Pyongyang in the fall.\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to meet Kim sometime in the coming months after a secret meeting between the North Korean leader and former CIA chief Mike Pompeo took place in early April.\nshow chapters Skeptical on North Korea denuclearization progress, but summit was moving: Former Australian PM Rudd 11 Hours Ago | 02:35", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T14:07:50.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
