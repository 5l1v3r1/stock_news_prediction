But if the dollar falls below 105 yen, it will consider currency hedging.\nIn the last fiscal year, Asahi invested more than 110 billion yen in foreign bonds — 90 billion yen in hedged foreign bonds and 20 billion yen without currency hedging.\nThe insurer plans to spend 70 billion yen in mutual funds and alternative investment this fiscal year, up from 45 billon yen in the previous year.\nIt also plans to invest 40 billion yen in mutual funds of stocks and bonds and expects to spend 30 billion yen in such alternative assets as infrastructure funds in the U.S. and Europe.\nAmid low-yielding environment in the domestic market, Asahi expects to cut investment in domestic bonds by 50 billion yen, while it reduced 90 billion yen in the last fiscal year.\nTsuruoka said that the insurer expects volatility in the market this fiscal year due to various global risks.\n“There are trade friction worries, geopolitical risks, concerns about falling support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which could cause volatility in the market,” he said.\n“But if those risks have a limited impact on the real economy, it may create a buying opportunity.”\nThe insurer forecasts the dollar to trade between 100-115 yen for this financial year. It expects the U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to move between 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent, and the 10-year JGB yield to trade between 0.0 percent and 0.2 percent.\nWriting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Vyas Mohan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:14:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
