REUTERS/Bobby Yip The United Nations and rights groups say nearly 700,000 mostly Muslim Rohingya have fled Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh since August, after attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants sparked a military crackdown that the United Nations has called ethnic cleansing.\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar rejects the charge, saying its security forces launched a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in response to Rohingya militant attacks.\nDuterte last week said the Philippines was willing to provide sanctuary for Rohingya fleeing what he called “genocide”, a comment a Myanmar government spokesman said showed he had no restraint and knew nothing about Myanmar.\nBut in remarks aimed at Suu Kyi, Duterte clarified that and said he was not interfering in what he called Myanmar’s “civil war”.\n“I will apologize to you, but if you have noticed my statement was almost a satire,” he told reporters.\n“I am not ready to intervene in your (internal affairs).”\nThe Philippines and Myanmar are members of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which has a rigid policy on non-interference on each other’s affairs.\nDuterte, who brooks no criticism from what he sees as hypocritical western powers, said he was speaking against European countries which had accused Myanmar of rampant human rights violations, but did little to help the Rohingya.\n“Do you have any plans of providing a safe sanctuary even for a moment for those who are really the victims of war?” he said, referring to European states.\nHe also urged them to provide “temporary relief” to the refugees and said he would do the same.\n“I am ready to accept my share of responsibility in the name of humanity,” he said.\nThere was no immediate response to request for comment from the Philippine foreign ministry.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to remove extraneous word in first paragraph)\nReporting By Manuel Mogato, Additional reporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T08:52:55.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
