This distribution relates to realized gains and income from fiscal year 2017.\nUnder U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year.

The table has been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The table includes estimated amounts and percentages for this distribution and for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date (01/01/2018 â€“ 03/31/2018), from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital.\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent Quarterly\nDistribution per\nshare ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent Quarterly\nDistribution per\nshare (%)\nEstimated\nAmounts of Fiscal\nYear to Date\nCumulative\nDistributions per\nshare ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of Fiscal\nYear to Date\nCumulative\nDistributions per\nshare (%)\nNet Investment\nIncome\n$0.03473\n14%\n$0.03473\n14%\nNet Realized Short-\nTerm Capital Gains*\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet Realized Long-\nTerm Capital Gains\n$0.21067\n86%\n$0.21067\n86%\nReturn of Capital\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal (per common\nshare)\n$0.24540\n100%\n$0.24540\n100%\n* includes currency gains\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes.

The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the NAV of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.
