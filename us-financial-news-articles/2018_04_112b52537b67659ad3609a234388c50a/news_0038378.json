Absolutely. You’ll see players with varying techniques and skills that they’ve honed over a period of time,” competitor Bryan Vaananen told Reuters. \n“You can’t just rock up and chuck it in the hole.” \nThe Black Horse came out victorious at Wednesday’s championship at a hall in the team’s home town of Lewes in southern England. More than 50 teams vied for the title, an increase on last year’s entrants. \nThe game is hugely popular in the East Sussex town, having waned elsewhere in English pubs amid competition from darts and pool.
