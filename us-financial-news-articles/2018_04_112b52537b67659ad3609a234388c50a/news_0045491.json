REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nThe company said the requested information did not relate to safety or clinical data submitted in the application. \nHerceptin and other complex medicines called biologics are made from living cells, making them difficult to copy with precision. Their similar versions are called biosimilars, instead of generics. \nHerceptin, which generated sales of 7.01 billion Swiss francs ($7.18 billion) in 2017, is one of the world’s most successful antibody drugs and has been a mainstay of Roche profits for many years. \nFDA in December approved Mylan’s biosimilar of Herceptin. \n($1 = 0.9758 Swiss francs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T15:16:09.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
