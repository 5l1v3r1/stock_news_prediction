Sales into hearing health were also higher than the year ago period. In the Precision Devices segment, revenues hit record levels due to stronger demand for capacitors across all end markets and an acquisition completed earlier in the quarter.”\n“We remain on track to deliver 8 percent growth in the first half of the year and anticipate this growth to continue through the second half of 2018. Our microphone business continues to benefit from robust demand in Ear and IoT. I also expect continued strength in capacitor sales, and that our hearing health business will remain stable throughout 2018.”\n“Lastly, we anticipate accelerating adoption of our intelligent audio products will drive revenue growth this year and set up 2019 to be a breakout year for this business. I’m very excited about the opportunities in front of us and continue to believe that our core capabilities in acoustics, digital signal processing, and algorithms are unmatched and the Company is ideally positioned to enable voice input technology across our end markets,” continued Niew.\nFinancial Highlights\nThe following table highlights the Company’s financial performance on both a GAAP and supplemental non-GAAP basis for continuing operations* (in millions, except per share data):\nQ1FY18 Q4FY17 Q1FY17 Sequential\nYear Ago Period\nChange\nChange\nRevenues $178.5 $215.5 $168.3 (17)%\n6%\nGross profit $65.3 $89.4 $59.3 (27)%\n10%\n(as a % of revenues) 36.6%\n41.5%\n35.2%\nNon-GAAP gross profit $66.7 $92.0 $65.2 (28)%\n2%\n(as a % of revenues) 37.4% 42.7% 38.7% Diluted (loss) earnings per share** $0.00 $0.35 $(0.06) NM***\nNM***\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.11 $0.40 $0.11 (73)%\nFlat * Continuing operations excludes the results of our speaker and receiver product line which was sold on July 7, 2016 and our timing device business which was sold on November 28, 2017.\n** Current period results include $7.0 million in stock-based compensation, $1.6 million from amortization of intangibles, $1.4 million in production transfer costs and restructuring charges, and $0.3 million in acquisition related expense.\n*** Not meaningful\nIn addition to the GAAP results included in this press release, Knowles has presented supplemental non-GAAP gross profit, earnings before interest and income taxes, adjusted earnings before interest and income taxes, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, as well as other metrics on a non-GAAP basis that exclude certain amounts that are included in the most directly comparable GAAP measure to facilitate evaluation of Knowles’ operating performance. Non-GAAP results are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP information should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP financial measures included in this press release do not have standard meanings and may vary from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Knowles believes that non-GAAP measures are useful as supplements to its GAAP results of operations to evaluate certain aspects of its operations and financial performance, and its management team primarily focuses on non-GAAP items in evaluating Knowles’ performance for business planning purposes. Knowles also believes that these measures assist it with comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles’ opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance including, for example, stock-based compensation, certain intangibles amortization expense, fixed asset impairment charges, restructuring, production transfer costs, and other charges which management considers to be outside our core operating results. Knowles believes that its presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the reconciliation table accompanying this release.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nThe following forward looking guidance for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 on a continuing operations basis is as follows:\nGAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP Revenues $170 to $190 million - $170 to $190 million Gross Profit Margin 36 to 38% 1% 37 to 39% EPS $0.00 to $0.04 $0.12 $0.12 to $0.16 Q2 2018 GAAP results for continuing operations are expected to include approximately $0.05 per share in stock-based compensation, $0.05 per share from a higher effective tax rate, $0.01 per share in amortization of debt discount, and $0.01 per share in amortization of intangibles. Expected Q2 2018 GAAP results exclude potential restructuring items.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nInvestors can listen to a live or replay webcast of the Company’s quarterly financial conference call at http://investor.knowles.com .

Knowles believes that non-GAAP measures are useful as supplements to its GAAP results of operations to evaluate certain aspects of its operations and financial performance, and its management team primarily focuses on non-GAAP items in evaluating Knowles' performance for business planning purposes. Knowles also believes that these measures assist it with comparing its performance between various reporting periods on a consistent basis, as these measures remove from operating results the impact of items that, in Knowles' opinion, do not reflect its core operating performance. Knowles believes that its presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful because it provides investors and securities analysts with the same information that Knowles uses internally for purposes of assessing its core operating performance. (2) Production transfer costs represent duplicate costs incurred to migrate manufacturing to facilities primarily in Asia. These amounts are included in the corresponding Gross profit and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest and income taxes for each period presented. (3) In 2018, Other represents expenses related to the Compex acquisition. In 2017, Other primarily represents expenses related to the acquisition of certain assets of a capacitors manufacturer. (4) Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash (or other assets) upon conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, for GAAP purposes we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the Company’s $172.5 million of convertible senior notes due 2021 that were issued in a private placement in May 2016. The imputed interest rate is 8.12% for the convertible notes due 2021, while the actual coupon interest rate of the notes was 3.25%. The difference between the imputed interest expense and the coupon interest expense is excluded from management’s assessment of the Company’s operating performance because management believes that this non-cash expense is not indicative of its core, ongoing operating performance. (5) The non-GAAP reconciling adjustments are those adjustments made to reconcile Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest and income taxes to Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before interest and income taxes. (6) The number of shares used in the diluted per share calculations on a non-GAAP basis excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense expected to be incurred in future periods and not yet recognized in the financial statements, which would otherwise be assumed to be used to repurchase shares under the GAAP treasury stock method.
