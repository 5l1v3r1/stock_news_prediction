EDF has started verifying all 150 weldings in the secondary circuit that conducts steam to the generator’s turbines.\nASN said in a statement on Wednesday that EDF and reactor builder Framatome had not adequately overseen the verification of the weldings by suppliers at the time of their installation.\n“The ASN considers that EDF will have to extend its controls to other circuits,” the regulator said in a statement.
