Picture taken November 1, 2017. REUTERS/Feisal Omar The clash was an indication of the difficulty in rebuilding unified security forces for a state where centralized authority collapsed in 1991 and an internationally backed government, elected last year, faces huge challenges.\nIt was also another sign of the fallout from a crisis in the Gulf region that has spilled into the Horn of Africa.\nThe UAE has trained hundreds of troops since 2014 as part of an effort boosted by an African Union military mission to defeat an Islamist insurgency and secure the country for the government backed by Western countries, Turkey and the United Nations.\nSomali military officers attend a training programme by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at their military base in Mogadishu, Somalia November 1, 2017.

REUTERS/Feisal Omar The Gulf nation ended its program in Somalia this month after Somali security forces seized millions of dollars and temporarily held a UAE plane.\n“Some Somali military forces attacked us at the base, they wanted to loot it but we repulsed them,” Ahmed Nur a soldier who was trained under the discontinued program, told Reuters.\nSomali military officers attend a training programme by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at their military base in Mogadishu, Somalia November 1, 2017.

Others left the guns and ran away and so I had to (flee) also.”\nResidents in the area said they saw UAE trained forces discarding their military uniforms and fleeing the facility in three-wheeled rickshaws with their guns in their laps.\nSomalia’s relations with the UAE have been strained by a dispute between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The UAE is part of a group of Arab states including Saudi Arabia that has ostracized Qatar. Countries on both sides of the dispute have influence in Somalia, and Mogadishu has refrained from taking sides.\nWriting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Maggie Fick and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:22:38.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
