The issuance of title deeds since 2016, in a bid to resolve several claims that had been in court, has inflamed tensions.\nFour people were shot by the police on Wednesday after a group tried to attack a crowd at a land allocation exercise, interior ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said by phone.\nThis followed an earlier attack on Friday, when a gang carrying machetes and sticks set upon five people driving to a land allocation event and burned their vehicle.\n“We will be investigating the role of administrators and politicians involved,” Njoka said.\n“People will be arrested and taken to court and if they are our administrators involved we will take disciplinary action,” he said, referring to local officials under his ministry.\nLand is an explosive political issue in Kenya and has been one of the main drivers of conflict since independence in 1963, with politicians often stoking ethnic tensions to provoke clashes and displace communities that support their opponents.\nThe governor of neighboring Kirinyaga County, Anne Waiguru, said on Friday that the issuance of titles would cause “chaos” as her community had been unfairly excluded.\nLocal officials issued about 7,000 private title deeds in 2016, according to the National Lands Commission (NLC), an independent state agency set up in 2012 to manage land issues.\n“Some of them have been living on the land for the last two years,” said Josphat Kithumbu, a lands official for Embu County, adding that his office had already issued more than half of the titles.\n“What we are dealing with now is a security, not a land (issue).”\nReporting by Kevin Mwanza; Editing by Katy Migiro.
