Commense has a tremendous opportunity to cement a leadership position in the field and deliver products that have the potential to alter, or even prevent, the course of many diseases at a very early age.”\nMr. Stewart joins Commense with more than 20 years of experience in the biotechnology field, including over 15 years at Merrimack Pharmaceuticals, where he was instrumental in growing the company from a pre-clinical organization to a commercial enterprise. Under his leadership as Senior Vice President of Business Development and Head of Merrimack’s Commercial Business Unit, the company executed multiple partnership and licensing deals with a total value in excess of $1.5 billion and successfully launched ONIVYDE®, which was sold to Ipsen in a 2017 transaction valued at $1.025 billion.\n“We are excited to have Tad on board as we build and develop our arsenal of pediatric microbiome-derived therapeutics,” said David Steinberg, Chief Innovation Officer at PureTech Health and Co-founder of Commense. “Tad brings extensive strategic and business development experience and has a proven track record of building value and deal-making.”\nAbout Commense\nCommense, Inc., an affiliate of PureTech Health (LSE: PRTC), is developing interventions for pediatric and maternal health based on a deep understanding of the microbiome and its fundamental role as the foundation for the development of immune tolerance.
