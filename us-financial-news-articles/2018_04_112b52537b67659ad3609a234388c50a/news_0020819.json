The 42,000 square-foot data center currently provides 2 MW of critical IT load capacity that is being expanded to 3 MW over the next four months to satisfy the growing demand for disaster recovery, cloud, colocation and related managed IT services. 1547 was the managing partner of the ownership company that developed and sold 340 Progress Circle, and joins CIM as a partner in the new ownership.\nCheyenne is an attractive data center location with its high-bandwidth fiber network, tax incentives, low-cost power, and low incidences of natural disasters. The property has access to four diverse fiber paths on a 100 Gbps network offering high-speed connectivity to Denver, and is located approximately 100 miles north of the city. The greater Cheyenne area is home to multiple high profile datacenters, including Microsoft, the National Weather Service’s computing center, and Echostar/Dish’s network and data hub.\n“The data center in Cheyenne combines high-quality infrastructure with low-cost power and high-capacity fiber, and continues the partnership’s goal of acquiring and developing premier datacenter assets in or adjacent to population centers to serve the growing data needs of businesses,” stated J. Todd Raymond, CEO of 1547.\nThis is the third data center that the CIM and 1547 partnership has acquired. Recently the partnership announced the acquisition of an operating datacenter in Markham, Ontario, just 20 miles outside of downtown Toronto, Canada. Last summer, the partnership acquired 400 Paul Avenue in San Francisco, a 7.3 acre property planned for a 240,000-square-foot data center campus located at one of the nation’s most important data center hubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two existing buildings on the 400 Paul site totaling approximately 54,000 square feet will be used to serve as office and support/secure storage space for the fully-entitled development of a 187,000-square-foot, two-story, tilt-up construction data center with 24 MW of power capacity from dual power feeds via underground ducts from separate PG&E transformers. Construction of the campus is underway.\nThe acquisition adds to CIM Group’s growing portfolio of diverse, infrastructure investments that includes renewable energy, urban parking facilities, water supply infrastructure, and waste solutions.\nAbout CIM Group\nEstablished in 1994, CIM is a vertically-integrated owner and operator of real assets for its own account, and on behalf of its partners and co-investors seeking to invest in urban real assets, net-lease assets, and other associated credit strategies, with a principal focus on North America.
