Worries about a possible trade war have weighed on the U.S. stock market, which fell more than 2 percent on Monday but regained about half that on Tuesday.\nOn Monday local time, new Chinese tariffs on food and other products from the U.S. began, as retaliation against Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. China's new taxes will hit products such as pork and certain fruit and nuts coming from the U.S. \nThe Trump administration alleges that China has improperly taken U.S. intellectual property. The U.S. could levy tariffs on $50 billion to $60 billion of Chinese imports annually. On Tuesday, the announcement said the total value of imports subject to the tariff increase is equal to \"the harm caused by China's unreasonable technology transfer policies.\" \nSome opponents of Trump's planned tariff action, announced last month, argued it could raise prices on consumer goods. \n\nWATCH: Aluminum CEO on tariff impact show chapters Century Aluminum CEO on the tariff impact      23 Hours Ago | 02:56", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T00:20:46.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
