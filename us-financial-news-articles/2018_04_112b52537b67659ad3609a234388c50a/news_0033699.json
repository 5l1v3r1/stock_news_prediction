Photo: Reuters The HKMA allows the Hong Kong dollar to trade in a range of 7.75 to 7.85 to the U.S. dollar and says it will buy or sell U.S. dollars to maintain the local currency’s value.\n“We see that the operation of the market has been smooth and orderly, and the market confidence in the ability of the HKMA to maintain [the] stability of the Hong Kong dollar is very strong,” Mr. Lee said at a briefing Thursday.\nThe Hong Kong dollar strengthened by as much as 0.08% against the U.S. dollar earlier, its biggest intraday rise in three months. One U.S. dollar bought 7.8481 Hong Kong dollars in recent trading, which meant Hong Kong’s currency was 0.02% stronger for the day.\nHong Kong’s dollar has been mostly depreciating against its U.S. counterpart since the beginning of last year, driven by a wide gap between U.S. and Hong Kong interest rates.\nLocal interbank rates have risen since the HKMA started intervening, but remain well below corresponding U.S. rates. That means it is still attractive for yield-seeking investors to swap Hong Kong dollars into U.S. dollars.\n“Usually it will take some time for this sort of activity to die down,” said Tommy Wu, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. He said he expects the Hong Kong dollar to continue hitting the weak end of its trading band over the next two to three months because the rise in local interest rates will be slow.\nWrite to Saumya Vaishampayan at saumya.vaishampayan@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T09:54:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
