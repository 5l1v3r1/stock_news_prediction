Currency markets generally dislike trade intervention, and previous protectionist efforts by the U.S. government have weakened the dollar.\nPerhaps the biggest risk for the U.S. currency is a possible exodus of capital, analysts said.\n“For the dollar right now I see a lot more risk to the downside than upside. With the current political atmosphere in Washington there’s a lot more still to come from this,” said Jeremy Cook, head of FX strategy at WorldFirst.\nWhile transfers out of dollar-based assets can take years if not decades because of the greenback’s status as the world’s premier reserve currency, recent trends among central banks and sovereign wealth funds indicate a slow shift.\nThe U.S. dollar’s share of currency reserves reported to the International Monetary Fund declined in the final quarter of 2017 to a four-year low, latest data showed.\nAny significant rise in risk sentiment would outweigh any short-term advantage the dollar would have against emerging markets in its role as a safe-haven bet, Cook said.\nIn the midst of the U.S.-China trade tension, the dollar has weakened in three of the last five sessions against the yen, down more than 5 percent so far this year. Against the Swiss franc, the greenback has fallen 1.4 percent so far in 2018.\nThe Japanese and Swiss units are viewed as safe-haven currencies and tend to benefit at the dollar’s expense in times of geopolitical and financial tension.\nBeyond the potential trade war, investors are also focused on U.S. data this week, including a jobs report on Friday, for signs how steady economic fundamentals are.\nThe dollar on Thursday rose 0.3 percent to trade at 107.08 yen and the Australian dollar was down 0.3 percent at $0.7691 despite stronger local data.\nThe euro edged down 0.2 percent to $1.2258, adding to the previous day’s modest gains.\nReporting by Tom Finn; Editing by Saikat Chatterjee and Catherine Evans\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
