For me, it was a difficult match to prepare for, because I didn’t know what to expect,” Garcia said.\nKostyuk had advanced to the main draw by beating France’s Alize Cornet and dumped out Antonia Lottner in the first round.\n“There aren’t many videos or stats on her because she’s brand new on tour, so that’s never easy. She just went for it,” Garcia said.\nUp next for Garcia is another Ukrainian in Elina Svitolina. The third seed was leading 2-6 6-1 3-2 when her opponent Marketa Vondrousova retired due to a thigh injury.\nFormer world number one Angelique Kerber was down a set and trailed by two games in the second against Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit when she pulled out with a quad problem.\nAmerica’s CoCo Vandeweghe battled past Laura Siegemund 6-4 4-6 6-3 to set up a last-eight showdown with top seed Simona Halep while Karolina Pliskova beat Veronika Kudermetova and next meets former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T23:33:05.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
