Jepsen wants to shrink the bulky million-dollar M.R.I. machines technicians use down into small \"thinking vaps\" that can transmit your thoughts and read the thoughts of others. \nScientists at Kyoto University in Japan were also recently able to use artificial intelligence to visualize what people were thinking by recreating the images on a screen.\n4.

Zoos filled with extinct and endangered species show chapters You can now clone your dog or cat. But is it ethical?      8:01 AM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 02:05 Safari rides in 2017 may feature long-dead species, such as the wooly mammoth and the dodo, thanks to animal cloning .

The American Association of University Women, for example, predicts that women in the United States could reach pay equity with men in 2119 .\nBarnard College professor and historian Premilla Nadasen tells CNBC Make It that although we can't know for sure what's going to happen 217 years from now, it's worth looking at what happened in the past to understand how we can make progress. \n\n\"In the 1950s, before the women's movement, people did not imagine that the movement would have taken place, but in the 1960s and 70s, it led to rapid process,\" Nadasen says, further noting how the feminist movement led to the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act.\nClosing the gender pay gap, Nadasen says, may also be a matter of making sure the government and employers enforce these laws.\n\"We have good laws on the books,\" Nadasen says. \"When we begin to ensure that employers are following the law through legal action, that's part of the way we can close the gender wage gap.\"\nLike this story?
