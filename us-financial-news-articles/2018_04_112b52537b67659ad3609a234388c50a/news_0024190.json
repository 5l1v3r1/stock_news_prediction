CVM confirmed receiving a formal communication regarding the matter, without elaborating.\nAn extraordinary board meeting is scheduled for April 26 to elect a new board. A dissolution of the board would likely shake up management and remove current Chairman Abilio Diniz, a retail magnate who took the reins five years ago and owns nearly 4 percent of the company.\nDiniz was behind the proposal of the alternative list, according to a person familiar of the matter.\nRepresentatives for Diniz did not immediately comment on his relationship with the alternative board line-up.\nThe company is also ensnared in a food safety probe into whether its executives bribed inspectors to evade safety checks.\nThe investigation, which led to a ban of BRF chicken exports to the European Union, forced the food company to send thousands of workers on paid leave as it trimmed output.\nBRF shares, which are down almost 39 percent this year, rose 5 percent on Wednesday, their strongest session in a month.\n$1 = 3.38 reais Reporting by Ana Mano; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T00:58:36.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
