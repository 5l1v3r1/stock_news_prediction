He is ranked by Forbes magazine as Spain’s ninth richest person. \nThe company operates bingo halls, casinos and slot machines in more than 70 countries and booked earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 398 million euros ($489 million) in 2016, up 5 percent on the previous year. \nIt issued in 2015 and 2016 two bonds for a total outstanding amount of 950 million euros maturing in 2021 and 2023. [ES140035165=] [ES122758699=] \nLast year Reuters reported that Cirsa [CIRSA.UL] had hired investment bank Lazard to explore a possible market listing.
