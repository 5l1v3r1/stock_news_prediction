They represent the best of the consumer technology industry.”\nKaren Chupka oversees the sales, marketing, conferences, operations and management of CTA’s events including its annual tradeshows, CES ® – the global stage for innovation – and CES Asia. At CES 2018 in Las Vegas, nearly 4,500 exhibitors filled more than 2.75 million net square feet of exhibit space and showcased their latest products and services to more than 180,000 attendees from 150 countries. Under Karen’s leadership, CES has been named as the largest annual North American tradeshow by Trade Show Executive and Tradeshow Week.\n“Karen has been invaluable in the remarkable evolution, growth and influence of CES,” said Shapiro. “Our exhibiting companies know and trust her vision for the show and understanding of the tech trends that will drive our entire industry. Karen has helped enable CES to become the largest and most influential global technology event in the world.”\nKaren first joined CTA in 1989, and has held numerous roles within the organization including vice president of business development, director of industry relations and education, and director of marketing for CES. She has also served as director of business development with Gartner and worked for the National Association of Manufacturers.\nTiffany Moore joined CTA as vice president of government and political affairs, leading the association’s advocacy efforts on Capitol Hill on issues including communications and technology policy, patent litigation reform, strategic immigration reform and international trade, and overseeing CTA’s political action committee CTAPAC. In addition to these responsibilities, her new role will include overseeing CTA’s U.S. Jobs, and Diversity and Inclusion initiatives.\n“As an integral leader of our government affairs team, Tiffany has found common ground for Republicans and Democrats to work together and helped shape policies that allow U.S. innovation to flourish,” said Shapiro. “Given her deep policy understanding and strategic vision, I know she’ll thrive leading our efforts on diversity and inclusion, and the American workforce – key issues for CTA and the entire tech industry.”\nBefore joining CTA, Tiffany served in public sector roles including assistant U.S. trade representative for intergovernmental affairs and public liaison at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, and legislative director for U.S. Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI). She also has professional experience as director of government relations for Kellogg Company, principal at Moore Consulting and a strategic consultant with TwinLogic Strategies.\nBoth promotions take effect immediately, and Karen and Tiffany have assumed their new titles.\nAbout Consumer Technology Association:\nConsumer Technology Association (CTA)™ is the trade association representing the $351 billion U.S. consumer technology industry, which supports more than 15 million U.S. jobs.
