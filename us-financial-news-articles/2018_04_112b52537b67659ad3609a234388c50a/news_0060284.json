The Rezūm system complements the company's existing portfolio of treatment options for symptomatic BPH, which includes the GreenLight XPS TM Laser Therapy system and holmium laser platforms.\nThe two organizations announced a definitive agreement on March 21, 2018 for Boston Scientific to acquire NxThera.\nAbout Boston Scientific\nBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.
