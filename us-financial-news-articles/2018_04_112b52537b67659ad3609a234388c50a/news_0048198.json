REUTERS/Darren Staples \nMeditor’s move comes ahead of a meeting scheduled for Thursday where Carpetright’s creditors and landlords will vote on a restructuring plan. \nMeditor increased its holding in the floor coverings retailer to 29.99 percent from 16.47 percent, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. \nLast month it raised its stake from 12.29 percent. \nCarpetright this month said it would seek creditor approval for a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). The plan involves the closure of 92 stores and rent reductions at 113 others. Up to 300 jobs could go. \nMeditor could not be reached for immediate comment. A spokesman for Carpetright declined to comment. \nCarpetright shares are down 85 percent year on year after a series of profit warnings. \nThe stock was down 1.4 percent at 37 pence at 1034 GMT, valuing the business at 26.1 million pounds. \nIn March, Carpetright agreed a 12.5 million pounds unsecured loan with Meditor in exchange for new shares to fund short-term working capital. \nIf the CVA is approved on Thursday, Carpetright will seek to raise a further 60 million pounds through an equity issue partly to fund the restructuring plan. \nWith UK consumer spending under pressure, Carpetright is not alone in finding the going tough. \nThis year Toys R Us UK, electricals group Maplin and drinks wholesaler Conviviality have gone into administration, while fashion retailer New Look is also closing stores. \nOn Monday, British windows and doors retailer Safestyle UK warned on 2018 revenue and profit.
