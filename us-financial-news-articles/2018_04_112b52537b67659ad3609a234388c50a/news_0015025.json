The call was also backed by Brian Acton, co-founder of the messaging service WhatsApp, which was sold to Facebook for around $19 billion in 2014, and by entertainers including the singer and actor Cher.\nThe company itself has said #deletefacebook has not had any meaningful impact on users to date and financial analysts say the controversy has had little impact on advertising or user engagement on the Facebook platform so far.\nIn an earlier foray into politics, Lubach helped attract the hundreds of thousands of votes needed to trigger a public referendum that last month rejected a new Dutch law granting spy agencies the power to conduct mass tapping of internet traffic.\nLubach’s best known skit is a parody of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” slogan, “The Netherlands Second” which has been viewed more than 26 million times on YouTube, and triggered dozens of copycat videos in other countries.\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch and Eric Auchard; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T18:18:00.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
