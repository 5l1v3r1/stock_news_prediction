Before that, he was chief energy economist at Paris-based financial services group Kepler Cheuvreux and managing director and global head of energy research at Deutsche Bank.\nSince May 2016, Lewis has also been a member of the G-20-backed Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.\n“Carbon Tracker has done so much to bring climate change into mainstream investor thinking and make financial markets aware of stranded asset risk in the fossil fuel industry,” Lewis said in a statement.\n“Its role in informing investors is even more important today, with new EU regulations in force since January putting extra pressure on the traditional providers of research in investment banks and brokerages,” he said.\nReporting by Nina Chestney; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:44:11.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
