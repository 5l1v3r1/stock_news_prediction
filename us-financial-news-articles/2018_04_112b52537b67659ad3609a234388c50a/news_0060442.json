In late 2016 it told staff the lower output plans took account of Iran, while publicly stressing the value of the deal to jobs.\n‘NOT DEPENDENT’ ON IRAN On Wednesday, however, Muilenburg said Boeing would not have to trim production of the 777 any further even if Iran were unable to take any deliveries of the $347 million jet.\n“The production rate that we have put in place is not dependent on the Iranian orders,” he said.\n“If those orders do come to fruition, if we do ultimately deliver airplanes, those represent opportunities for us but we are going to follow the U.S. government’s lead and we have ensured that ... we are not dependent on those aircraft.”\nSales of 777s rebounded in 2017, more than doubling to 60.\nTrump has often vowed to pull the United States out of the 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six major powers. He will decide by May 12 whether to restore U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran, which could be a first step to ending the deal.\nIranian officials have said repeatedly the United States must honour the agreement and have accused Washington of hampering not only the delivery of U.S. aircraft, but also European planes purchased under the same accord, because of practical restrictions on financing.\nIranAir ordered 100 Airbus jets and 20 Franco-Italian ATR turboprops. It has taken delivery of three Airbus and 8 ATRs.\nThe European firms rely on U.S. export licences to complete their deals because of the number of U.S. parts in each plane.\nSo far Washington has issued licences covering a period that would allow about a third of the Airbus deliveries to go ahead, but it remains unclear how a U.S. withdrawal would affect these.
