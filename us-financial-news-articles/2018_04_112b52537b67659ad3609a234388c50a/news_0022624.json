But the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods a week later sent the price to a two-week low.\nOil markets have been supported by healthy demand and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nHowever, soaring U.S. crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016, threatens to undermine OPEC's efforts.\nThe American Petroleum Institute will publish storage data later on Tuesday while the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its monthly report on U.S. production.\n\"The latest monthly estimates will come out this week with the EIA leading the pack, publishing its Short-Term Energy Outlook this afternoon,\" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said.\n\"The EIA said that U.S. crude oil output is chiefly the function of price. If this is the case, then no downward revision is anticipated today.\"\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE; Editing by Jason Neely and Adrian Croft)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T05:11:53.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
