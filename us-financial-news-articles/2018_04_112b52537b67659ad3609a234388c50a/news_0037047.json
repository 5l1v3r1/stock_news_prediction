REUTERS/Kevin Coombs Wages in the three months to February rose by 2.8 percent, unchanged from the three months to January and weaker than a median forecast of 3.0 percent in a Reuters poll of economists.\nInflation over the period, as measured by the consumer price index, was around 2.9 percent.\nThe ONS said the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.2 percent, its lowest since the three months to May 1975.\nThe Bank of England has said it expects the fall in unemployment to start pushing up pay more quickly, the main reason why it has said it is likely to raise interest rates more quickly than it previously thought.\nBritish households - whose spending is the main driver of the countryâ€™s economy - have been struggling from the double whammy of slow wage growth and a jump in inflation, due mostly to the fall in the value of the pound after the 2016 Brexit vote.\nExcluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.8 percent year-on-year in the three months to February, matching the median forecast in the Reuters poll, the ONS said.\nAn ONS spokesman said bonus payments in February were lower than a year earlier but it was too soon to draw conclusions about the bonus season as a whole.\nReporting by William Schomberg and David Milliken\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:06:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
