What is not minimal is the way in which confidence can be undermined.”\nThe reality for 2018 and 2019 was that momentum would eventually slow due to fading fiscal stimulus, rising interest rates and tighter financial conditions, Lagarde said.\nNew analysis by the IMF showed that global debt had reached an all-time high of $164 trillion, 40 percent higher than in 2007, with China accounting for just over half of that increase.\nLagarde said economies needed to reduce government deficits, strengthen fiscal frameworks and place public debt on a gradual downward path.\n“Strengthening financial stability by increasing buffers in corporate and banking sectors is key, especially in large emerging markets such as China and India,” she added.\nHousing markets in major cities worldwide were increasingly moving in tandem, with Lagarde warning that could amplify any financial and macroeconomic shocks coming from any one country.\nAsked about the IMF’s view on the Hong Kong dollar’s peg to the U.S. dollar, Lagarde said the fund believed the pegging mechanism is consistent with the fundamentals of the financial hub’s economy.\nThe Hong Kong dollar was pegged to the greenback in 1983. The peg has forced the former British colony to import ultra-loose monetary policy from the U.S in recent years, with rock bottom interest rates in Hong Kong having helped to fuel soaring real estate prices.\nThe IMF chief was speaking after attending the Boao Forum in China where she said that a global economic recovery was taking root.\nChristine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), arrives to speak during the \"Europe Lecture\" of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in Berlin, Germany, March 26, 2018.
