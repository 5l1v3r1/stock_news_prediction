Slideshow (8 Images)\nThe pair combined again to put Palace two up before halftime, McArthur swivelling to shoot low into the bottom corner from a square ball by Zaha, who minutes earlier brought a diving save from Ben Hamer.\nLeicester were on top just after the break but wilted after Albrighton was dismissed for bringing down Zaha, leaving Palace to wrap up the points with goals by Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Patrick van Aanholt and substitute Christian Benteke’s penalty.\nPalace climbed to a season high of 11th in the standings with 38 points, six clear of the relegation zone with two matches to play.
