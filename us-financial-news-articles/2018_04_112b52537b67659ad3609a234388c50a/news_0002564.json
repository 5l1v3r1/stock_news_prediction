But the output of oil and gas from western Europe’s largest producer would initially be spared, the unions said.\nNorway’s Norsk Hydro is a major producer of aluminium, while Yara is among the world’s largest makers of fertilisers.\nOther companies that would be hit include offshore engineering companies Aker Solutions and Kvaerner .\nStarting on Wednesday, a state mediator will attempt to broker a deal ahead of an April 7 deadline.\nIn case of a protracted conflict, the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions, known under its LO acronym, and the smaller Confederation of Vocational Unions (YS) could later escalate a strike to include more than 200,000 people.
