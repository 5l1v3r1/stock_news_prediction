The corporate logo of the state oil company PDVSA is seen at a gas station in Caracas, Venezuela March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Marco Bello \nOpposition leaders in Venezuela, which is suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation, at the time accused Goldman of giving President Nicolas Maduro a financial lifeline through the $2.8 billion deal. \nThey added that the operation, which provided Goldman a yield of around 50 percent, would fuel hunger in Venezuela by depriving the government of foreign exchange to import food - leading the securities to be dubbed “hunger bonds.” \nPDVSA completed the payment in recent days, according to the sources, who asked not to be identified. PDVSA in December said it had initiated the payment. \nPDVSA and Goldman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nNews of payment on the PDVSA 2022 VE112689168= was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. \nMaduro’s government has halted almost all foreign debt payments, leaving Venezuela and PDVSA in default on around $40 billion in bonds, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nThe U.S. government has barred its citizens from buying newly issued Venezuelan debt, which has effectively locked the country out of financial markets. \nLeftist Maduro says the country is victim of an “economic war” led by the opposition with the help of United States.
