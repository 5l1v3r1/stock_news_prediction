Jones conceded that he was only speculating and had not spoken to the deputy who drove the car. \nCleveland, 61, was treated at a local hospital for minor injuries and has since been released. \nA lawyer for Cleveland, Mark Reichel, said it was not possible that the deputy did not see his client, whom he claimed was trying to get to a sidewalk at the time. \n“It appears from all evidence that he hit her intentionally. He drove away from an injured woman intentionally,” Reichel said in a written statement, adding that Cleveland would not speak to police or the media.

She suffered physical and psychological harm which will take time to heal,” Reichel said. \nAt the time Cleveland was struck by the car she was taking part in protests over the death of Stephon Clark, 22, who was killed on March 18 in a hail of bullets fired by Sacramento police officers in the backyard of his grandparents’ home. \nThe death of Clark, a father of two, was the latest in a string of killings of black men by police that have sparked protests and fueled renewed debate about bias in the U.S. criminal justice system. \nProtesters on Saturday surrounded two marked Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department patrol cars and began yelling, and pounding and kicking the vehicles, the sheriff’s department has said. \nThe sheriff’s department said the car was damaged by protesters, with dents and a shattered rear window.
