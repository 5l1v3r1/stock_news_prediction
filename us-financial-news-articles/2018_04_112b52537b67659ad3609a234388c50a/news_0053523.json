This is my second time in Germany — I’m not here for the clay, it’s more the shopping. I didn’t come out here to play and lose.”\nRussian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova battled past U.S. Open runner-up Madison Keys 7-6(7) 5-7 6-4.\nThe 26-year-old will take on second-seed Garbine Muguruza in the second round.
