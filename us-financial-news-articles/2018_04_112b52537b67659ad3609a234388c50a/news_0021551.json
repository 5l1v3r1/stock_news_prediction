REUTERS/Charles Mostoller/File Photo \nU.S. District Judge Dan Polster in Cleveland, Ohio picked three lawsuits by municipalities and counties in the state to be the first cases against drug manufacturers and distributors to face a jury in the sprawling litigation. \nThe lawsuits accuse the drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and allege that drug distributors ignored red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. \nIn 2016, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe defendants include opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Endo International Plc and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp. They have denied wrongdoing. \nPolster, who is overseeing at least 433 lawsuits largely by cities and counties, has been pushing for a global settlement and has invited state attorneys general with state court cases or probes not before him to participate in those talks. \nBut roadblocks have emerged, and Polster in a ruling on Wednesday said the companies have “asserted forcefully that they cannot reach final settlement without litigating certain matters.” \nHe said his scheduling order was intended to “address this impediment.” \nThe March 18, 2019 trial date will put the Ohio cases ahead of a May 2019 trial previously scheduled in a lawsuit by Oklahoma’s attorney general in state court. The four drugmakers in that case had sought a 2020 date. \n“Getting the cases to trial accelerates an outcome of some sort,” said Archie Lamb, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs. \nPolster said additional trials would be scheduled in lawsuits by local governments in West Virginia, Illinois, Alabama, Michigan and Florida. \nThe cases were picked for so-called bellwether trials, essentially test cases used in mass litigation in the United States to help both sides gauge the range of damages and define settlement options. \nTo help the plaintiffs, Polster on Wednesday also ordered the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration turn over “critical” data that would allow them to assess to what extent the companies sold or distributed drugs in the six states at issue. \nThe U.S. Justice Department had no immediate comment. Various defendants also did not respond to requests for comment.
