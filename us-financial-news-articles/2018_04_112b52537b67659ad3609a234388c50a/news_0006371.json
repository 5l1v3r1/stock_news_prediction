We won’t give these terrorist, communist youths the right to study at these universities,” Erdogan said last month.\n“We will catch those marginals by the ear and hurl them to the ground,” he told members of his ruling AK Party.\nThe chairman of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said it was not the president’s place to determine the fate of students.\n“Who are you not to let them study? Are universities your father’s property? Universities are not designed from the top of the state,” Kilicdaroglu said, likening Erdogan to a dictator.\nLast month Turkish forces drove the YPG militia, considered by Ankara a terrorist organization linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), from the town of Afrin after a nearly two-month operation.\nSince the start of the offensive, Turkish authorities have detained hundreds of people for social media posts and protests criticizing the operation.\nErdogan also vowed to strip the word “Turkish” from the name of the 83,000-member Turkish Medical Association (TTB) after the group publicly opposed the military campaign.\nReporting by Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay in Ankara, Ali Kucukgocmen in Istanbul; Editing by Daren Butler and Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T02:34:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
