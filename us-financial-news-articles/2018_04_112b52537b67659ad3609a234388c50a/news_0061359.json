FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Serie A - Juventus vs Inter Milan - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - December 9, 2017 Juventus’ Mario Mandzukic and referee Paolo Valeri REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\nThe selection of the officials, who are all active pitch referees, was based on their experience in using the VAR system which has been trialled in a number of competitions around the world, FIFA said in a statement.\nIn choosing the officials, FIFA also considered “successful participation in several preparatory seminars and FIFA competitions, where they enhanced their VAR knowledge and skills by using the system”.\nThe European referees named were Daniele Orsato, Paolo Valeri and Massimiliano Irrati of Italy, Artur Soares Dias and Tiago Martins of Portugal, Bastian Dankert and Felix Zwayer of Germany, Pawel Gil of Poland and Danny Makkelie of the Netherlands. Soccer Football - Serie A - Inter Milan vs Juventus - San Siro, Milan, Italy - April 28, 2018 Inter Milan players appeal to referee Daniele Orsato after he sent off Matias Vecino REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini\nSerie A, the Bundesliga and the Primeira Liga are among the leagues which have used VAR this season.\nThe others were Abdulrahman Al Jassim of Qatar, Wilton Sampaio of Brazil, Gery Vargas of Bolivia and Mauro Vigliano of Argentina. FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Serie A - AC Milan vs Lazio - San Siro, Milan, Italy - January 28, 2018 AC Milan's Leonardo Bonucci is spoken to by referee Massimiliano Irrati REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo\nFIFA said some of the previously-selected pitch referees and linesmen would also act as VARs during the tournament in Russia.\nThe VAR system was approved by soccer’s law-making body IFAB in March after around two years of trials, although there are still concerns that it is not working as smoothly as it should.\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino is a strong proponent of the system and says it has been shown to cut the number of mistakes and lift the pressure on match officials.\nBut critics say decisions are poorly explained to the crowd and have led to goals being disallowed unexpectedly, several minutes after being scored, or penalties being revoked with the ball on the spot and the attacking player ready to take the kick.\nThe VAR, who sits in a special room with video monitors and is in constant communication with the main match official, checks all decisions which could potentially decide a game.\nIf a “clear and obvious” mistake is spotted, the incident can be reviewed and changed. The referee, who has access to a pitchside monitor, can also initiate a review himself.
