REUTERS/Darren Whiteside/File Photo The takeover of PGN by Pertamina dates back to at least 2013 and is aimed at simplifying the management of gas infrastructure in Indonesia.\nThe plan involves forming a new energy holding company, which Harry Fajar Sampurno, who heads mining and strategic industries at the State-owned Enterprise Ministry, said would be effective immediately.\n“The formation of the state-owned oil and gas holding company became legal with the signing of the share transfer agreement,” Sampurno said.\nWith the transfer, PGN will become a “sub-holding” company under Pertamina, managing gas from midstream to distribution and marketing, Sampurno told a press conference.\nAs part of the transition, PGN will acquire Pertamina’s gas unit, Pertagas, he added.\nPertamina Human Resources Director Nicke Widyawati said the changes would strengthen Pertamina and PGN’s finances, allowing them to expand investment and “create more value.”\nBy reducing competition between the two gas companies “that have traditionally been competing”, the integration will improve efficiency and expand their coverage, Widyawati said on Wednesday.\n“This whole time the focus has mainly been in Sumatra and Java, and we want to expand midstream and downstream infrastructure to central and eastern Indonesia,” she added.\nPGN President Director Jobi Triananda Hasjim said the transition would still take some time as the value of the Pertagas acquisition by PGN still needed to be calculated.\n“The first step will be to immediately meet with the management of Pertagas (to discuss) which of their assets can be operated together and to prevent duplication,” Hasjim told reporters.\n“We will look for quick wins first - which infrastructure can be built more quickly with this oil and gas holding company.”\nReporting by Jakarta bureau; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T12:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:41:40.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
