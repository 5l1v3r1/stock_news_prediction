Those talks have not yielded a deal. Related Coverage U.S. biofuel credits hit over 1-year low after EPA grants refinery exemptions \nUnder the RFS requirements, adopted a decade ago, refiners must blend increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation’s fuel every year, or purchase tradable blending credits from other companies that do such blending. \nRefiners granted exemptions win in two ways: They no longer have to blend biofuels or buy credits to comply with the law, and they can sell any credits they had previously purchased to use for compliance. \nNews that Andeavor had received an exemption, reported by Reuters on Tuesday, drew criticism from biofuel backers, who fear that EPA administrator Scott Pruitt is using the waiver program to gut a program he dislikes. \n“Mr. Pruitt is eviscerating a law the president supports – in complete secrecy,” Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, said. \nTrump campaigned on a promise to support the RFS. \nU.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican who represents Iowa - the nation’s largest corn-growing state, said the expansion of the waiver program raised legal questions. \nGiving Andeavor “a free pass when other companies are required to follow the law of the land isn’t just unfair, it may be illegal,” Grassley told Reuters late Tuesday.
