Auto sales jumped 2 percent, the most in six months.\nRetail sales slipped in the first two months of the year as consumers pulled back after heavy spending during the winter holidays. Last month's figures suggest Americans are returning to more free-spending ways. Economists predict that healthy consumer confidence, steady job gains and the impact of tax cuts will fuel solid spending growth in the months ahead.\nSales rose at grocery stores, restaurants and bars, and drug stores.
