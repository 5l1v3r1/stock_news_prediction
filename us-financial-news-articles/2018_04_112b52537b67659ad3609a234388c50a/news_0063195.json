We do believe we were both satisfied. There’s a good relationship between us. However, it’s the first time we have an official meeting. It’s the starting point for a potential future,” he added.\nYamamoto said the deadline for engine manufacturers to present documents to the governing FIA about which teams they are supplying was May 15 and discussions on that were ongoing.\n“It’s something we are starting to discuss now and it has to be smooth between Honda and Red Bull,” he added.\n“I want to use the time we have left to discuss with the Honda board members before I take the feedback back to Red Bull to take the next steps.”\nToro Rosso are Honda’s only current partners but Yamamoto said the car maker’s plan was always to work with multiple teams.\n“The board members are aware of discussions and there is a big respect for the relationship (with Red Bull),” he said.\nRed Bull are winners this season, with Daniel Riccciardo in China. The Australian collided with Dutch team mate Max Verstappen in Baku.\nHonda have, meanwhile, shown improved reliability and performance with Toro Rosso.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:23:50.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
