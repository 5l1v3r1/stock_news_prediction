It also said it had seen one “long-standing institutional client” withdraw assets from a segregated mandate, without giving details.\nKBW analysts said the outflows were greater than its 700 million pounds forecast and they expected downward pressure on analysts’ 2018 earnings expectations, although they reiterated their ‘market perform’ rating on the stock.\nJupiter’s shares were down 3.1 percent to 451.8 pence per share at 0721 GMT, making it among the worst performers in the FTSE mid-cap index.\nThe outflows for Jupiter contrast with the performance of emerging markets-focused peer Ashmore on Tuesday and hedge fund group Man Group last week, both of which reported strong quarterly net inflows.\nActive managers such as Jupiter have come under pressure from lower-cost index-tracking funds in recent years, compounded by a rise in operational costs that has prompted a rash of mergers and acquisitions across the industry.\nAs part of its efforts to cushion the impact of the various market pressures, Jupiter said it would continue its plan to drive growth through diversifying by product, client type and country, although this would make short-term flows “less predictable”, Slendebroek said.\n$1 = 0.6990 pounds Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Simon Jessop\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:39:01.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
