In his free time, he indulged a love of tradition, acquiring 19th century mansions on impulse and hiring decorators to adorn them with antiques and leather-bound books bought in bulk.\nThe standard Wall Street suits Mr. Jenrette wore didn’t quite camouflage his eccentricities. Each morning, he weighed himself before breakfast and plotted the result on graph paper so he could take immediate action, such as skipping bread at lunch, if he veered off target. Instead of going to a gym, he started his days at home with 50 push-ups, 50 deep knee bends and a burst of running in place. He searched for psychological clues in others’ penmanship.\nIn 1959, at age 30, he gambled by helping set up a new firm, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, rather than toiling for decades in the hope of making partner at a traditional one. He then filled the DLJ offices with antiques and oil paintings to suggest a venerable history. In 1970, he and his partners defied tradition by offering DLJ shares to the public while rivals clung to their fusty partnerships.\nMr. Jenrette, who died April 22 at age 89, steered DLJ and later Equitable Life Assurance Society through financial crises that nearly destroyed them. His advice to crisis managers was to make a plan and ignore the critics. He often Quote: d a proverb: “The dog barks but the caravan moves on.”\nMore Obituaries\nMartin Whitman Invested in Troubled Companies Others Shunned April 27, 2018 FMC CEO Malott Thwarted Raiders by Loading Up Company With Debt April 27, 2018 Avicii, Electronic Dance DJ and Producer, Dies at 28 April 20, 2018 SEC Lawyer Scott Friestad, Bedridden With Cancer, Kept Working Until His Final Days April 20, 2018 Sheldrick Built Orphanage to Raise Elephants in Kenya April 20, 2018 The son of an insurance agent, he was often described as courtly, perhaps because he spoke in soft Southern tones.\nRichard Hampton Jenrette was born April 5, 1929, in Raleigh, N.C. As a boy, he liked drawing, particularly houses. He found his family’s Tudor-style home lacking in architectural distinction.\nAt the University of North Carolina, he majored in journalism and was editor of the student newspaper. He worked as sportswriter and a life insurance agent in his teens and early 20s but concluded those weren’t likely paths to wealth. So he enrolled in Harvard Business School, where he graduated in 1957.\nThat earned him a job at Brown Brothers Harriman, a Wall Street firm where he admired the oak-paneled walls, fireplaces and roll-top desks. He started as a messenger toting bags of securities, then learned to write research reports and was promoted to portfolio manager. Among his clients was Greta Garbo. Before he got a chance to meet the reclusive actress, however, a more tempting proposition emerged. William Donaldson and Daniel Lufkin, fellow Harvard Business School graduates, persuaded him to join them as a partner.\nHe was 30 and making around $7,500 ($64,000 in today’s terms) a year. Starting a new firm, he figured, was a better bet than waiting two decades to become a partner at Brown Brothers.\nWhile other Wall Street firms focused on blue chips, DLJ offered in-depth research on emerging growth stocks. DLJ’s founders also foresaw that institutional investors would account for a growing share of trading and catered to them rather than mom and pop.\nDLJ flourished in the go-go 1960s as a research house, trader and fund manager. In 1974, when Mr. Jenrette became CEO, everything started to go wrong. Oil prices and interest rates soared. Stock prices and trading volumes sank. Wall Street firms braced for the end of fixed stock-trading commissions, which would slash their incomes.\nMr. Lufkin favored turning DLJ into what now would be called a private-equity firm. Mr. Jenrette insisted on keeping the firm mostly intact, partly because he didn’t want to lay off colleagues in troubled times.\nThe dogs barked, the caravan rumbled on, and DLJ survived. Equitable Life bought the firm in 1985 for about $460 million. Five years later, facing its own crisis, Equitable made Mr. Jenrette CEO. He raised capital by converting it from a mutual insurer, owned by policyholders, to a shareholder-owned company.\nHis partner in private life, William L. Thompson, died in 2013. Survivors include nieces and a nephew.\nWhen he couldn’t sleep at night, Mr. Jenrette listed his worries on a yellow legal pad he kept at bedside, according to his 1997 memoir, “The Contrarian Manager.” He kept those lists of worries and crossed them out one by one as they were resolved.\nFriends kidded him about his fascination with astrology. Mr. Jenrette admitted it might be hocus-pocus but found that asking about astrological signs was a way to spark conversation at dull parties. He believed it also helped him understand different ways of thinking about life.\nFor decades, Mr. Jenrette chronicled his daily adventures in a diary. He left out details of his romantic life.\nThe only unbridled lust he was willing to write about involved real estate. He bought and renovated more than a dozen mansions. One of his favorites was Edgewater, an 1820 classical revival gem with six Doric columns on the Hudson River in Barrytown, N.Y. He stumbled upon it on a warm September afternoon in 1969 and a few days later agreed to buy it from Gore Vidal. “It was love at first sight,” he wrote.\nWhen DLJ marked its 25th anniversary in 1984, he chartered a private train to bring 400 guests from Grand Central Terminal to Edgewater for a celebration.\nWrite to James R.
