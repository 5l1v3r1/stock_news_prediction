Moscow has denied the allegations.\nIn February, U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and three Russian companies with interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by sowing discord on social media.\nZuckerberg, on the call with reporters, said Facebook should have done more to audit and oversee third-party app developers like the one hired by Cambridge Analytica in 2014.\nWATCH:  Mark Zuckerberg admits to making a huge mistake regarding Facebook data breach show chapters Mark Zuckerberg admits to making a huge mistake regarding Facebook data breach      12:36 PM ET Thu, 5 April 2018 | 02:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T16:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T15:41:32.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
