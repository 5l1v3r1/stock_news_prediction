Soccer Football - Serie A - Juventus vs AC Milan - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - March 31, 2018 Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri REUTERS/Massimo Pinca \nRather than emphasising fight and commitment, the 50-year-old likes to talk about the importance of “interpreting the moment” and “administering the match”. \nHe says his team enjoys defending as much as trying to score goals and said last year that good defending is “as beautiful as a great attacking move”. \nOne of his most recent masterstrokes was in the second leg of the last-16 tie against Tottenham Hotspur when Allegri altered the course of the game with two changes in a minute. \nJuve were losing 1-0, and trailing 3-2 on aggregate, when Allegri replaced defensive midfielder Blaise Matuidi with left back Kwadwo Asamoah, then one minute later brought on right back Stephan Lichtensteiner for central defender Benatia. \nThe complexion of the game changed immediately, Juventus scored two quick goals and, despite being on the back foot for most of the two-leg tie, went through to the last eight 4-3 on aggregate. \nAllegri was similarly successful on Saturday when, with his side drawing 1-1 against AC Milan, he introduced winger Juan Cuadrado on the hour against AC Milan. \nBarely 15 minutes later, the Colombian, returning after three-month injury-enforced absence, scored to set his side on the way to a 3-1 win, heading in at the far post from Sami Khedira’s cross. \nKhedira, who had been greeted with a few jeers when he reappeared for the second half of the match, scored the third and, typically, Allegri praised the German for his tactical nous. \n“He’s an international class player and he is intelligent,” he said. “I like to have him on the pitch as knows when to raise the drop the rhythm, and he knows how to read the moment of the match.” Writing by Brian Homewood, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T14:57:39.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
