Starbucks did not say how many hours the stores would be shuttered on May 29, but the afternoon is the slowest time for Starbucks' business.\nStarbucks is one of the most high-profile and beloved brands in the world and its long-time CEO Howard Schultz was not one to shy away from difficult conversations over thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock.\nHowever U.S. race relations have proven more challenging, even for a company that touts its diverse workforce -- minorities account for 18 percent of Starbucks executives with the title of senior vice president or higher and 43 percent of employees overall.\nFor example, the company's 2015 \"Race Together\" campaign to foster a conversation on the topic following the high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men stirred an intense social media backlash.\nJohnson has apologized for the \"reprehensible\" arrests of the two men in Philadelphia on Thursday and took personal responsibility for the incident, which was captured in a customer video that was shared widely.\nStarbucks attorneys said Johnson and the men, who were released without charges, have \"engaged in constructive discussions about this issue as well as what is happening in communities across the country.\"\nThe manager, whose call to Philadelphia police led to the men's arrests, is no longer working for Starbucks.\nPhiladelphia's police commissioner defended the arrests, saying his officers had to act after Starbucks employees told them the pair were trespassing.\n\"It's good that Starbucks is giving all staff race trainings on May 29. But let's not lose sight of the real problem which is police accountability,\" Tiffany Dena Loftin, director of the youth and college division at NAACP, told Reuters\nShares in Starbucks closed up 0.7 percent at $59.83 on Tuesday and are relatively unchanged in the week since the arrests.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T20:40:18.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
