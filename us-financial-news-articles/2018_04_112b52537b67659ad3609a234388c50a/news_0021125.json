It also said the storage tank isn't designed to monitor liquid nitrogen that is poured into the top.\nUniversity Hospitals said in a statement Tuesday that it's working with the company and others to determine the cause of the failure.\n\"We intend to continue to work with the tank manufacturer to ensure this does not happen again,\" the statement said. \"We've been careful to not assign blame. But we've accepted responsibility.\"\nUniversity Hospitals, which has said about 950 patients were affected, is facing several lawsuits.\nCouples who had stored their eggs and embryos at the clinic had been trying for years to get pregnant, suffered multiple miscarriages or undergone cancer treatments that destroyed their fertility.\nCustom Biogenic Systems also said it didn't have anything to do with the remote alarm system that had been turned off. It said the tank functioned properly by indicating a high-temperature condition and activating a local alarm.\nUniversity Hospitals has said it doesn't know who shut off the remote alarm, which should have alerted staff to changes in the storage tank's temperature on the weekend of March 3, when no one was at the lab.\nSeewer reported from Toledo, Ohio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T05:03:02.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
