Original directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, best known for “The Lego Movie,” were fired in June 2017 because of what were described as creative differences, and veteran Hollywood filmmaker Ron Howard took over.\nReporting by Jill Serjeant in Los Angeles; Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:17:10.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
