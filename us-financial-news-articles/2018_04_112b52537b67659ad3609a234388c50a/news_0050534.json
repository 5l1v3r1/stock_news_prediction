It isn’t clear exactly when he purchased shares in those companies. But financial disclosures dated March 2017 and released after the White House nominated him for the job don’t list stakes in those banks.\nThe most recent disclosure, dated February 2018, is awaiting certification by the Office of Government Ethics. An OCC spokesman also said Mr. Otting uses a professional money manager and “has not made individual decisions regarding specific stocks or securities for several years.”", "external_links": ["https://www.marketwatch.com/story/top-us-bank-regulator-otting-bought-bank-stocks-shortly-before-taking-office-2018-04-25"], "published": "2018-04-25T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T21:08:59.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
