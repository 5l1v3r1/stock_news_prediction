When they had breakfast at the Time Warner Center in November, paparazzi “somehow” showed up, Cuban said. “I think he does it to piss off Trump when Trump is ignoring him.”\nThe president isn’t ignoring Cohen now. Federal prosecutors are investigating Cohen’s work for Trump, including his $130,000 pre-election payment to a former adult-film actress, as well as his taxi business and other personal dealings. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided his premises earlier this month.\nLooming over all of this is an investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether associates of Trump, including Cohen, colluded with Russians to influence the 2016 presidential election. Cohen and the White House have denied any collusion.\nCohen has memorably said he would “take a bullet” for the president. But in a sign of Cohen’s state of mind, he has in recent months privately groused about being excluded from White House posts he believed he deserved, according to people familiar with his thinking. He has struggled to get Trump’s attention. And two new business engagements he started during that time that could have profited from his Washington connections have instead languished.
