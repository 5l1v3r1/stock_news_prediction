He earned his 43rd victory this season, equaling the number Barrasso collected in 1992-93 with the Pittsburgh Penguins.\nHellebuyck was strong from the drop of the puck, making first-period saves on both Johnny Gaudreau and Michael Frolik to deny breakaway chances.\nDespite the Flames carrying the play in the first 20 minutes, Wheeler opened the scoring with 46.8 seconds remaining in the initial period. Wheeler tipped Dustin Byfuglien’s slapper from the point past Flames goalie Jon Gillies for his 23rd goal and 90th point of the season.\nThe last player in franchise history to reach the 90-point mark in a season was Ilya Kovalchuk in 2008-09, when the club was in Atlanta.\nStastny, who has made a habit out of collecting points against the Flames, made it 2-0 Winnipeg at the 12:59 mark of the second period. Stastny was set up at the doorstep and neatly redirected Ben Chiarot’s hard pass from the point for his 16th goal of the year.\nStastny has collected 25 goals and 61 points in 52 career games against Calgary. Among active players, only Daniel Sedin has scored more goals against the Flames (29). Stastny also ranks third among active players in total points against the Flames, trailing Daniel Sedin (88 points) and his brother Henrik Sedin (78).\nFlames rookie Spencer Foo scored his first NHL goal with 4:46 left in the second period to put the visitors on the board. Foo made his third NHL game one to remember when he received a fortunate bounce as Michael Stone’s point shot ricocheted off his skate and into the net.\nThe Jets, who are riding a four-game winning streak and have won 10 of 11 games, will finish second in the Central Division and have home-ice advantage in their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series against the Minnesota Wild.\nGillies stopped 24 shots for the Flames, who have lost nine of 10 games.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:03:21.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
