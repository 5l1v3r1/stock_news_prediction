They are then re-infused into the same patient where they can circulate for years to seek out and fight the disease.\nAllogene will receive from Pfizer rights to 16 pre-clinical CAR T assets which are licensed from French cell therapy specialist Cellectis SA and French drugmaker Servier.\nPfizer has an 8 percent stake in Cellectis from a 2014 agreement.\nAllogene will also get rights to one clinical asset from Servier, which is called UCART19, an \"off-the-shelf\" cell therapy currently in early-stage study.\nPfizer will get a representation on Allogene's board, but financial details of the deal were not disclosed.\nSan Francisco-based Allogene specializes in cancer treatment by developing CAR T cell therapy for blood cancer and tumors.\nServier and Allogene aim to start mid-stage studies in 2019 with Allogene having the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States. Servier will have the exclusive rights for all other countries, Pfizer said.\nAllogene is a Two River portfolio company, which was formed with $300 million from an investment consortium that includes TPG Capital, Vida Ventures, BellCo Capital, the University of California Office of the Chief Investment Officer and Pfizer.
