The Blues close the season Saturday night in Colorado, where a win or an overtime/shootout loss will enable them to make their seventh straight playoff appearance. A regulation loss would eliminate St. Louis.\nBerglund’s tie-breaking goal came 16 seconds after Chicago’s Erik Gustafsson had tied the score with his fifth goal of the season on a wrister from the left circle that beat Carter Hutton to the short side at 8:08 of the third period.\nRobert Bortuzzo’s point shot deflected off Kyle Brodziak and right to Berglund at the left post, and he wristed it past J-F Berube.\nJaden Schwartz tacked on his 23rd goal on a wrister at 12:40 to give the Blues some insurance. The tally snapped a seven-game scoreless drought for Schwartz.\nBerglund capped the second hat trick of his career with an empty-netter, his 17th marker of the season, at 18:49. He won a puck battle with Duncan Keith along the right boards and chipped a backhander from just inside the blue line that rolled just inside the right post.\nSt. Louis controlled the game most of the night, outshooting the Blackhawks 35-20 and outhitting them 24-8. The Blues could have owned a 2-0 lead early, but failed to convert on point-blank chances with open nets staring at them.\nBerglund put them ahead 1-0 at 18:17 of the first period when he deflected a point blast from Joel Edmundson in the high slot. The puck rolled inside the right post as Berube couldn’t react to it in time.\nHutton made his first start in a month as starter Jake Allen rested for Saturday night’s showdown and made 19 saves. Berube stopped 31 of 34 shots.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:01:42.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
