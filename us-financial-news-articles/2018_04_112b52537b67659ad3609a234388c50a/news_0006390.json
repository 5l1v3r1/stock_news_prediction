The second phase, which has just been signed, will see the business work on 12 more turbines, due to be commissioned by October. SGRE said that it would also be responsible for the operations and maintenance services on the project over the next 10 years.\n\"We are committed to Vietnam as a market and we want to be our customers' preferred partner in developing wind power projects,\" Alvaro Bilbao, CEO of Siemens Gamesa in the Asia-Pacific region, said in a statement.\nWind energy is becoming an increasingly important source of power.
