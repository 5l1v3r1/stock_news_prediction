It bears repeating.\nIndeed, the workaday textile has become a go-anywhere hero. Wear jeans with your favorite T-shirt for a casual weekend or doll them up, as Ms. Vassar suggests, with a peplum jacket. Added stylist Danielle Nachmani: “I most often style my denim with a plain white tee or button down—I’m a big fan of keeping things simple and classic.”\nNot a jeans person? There’s still plenty of denim to be had in the form of jackets, chambray shirts, dresses and even accessories. “What makes denim so great is that it pretty much matches everything,” Ms. Nachmani said. To wit, we’ve found 26 variations on the theme to satisfy every whim.\nPhoto: F.
