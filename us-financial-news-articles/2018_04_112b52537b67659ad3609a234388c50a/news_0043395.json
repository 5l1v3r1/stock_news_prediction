REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo Donald, who joins UKGI from Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ) where he was vice chairman of UK advisory and corporate broking, will be responsible for managing and selling down the government’s 71 percent stake in RBS.\nThe government has said the stake sale is expected to commence by March 2019.\nUKGI Chief Executive Mark Russell said Donald, who takes up his role in May, “brings long experience of financial institutions and capital markets, and I look forward to working with him as we continue to execute our mandate and build on the progress which has been made in the disposal program.”\nUK Financial Investments, a separate body which previously managed the government’s RBS stake, was folded into UKGI in March. Its CEO Oliver Holbourn also said that month he would stand down from the role he had held since 2013.\nHolbourn had overseen the government’s attempts to sell shares in RBS and Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ), both of which were rescued during the 2007-9 financial crisis.\nThe government has sold its remaining stake in Lloyds, but it is still the major shareholder in RBS as a long-running investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the bank’s mis-selling of toxic mortgage-backed securities has delayed the share sale.\n(This version of the story has bee refiled to fix to read “since 2013” in paragraph five)\nReporting by Emma Rumney; Editing by Silvia Aloisi and Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T14:25:54.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
