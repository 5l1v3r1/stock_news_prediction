The U.S. blamed North Korea for the WannaCry attack, for example, he said, and the NotPetya ransomware attack has been attributed to Russia.\n\"One never holds people necessarily responsible for their government, but one does have the ability to be very careful in what one does with the government itself,\" said Smith, who became Microsoft's president in 2015, taking on a title that had not existed at the company since 2002, when Richard Belluzzo left.\nEarlier this week Microsoft announced new security tools, including a secure operating system for internet-connected devices.\nHPE and Oracle are among the other companies that have signed onto the accord. Microsoft's top competitors in the public cloud market, Alphabet and Amazon, are not currently on board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T23:13:30.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
