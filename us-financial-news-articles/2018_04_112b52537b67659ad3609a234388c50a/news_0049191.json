Girls can be married at an even younger age if religious courts agree.\nWomen’s rights campaigners said a ban is long overdue.\n“Child marriage is a form of sexual violence,” said Ninik Rahayu, one of the female Islamic clerics who jointly issued an unprecedented fatwa against child marriage last year.\nA fatwa, or religious edict, is influential among Muslims although it is not legally binding.\n“Child marriage has reached an emergency level in Indonesia. If we don’t take action quick enough, it will destroy the future of our children,” Rahayu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAndreas Harsono from campaign group Human Rights Watch said the Indonesian government’s pledge is “bold” but action must be taken without delay.\nCampaigners say poverty and tradition continue to drive underage marriage in Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago in Southeast Asia with a population of 250 million people.\nOne in four girls marry before they turn 18 in Indonesia, according to the United Nations’ children agency, UNICEF. On average over 3,500 Indonesian girls are married off every day.\nGlobally, 12 million girls become child brides each year, the Girls Not Brides group says, exposing them to greater risks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death in childbirth.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
