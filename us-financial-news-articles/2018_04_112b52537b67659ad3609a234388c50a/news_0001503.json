The Company's Form 10- K can be found in the Investor Relations section of its website.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 47% to $1.4 million from revenue of $1.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, when excluding a non-cash intangible impairment charge of $0.3 million, improved by 20% from the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 improved by 25% from the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased 4% to $5.4 million from revenue of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 32% from the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 33% from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $1.4 million, compared to $1.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The majority of the Company’s revenues for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 came from its Mobile Labs segment, consisting of its E-N-G Mobile Systems subsidiary (“ENG”), which generated $1.4 million of revenue. Cost of revenue was $1.0 million and $0.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, due to a change in revenue mix.\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.4 million, compared to $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decreased revenue for 2017 compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the timing of delivery of projects in the Mobile Labs segment, which had a large backlog of business at the time the Company acquired ENG in December 2015. Operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 32% to $4.8 million, compared to $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 improved by 33% to $8.7 million, compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExcitePCR/Molecular Diagnostics 2017 Highlights\nFormed ExcitePCR subsidiary to better position FireflyDX for the global, point-of-care diagnostics market and provide a platform for strategic partnership and financing opportunities Announced a new product under development, the FireflyDX-Portable, a lightweight, real-time pathogen detection system with commercial availability slated for 2019 Detected Ebola virus on its lab-based FireflyDX prototype system in a collaborated effort with its assay partner, GenArraytion Inc.
