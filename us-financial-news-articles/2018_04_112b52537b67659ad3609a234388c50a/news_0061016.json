The Bundeswehr wants to and must rapidly close the gaps that exist after 25 years of underfunding in procurement,” the official said.\nGermany sharply curtailed military spending after the end of the Cold War, but began boosting spending again after Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014.\nReports by the ministry and parliament this year raised concerns that missing spare parts and quality defects had curtailed the readiness of Germany’s submarines, warplanes and some other key weapons.\nThe ministry said the minister had ordered that funds should be prioritised to pay for digitalisation and personal equipment for soldiers, but that meant that at least one planned major international weapons programme would have to be postponed unless additional funds were added to the 2019 budget.\nNo additional details were immediately available. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet is due to debate the budget plans at a cabinet meeting next Wednesday.\nGerman Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen and French Defence Minister Florence Parly on Thursday signed documents to move forward on joint development and procurement of a new combat jet and other programmes.\nGermany is also due to kick off several major procurement programmes for new heavy-lift helicopters and warships.\nThe defence ministry said the finance ministry would cover some 875 million euros in added costs triggered by a recent wage agreement for soldiers and other public sector workers, but gaps remained in the modernisation budget.\nNo data was immediately available about how the spending would break down as a percentage of gross domestic product.\nBut the ministry sources said the new budget plan would result in a reduction of development spending as a percentage of GDP from 0.5 percent to 0.47 percent, despite a firm commitment in the coalition agreement between conservatives and Social Democrats to boost development spending to 0.7 percent of GDP, in line with commitments made to the United Nations.\n“The Development Ministry and the Defence Ministry expect that this gap will be closed in line with the contract as part of further budgetary processes,” the source said.\nThe coalition agreement also calls for any additional funds made available for development to be matched equally for the defence budget, the source added.
