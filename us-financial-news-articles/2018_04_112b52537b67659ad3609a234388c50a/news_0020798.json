The next focal point is how the United States responds.” \nIn currencies, the euro was a shade higher at $1.2362 and on its fourth session of gains. \nThe common currency was not far from a two-week high of $1.2378 scaled overnight after European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters in an interview that its 2.55-trillion euro bond buying program would be wound down by the end of this year. \nThe euro has risen about 3 percent this year on expectations that the ECB would eventually normalise monetary policy and hike interest rates. \nThe dollar was steady at 107.170 yen after gaining 0.4 percent overnight as an uptick in risk appetite weakened demand for its Japanese peer, often sought in times of market turmoil and political tensions. \nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.562 after shedding 0.3 percent the previous day. \nCrude rose further after rallying overnight on the easing of U.S.-China trade conflict concerns and tensions in the Middle East. \nU.S. crude futures gained 0.25 percent to $65.67 a barrel after surging more than 3 percent on Tuesday.
