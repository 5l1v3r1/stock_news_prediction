The government insists it will remain 100 percent state-owned but unions fear this opens the door to privatisation, as happened after similar changes to the corporate structure of France Telecom, now called Orange.\nAnother vote on the bill that enshrines the reform is scheduled in the Senate, the upper house of parliament, in May before the process of parliamentary approval is completed, which should now happen by early July at the latest.
