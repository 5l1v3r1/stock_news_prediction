The Norwegian firm was not immediately available for comment.\nFaroe’s shares closed 12.2 percent higher on Wednesday, having hit a four-year high.\nReporting by Terje Solsvik in Oslo and Shadia Nasralla and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T21:27:38.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
