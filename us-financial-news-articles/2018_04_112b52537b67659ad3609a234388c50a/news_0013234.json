Pocock, who had a sabbatical last year, scored the last of the seven-try haul for the Brumbies. \nThe Reds made a storming start and scored through Taniela Tupou and Chris Feauai-Sautia in the opening 22 minutes but saw their 18-12 halftime lead wiped out after the interval. \nBoth sides now have three wins and three defeats from their opening six matches of the 2018 campaign.

HURRICANES 38 SHARKS 37 \nThe Wellington Hurricanes needed a converted try from centre Ngani Laumape five minutes after the hooter to pip South Africa’s Sharks in a thriller at McLean Park, Napier, on Friday. \nThe New Zealand conference leaders were trailing by nine points with two minutes remaining but Ihaia West slotted home a penalty before the Hurricanes pack built a platform for Laumape to romp across the line for his second try of the night. \nFlyhalf West, promoted to start after Beauden Barrett failed a late fitness test, still needed to add the conversion to give 2016 champions their fifth straight win and he nervelessly steered the ball between the posts to the delight of the crowd. \nThe Durban-based Sharks, picking up where they left off in their 63-40 win over the Blues in Auckland last week, scored four tries in a brilliant display of aggressive forward play and powerful running from the backline.
