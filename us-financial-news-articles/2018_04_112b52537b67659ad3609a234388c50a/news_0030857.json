He made Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list, but struggled at first to get private investment for his company Biofire Technologies.\nLast year, Mr. Kloepfer secured funding from Mr. Conway and a few others. He is currently making hires and hopes to raise more money and ship and product in 12 to 18 months.\nMr. Conway remains optimistic about Mr. Kloepfer, if not the foundation, which raised $15,000 in 2015 and not much more since then.\n“We awarded our grants, we picked our horses,” he said.\nVenture capitalist Ron Conway remains optimistic about Mr. Kloepfer.
