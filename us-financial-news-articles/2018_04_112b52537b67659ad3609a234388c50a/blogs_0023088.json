Crude oil prices also spiked higher. \n\"It's not that this wasn't expected. Trump had already hinted at a response,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"I think the market was caught offguard by the tone of the response.\" \nThe president's threat comes after Russia's ambassador to Lebanon told local media that Russia would shoot down American missiles headed Syria's way.
