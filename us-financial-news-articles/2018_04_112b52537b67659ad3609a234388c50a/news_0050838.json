Mountbatten was killed by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) who detonated a bomb on his boat in 1979.\nBritain's Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital with their new baby boy in London, April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay The birth of the new prince has provided a welcome distraction for many in Britain where Brexit and political turmoil has dominated the headlines since the 2016 shock vote to leave the European Union.\nLouis joins siblings Charlotte, 2, and George, 4, in the growing royal family, and the queen, Philip, Charles, and his wife, Camilla have all expressed delighted with the birth of the monarch’s sixth great-grandchild.\n“It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them,” Charles said.\nThe name was a surprise, with the bookies’ favorites having been Albert, Arthur, Alexander, James and Philip. The betting odds indicated just a 5 percent chance of Louis.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Such was the excitement at the arrival of a new royal baby that Blackpool Zoo named a newly born double-humped Bactrian camel calf as Louis to honor the new prince.\nA zoo spokeswoman said the camel’s name was simply Louis though some were already calling the camel “Prince Louis”.\nAdditional reporting by Alistair Smout and Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T13:58:35.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
