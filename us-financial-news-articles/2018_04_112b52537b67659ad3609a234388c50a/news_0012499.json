But..you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.”\nHOPES FOR EARNINGS The next major hurdle will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday.\nThe war of words took a toll on Wall Street on Friday. The Dow ended down 2.3 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq 2.3 percent.\nThe looming earnings season might be strong enough to provide fundamental support for stocks, with analysts tipping the fastest quarterly profit growth in seven years.\nThe latest souring of risk sentiment and a soft report on U.S. payrolls helped sovereign debt end last week on a firm note. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt dropped back to 2.786 percent, from a top of 2.8380 on Thursday.\nIn currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 107.00, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49. The euro hovered at $1.2270, after bouncing from a trough of $1.2212, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 90.203.\nIn commodity markets, gold eased slightly to $1,331.69 an ounce, but stayed well within recent trading ranges.\nOil prices edged up in early trade with Brent crude futures for June rising 16 cents to $67.27 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 15 cents to $62.21 a barrel.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:13:43.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
