First quarter 2018 EBITDA was $1.9 billion.\n\"We started 2018 with strong operations, capturing higher margins for several of our products and advancing our organic and inorganic growth programs. EBITDA improved by 11% relative to the fourth quarter and by 18% relative to the first quarter 2017. Global polyolefins demand remained solid. While U.S. ethylene prices weakened, a tight market for polyolefins supported a polyethylene price increase and strong chain margins. Our Intermediates and Derivatives business achieved record quarterly EBITDA for the segment, driven primarily by higher margins, while our reliability initiatives at the Houston refinery resulted in strong operations during the first quarter,\" said Bob Patel, LyondellBasell CEO.\n\"In February we announced our agreement to acquire A. Schulman, Inc., a leading global supplier of high-performance plastic compounds and composites. This acquisition builds upon our existing compounding business and will create value for our shareholders and customers while also providing a platform for future growth. In March we launched our recycled polyolefins joint venture, Quality Circular Polymers (QCP), with SUEZ which allows us to contribute to the circular economy in a way that no plastics company has before,\" said Patel.\nOUTLOOK\n\"We are beginning to see the typical seasonal margin improvements in oxyfuels and refining, and we look forward to the benefits of continued high operating rates in the second quarter. Over the past two months, the U.S. market has experienced an imbalance between ethylene production and consumption, but this is expected to improve as the downstream derivative units attain full operating rates. Robust global demand and recent higher oil prices continue to support strong polyolefin pricing. LyondellBasell's organic growth program continues with our Hyperzone HDPE and PO/TBA projects on track,\" Patel said.\nLYONDELLBASELL BUSINESS RESULTS DISCUSSION BY REPORTING SEGMENT\nLyondellBasell manages operations through five operating segments: 1) Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas; 2) Olefins and Polyolefins – Europe, Asia and International; 3) Intermediates and Derivatives; 4) Refining; and 5) Technology.\nOlefins & Polyolefins - Americas (O&P-Americas) – Our O&P–Americas segment produces and markets olefins and co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.\nTable 2 - O&P–Americas Financial Overview\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\nMillions of U.S. dollars\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating income\n$651\n$667\n$559\nEBITDA\n780\n784\n723\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 versus three months ended December 31, 2017 – EBITDA decreased $4 million versus the fourth quarter 2017.
