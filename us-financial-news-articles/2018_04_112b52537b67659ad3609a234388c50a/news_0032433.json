The population of the province is predominantly Sunni Muslim; the majority of Iranians are Shi’ites. \nIn April 2017, ten Iranian border guards were killed by militants in Mirjaveh. \nSunni militant groups which have carried out several deadly attacks in recent years say they are fighting against discrimination.
