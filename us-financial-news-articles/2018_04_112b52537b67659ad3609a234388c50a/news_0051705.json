The logo of Swiss drugmaker Roche is seen at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nRoche, the world’s biggest cancer drugs maker, now predicts low-single-digit sales growth at constant exchange rates, after previously warning revenue could be flat.\nExcluding tax gains, core earnings per share are set to grow broadly in line with sales, it said.\nFirst-quarter sales rose 6 percent at constant exchange rates to 13.6 billion Swiss francs (9.92 billion pounds), compared to the average 13.3 billion franc analyst estimate in a Reuters poll.\nOcrevus sales easily topped estimates, hitting 479 million francs compared to the 406 million francs forecast in the Reuters poll.\nSales of Roche’s blood cancer medicine Rituxan fell 8 percent to 1.7 billion francs, hurt in particular by a 44 percent drop in Europe as copies from rivals ate into its business that is no longer protected by patents. Avastin sales fell 2 percent to 1.6 billion francs, while Herceptin held its own, rising 2 percent to 1.8 billion francs.\nRoche Chief Executive Severin Schwan is counting on new medicines like Ocrevus to offset declines from his $21 billion per year trio of older drugs Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin. So far, his strategy appears to be succeeding, although sales erosion from rivals’ copies is accelerating.\nAnalysts could see immunotherapy Tecentriq as a first-quarter blemish, with revenue of 139 million francs lagging their 154 million poll estimate. The figure was up 29 percent over the period last year, but barely topped the 132 million francs of the fourth quarter in 2017.
