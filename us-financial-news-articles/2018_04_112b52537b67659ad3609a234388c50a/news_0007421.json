Vettel has 48. \nFerrari have won 230 races since 1950, McLaren 182, Williams 114, Mercedes 76 and Red Bull 55. Former champions McLaren and Williams have not won since 2012.

BAHRAIN \nVettel and McLaren’s Fernando Alonso have won three times in Bahrain, Hamilton twice. \nThis year’s race is the 14th edition.

The exceptions were Alonso for Ferrari in 2010 and Vettel in 2017. MILESTONE \nIn winning in Australia, Vettel became only the third driver to lead 3,000 laps in his career. The others are Schumacher and Hamilton. He also took his 100th podium. \nVettel is set to make his 200th start (from 201 races).
