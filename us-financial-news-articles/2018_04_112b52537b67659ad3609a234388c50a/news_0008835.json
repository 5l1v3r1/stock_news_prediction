(Nasdaq:TIL) (TSX.V:TIL) (the “ Company ” or “ Till ”), announces that the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSX.V”) has accepted the Company’s notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (“ NCIB ”).\nUnder the new NCIB, Till Capital intends to bid for up to 246,240 common shares, representing 10% of the 2,462,425 shares forming Till's public float. As at March 31, 2018, there were 3,290,884 shares of Till outstanding.\nThe board of directors of the Company believes that the current and recent market prices for the Company's common shares do not give full effect to their underlying value and that, accordingly, the purchase of common shares under the NCIB will increase the proportionate share interest of, and be advantageous to, all remaining shareholders. The Company also believes the NCIB purchases will provide increased liquidity to current shareholders who would like to sell their shares. Purchased shares will be returned to treasury and cancelled. The bid will commence no earlier than three trading days following receipt of approval of the TSXV and will terminate one year from such date, or such earlier time as the applicable bid is completed or at the option of the Company. Purchases subject to the bid will be carried out pursuant to open market transactions through the facilities of the “TSX.V” by Canaccord Genuity on behalf of Till.\nUnder a prior normal course issuer bid, which commenced on December 7, 2016 and expired on December 6, 2017, Till purchased 59,400 common shares through open market purchases, all of which have been returned to treasury.\nReported by:\nJohn T.
