PCCW Media also runs Viu, which is an over-the-top streaming service.\nThe company had previously emphasized Korean content due to its high popularity, but it's now intending to focus on local content within the region, Lee said.\n\"We're producing in Indian languages, in Indonesian Bahasa. This year, we're starting a Malaysian production of 'The Bridge,' trying to go deeper in each of the markets we operate in, as we believe we should be locally and market relevant,\" she said.\nLee added that companies could create an edge by looking into expanding their revenue stream through advertising.\nThe company's Viu service allows for free streaming with built-in advertisements. The company operates on a \"freemium\" model, and uses a dual revenue stream of advertising-supported and premium subscription services.\nOver-the-top streaming services in Asia Pacific has been successful so far with the industry expected to reach $10 billion and gain about 200 million subscribers by 2021.
