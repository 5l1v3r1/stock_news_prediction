District energy networks are among the most efficient, reliable, and cost-effective ways to provide energy security while reducing the carbon footprint. Within ENGIE, it is our conviction that district heating and cooling networks can be the backbone of more sustainable and resilient hospital campuses and cities.”\n“Axium is thrilled that our consortium has the opportunity to provide competitive and reliable energy services essential to the hospitals’ health and research mission,” said Thierry Vandal, President of Axium Infrastructure US. “This investment is a great addition to our existing North American portfolio of over 100 core energy, transportation, and social infrastructure assets. Axium continues to focus on developing relationships with high quality partners and counterparts, under long-term agreements providing for strong and predictable cash flows.”\nIn 2017, ENGIE and Axium were awarded a 50-year contract to operate and optimize The Ohio State University’s utility system for its flagship campus in Columbus, Ohio.
