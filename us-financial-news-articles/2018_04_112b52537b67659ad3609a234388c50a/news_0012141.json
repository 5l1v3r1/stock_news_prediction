It wouldn’t take much to make this a less dramatic issue,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.\nOptimism over first-quarter earnings increased, with JPMorgan Chase and other financials expected to kick off the reporting period next week.\n“We’re going into earnings season with a fair amount of optimism, largely driven by the new, lower tax rates and also driven by other bits of evidence the economy is doing very well,” Tuz said.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 263.96 points, or 1.09 percent, to 24,528.26, the S&P 500 gained 21.29 points, or 0.81 percent, to 2,665.98 and the Nasdaq Composite added 40.10 points, or 0.57 percent, to 7,082.20.\nEarnings forecasts have increased sharply since Congress approved sweeping changes to the U.S. tax law late last year.\nFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix - collectively known as the “FANG” group - were up between 0.5 percent and 3 percent.\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen “any meaningful impact” on usage or ad sales since the data privacy scandal.\nAmazon rose 3.2 percent after being repeatedly hammered this week by Trump’s attacks on the online retailer.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.57-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted five new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 29 new lows.
