(Proceeds of the sale went to help pay back Madoff’s victims.)\nRoth gut renovated the house with the help of interior architect and designer Thierry Despont. Less than a decade after purchasing it, the couple has put it on the market for $21 million, listing it with Corcoran brokers Gary DePersia and Joan Hegner.\nThe Property The house sits on 1.5 acres almost directly on the beach, accessed via a paved drive, with 180 feet of Atlantic frontage. In a 2013 article about the home’s renovation in Architectural Digest, Daryl Roth is Quote: d as saying that it’s “right on the sand.”\nThe ground floor has a big, lofted living room with views of the ocean (naturally), a large eat-in kitchen, and two bedrooms that currently share a bathroom. The second floor has a smaller footprint and is dedicated to the master bedroom, which has its own wooden deck, his and hers half-baths, and two walk-in closets.\nIn total, the house has three bedrooms and three bathrooms.\nThere’s also a gunite pool and a deck that spans the length of the house, which is accessible from every ground-floor room.\nDespont updated the layout and filled it with furniture and decorations that include a large chandelier by Jeff Zimmerman and a Vladamir Kagan rocking chair tucked into an glass-ringed alcove in the great room. The furnishings, the listing notes, “could be available separately.”\nThe Market In retrospect, the Roths’ purchase seems to have been timed perfectly, near the bottom of the market; Hamptons home prices have since skyrocketed. While 2016 was relatively sluggish and 2017 just marginally better, prices are still well above their 2010 low, according to a report by Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.\nThe average sales price of luxury homes in the area was $6.696 million, with 295 sales listed, the report says. In 2009, sales numbers were half that amount (158), and luxury sales averaged just $5.358 million.\nThe Roths are reportedly selling because they own two additional houses in East Hampton, N.Y.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T22:43:35.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
