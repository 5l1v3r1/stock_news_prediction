Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for fighting discrimination.\nWurst said her treatment for HIV, which is spread when infected fluid enters the bloodstream, was going well.\n“Since I received the diagnosis, I have been in medical treatment, and for many years without interruption I have been below the detection limit, which means I am unable to transmit the virus,” Wurst said on Instagram.\nMore than 70 million people globally have been infected with the HIV virus and 35 million have died since the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, according to the World Health Organisation.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:12:37.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
