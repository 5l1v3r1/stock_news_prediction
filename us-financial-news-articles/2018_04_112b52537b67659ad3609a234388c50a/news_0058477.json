On Sunday, Blue Origin — which has an ambitious plan to send tourists beyond the Earth as early as this year — is expected to launch its first rocket of 2018 on Sunday .\nIn an interview with the CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer , the billionaire was asked whether he considered space exploration more important than the online retail company he's built into a behemoth, or the venerable newspaper he acquired several years ago.\n\"Yes,\" Bezos replied. Sending humans to outer space \"is super important to me. I believe on the longest time frame — and really here I'm thinking of a time frame of a couple hundred years, so over many decades...that Blue Origin, the space company, is the most important work I'm doing.\"\nHe added that \"I'm pursuing this work because I believe if we don't, we will eventually end up with a civilization of stasis, which I find very demoralizing.\" Humans \"all enjoy a dynamic civilization of growth and change,\" and space travel is integral to that continuing, he said.\nBezos predicted that heavy industry will be moved to other planets, while Earth, he said, would be reserved for living and for light industry. He also told Business Insider that he grows increasingly convinced of the necessity for space exploration and development \"with every passing year.\"\nBlue Origin, which Bezos invests $1 billion in each year, is set to launch its New Shepherd rocket on Sunday morning from the company's facility near Van Horn, Texas. It will be the rocket's eight launch and its first flight of 2018.\nThe full interview can be found on Business Insider's website.\nshow chapters Blue Origin believes it can get tourists into space by the end of the year 4:25 PM ET Wed, 18 April 2018 | 04:54", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T23:18:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
