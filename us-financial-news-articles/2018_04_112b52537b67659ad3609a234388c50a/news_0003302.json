In January, he was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as one of 96 \"oligarchs\" close to President Vladimir Putin.\nHis Caspian Venture Capital fund has investments in ride-hailing service Uber; Diamond Foundry, a company that produces man-made diamonds; and Peek, an online leisure activities company.\nMagomedov is co-executive chairman of Los Angeles-based tech firm Virgin Hyperloop One chaired by Richard Branson, one of several firms developing a futuristic transport system that involves propelling people at high speed through sealed tubes. He also co-owns the Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port with Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft and transportation group Fesco.
