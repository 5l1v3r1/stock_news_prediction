The book is being published by Penguin Random House and will be released on June 5.\nGonzalez and Hogg were among the students instrumental in organizing the March for Our Lives rally for gun control last month that drew hundreds of thousands to the nation’s capital, along with sister marches in cities across the country. The funds will be used to help the high school’s community in the wake of the shooting, Hogg said on Twitter.\n“This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America–with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed,” the description reads. “With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve.”\nHogg, who is graduating this year, made headlines after he launched a boycott campaign against Fox News host Laura Ingraham when she discussed his college rejection letters on air, which resulted in several companies pulling their advertisements from her show. On Wednesday, Hogg called on Twitter for a boycott of investment management companies BlackRock Inc and The Vanguard Group, arguing that they are among the biggest investors in gun manufacturers.\nCorrection: The original version of this article said that Emma Gonzalez would write a forward to the book. Random House, the book’s publisher and source of that information, later realized it was an error. Fortune has updated this article to reflect the change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T09:17:47.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
