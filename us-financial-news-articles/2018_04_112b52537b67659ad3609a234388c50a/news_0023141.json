REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque “Never said when an attack on Syria would take place,” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nTrump had vowed to take swift and decisive action against Syria since reports of a suspected poison gas attack that killed dozens of people. Damascus has denied responsibility for the incident that has widened a rift between the West and Moscow, which backs Syria’s government.\nOn Wednesday, even though Trump had previously said he would not “broadcast” his moves in Syria, he said in a post on Twitter that missiles “will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’”\nHowever, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis struck a more cautious tone later on Wednesday, saying that Washington was still assessing intelligence on the suspected toxic gas attack.\nReporting by Michael Holden and Makini Brice; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and David Stamp\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
