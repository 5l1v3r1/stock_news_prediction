Building on the strong returns we delivered in 2017 and the performance of our investments made in the last 5 years, which have generated net realized and unrealized gains, we intend to maintain our investment strategy and disciplined approach to loan originations.\n“As an active provider of secured debt to the lower middle market, we continue to see attractive investment opportunities. We believe the prudent deployment of this additional capacity will enhance our portfolio diversity, lower our risk profile, and expand our capital market access options, while positioning us to further improve overall returns for the benefit of our shareholders. We believe this is a very positive development and look forward to detailing how we intend to implement this increased financing flexibility in the coming quarters.”\nAbout Gladstone Capital Corporation: Gladstone Capital Corporation is a publicly traded business development company that invests in debt and equity securities, consisting primarily of secured first and second lien term loans to lower middle market businesses in the United States.
