So called civil-military fusion has taken on increasing importance in the party’s plans for developing artificial intelligence, quantum communications and other advanced fields.\nThe internet and information technology is “the liveliest and most promising area for civil-military fusion,” Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.\nWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:40:38.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
