JP Morgan will manage the sale, Marfrig said. \nMarfrig’s management said the two transactions were running in parallel without making clear whether they would go ahead with the National Beef purchase if they failed to find a buyer for Keystone. \nRabobank will finance 100 percent of the National Beef acquisition, Marfrig said.
