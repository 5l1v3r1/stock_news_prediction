Trump has not confirmed when or if the attack will take place, stating in a tweet that it \"could be very soon or not so soon at all.\"\nThe chemical attack is the latest in an escalating and deadly war in Syria that has garnered global attention and worry.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on NBC's report.\nRead the full NBC report here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T22:13:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
