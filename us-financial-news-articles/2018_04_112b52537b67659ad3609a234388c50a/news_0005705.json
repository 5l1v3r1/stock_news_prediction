It feels like a Genuine Moment for women’s basketball, even if people who’ve been around women’s basketball will tell you: Yeah, dummy, our game is great, and it’s been great for a long time. Get with it.\nOK. But I just want to talk some more about The Shot. Because The Shot was incredible.\nArike Ogunbowale of the Fighting Irish. From three. For the game. For everything.\nSwish. Again.\nOh yeah, didn’t you know? Ogunbowale did the same thing in the semifinals a couple nights before, on Friday versus undefeated women’s college basketball Death Star Connecticut, knocking back a game-winner in overtime.\nIt was the shot of a lifetime—for 48 hours. Ogunbowale simply rolled it back once more for a championship.\n“To do that twice in one weekend, the biggest stage in college basketball, it’s crazy,” Ogunbowale said Sunday.\n“I was thinking, ‘Two nights in a row, I don’t know if this is going to happen again—the miracle,’” said Notre Dame’s coach, Muffet McGraw, who notched her 800th win with the title. “It is Easter Sunday, and all the Catholics out there were praying for us. We definitely needed it all.”\nMore by Jason Gay\nNotre Dame’s Shots Heard ‘Round the World April 2, 2018 Are You Ready for (Even More) Football? March 22, 2018 College Basketball Is Yuck. March Madness Is Delicious March 18, 2018 March Madness Is Here, and Warren Buffett Knows I’m an Idiot March 12, 2018 What Is This Bull…Pen Cart!? March 8, 2018 Let me be the 10,000th person to say this: Unless Villanova and Michigan produce some kind of quintuple overtime thriller for the ages, in which every player scores 75 points, and a herd of stray dogs run onto the court, the women’s Final Four totally eclipsed the men’s Final Four this year.\nDid you watch the men’s semis on Saturday? First Loyola-Chicago and Sister Jean ran out of miracles against Michigan, and then Nova steamrolled over Kansas in a blowout.\nIt was not close. It was not thrilling. Bedtime came early, for me and Sister Jean.\nMeanwhile, every game in the Women’s Final Four in Columbus was a classic. Both semifinals went to OT—Mississippi State-Louisville did, too. Notre Dame very nearly blew it versus UConn, letting the Huskies slip back in the waning seconds.\nBut they didn’t. Because they had Arike Ogunbowale, at the ready.\nShe practices this kind of shot, she told ESPN’s Holly Rowe Sunday night. OK but: everybody practices that type of shot, Arike! I practiced that shot my entire childhood, against imaginary defenders of all kinds. Who hasn’t done it? Three, two, one…W .\nBut it takes a special kind of player to pull off just one of those in real life. Two in two games is redonk. Yes, “redonk” is a word, because I say so.\nOgunbowale, who has a brother, Dare, who played college football at Wisconsin and is now trying to make it in the NFL, was having a pretty unmemorable night before The Shot. Until that moment, she’d missed 15 of the 20 shots she’d taken.\nBut that’s the thing about the great shooters, yes? They don’t let a few misses—or a bunch of them—deter them. If given the opportunity, they’ll take another. Call it a mixture of bravado and irrational confidence, but a great shooter is not skulking off the floor.\nArike Ogunbowale celebrates with her teammates. Photo: Andy Lyons/Getty Images It won Ogunbowale the admiration of another inveterate shooter, Kobe Bryant, who watched Ogunbowale hit the UConn dagger in person—then mercilessly urged her to “finish the job” on Sunday.\nMemories from this women’s Final Four will live on for a long time. It was another crusher of a loss for UConn, a dynasty for the ages that has now lost back-to-back stunners in the semis. It was a second straight finals loss for Mississippi State—and Bulldogs fans have a legit grumble about a late uncalled foul on Morgan William (who hit a buzzer beater to beat UConn herself last year). It was another brilliant moment in McGraw’s Hall of Fame coaching career, which now includes two national titles.\nIt was the kind of inspired basketball that people will talk about for a very long time.\nBut what I’ll remember is The Shot. Or really, The Shots. I think you will, too.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nArike Ogunbowale’s game-winning shot against Connecticut on Friday was a 2-point shot. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it was a 3-pointer.\nWrite to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T05:03:05.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
