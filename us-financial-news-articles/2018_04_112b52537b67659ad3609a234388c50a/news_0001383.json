REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage \nCui Tiankai made the comments ahead of what is expected to be the announcement this week of U.S. tariffs on $50 billion to $60 billion (£35.5 billion to £42.6 billion) in Chinese imports following an investigation under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act. \n“If they do, we will certainly take countermeasures of the same proportion, and the same scale, same intensity,” Cui said in an interview posted on the website of China Global Television Network (CGTN) and broadcast on state television on Tuesday. \nThe U.S. tariffs are expected to target products benefiting from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial development programme, although it may be more than two months before the import curbs take effect, U.S. officials have said.
