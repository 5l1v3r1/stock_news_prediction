It’s hard in that situation when everyone is having a good time,” she said, urging authorities to step up enforcement and issue warnings to revelers against sexual harassment.\nThe past year has been pivotal for women’s rights after accusations of sexual misconduct by Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein sparked the #MeToo campaign, with women taking to social media and the streets to highlight experiences of abuse.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
