The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nAccording to the indictment and a related lawsuit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed, Chen had obtained information about VistaPrint’s quarterly results from either a managerial accountant at the company or her husband. \nChen and his family socialized and went on vacations in Hawaii and Europe with the Vista employee’s family, who, like Chen, lived in Lexington, Massachusetts, the indictment said. \nChen and the VistaPrint employee’s husband in particular spoke frequently about investments in real estate and the stock market, the indictment said. It said the unnamed woman ceased to work for VistaPrint’s financial planning and analysis department in 2015. \nThe case is U.S. v. Chen, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-cr-10083. \nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Tom Brown and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T20:56:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
