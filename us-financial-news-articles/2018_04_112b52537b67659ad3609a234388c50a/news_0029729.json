She was focused, she was really with me,” Werth said of her 13-year-old mare.\n“It was one of her best freestyle, if not the best.”\nWorld number one Werth, who had won four of nine events going into the World Cup dressage final, made uncharacteristic mistakes in Friday’s Grand Prix as she was beaten by Graves, but there was no repeat of those in Saturday’s decisive Grand Prix Freestyle.\n“A lot of people think it is easy to win but you have to listen to the horse. Yesterday was not our day but today we improved. It was a great show,” said Werth, the most decorated dressage rider in the event’s history.\nA bouncy piaffe, near-perfect tempo changes and a lot of power made the difference and six of the seven judges put her first.\nThe event is part of a joint-final with the World Cup jumping final, which will be held on Sunday.\nReporting by Julien Pretot,; Editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T19:56:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
