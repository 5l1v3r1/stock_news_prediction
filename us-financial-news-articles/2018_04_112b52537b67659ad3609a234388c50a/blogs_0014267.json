It's hard for a stock to outrun the gravity of its sector; not an impossibility, but low probability. \nThere are signs that no tech stock is safe even if it isn't mired in a privacy scandal. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that big hedge funds are taking money out of tech, and \"FANG\" stocks in particular are being sold by big fund managers , according to Reuters. Getty Images A protester with the group 'Raging Grannies' holds a sign during a demonstration outside of Facebook headquarters on April 5, 2018 in Menlo Park, California. \nFacebook and Amazon are part of the \"FANG\" (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix , and Google-now- Alphabet ) stocks, the super-popular, widely held winners of the last few years and the stocks that fueled the market rally earlier this year. These companies are also part of the broader cohort of tech stocks that have outperformed, such as Salesforce.com , Adobe , and others. \nThe thing is, the tech sector's run of outperformance means the companies also will trade alike when they go down. If one is having an up quarter or year, most likely they all are, and vice versa. It makes individual stock selection less relevant and reinforces the notion that most of a stock's performance is correlated with its sector. So, if you're taking a profit on Facebook shares, what's the point of putting the proceeds into another tech stock that also rose a lot? \nSure, you could not have known that the day you moved your money from Facebook to Amazon the president of the United States would decide to ignite a Twitter war against Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, but that's not the point. You might as well hold onto the Facebook stock or shift the proceeds into a different sector. show chapters 5 Hours Ago | 01:15 \nInvestors in the Facebook or Amazon crosshairs need to start with one question: do you own a particular stock for the very long term? If the answer is yes, then you can stop reading now. You've accepted the ups and downs that come along with being a long-term investor. Time horizon is one out of three critical objectives to take into account when developing one's overall investor profile; risk tolerance and financial goals are the other two objectives. \nMy holding period for individual stocks is typically two to five years, sometimes more and sometimes less â€” and some positions I've been holding in clients' portfolios for over a decade. But as a rule, the single-biggest mistake I see investors make is improper diversification. It's the biggest mistake because it's the cause of substantial, permanent portfolio losses. \nIn the Facebook/Amazon example, you can argue these two stocks are in different sectors, social media and consumer discretion, respectively, but they are both viewed as tech stocks and are both widely held, as can be seen by their disproportionate representation in nearly every large cap stock index, ETF, and mutual fund. By one count, there are more than 100 ETFs with Facebook among their top holdings and more than 230 ETFs with exposure to Facebook. There are roughly the same total number of ETFs with exposure to Amazon. \nTop 10 U.S. sector ETFs by performance year-to-date Sector", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T23:48:13.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
