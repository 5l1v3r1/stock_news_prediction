Those are two paths,\" Coffee said.\nLyft said in December its latest round of funding brought its valuation to $11.5 billion. Uber's latest valuation has been pegged at more than $70 billion.\nUber and Lyft did not respond to requests for comment on the Spotify listing.\nMarket comfort Loss-making Spotify, which has prioritized rapid growth over profit and whose closest rival is Apple's Apple Music, launched in 2008 and had 71 million subscribers at the end of 2017.\nRun by co-founder Daniel Ek, Spotify was valued at around $20 billion based on private stock transactions in February, according to its filing for the listing.\nCitadel Securities will act as the designated market maker for Spotify's shares, a source familiar with the listing said, and set the opening price on Tuesday.\nSpotify has hired Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , and Allen & Co. as financial advisers but they will not have an underwriting role.\n\"This approach will save the company money, but will probably lead to volatility when the stock starts trading, as the market tries to find a price it's comfortable with,\" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note.\nOne equity capital markets banker at a major firm, which was not on the direct listing, said their syndicate desk had been instructed to ask investors for feedback following the Spotify listing.\nSyndicate desks market, price and distribute stock offerings.\nThe purpose will be to give the bank color to take into pitch meetings with prospective clients if the direct listing is considered a success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T14:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T13:21:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
