Investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading.\n* Financials on the TSX fell 0.4 percent, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 0.8 percent.\n* Crop nutrient producer Nutrien Ltd retreated 1.6 percent to C$57.70.\n* Six of the TSX’s 10 main groups ended lower. The index posted two new 52-week highs and 15 new lows.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Element Fleet Management Corp, which rose 4.3 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Life Sciences, down 6.9 percent.\n* Weed stocks were among the most active Canadian stocks by volume, including Aurora Cannabis, which fell 5.6 percent to $7.62.
