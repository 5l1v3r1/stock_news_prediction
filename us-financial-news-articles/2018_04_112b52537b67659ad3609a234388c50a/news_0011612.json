Microsoft — which could have decided the extent of American jurisdiction over foreign servers — is now, for all intents and purposes, dead. On March 30th, the Department of Justice moved to drop the lawsuit as moot, and today, Microsoft filed to agree with the motion . While the Supreme Court has yet to officially drop the case, it's a foregone conclusion that they will.\nBoth the government and Microsoft agree that the newly passed CLOUD Act renders the lawsuit meaningless. In US v. Microsoft , federal law enforcement clashed with Microsoft over the validity of a Stored Communications Act warrant for data stored on a server in Dublin. The CLOUD Act creates clear new procedures for procuring legal orders for data in these kinds of cross-border situations. In last week's motion to vacate, DOJ disclosed that it had procured a new warrant under the CLOUD Act.\nAlthough the new law is not without controversy , Microsoft supported the CLOUD Act while it was still a bill and again took the opportunity praise it in its Supreme Court filing, calling it a \" nuanced legislative scheme that creates a modern legal framework for law-enforcement access to data across borders. \"\nRead more from The Verge: \nMajor blockchain group says Europe should exempt Bitcoin from new data privacy rule \nWhy AI isn't going to solve Facebook's fake news problem \nMophie's new $60 charger fixes some problems from the original, but it is still too expensive", "external_links": ["https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-2/41851/20180330172237829_17-2motUnitedStates.pdf", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17131004/cloud-act-congress-omnibus-passed-mlat", "https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-2/42149/20180403145952967_180401", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17202886/facebook-fake-news-moderation-ai-challenges", "https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/5/17203116/wireless-charge-mophie-stream-pad-plus-apple-iphone-qi", "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/5/17199210/blockchain-coin-center-gdpr-europe-bitcoin-data-privacy"], "published": "2018-04-06T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T00:44:59.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
