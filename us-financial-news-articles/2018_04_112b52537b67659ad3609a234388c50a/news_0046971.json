The GWEC expects the market to be flat this year but start growing again from 2019.\n“The annual market will return to growth in 2019 and 2020, breaching the 60 GW barrier once again and continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, in the beginning of the new decade,” the GWEC said in its report.\n“We expect to see total cumulative installations reach 840 GW by the end of 2022,” it added.\nWind power has become more competitive over the past few years, with a move from government subsidies to auctions which has brought costs down further.\n“Overall, offshore prices for projects to be completed in the next five years or so are half of what they were for the last five years and this trend is likely to continue,” the report said.\nChina continues to be the biggest wind market in the world, adding nearly 19.7 GW of new capacity in 2017, though this was 15.9 percent lower than the previous year.\nThe pace of China’s wind development is gradually slowing down and growth is expected to be flat to 2020.\nIndia experienced record wind installations last year, adding over 4 GW, but GWEC expects this to slow this year due to a transition period between old market incentives and moving towards an auction-based system, the GWEC said.\nThe European Union also had a record year in 2017 with 15.6 GW added. The bloc is expected to install around 76 GW of new wind power by the end of 2022, reaching a cumulative total of 254 GW.\nThe United States added 7 GW of new wind capacity last year. Despite attempts to change the structure of tax credits last year, the provisions remained intact and continue to support the industry.
