We are experiencing it day in and day out,” he said.\nAs saltwater destroys fields and water supplies, “it’s becoming far harder for us to live in certain parts of the country than ever before”.\nSuch creeping losses don’t attract the international attention that powerful cyclones do, but “the frequency of these events adds up, and it really takes a toll on the country”, he said.\nDespite that, “there’s no way we’re going to migrate and leave the country”, he said. Instead, the country aims to put pressure on bigger nations to cut their emissions and, at home, “to adapt and adjust, to build a community far more resilient than before”.\nGOING GREEN So far the Marshall Islands government is promoting water harvesting, trying out new roof designs aimed at capturing and channeling rain, and experimenting with solar-powered desalination, among other efforts.\nBut the biggest push is to reduce the islands’ own emissions, particularly from diesel-fueled generators that still provide much of the country’s electricity.\nHome solar power systems are already in widespread use in some remote atolls, and the country is developing a step-by-step plan to install solar power more widely and become carbon neutral by 2050.\nThat will happen largely by cutting fossil fuel use from electricity production and transport, and burning trash to produce electricity, Paul said.\nThe plan, expected to be in place by the end of the year, would be a first for an island nation, said the minister, who formerly managed the country’s utilities and now also serves as minister-in-assistance, standing in as needed for President Hilda Heine.\n“We absolutely believe we can” become carbon neutral by mid-century, he said.\nBut finding funding to make the switch remains a frustration, not least because the Marshall Islands – like many small island nations – lacks the bureaucratic muscle to make complex funding applications, and because it needs smaller sums which big donors trying to move billions can find challenging.\nWorking through the World Bank, the country received a first grant from the Green Climate Fund (GCF) – the main channel for billions of dollars in climate finance – to build a protective sea wall on Kwajalein Atoll, which is also home to a U.S. military garrison.\nBut getting successful applications together to shift the country’s energy systems has proved harder, Paul said.\n“There’s a level of frustration we feel. We know what we need and what needs to be done. We just don’t have the resources,” he said.\nGlobally, however, Paul has no doubt a shift to clean energy is coming.\nSolar and wind power are now cheaper than fossil fuel energy in many parts of the world, and set to get cheaper still, with fast-improving batteries poised to solve the problem of storing renewable energy, he said.\nInvestors and businesses will turn to clean energy “because it makes sense. They will change not to clean the atmosphere but because they want to make money and make their shareholders happy”, he said.\nBut making that happen fast enough to keep the Marshall Islands above water may require financial institutions, governments or other entities stepping in to absorb some of the early risks investors face in switching to clean energy, he said.\nThat could include things like guaranteeing set rates to buy clean power, setting national policies that prioritize buying renewable energy, simplifying permits or offering public loans or tax credits for clean energy investment.\n“There’s so much (investment) money that’s sitting idle. People don’t know what to do with it,” Paul said. If some of the risk is removed, clean energy investment “could really exponentially take off”.\nReporting by Laurie Goering @lauriegoering ; editing by Alex Whiting: Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, climate change, resilience, women's rights, trafficking and property rights.
