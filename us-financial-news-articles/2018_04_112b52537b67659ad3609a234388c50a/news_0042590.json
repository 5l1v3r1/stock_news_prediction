Yields are up 10 basis points in just two days, the sharpest move since early February.\nIn currency markets, the main mover was sterling which dived late on Thursday when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cooled expectations for an interest rate hike in May, pointing out there were “other meetings” this year.\nSterling dropped more than a cent to $1.4078, leaving the week’s peak of $1.4373 a distant memory.\nThe sudden retreat in sterling helped support the U.S. dollar more broadly and the dollar index was steady at 89.956.\nThe euro also eased back a touch to $1.2341, while the dollar inched up on the yen to 107.62 and looked set to test the recent top at 107.78.\nOn the radar later in the day will be IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington where free trade and protectionism is certain to be high on the agenda along with Sino-U.S. tensions.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:23:52.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
