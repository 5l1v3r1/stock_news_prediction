As we previously indicated, our wallboard volumes were impacted by the timing of our U.S. wallboard price increase and the frequent storms that affected many regions of the country. However, we are encouraged to see shipping volumes increase over the last six weeks, as our Sheetrock ® brand and industry leading technology continue to be preferred by contractors,” said Jennifer Scanlon, president and chief executive officer of USG Corporation. “This reinforces our confidence in our strategy, which includes organic growth from our logical portfolio of products. Our relentless focus on serving our customers, lowering our cost position and expanding our margins will continue to guide us through the rest of the year. We remain confident in our 2018 outlook for all of our segments and continue to believe that 2019 will be the breakout profit year of our strategy.”\nMs. Scanlon continued, “We undertook significant actions over the last two years which completely transformed our company and laid the foundation for continued improvements in our cost position, profitability, capital structure and portfolio. This is an exciting time for USG because, now, as a pure manufacturer, we have the opportunity and available capital to focus on growth and shareholder value creation with a balance sheet that supports our plan.”\nConsolidated First-Quarter Results\nFirst quarter net sales were $786 million on a consolidated basis, compared to $767 million in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net sales were $796 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $767 million in the first quarter of 2017. Operating profit decreased to $46 million from $84 million, while adjusted operating profit decreased to $68 million from $97 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The lower operating profit in the first quarter of 2018 was driven primarily by lower volumes in our U.S. Wallboard & Surfaces segment, resulting from the timing of pre-buy and adverse weather conditions, higher labor costs due to retained staffing levels with lower Q1 wallboard volumes in advance of expected increase in demand through the remainder of 2018, and investments across all our business to drive future growth. A full reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted metrics is provided in the attached schedule.\nUSG recorded $37 million in net income, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $55 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis, net income of $46 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 decreased from $55 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company remains on track with Advanced Manufacturing, which delivered $4 million of incremental EBITDA this quarter. The program is expected to deliver incremental $25 million of EBITDA in 2018. In addition, the Company deployed strategic capital to lower its cost position and to fuel future growth. Its 2018 SG&A target has not changed.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, USG repurchased 1.8 million shares of its common stock for approximately $62 million. Since the program began in 2017 through the first quarter of 2018, the Company has repurchased $246 million USG shares of up to $500 million approved by the Board.\nU.S. Wallboard & Surfaces\nThe U.S. Wallboard & Surfaces segment generated $49 million of operating profit in the first quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $51 million decreased by $28 million over the first quarter of 2017. Wallboard price increased 9% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1% from the first quarter of 2017, due primarily to a January 2018 price increase. As noted above, the first quarter 2018 results were affected by wallboard volumes decreasing by approximately 12%. Additionally, wallboard costs were $14 million higher than the prior year as we retained staffing levels, incurred costs to start-up a lower-cost line and saw modest input cost inflation.\nU.S. Performance Materials\nThe U.S. Performance Materials segment net sales increased by $6 million and adjusted net sales increased by $7 million year over year due to a higher average realized selling price. The segment generated $1 million of operating profit in the first quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $1 million in the U.S. Performance Materials segment declined by $5 million over the first quarter of 2017 due to investments to increase capacity, lower the cost position and accelerate the adoption of new products. These investments are necessary to meet the Company’s 2020 financial targets for this segment.\nU.S. Ceilings\nThe U.S. Ceilings segment generated $19 million of operating profit in the first quarter of 2018. On an adjusted basis, operating profit of $23 million increased by $3 million from the first quarter of 2017 due to improved pricing and volumes across tile and grid products, and an incremental $2 million from the Specialty product category.\nUSG Boral\nThe USG Boral business generated $9 million of equity income in the first quarter of 2018. Equity income decreased $4 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. USG Boral recorded a 4% increase in net sales compared to the first quarter of 2017, although higher input costs resulted in a decrease in equity income.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Conference Call and Presentation\nA conference call is being held today at 9:00 a.m. ET (8:00 a.m. CT) during which USG senior management will discuss the Company’s operating results.

In particular, the company presents the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted net sales, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net income, adjusted selling and administrative expenses, EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per diluted share, which exclude certain items. The non-GAAP financial measures are included as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP because management believes these non-GAAP financial measures help investors’ ability to analyze underlying trends in the company’s business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in its industry and provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core operating results. Adjusted operating profit on a consolidated basis includes the equity method income from USG Boral and USG’s income from other equity investments because management views USG Boral and its other equity investments as important businesses. In addition, the company uses adjusted operating profit and adjusted net income as components in the measurement of incentive compensation. The non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results and may vary from others in the industry. For further information related to the company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measures, see the schedules attached hereto.\nThis press release contains within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 related to management’s expectations about future conditions, including but not limited to, profitable growth and increased shareholder value over the mid-term, advanced manufacturing returns, achievement of our 2020 financial targets, organic growth from our products, improvements in our cost position, margins, profitability, capital structure and portfolio, 2018 outlook and 2019 profitability, increased demand through the remainder of 2018 and 2018 SG&A target.
