REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nMonex, Japan’s No.3 online brokerage by customer accounts, said in a statement it would execute the deal on April 16. Coincheck’s CEO and COO will resign from the board of directors and become the company’s executive directors. \nToshihiko Katsuya, Monex’s managing director and senior executive officer, will become president and representative director of Coincheck. \nThe companies will hold a news conference at 4 pm local time (0700 GMT). \nThe deal will allow Monex to access Coincheck’s trading platform and customer base. Monex said Coincheck generated net income of 471 million yen ($4.4 million) for the year ended in March. \nMonex shares surged by 20 percent, the maximum allowed under Tokyo Stock Exchange rules, while the benchmark Nikkei average .N225 was flat. Its shares have risen 40 percent since Monex said it was considering the deal. \nThe deal bring another mainstream financial services operator into the frontier cryptocurrency trading market in Japan. \nLarger rival SBI Holdings Inc ( 8473.T ) last year obtained a licence to run a cryptocurrency exchange, but in February postponed plans to do so as it sought to bolster the security of its exchange. \nCoincheck was hit by a daring $530 million (£378.5 million) theft of digital money earlier this year, prompting penalties from Japan’s financial regulators for lax security protocols.
