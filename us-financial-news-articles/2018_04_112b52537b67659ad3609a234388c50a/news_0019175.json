After a highly competitive creative, media and PR review, the brand selected the following agencies: San Francisco-based FCB West (creative), Minneapolis-based Fallon (media) and the Los Angeles team of Citizen Relations (communications/PR). All three agencies will work with the brand team on the strategic development and execution of a fully-integrated marketing campaign set to launch this summer.\nSeeking agency partners to help take Hotwire into its next phase of growth within the fast-moving travel industry, Hotwire's agency review started late last year with many of the most admired agencies participating. The final selection ended in early March, and agency partners were notified of the win this past week.\n\"This is going to be an exciting year for the brand, and we've found a team of creative partners that not only share in our vision but in our passion for the product and what it means to our customers,\" said Melissa Postier, Director Brand, PR and Social for Hotwire.\nEach of the three agencies will focus on specific areas of the new campaign with a shared interest in the overall vision, voice and disruption the brand is looking to bring this year. FCB West will be responsible for the brand's strategy and creative development while Fallon will oversee and manage the brand's paid media efforts across multiple channels. Citizen will develop and deploy the creative communications strategies and integrated messaging across the brand's media, consumer and influencer targets.\nHotwire has been one of the leading discount travel sites for nearly two decades, serving tens of millions of customers with some of the hottest deals in hotel rooms, rental cars, flight tickets and vacation packages.
