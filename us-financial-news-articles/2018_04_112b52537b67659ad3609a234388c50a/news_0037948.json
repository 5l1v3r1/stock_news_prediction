There a number of outstanding issues on which we await further responses from Facebook,” a spokesperson for the regulator told CNBC in an email Wednesday. \n“In particular, the Irish DPC is querying the technology around facial recognition and whether Facebook needs to scan all faces (i.e. those without consent as well) to use the facial recognition technology. The issue of compliance of this feature with GDPR is therefore not settled at this point.” \nFacebook says its technology can help protect your privacy by allowing it to detect when another person is using your image as their profile picture. It can also recognize other faces and suggest friends you might want to tag in photos or videos. \nBut the Irish DPC is worried that for Facebook to do this, it would need to scan a plethora of images, which could include pictures of people who have not consented to use this feature. \nFacial recognition has landed the social media giant in hot water. A U.S. district judge in a San Francisco federal court ruled earlier this week that Facebook must face a class action lawsuit that alleges it unlawfully used the facial recognition technology on images without permission from users.
