Stocks in China and Taiwan, which started higher, were also lower. \nJapan’s Nikkei Stock Average rose as much as 1.2% in early trade, with a weakened yen helping boost Japanese stock prices, but that was cut in half in early-afternoon action. \nChina’s trade balance swung to a deficit of $4.98 billion in March from a $33.7 billion surplus in the previous month. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a surplus of $19.6 billion. \nStandard Chartered economist Shuang Ding attributed the deficit to seasonal factors after the Lunar New Year holiday in February, and expected the nation’s return to a surplus in April and for the rest of the year. \nThe economic data came after gains in U.S. and European equities overnight as President \nDonald Trump’s \nmore conciliatory tone on Syria eased geopolitical tensions. \n“Investors tend to react very violently to both good news and bad news,” said \nJane Fu, \na sales trader at CMC Markets. “Any other news that comes up, be it geopolitical or economic, may potentially trigger another round of volatility.” \nAustralia, South Korea and Singapore all held on to their gains of about 0.5%. \nSingapore’s central bank tightened monetary policy for the first time in six years and first-quarter economic growth was stronger than projected. \nSome investors were moving into stocks seen as more-defensive plays on Friday, said \nAlvin Cheung,", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T11:36:00.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
