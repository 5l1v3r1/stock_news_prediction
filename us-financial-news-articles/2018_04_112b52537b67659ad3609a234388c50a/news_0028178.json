And that’s not a policy statement,” Comey said.\n“He is morally unfit to be president,” he added.\nComey has a tell-all book, “A Higher Loyalty,” due out on Tuesday.\nThe book’s imminent release - and the slated ABC News interview - prompted Trump to hurl a new set of insults at Comey earlier on Sunday, challenging accusations made in the book, and insisting that he never pressed Comey to be loyal to him.\n“Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!” Trump wrote early on Sunday in one of five Twitter posts aimed directly at Comey.\nReuters and other news outlets have obtained copies of Comey’s book before its formal release. In it, Comey wrote that Trump, in a private meeting, pressed the then-FBI director for his loyalty.\nComey told ABC News that the title of the book came from that “bizarre conversation” he had with Trump at the White House in January 2017, shortly after his inauguration.\nFILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Russia's alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo “He asked for my loyalty personally as the F.B.I. director. My loyalty’s supposed to be to the American people and to the institution,” Comey said in the interview.\nThe FBI has long tried to operate as an independent law enforcement agency.\n“I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies,” Trump said on Twitter.\nComey is now a crucial witness for Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump has tried to obstruct the Russia probe.\nComey told ABC News that he believes there is “certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice.”\nComey also defended his decision to publicly disclose the FBI’s re-opening of its investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s handling of email when she was secretary of state.\nThe Clinton probe was already public, Comey said, whereas the FBI’s examination of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia was in its early stages. It did not become publicly known until after the 2016 presidential election.\nDespite his myriad of reservations about Trump, Comey told ABC News that he did not believe the U.S. Congress should impeach him, as it would let the American people “off the hook” for something “they’re duty bound to do directly.”\n“People in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values,” he said.\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday morning, expressed qualified support for Comey. Asked whether Comey was a man of integrity, the Republican speaker said: “As far as I know,” but added that he did not know him well.\nAsked about Trump’s use last week of the words “slime ball” to describe Comey, Ryan said: “I don’t use words like that.”\nA copy of former FBI director James Comey's book \"A Higher Loyalty\" is seen in New York City, New York, U.S. April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Soren Larson Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the ABC interview reaffirms that Comey’s “higher loyalty is to himself.”\n“He has no credibility and President Trump was right to follow through on the bipartisan calls for him to be fired,” McDaniel said in a statement.\nReporting by Amanda Becker and Sarah Lynch; Additional reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T06:25:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
