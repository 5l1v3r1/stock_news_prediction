Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan waves goodbye after a meeting about Qatar crisis at the Elysee Place in Paris, France, June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes \nThe two leaders agreed in a telephone call that members of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council “can and should do more to increase coordination with each other and with the United States,” the White House said in a statement. \nThe UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar last June, accusing it of supporting terrorism and their arch-rival Iran. Doha has denied the charges and has said the countries aim to curtail its sovereignty. \nThe dispute pits key U.S. allies against each other and has complicated efforts to maintain a united front against Iran. \nEarlier this week, U.S. officials said the Trump administration was postponing until September a summit with Gulf Arab leaders that had been planned for May. A crowded diplomatic calendar and lack of progress in negotiations to end the dispute were cited as reasons by officials. \nTrump last month met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who was on multi-week tour through the United States, and is scheduled to meet with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani April 10.
