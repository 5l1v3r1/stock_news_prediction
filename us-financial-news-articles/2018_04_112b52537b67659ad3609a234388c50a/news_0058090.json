Global macros are also worrisome,” said Siddharth Sedani, vice president - head equity advisory at Anand Rathi.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield set a fresh four-year high of 3.035 percent on Wednesday, driven by worries about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices. But, robust corporate earnings helped quell concerns and Asian shares gained.\nSoftware services exporter Wipro Ltd was among the biggest drags on the NSE index after its fourth-quarter profit missed estimates and guidance for the first quarter failed to please investors. Shares fell as much as 4.6 percent, their biggest fall since Sept. 14.\nAxis Bank fell 1.2 percent as analysts expected the bank to report a fall in profit, while Yes Bank was marginally higher at 0.3 percent amid expectations of higher profit.\nShares of Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services rose over 5 percent to a record high after profit surged in the fourth quarter.
