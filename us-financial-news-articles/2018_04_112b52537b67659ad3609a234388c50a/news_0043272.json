North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump have agreed to meet sometime in May or June.\nTrump Korea Tweet\nThe announcements came days before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in in a border truce village for a rare summit aimed at resolving the nuclear standoff with Pyongyang.\nA separate meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump is anticipated in May or June.\nThe North's decisions were made in a meeting of the ruling party's full Central Committee which had convened to discuss a \"new stage\" of policies.\nThe Korean Workers' Party's Central Committee declared it a \"great victory\" in the country's official \"byungjin\" policy line of simultaneously pursuing economic and nuclear development.\nThe committee unanimously adopted a resolution that called for concentrating national efforts to achieve a strong socialist economy and \"groundbreaking improvements in people's lives.\"\n\"To secure transparency on the suspension of nuclear tests, we will close the republic's northern nuclear test site,\" the party's resolution said.\nThe agency Quote: : d Kim as saying during the meeting: \"Nuclear development has proceeded scientifically and in due order and the development of the delivery strike means also proceeded scientifically and verified the completion of nuclear weapons.\n\"We no longer need any nuclear test or test launches of intermediate and intercontinental range ballistic missiles and because of this the northern nuclear test site has finished its mission.\"\nNorth Korea's abrupt diplomatic outreach in recent months came after a flurry of weapons tests, including the underground detonation of a possible thermonuclear warhead and three launches of developmental intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland.\nSome analysts see Kim as entering the upcoming negotiations from a position of strength after having declared his nuclear force as complete in November. South Korean and U.S. officials have said Kim is likely trying to save his broken economy from heavy sanctions.\nSeoul says Kim has expressed genuine interest in dealing away his nuclear weapons. But North Korea for decades has been pushing a concept of \"denuclearization\" that bears no resemblance to the American definition, vowing to pursue nuclear development unless Washington removes its troops from the peninsula.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T02:12:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
