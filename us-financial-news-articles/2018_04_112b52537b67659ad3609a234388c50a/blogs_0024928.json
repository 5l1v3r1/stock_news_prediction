Investors expect Lula to continue to exert influence over an election that is now without an obvious front-runner. \"With all that uncertainty, it is natural that local markets demand a higher risk premium,\" said a manager at a Rio de Janeiro-based brokerage. The benchmark Bovespa stock index fell 1.78 percent, the only decliner among Latin America's main equity indexes, which were mostly range-bound. In Mexico, the IPC index rose 0.28 percent, following movements in the United States. Mexico's peso depreciated 0.3 percent as the government said it would review all its cooperation with the United States, in a sign of President Enrique Pena Nieto's increasing frustration with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump's treatment of Mexico. \nKey Latin American stock indexes at 2130 GMT: \nStock indexes Latest Daily YTD pct pct change \nchange \nMSCI Emerging Markets 1,163.07 0.09 0.4 MSCI LatAm 2,998.85 -0.99 6.04 Brazil Bovespa 83,307.23 -1.78 9.04 Mexico IPC 48,058.96 0.28 -2.62 Chile IPSA 5,632.71 0.89 1.22 Chile IGPA 28,012.69 0.14 0.11 Argentina MerVal 31,844.43 0.33 5.92 Colombia IGBC 11,959.03 0.67 5.17 Venezuela IBC 6,433.71 7.03 409.34 \n(Reporting by Bruno Federowski and Christine Murray Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T08:25:39.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
