The 200 mph club is a small pool but the kind of club you want to be included in if you're a real car enthusiast. Hitting that speed might seem like a small feat these days, but there are under 50 cars in the world that can push this high-speed limit and push it well.\nOn an upcoming episode of \" Jay Leno's Garage ,\" Jay visits General Motors ' Milford Proving Ground in Michigan, the first proving ground in the U.S. and the world. Created by Albert Sloan in 1924, the grounds were a place to test cars in controlled conditions without the worry of oncoming traffic. Now, with technological advances, cars are becoming extremely fast, and this proving ground is a great place to test your need for speed.\nIn this particular episode, Jay is introduced to the nearly $120,000 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1, which is camouflaged in a black and white pattern, hiding the car's exact details until its release date. Not only is Jay one of the first people to drive this modern-day rocket on wheels; he's about to become the first person to ever take it over 200 mph.\nWatch Jay take this Vette where it's never been before on an all-new \" Jay Leno's Garage \" Thursday, May 3, at 10 p.m. ET/PT!
