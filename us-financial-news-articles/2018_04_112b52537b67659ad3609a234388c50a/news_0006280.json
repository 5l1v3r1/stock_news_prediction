Except for close relatives, and of course the family jewellers, no one knew about its existence,” Sotheby’s said.\nThe stone will appear in Sotheby’s Geneva Jewellery sale on 15 May.\nReporting by Olive Enokido-Lineham; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T14:03:01.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
