Cambridge Analytica managed to obtain data on 2.7 million Europeans, which is why it is such a huge issue in the region.\nFacebook and Cambridge Analytica are facing investigations from a number of data protection watchdogs across the EU. \nZuckerberg has already been asked to travel to Europe to testify by Antonio Tajani, the president of the European Parliament. He has continued pressing the Facebook CEO.\nTWEET \nFacebook was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nIndividual countries in Europe have also requested the presence of Zuckerberg including the U.K. Facebook said it would not send its leader, but instead send one of his deputies . \nThe EU is trying to clamp down on rogue data practices and on Thursday announced a social media working group to investigate other firms that may have misused user data. \nA major new piece of legislation known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is also set to come into force on May 25 in the EU, and it will impose stricter data protection rules on companies such as Facebook and Google .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T13:33:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
