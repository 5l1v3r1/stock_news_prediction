REUTERS/Amir Levy/File Photo \nThe powerful young prince who is behind modernising reforms in Saudi Arabia is on a three-day trip to France at a time when relations between the two countries have become more complicated, including over how to address Iran’s regional role. \nHe is not expected to sign mega contracts in France as he did during visits to the United States and Britain over the last month. \n“It has been decided to keep working on defining Franco-Saudi entrepreneurial projects before envisaging a high-level visit,” the Matignon source said. \nPrince Mohammed, 32, and President Emmanuel Macron both paint themselves as champions of their nations’ plugged-in youths with a modernising message that has resonated strongly with younger Saudis and French citizens. \nPrince Mohammed’s decision to skip a visit to Station F, Europe’s largest startup incubator founded by billionaire Xavier Neil, is likely to disappoint Macron, especially after the crown prince met with technology titans in Silicon Valley last week. \nStation F is headed by an Iranian-American, Roxanne Varza, who previously worked at TechCrunch France and Microsoft Ventures. \nThe prince, who is also defence minister, is due to meet the French foreign and defence ministers later today and attend an event at the Institute of the Arab World this evening.
