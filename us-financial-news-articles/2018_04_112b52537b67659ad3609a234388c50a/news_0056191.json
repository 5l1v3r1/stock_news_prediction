The offer is made upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the offer to purchase and in the related letter of transmittal. The closing price of Whirlpool's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 25, 2018, the last full trading day before the commencement of the tender offer, was $155.48 per share. The tender offer is scheduled to expire at one minute after 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on May 23, 2018, unless the offer is extended.\nWhirlpool's decision to commence the tender offer is based on its confidence in the long-term outlook for the business, enhanced by the recently-announced pending sale of the Embraco compressor business, and is consistent with Whirlpool's balanced approach to capital allocation. Whirlpool believes that the tender offer represents an efficient mechanism to provide the Company's stockholders with the opportunity to tender all or a portion of their stock and thereby receive a return of some or all of their investment in the Company if they so elect. The tender offer provides stockholders with an opportunity to obtain liquidity with respect to all or a portion of their stock without the potential disruption to the stock price of the Company.\nSubsequent to the completion of the tender offer, the Company intends to opportunistically execute open market share repurchases throughout the remainder of 2018. Share repurchases had previously been suspended since the end of 2017 pending the completion of the Embraco sale process and related negotiations.\nThe tender offer is not contingent upon obtaining any financing. However, the tender offer is subject to a number of other terms and conditions, which are described in detail in the offer to purchase. Specific instructions and a complete explanation of the terms and conditions of the tender offer will be contained in the offer to purchase, the letter of transmittal and the related materials, which will be mailed to stockholders of record shortly after commencement of the tender offer.\nNone of the Company, the members of its Board of Directors, the dealer managers, the information agent or the depositary makes any recommendation as to whether any stockholder should participate or refrain from participating in the tender offer or as to the price or prices at which stockholders may choose to tender their shares in the tender offer.\nD.F. King & Co., Inc. will serve as information agent for the tender offer. Stockholders with questions, or who would like to receive additional copies of the tender offer documents may call D.F. King & Co., Inc. at (800) 269-5550 (toll free) or email WHR@dfking.com . The dealer managers for the tender offer will be Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and J.P.
