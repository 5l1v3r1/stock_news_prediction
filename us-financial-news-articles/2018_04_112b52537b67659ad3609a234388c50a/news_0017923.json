While Walmart added more holiday merchandise like electronics, toys and gifts, it did not stock enough everyday items, which hurt sales.\nShannon Stapleton | Reuters A man enters a Dollar Tree discount store in Garden City, New York. Family Dollar, the unit Dollar Tree bought in 2015, reported underwhelming holiday-quarter same-store sales growth despite Dollar Tree making several plans to attract customers.\nFor the full year, Dollar Tree said it estimates net sales to range between $22.70 billion and $23.12 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales. It expects profit in the range of $5.25 to 5.60 per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $5.90 per share on revenue of $23.1 billion.\n\"The guide suggests greater than expected margin pressures,\" Oppenheimer analysts wrote in a note, pointing to increased investments in labor and stores. They, however, cautioned that Dollar Tree's outlook tends to be very conservative.\nWhile Dollar Tree sells goods at a fixed-price point of $1 or less, its Family Dollar chain follows a multi price-point strategy, selling goods for $10 or less.\nSame-store sales rose 1 percent at Family Dollar and 3.8 percent at Dollar Tree in the fourth quarter.\nWall Street analysts had expected same-store sales at Family Dollar to rise 1.46 percent and 3.99 percent at Dollar Tree stores, Reuters I/B/E/S.\nOverall, sales at established stores rose 2.4 percent, lower than the average analyst estimate of 2.73 percent.\nNet income rose to $1.04 billion, or $4.37 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, from $321.8 million, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Dollar Tree earned $1.89 per share, missing analysts' average estimate by a cent.\nThe Chesapeake, Virginia-based company recorded a tax benefit of $583.7 million in the latest quarter due to changes in the U.S. tax code.\nNet sales rose to $6.36 billion from $5.64 billion.\nDollar Tree also said it expects net sales for the first quarter of 2018 to range from $5.53 billion to $5.63 billion, based on a low single-digit increase in same-store sales. It expects profit in the range of $1.18 to $1.25 per share.\nAnalyst on average were expecting earnings of $1.31 per share on sales of $5.60 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-07T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T04:07:31.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
