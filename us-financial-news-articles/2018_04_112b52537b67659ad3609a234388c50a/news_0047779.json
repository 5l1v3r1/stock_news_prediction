Ukrainian military pilot Mykola Volkozub, who was deployed in a team to fly a helicopter over the reactor to measure the temperature and composition of gases after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, walks out of a Mi-8 helicopter at a military base in Kiev Region, Ukraine April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nRemembering the incident still brings tears to the eyes of Volkozub, who survived the risk of radiation poisoning to live to a ripe age of 86 and still supervises test pilots for Antonov, a state-run aircraft manufacturer.\nVolkozub was deployed in a team of two pilots, an engineer and a scientist, to fly an MI-8 helicopter over the reactor to measure the temperature and composition of gases inside.\nThursday marks the 32th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine, caused by a botched safety test in the fourth reactor of the atomic plant that sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe. Ukrainian military pilot Mykola Volkozub, who was deployed in a team to fly a helicopter over the reactor to measure the temperature and composition of gases after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986, speaks during an interview with Reuters at the Antonov aircraft plant in Kiev, Ukraine April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko\nThe accident killed dozens right away and forced tens of thousands to flee. The final death toll of those killed by radiation-related illnesses such as cancer is subject to debate.\nSpeaking ahead of the anniversary, Volkozub called it “a planet-sized tragedy” and recalls agreeing to fly the mission despite knowing his life would be at risk.

That’s why I took such a decision immediately,” he told Reuters in the hangar at an Antonov factory, where he has worked for 23 years.\nVolkozub was awarded a ‘Hero of Ukraine’ medal for his efforts. After performing three flights which lasted for 19 minutes 40 seconds in total, Volkozub was exposed to such a high dose of radiation that some dosimeters went haywire when he tried to measure his exposure.\nThe helicopter was also exposed to radiation and had to be buried at a so-called cemetery for decommissioned equipment, something he recalls with tears in his eyes.\n“I landed there, near (the site). And when I left the place, I felt very sorry for the helicopter. It seemed to me it had not failed me, but I had to throw it away,” he said.\nRight after his third flight on May 10, 1986, Volkozub was sent to Moscow for medical tests. He remembered how nurses, afraid of contamination, pushed food towards him with the help of a long stick to avoid physical interaction with him.
