Ben Gomes, who joined Google in 2000 and was running search engineering, will take over the search organization. \nWhen Giannandrea inherited the role from Amit Singhal in early 2016, it signaled Google's emphasis on weaving machine learning and artificial intelligence into its most important product, search. But Google CEO Sundar Pichai has increasingly emphasized AI's importance to the entire company. The move suggests that AI is now important enough to form its own business unit. \nGiannandrea, a machine learning expert, joined Google in 2010 after it acquired his startup Metaweb Technologies. That technology formed the basis of Google's \"Knowledge Graph,\" which quickly surfaces information at the top of search. \nGiannandrea will continue to work at Google.
