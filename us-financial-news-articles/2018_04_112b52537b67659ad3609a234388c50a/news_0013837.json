Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Atletico Madrid - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - April 8, 2018 Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo in action REUTERS/Susana Vera \nYet the Madrid derby draw only pushes Barcelona closer to winning the league title as second-placed Atletico now trail Ernesto Valverde’s runaway leaders by 11 points. \nRonaldo followed his outrageous bicycle kick strike against Juventus in the Champions League on Tuesday by breaking the deadlock in an entertaining contest in the 53rd minute. \nHe sent a cross from Gareth Bale crashing past Jan Oblak on the volley, hitting the target for the 20th time in 10 games. \nAtletico quickly struck back down the other end, with Griezmann tapping into an empty net in the 57th minute to complete an excellent team move also involving Thomas Partey and Vitolo. \nBarcelona lead the standings on 79 points after beating Leganes 3-1 on Saturday. Atletico have 68 while Real are third on 64 after 31 games.

We responded to their goal immediately and we could have won or lost the game. But I leave here feeling we’ve gained little.” \nReal winger Marco Asensio and left back Marcelo both hit the crossbar in the first half while the home side had penalty appeals waved away either side of the interval and Oblak was forced to save goal-bound shots from Dani Carvajal and Ronaldo.

OBLAK THWARTS REAL \nMadrid captain Sergio Ramos almost grabbed an injury-time winner from a free kick but Slovenian goalkeeper Oblak again came to Atletico’s rescue by tipping the curling shot over the bar. \n“I’m very happy with how we played but we obviously deserved more. It’s a shame we didn’t win because we had a lot of chances but we also could have lost the game,” Real coach Zinedine Zidane told reporters. \n“We had a lot of chances, we did everything to win the game but our objective stays the same, to reduce the points gap and get into second place.” \nAlso on Sunday, Levante took a giant step towards sealing their La Liga survival by winning 2-1 in a relegation battle at home to fellow strugglers Las Palmas with a superb injury time goal by Jose Campana. \nSpanish midfielder Campana cut inside from the left wing on the counterattack and coolly curled the ball into the far corner, sparking jubilant scenes at the packed Ciutat de Valencia stadium after Las Palmas captain David Garcia had cancelled out Coke’s opening goal. \nThe win lifted Levante, who finished the game with 10 men, eight points clear of the relegation zone and 18th placed Deportivo La Coruna with seven games remaining.
