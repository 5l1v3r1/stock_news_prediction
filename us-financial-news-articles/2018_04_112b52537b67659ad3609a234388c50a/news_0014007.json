REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Phoro One of the best known of the hedge fund world’s aggressive activist players who seek major changes in company strategies, Icahn has been railing against the Oklahoma-based company’s management for months.\nIn a statement on Monday, SandRidge said that it would look at alternatives to its current strategy and would also evaluate “credible” offers for the company, including any offer from Icahn Capital.\n“To date, Icahn Capital has rejected SandRidge’s offer to participate in this process on the same fair basis as other interested parties,” it said.\nIcahn did not immediately return a request for comment.\nSandRidge shares rose about 3.7 percent in midday Monday trading. They have fallen nearly 15 percent since Icahn reported his stake on Nov. 21.\nLast week Icahn said he planned to nominate directors who would push for a sale of SandRidge and said he was willing to make an all-cash offer to buy the company in a formal process seeking a buyer.\nSandRidge said it had offered Icahn the opportunity to submit qualified, independent candidates for the board’s consideration “on more than one occasion” adding that none had been put forth.\nThe deadline for shareholders to propose board nominees is April 16.\nSandRidge has made changes in recent months after some prodding by Icahn. In February, it ousted both its chief executive and finance chief. Icahn, who holds a 13.5 percent stake, also persuaded SandRidge to back out of a $746 million deal to acquire Bonanza Creek Energy Inc ( BCEI.N ) last year.\nSandRidge came out of bankruptcy in late 2016, overcoming opposition from shareholders who had accused the oil and gas producer of misrepresenting its value.\nSandRidge had previously rejected Icahn’s demand to replace two directors and the removal of a “poison pill” measure preventing individual shareholders from amassing more than a 10 percent stake in the company’s stock.\nIcahn last month persuaded Newell Brands Inc ( NWL.N ) to appoint four directors to its board, and before that opposed Xerox Corp’s ( XRX.N ) plan to sell itself to Fujifilm Holdings ( 4901.T ).\nReporting by Karan Nagarkatti in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Ernest Scheyder in Houston; editing by Shailesh Kuber and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T16:04:17.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
