Formula One - F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai, China - April 14, 2018 - Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in action during qualifying. REUTERS/Aly Song \nWorld championship leader Sebastian Vettel took pole position with a lap more than half a second faster than that of Valtteri Bottas, the fastest of the two Mercedes drivers in third place. \nThe German’s best time of one minute, 31.095 seconds — a Shanghai circuit record — turned up the heat on a chilly afternoon with Finnish team mate Kimi Raikkonen joining him on the front row. \n“We thought coming into today that we would be fighting for the pole position,” said Bottas, whose reigning champion team mate Lewis Hamilton qualified fourth after aborting his final flying lap. \n“But it was definitely out of reach today, there was nothing in the lap that we could have gained that much.” \nDominant isn’t a word that has been used to describe Ferrari since they chalked up five straight drivers’ titles and six consecutive constructors’ crowns with Michael Schumacher, but they were imperious on Saturday. \nThe front row lockout was their second in a row after Vettel beat Raikkonen to pole last weekend in Bahrain. \n“Ferrari were just way too quick,” said Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, who was fifth fastest but a hefty 0.701 seconds off Vettel’s pace.
