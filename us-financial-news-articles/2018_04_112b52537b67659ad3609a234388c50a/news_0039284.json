The leader of Britain’s opposition party suggested on Sunday the position should be rotated around the members. \nPrime minister Theresa May also spoke at the opening ceremony and paid glowing tribute to the queen’s “service, dedication and constancy” in the role. May will lobby for Charles to be the queen’s successor when the issue is discussed over the next two days. \nPrince Charles, 69, also made an informal pitch for the role in his remarks at the event in Buckingham Palace: “For my part, the Commonwealth has been a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember.” Slideshow (6 Images)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:51:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
