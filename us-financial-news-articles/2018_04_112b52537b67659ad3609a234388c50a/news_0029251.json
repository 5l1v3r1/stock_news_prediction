He was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actor for the role. \nIn a four-decade acting career, he played a helicopter pilot in “Apocalypse Now,” portrayed authoritarian figures like Mayor Tillman in “Mississippi Burning” and did voice overs for characters like the green plastic soldier “Sarge” in “Toy Story.” Reporting By Andrew Hay, editing by Darren Schuettler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T05:42:06.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
