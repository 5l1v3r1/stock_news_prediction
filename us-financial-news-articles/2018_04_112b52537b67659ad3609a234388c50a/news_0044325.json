Castro will retain the powerful post of Communist Party head.\n“We will continue to stand in solidarity with the Cuban people as they call for freedom and prosperity,” the official said. “In support of this, our stated policy to channel funds toward the Cuban people and away from Cuba’s military, security and intelligence services is not expected to change.”\nReporting By Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:38:10.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
