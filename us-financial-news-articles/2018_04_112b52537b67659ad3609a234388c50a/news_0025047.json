Three of the tournaments, Dubai, Sydney and Paris, are held jointly. \nWomen’s sevens, despite being played at the Rio Olympics, had never featured at the Commonwealth Games before the Gold Coast tournament. \nMen’s sevens made its Commonwealth debut at Kuala Lumpur in 1998. South Africa are the defending champions from the Glasgow Games.
