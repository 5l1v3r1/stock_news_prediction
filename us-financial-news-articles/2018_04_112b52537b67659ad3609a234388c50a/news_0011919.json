It has already docked with the International Space Station and the tests are expected to begin in the next few weeks.\n“All we have to do is sit away from our target spacecraft, fire our harpoon towards it and then once it’s impacted we’ve captured our piece of space debris,” said Wayman.\nA small harpoon system, identical to the one in space now on the RemoveDebris satellite, is seen at the European Space Agency project in Stevenage, Britain, April 4, 2018.

REUTERS/Stuart McDill One of the harpoons is around 30 cm (one foot) long, and is designed to fire at a target on an arm around 20 meters (65 ft) away, before reeling it back in on a rope.\nA larger harpoon, around 1.5 metres-long and weighing 2.2 kg (5 lb) is also being designed in the lab, as part of the European Space Agency’s Clean Space program. It aims to capture space junk targets weighing up to eight tonnes (17,000 lb).\nScientists estimate as much as 7,000 tonnes of junk is orbiting the earth at speeds of up to 27,000 km/h (17,000 mph) and it is capable of damaging satellites or spacecraft.\nThe debris ranges from tiny items such as screws or chips of paint to rocket sections or defunct satellites.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Other devices being tested on the RemoveDebris satellite include a net to catch debris, a light-based ranging system known as LIDAR, and a sail that will pull the craft back into earth’s atmosphere where it and the debris would burn up harmlessly.\nReporting by Stuart McDill; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:18:14.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
