Clinton herself did not participate, though her running mate, Sen. Tim Kaine , D-Va., gave multiple interviews. \nThe New York Times reported in August that Sinclair's chairman had discussed relaxing regulations on television advertising with Ajit Pai, who became the Federal Communications Commission chairman soon after. \nDuring Pai's first 10 days on the job, he rolled back the Obama-era restriction on sharing ad revenue and other resources among television stations, according to records of the exchange . \nThe company is currently seeking approval from the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission for a $3.9 billion deal to buy Tribune Media. \nWhile Sinclair owns nearly 30 local NBC affiliates, Trump in his tweet said the broadcasting group is \"far superior\" to NBC, \"which is a total joke.\" \nSinclair Broadcast Group did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment about the president's tweet.
