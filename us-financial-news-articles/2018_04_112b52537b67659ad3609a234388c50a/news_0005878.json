So far in 2018 we have continued to be deeply engaged in a number of activities that we believe should create significant value for our shareholders over time by bringing innovative technologies to market that have the potential to save and improve the lives of cancer patients.”\nRecent Highlights\nStrengthened balance sheet through a $10 million private placement of common shares with two current investors.\nDiscovered and filed patent applications for 190 novel lung cancer biomarkers that may enhance OncoCyte’s lung cancer test and enable better differentiation of malignant from benign lung nodules for improved lung cancer diagnosis.\nReported positive data from a small study using a preliminary algorithm incorporating a combination of existing and newly discovered biomarkers. The study demonstrated at least equivalent accuracy for DetermaVu™ in diagnosing lung cancer on three different commercial molecular diagnostic platforms. These results need to be verified in a larger confirmation study to confirm the potential utility of the new biomarker panel. The Company is currently conducting that study and expects that it will be completed during the second quarter of 2018.\nAnnounced the appointment of Cavan Redmond, a director of the Company since 2015, as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nContinued to enhance our abilities to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and develop lung cancer diagnostic products through the continued growth of our well-characterized lung cancer clinical sample bank.\nUpcoming Milestones in 2018\nFirst half:\nComplete DetermaVu™ confirmation study.\nSecond half:\nSelect final commercial platform for DetermaVu™.\nConduct R&D Validation Study of DetermaVu™\nConduct and report results of Analytical Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nConduct CLIA Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nConduct and report results of Clinical Validation Study of DetermaVu™.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, OncoCyte incurred a net loss of $4.0 million, or ($0.13) per share, compared to a net loss of $3.1 million, or ($0.11) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were $3.9 million as reported, and were $3.3 million, on an as adjusted basis.\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increased costs include outside laboratory and clinical trial expenses, salaries and payroll related expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, and charges to OncoCyte by its former parent company BioTime, Inc. for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $1.8 million compared to $1.1 million for the same period in 2016. The $0.7 million increase was mainly attributable to increased legal and patent related costs, consulting, salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as we upgraded our management team with additional key hires made in 2017.\nSales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017, as reported, were $0.6 million, relatively unchanged from $0.5 million for the same period in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, OncoCyte had cash and cash equivalents of $7.6 million and available-for-sale securities valued at $0.8 million.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Results\nFor 2017, OncoCyte reported a net loss of $19.4 million, or ($0.64) per share, compared to $11.2 million, or ($0.42) per share, in 2016.\nOperating expenses for 2017 were $18.8 million, as reported, and were $12.6 million, on an as adjusted basis.\nResearch and development expenses for 2017, as reported, were $7.2 million, compared to $5.7 million during 2016. The $1.5 million increase was primarily due to the certification and maintenance costs related to the Company’s CLIA laboratory and the cost of the DetermaVu™ program. The increased costs include outside laboratory and clinical trial expenses, salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and charges to OncoCyte by its former parent company, BioTime, Inc., for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for 2017, as reported, were $9.2 million compared to $4.3 million during 2016. The $4.9 million increase was mainly attributable to a $4.1 million noncash charge for the issuance of warrants to certain investors who exercised stock purchase warrants, $0.4 million in legal and patent related expenses, $0.3 million in personnel costs and related benefits, including stock-based compensation expenses, and $0.2 million in insurance expense.\nSales and marketing expenses for 2017, as reported, were $2.4 million compared to $1.2 million during 2016. The $1.2 million increase was mainly attributable to increases of $0.7 million in salaries and payroll related expenses, including stock-based compensation, $0.2 million in consulting expenses, and $0.2 million in amounts charged to OncoCyte by BioTime for continued shared facilities and services provided to OncoCyte.\nConference Call\nOncoCyte will host a conference call today, April 2, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT to discuss financial results.\nThe dial-in number in the U.S./Canada is 800-281-7973, for international participants the number is 323-794-2093.

Early detection of cancer can improve health outcomes, reduce the cost of care, and improve patients’ quality of life. Liquid biopsy diagnostic tests like those OncoCyte is developing may reduce the need for costlier and riskier diagnostic procedures such as invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures. OncoCyte’s development pipeline is focused on non-invasive confirmatory diagnostic tests for lung, breast, and bladder cancer. OncoCyte’s tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein molecular markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer. OncoCyte conducts ongoing research to identify additional molecular markers, acquire and license markers and related technology, and develop tests based on those markers.\nForward Looking Statements\nAny statements that are not historical fact (including, but not limited to statements that contain words such as “will,” “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates” and similar expressions) are forward-looking statements.

Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. However, OncoCyte believes the presentation of non-GAAP total operating expenses, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP total operating expenses, is helpful in understanding OncoCyte’s ongoing operating expenses and its programs.\nFurthermore, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in the aggregate to establish budgets and operational goals, to manage OncoCyte’s business and to evaluate its performance and its programs.\nOncoCyte Corporation\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted Operating Expenses\nAmounts In Thousands For the Three Months\nEnded December 31, 2017\n(unaudited) For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 GAAP Operating Expenses - as reported $ 3,892 $ 18,849 Stock-based compensation expense (472 ) (1,630 ) Noncash warrant expense - (4,074 ) Depreciation and amortization expense (162 ) (580 ) Non-GAAP Operating Expenses, as adjusted $ 3,258 $ 12,565\nSource:OncoCyte Corporation", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=psewmI24FzZjhyGlqeV9J-oBevne10QJ2HEmUuSXm6MZJVQZD9Bel3QJytJTvZ2IQ2oWqobYtHKyAYZiliHuPyoXiNOb2M9r04_u9w1862l1378X2TBJZJmDneuVBwWGNCE_26ZNG7IS6IlJMC_7nAYMN4p7yDzKyFmzdR3fwqaHQxfri62EZEGccvc6TneZcIP-Iq-NecSr02ZEQqPO2ijm_3DP99dSGEcWKKDlv3NHvP1V96_6uEXCVwWyJ_qoQnEMMakAqugLDq29c1UxxXWD7F8rqYi1zQsODdce8uAArhNTUfmQJ3cqk5JOuP2HAk1-YQYrfAho7fJVkU6QILoykaDP5ekDYblQuBpSu-xxQX7f_PVtkpoWyUGRV1WBvVrh3Ywt5okI-1D5BtS2dCorZOLkRm3Uzf_EXAmzG84=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5EtkCOaFQbv-CCCHcmcTo-vo7k0c7cB16v_4ePHQk2B-38SVLL0ctdWub8zH723vInF355M6qhOzflnD8Er8zbnNwnRn5TsDmILlla8-TS1rq28DBPI1IvhUCnK_Opc8", "http://investors.oncocyte.com/events-and-presentations", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9FoNDTiuf2VM88AbXS5yf4_FG3g-l6BWqNwcsnOe_JJd2S-n0vcGTVxDV2e4FJlOshlcNucTbY_8xxLTIQ8OgZ3BbcAt3P3TEU3aNF7Gzxs=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Ga3Fla1ytUlpTMUHljoR3ft4CfNo6700BivjNgHZ_M61Hwph8XiRs3AEaZr18KL8gSTh4ua_FAvKQlIZeHf0fjTSG2K42GTBTHaztNI7ZXI=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=UXnyStPICYpnJMbYNjcwDNnHWpXeoeJVsqT9Gs_EW0S7suEh39Hk9z0PW7q0MP8745O81fy2KsMX5A7uvzfiUg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aN0Vtso14jDE2s9wuZoCQ4x-VHUespN3g3rGdt5t4xat4yvy4TeH0UEeDny4WIu4kvU572jRUaT58d8gSlBsS9i11HIGVjAuRpa-XMu6ZLo=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=psewmI24FzZjhyGlqeV9J-oBevne10QJ2HEmUuSXm6MZJVQZD9Bel3QJytJTvZ2IQ2oWqobYtHKyAYZiliHuP8JeFb97VSa_R8627tdi0pW0KRsHgXMgpJd-F7yLdRVSZq3Ol2JL6hyG7-Pf9kunYEuqNhbRQlAnlMHYiHGMdgej5W19J4iGyljARZ3svtKVLqzZZK0swCUlekMxpWuuUF0sJDBPnOzFviTpkr_Hz8POIST4FWwiuJOgHACp4xjmeRKJVpWK_vb8zsGWqh42CTKLaR1ZHBqGHUTJehU9eesYDfkm3YblpQOIZgzdALhSYBVRKvRsFPAgCq6lpDN_jBbnItH2vM9F6fjOnRRLIcDXmMsgJj7_NbdQrMp3SI21I2XPvW0uAUE7Py4TOdI_ZiFBeg6wRQpufZFYc_Txn3A="], "published": "2018-04-03T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T01:51:03.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
