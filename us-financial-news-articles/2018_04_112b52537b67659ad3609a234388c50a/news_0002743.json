Tesla Inc. tells drivers that its Autopilot system, which can keep speed, change lanes and self-park, requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel in order to take control of the vehicle to avoid accidents.\nTesla said its vehicle logs show the driver took no action to stop the Model X SUV from crashing into a concrete lane divider. Photographs of the SUV show that the front of the vehicle was demolished; its hood was ripped off; and its front wheels were scattered on the freeway.\nThe vehicle also caught fire, though Tesla said no one was in the vehicle when that happened. The company said the crash was made worse by a missing or damaged safety shield on the end of the freeway barrier that is supposed to reduce the impact into the concrete lane divider.\nThe crash happened in Mountain View, in California's Silicon Valley. The driver was Walter Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple.\n\"None of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer's family and friends,\" Tesla said on its website late Friday.\nEarlier this month, a self-driving Volvo SUV being tested by ride-hailing service Uber struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.\nTesla Inc. defended its Autopilot feature, saying that while it doesn't prevent all accidents, it makes them less likely to occur than vehicles without it.\nFederal investigators are looking into last week's crash, as well a separate crash in January of a Tesla Model S that may have been operating under the Autopilot system.\nThis version of the story corrects that the vehicle was semi-autonomous not self-driving.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-31T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:51:30.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
