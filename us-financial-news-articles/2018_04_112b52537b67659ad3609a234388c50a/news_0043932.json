The OPEC country is undergoing a major economic and social crisis, with millions suffering food shortages amid soaring inflation. \nState electricity company Corpoelec, which originally ordered rationing in March following a drought, lifted the measure last week. \n“There was a six-hour blackout on the day the minister said that rationing was suspended!” said Nelly Moreno, a 32-year-old nursing assistant, as she waited for power to return to her home in San Cristobal, a city near Venezuela’s border with Colombia. \nElectricity minister Luis Motta blamed sabotage and asked people to report suspicious activity. \nPresident Nicolas Maduro, who is gearing up for presidential elections in a month’s time, often points to sabotage for the country’s ills. He blames Venezuela’s economic woes on a war that he says is being waged against his government by the United States and the opposition. \n“We live with uncertainty. We have no idea what time they are going to cut the power today,” said Yoselin Cote, a 31-year-old homemaker who lives in a poor neighborhood of San Cristobal.
