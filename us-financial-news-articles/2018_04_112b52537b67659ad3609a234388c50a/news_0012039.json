We don't have a trade war, we've lost the trade war,\" Trump said in a radio interview with New York radio show, 77 WABC's \"Bernie & Sid.\" \n\"I'm not saying there won't be a little pain, but the market has gone up 40 percent, 42 percent so we might lose a little bit of it. But we're going to have a much stronger country when we're finished. \n\"So we may take a hit and you know what, ultimately we're going to be much stronger for it,\" Trump said.
