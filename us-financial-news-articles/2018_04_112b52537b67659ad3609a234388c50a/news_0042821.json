And make no mistake about it, it is a crime,\" he said on \" Closing Bell .\"\nIn fact, he thinks some executives should face prison time.\n\"To the extent you don't have senior executives going to prison, I think you are going to continue to see these sorts of abuses going forward,\" said Stoltmann, an investor advocate.\nWells has agreed to pay back the customers and make changes to its risk and compliance practices.\nIn a statement , CEO Tim Sloan said, \"While we have more work to do, these orders affirm that we share the same priorities with our regulators and that we are committed to working with them as we deliver our commitments with focus, accountability, and transparency.\"\nWhen asked for a comment regarding Stoltmann's remarks, a Wells spokesperson referred back to Sloan's statement.\nChris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors, said Wells Fargo made mistakes but he thinks the company is going to address it.\nIn fact, he says the Federal Reserve is ultimately responsible because it \"slammed\" Wachovia into Wells Fargo to avoid another bankruptcy. Wells bought the troubled Wachovia for about $15 billion in 2008.\nHowever, he says, that doesn't mean Wells executives are without blame. He agrees that in some cases, some executives should go to prison.\n\"The officers and directors are responsible, and when they are sloppy and stupid and they do bad things they should be punished,\" Whalen said on \"Closing Bell.\"\nHe believes the worst is now over for investors, he says.\nShares of Wells closed Friday up 1.9 percent.\nâ€” CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T02:12:48.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
