June ended 2.725 cents lower at 102.325, and below the 10-day moving average of 103.490 cents.\nTechnical selling, profit-taking and lower live cattle futures sank CME feeder cattle contracts.\nApril closed 2.150 cents per pound lower at 135.325 cents.\nHOGS CLOSE LOWER CME hogs fell on lower wholesale pork prices and pressure from the exchange’s live cattle market selloff, said traders.\nThey said worries about higher Chinese tariffs on U.S. pork discouraged futures buyers.\nFrom January to February U.S. pork export volume to Hong Kong/China dropped 14 percent year-over-year to 69,515 tonnes worth $164 million, the USMEF said.\nThe group attributed the decline to increased Chinese supplies.\nSome U.S. farmers may be sending hogs to market earlier than planned as almost $4 per bushel corn erodes their profits, a trader said.\nSharply lower wholesale pork belly prices suggest that end-users are relying on fresh rather than frozen product, he said.\nApril hogs closed down 0.325 cent per pound at 52.125 cents. May ended 1.375 cents lower at 64.475 cents, and below the 10-day moving average of 65.043. Most actively-traded June finished 0.550 cent lower at 73.275 cents.
