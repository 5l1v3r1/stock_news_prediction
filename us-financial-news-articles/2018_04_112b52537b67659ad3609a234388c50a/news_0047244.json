The five-year yield inched up 0.5 basis point to minus 0.100 percent and the 10-year yield was unchanged at 0.050 percent.\nThe BOJ on Wednesday offered to buy 1.34 trillion yen ($12.3 billion) of five- to 40-year JGBs as a part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme.\nIn addition to tightening supply, Wednesday’s JGB-purchasing operations by the BOJ provided some relief for bond investors as the central bank refrained from trimming the amount of debt it had offered to buy.\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield extended its overnight rise and touched 3.009 percent on Wednesday, its highest since early 2014.\n$1 = 108.9000 yen Reporting by the Tokyo markets team, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:27:39.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
