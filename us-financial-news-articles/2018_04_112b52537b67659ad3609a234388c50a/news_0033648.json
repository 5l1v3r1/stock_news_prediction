The Bank's asset quality remained exceptional. For the first quarter, gross loans increased by $16.3 million, and year over year increased $47.6 million, 11% to $469.2 million. Allowance for loan losses of $9.4 million at March 31, 2018 represents a 10% increase over the same period last year. Deposits grew by 2%, $13.7 million since December 31, 2017.\nNon-Interest Income / Expense and Net Interest Margin\nA component of the Bank's core business is the origination and sale of loans generated by its top producing SBA Department which results in gains that are included in non-interest income. For the first quarter of 2018, the non-interest income total was $945 thousand which included $329 thousand of gains on loans sold.\nNon-interest expense for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, increased 14% or $481 thousand compared to prior quarter and increased 12.6% or $443 thousand compared to the same period last year. The bulk of the increase resides in the category of professional services which should even out over the remainder of 2018.\nNet interest income of $6.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was basically equivalent to prior quarter but exceeded the first quarter of 2017 by $753 thousand or 13%. The year over year improvement is driven by a continued focus on building high quality earning assets through loan production and the benefit from rate increases implemented by the Federal Open Market Committee. Consequently, net interest margin at 4.47% improved 20 basis points over prior year.\nShareholders' Equity\nTotal shareholders' equity was $59.9 million at March 31, 2018, a $7.3 million, 14% increase over March 31, 2017. The value added to our shareholders was due to continued strong earnings. This increase was reduced by the payout of quarterly cash dividends. Common stock cash dividends totaled $121 thousand or $0.05 per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Historically, the Bank has paid twenty consecutive $0.05 cash dividends totaling over $2.1 million to shareholders and one 10% stock dividend.\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Bank's return on average equity was 17.43% and return on average assets was 1.62%.
