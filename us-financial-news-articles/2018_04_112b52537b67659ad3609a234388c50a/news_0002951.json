Starting with a minimum investment of $10,000, retail investors now have the ability to acquire interest in the HomeUnion Fix-and-Flip Fund . The fund enables consumers to invest in SFR assets acquired for fix-and-flip purposes in seven HomeUnion markets: Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Raleigh and Tampa.\n“Consumers can now choose how they invest in real estate with us,” explains Don Ganguly, CEO of HomeUnion. “With the launch of this new platform, we are empowering buyers to invest in rental assets directly, or invest in a fund that meets their individual preferences and goals,” he says. “Unlike other websites, which source third-party projects and act as middlemen or brokers, HomeUnion is the investment manager on the newly launched fund. In other words, we curate, renovate and manage the assets using big data and our local real estate experts.”\nHere are more details about the Fix-and-Flip Fund currently available on HomeUnion’s website:\nThe HomeUnion Fix-and-Flip Fund uses proprietary methodology and local market expertise to identify SFRs in seven active HomeUnion markets that present opportunities to increase values and command higher rents through renovation. The fund purchases, renovates, and places renters in these properties, which are located in Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Raleigh and Tampa. The properties in this fund are then sold as tenanted assets on HomeUnion’s online investment marketplace, where more than $150 million in real estate transactions have closed.\n“The addition of crowdfunded investments to our site enhances our existing, robust platform, which allows individuals to acquire both single-family and multifamily real estate based on their personal preferences and goals. Investors can already select the metros and neighborhoods where they’d like to acquire properties (A, B, or C) and whether to use financing, all cash or a self-directed IRA for those acquisitions.”\nThe fund is now available for consumers on HomeUnion’s website.\nwww.homeunion.com\nAbout HomeUnion\nHomeUnion is the leader in online residential real estate investing. Based in Irvine, Calif., the company provides all the services needed for individuals to invest remotely in residential real estate.
