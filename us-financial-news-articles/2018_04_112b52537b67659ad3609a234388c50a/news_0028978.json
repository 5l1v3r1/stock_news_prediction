If your lot code reads 5006 8069 10 05 and the best buy date is Sept. 1, 2019, the company says the food should be discarded or returned to the point of purchase. \nThe agency has classified this as a Class I recall, meaning “there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences.” \nAll totaled, roughly 80,000 packages are affected by the recall, the agency says. \nConsumers with additional questions about the recall can call Conagra’s brands consumer affairs office at 800-289-6014. The company also makes foods under the Slim Jim and Chef Boyardee brands, among others .
