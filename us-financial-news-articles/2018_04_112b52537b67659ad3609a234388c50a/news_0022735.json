It added that funds continue to allocate bigger shares of their assets to riskier investments such as equities, hedge funds, real estate and commodities that can produce higher returns. \nRetirement systems in New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wisconsin were at least 90 percent funded in 2016, while pension funds in Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Kentucky and New Jersey were less than 50 percent funded, according to Pew. Another 17 states had less than two-thirds of the assets needed to pay future retirement benefits. \nKentucky and New Jersey had the lowest funded ratios among states at 31 percent and Wisconsin had the highest at 99 percent.
