Approximately half of those could have some delay as a result of the system outage,\" it said.\nThe statement added that while the problem had been identified and action was underway, a contingency plan would remain in place. Eurocontrol said the backup plan would reduce the capacity of the European flight network by approximately 10 percent.\nThe intergovernmental organization claimed that there are no safety implications arising from the system failure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T18:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T18:34:36.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
