During the past year, the group raised in excess of $11 million and currently has more than $9 million on hand, the most for any lawmaker in the House, records from the Center for Responsive Politics show.\nHow the money could be split up Where the money goes will come down to what the campaign wants to do with it.\nThere are two typical ways in which Ryan could divvy up the funds, sources said.\nHis campaign could offer to return donors' contributions. If they choose to decline the refund, it's up to the campaign to decide where the money goes, strategists said.\nThe Federal Election Commission makes this clear in its rules and regulations.\nThe Ryan campaign could also use the money to wind down offices, pay for moving expenses, pay committee staff and even give gifts to supporters, an FEC spokeswoman said.\nThe FEC representative also reinforced that the campaign can use the leftover money for \"transfers to any national, state or local political party committee.\"\nA spokesman for the Ryan campaign declined to comment.\nTom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio The chairman of the NRCC, Rep. Steve Stivers, R-Ohio, praised Ryan as a fighter for change and as a key leader in the battle to pass a comprehensive tax reform package last year.\n\"Speaker Ryan's leadership has transformed our nation,\" Stivers said. \"His vision to reform our broken tax code sparked a new era of American prosperity and confidence.\"\nBut Stivers also expressed optimism that Ryan would pitch in with the GOP midterm efforts this year.\n\"I'm thankful for all Paul has done for the NRCC and am confident he has set us on a path to keep our majority,\" he added. \"Paul is also a man of follow-through and I know he will continue to be an asset to us this fall.\"\nâ€” Graphic by CNBC's John Schoen", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T19:12:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
