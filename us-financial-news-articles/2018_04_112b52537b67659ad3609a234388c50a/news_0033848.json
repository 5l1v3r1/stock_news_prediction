The central bank has until July to issue a decision, although it is expected to act sooner, according to Valor. nL1N1QW1BD]\nItaú is proposing to buy a 74.9 percent stake in XP and a 49.9 percent stake in its voting capital by 2022 for 5.7 billion reais ($1.67 billion).\nUnder the terms of the deal, Itaú could take on a controlling stake in XP’s voting capital as soon as 2024, which would require separate approval by Cade and the central bank.\nBrazil’s central bank and Itau did not have an immediate comment.
