Athletics - London Marathon - London, Britain - April 22, 2018 Kenya's Eliud Kipchoge crosses the finish line to win the men's elite race REUTERS/Paul Childs \nKipchoge, who skipped last year’s race to attempt a sub-two-hour marathon in Italy, could not break Dennis Kimmetto’s world record as high temperatures made running conditions difficult in the English capital. \nWomen’s favorite Mary Keitany attempted to break Paula Radcliffe’s “mixed race” record — assisted by male pacemakers — but the Kenyan struggled late on in the race, eventually finishing fifth and unable to add to her three London titles. \nThat allowed Cheruiyot in to take her first London crown, having won her first career marathon in Frankfurt only in October. \nRadcliffe’s record, set in 2003, did seem under threat at first as Keitany comfortably led for the majority of the race but the conditions got the better of her in the end. \nThe men’s race went out at a blistering pace, with early leader Guye Adola clocking four minutes 22 seconds in the first mile, and Farah stayed with the group until a bizarre incident when he missed his drinks bottle around the 10-mile mark, which delayed him after a heated exchange with a steward.
