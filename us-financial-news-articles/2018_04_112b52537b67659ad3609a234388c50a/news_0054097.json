Gashes have appeared along the city’s sidewalks where docking stations have been uprooted. Seemingly serviceable bikes can’t be ridden because of electrical problems with newly installed stations. Overall the system, known as Velib’, is operating at a fraction of its former capacity.\nThe mess, dubbed an “industrial catastrophe” by French media, is casting a cloud over the city’s political leadership and dragging down the popularity of Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist mayor of Paris. Elected officials are learning a new lesson in big-city politics: Keep the local bike-sharing network up and rolling, or suffer the consequences.\n“Hidalgo could pay dearly for this,” said Eric Azière, a Paris city councilor from a centrist party. “It has undermined her reputation for competence.”\nVelib’ customers have been sharing stories of nonfunctioning bikes with the hashtag #Velibgate. On Saturday, one Twitter user posted a picture of a long row of Velib' bikes in their docking station, writing: “Not one works.”\nSmovengo CEO Jorge Azevedo talking to the press at a Velib’ station under construction in Paris in January.

Many are disappointed. ’\n—Christophe Najdovski, head of transportation at Paris city hall The scale of the backlash is a measure of Velib’’s success. Before it ground to a halt, the system averaged 100,000 bike rides a day, and boasted about 1,200 stations in the city and its outskirts. It was hard to walk five blocks here without coming across a row of clunky, gray Velib’ bikes plugged into docking stations. Mayors from around the world, including Michael Bloomberg of New York, dropped into Paris to give Velib’ a spin before launching their own programs.\n“Velib’ is part of the identity of Paris,” said Christophe Najdovski, Ms. Hidalgo’s deputy in charge of transportation. “Many are disappointed. Some are angry, and that necessarily can have political consequences.”\nThe controversy has devolved into a scrum of mutual recriminations. Ms. Hidalgo is blaming Smovengo, a consortium that won the estimated €600 million ($734 million) bid to upgrade and operate the bike network for the next 15 years. Smovengo is blaming a local electrical company and JCDecaux, the outdoor-advertising company that ran the previous version of the network. JCDecaux sued last year, claiming the bidding process was rigged in favor of Smovengo. (It lost the case.)\nThe problems started when Paris reopened the Velib’ contract to new bidders, as required by law, nearly 10 years after the network first opened in 2007. The city and surrounding municipalities chose to replace JCDecaux with Smovengo, a consortium of four companies specializing in urban transportation.\nThe contract required Smovengo to introduce electric bikes into the system, expand the network farther beyond the city limits of Paris and improve the design of the mechanical bikes. The consortium’s plan called for all existing bikes and stations to be replaced with entirely new designs that were incompatible with the old system.\nBeginning late last fall, workers for JCDecaux, the former contract holder, began tearing out the old docking stations, leaving the streets dotted with hundreds of gaping holes.\nThe first glitch arose when Smovengo started running behind schedule installing new stations—opening about 65 of the 525 stations it was supposed to have installed as of January 1. As of late April, Smovengo said it was commercially operating only 670 of 1,400 planned stations. About 8,000 of the system’s 24,000 bikes are on the streets.\nBut those numbers mask another problem: Smovengo has only managed to connect about 35% of the 670 active stations to the city’s electrical grid, with the rest running on battery power. Battery-powered stations can’t recharge the electric bikes that were one of the new Velib’ system’s selling points.\nWorse, when a station’s battery runs out, the electronic boxes that allow users to unlock bikes—even mechanical ones—exhaust their own batteries by trying and failing to connect to the station. That renders all bikes at the station unusable.\n“Once we can get more stations hooked into the grid, that will fix a large number of the problems,” said Jorge Azevedo, chief executive of Smovengo.\nSmovengo has spent large sums sending teams across the city to replace depleted batteries at the stations, but last week those workers went on strike. Velib' told users Friday that the feud was “strongly disrupting” the availability of bikes. Mr. Azevedo said the strike was also slowing the opening of new stations, with 30 additional stations complete but not yet open.\n‘ It’s a shame to see this happening. It’s as though a beautiful diamond ring had its diamond taken out. ’\n—Russell Meddin, American bike-sharing blogger Mr. Azevedo says Enedis, the company that manages the Parisian electrical grid, hasn’t been moving quickly enough to connect the Velib' stations.\nEric Salomon, director of the Paris region at Enedis, said only around half of Smovengo’s battery-powered stations meet the technical and safety requirements to be hooked up to the grid. Of the 345 stations that are up to snuff, 290 have been connected to the grid, and work is under way on the remaining 55, he said.\n“We have the capacity to go faster. I can adapt my resources if you give me more stations,” Mr. Salomon said. “We are really waiting for Smovengo.”\nRelated Video Dockless bike-sharing is likely coming to a city near you. To see what the world looks like from behind the handlebars, WSJ's David Pierce takes an Uber Bike for a spin around San Francisco. Smovengo also blames the sandy, gravel- and rock-filled earth under the city’s streets, a legacy of hundreds of years of building. Mr. Azevedo says that makes it difficult to ground the electrical connections for each station.\n“It was impossible to predict. We didn’t know there were problems with the soil in Paris,” Mr. Azevedo said, more than a century after Paris opened its first underground Métro line.\nVelib’’s woes have allowed bike-sharing competitors to gain a foothold in Paris. Mobike and Ofo, two Chinese bike-sharing companies, have flooded the streets with bicycles that aren’t parked in docking stations and are locked with a bolt through the rear-wheel spokes.\nThose bikes, made in China, haven’t caught on because their frames tend to be too small for larger Europeans. The companies, however, are rolling out upgrades while Velib’ sputters.\n“It’s a shame to see this happening,” said Russell Meddin, an American consultant who runs a bike-sharing blog. “It’s as though a beautiful diamond ring had its diamond taken out.”\nWrite to Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com and Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:50:48.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
