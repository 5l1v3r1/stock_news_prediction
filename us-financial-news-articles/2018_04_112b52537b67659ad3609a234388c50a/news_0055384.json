REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nEurope’s largest aerospace group is simultaneously juggling a drop in demand for its A330 wide-body jet - the only one of its class on which it currently makes a profit - against record demand for bread-and-butter models like the A320.\nAirbus said it was reducing deliveries of the 250-300-seat A330 to around 50 aircraft in 2019, compared with 67 last year and 60 planned for 2018. That comes after an upgraded version due to enter service this year failed to sell as it had hoped.\nThe production slowdown came as Airbus posted a slender - though better than expected - core profit in the first quarter after delays in engine deliveries for its smaller A320neo.\nTogether, the A320 and A330 families generate most of the cash and income needed to support future developments and other activities at the maker of airplanes, rockets and fighters.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo A320 PRODUCTION\nShares in Airbus dipped just over 1 percent on the results, which came days after Boeing beat forecasts after improving deliveries and turning the corner on 787 costs.\nAirbus reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros (12.3 million pounds) after a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.12 billion euros.\nAirbus reaffirmed full-year forecasts, however, predicting that A320neo deliveries would speed up later this year after a two-month break in some deliveries due to engine snags.\nAnalysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro quarterly operating loss on revenues of 10.21 billion.\nAirbus said it saw continued strong demand for narrowbody jets like the A320, allowing it to explore future production rates of “70 or 70-plus” a month, up from around 55 a month now.\nBut it softened recent indications that it planned to accelerate its goal in the short term, after an Airbus spokesman earlier this week confirmed a report it planned to increase output to 63 a month in 2019, instead of 60.\nFinance Director Harald Wilhelm said Airbus was only asking for “surge capacity” of that level and the only commitment was for 60 aircraft a month, while redefining the goal as a delivery target rather than a production figure.\nThis is a change from the usual practice for high-volume aircraft programmes, where manufacturers typically announce monthly production rates that hold steady while deliveries can fluctuate from month to month. For the year as a whole, they tend to focus on deliveries, which drive revenues and cash.\nAirbus is keen to lock in a recent advantage over Boeing in narrowbody jets by speeding up the rate at which it turns orders into deliveries, but faces pushback from its engine suppliers.\nThe head of France’s Safran ( SAF.PA ) this week warned against hasty production increases as suppliers work through an unprecedented speed-up plan already in motion.\nGermany’s MTU Aero Engines ( MTXGn.DE ) said on Wednesday it too was cautious, because of tight supply chains.
