Taylor homered and Washington left-hander Gio Gonzalez pitched seven innings for the first time this season as the Nationals beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 3-1 at Nationals Park on Sunday.\nWieters and Taylor homered off reliever T.J. McFarland (1-1), who entered in the second inning after Arizona starter Robbie Ray was forced to leave with what was initially diagnosed as a strained right oblique.\nWieters, the first batter McFarland faced, hit his third homer as part of a two-run second inning, and Taylor hit his third homer with one out in the third inning for a 3-0 lead.\nGonzalez (3-2) gave up six hits and one run in seven innings, striking out a season-high eight and walking one.\nNick Ahmed had three hits and Ketel Marte had two for the Diamondbacks, who went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position.\nDespite their hot start to the season, the D-backs’ starting rotation is being tested. Arizona lost No. 4 starter Taijuan Walker to season-ending Tommy John surgery after just three starts this season.\nHowie Kendrick extended his hitting streak to seven games and Trea Turner had his 12th stolen base for the Nationals, who had lost six of seven and are just 4-9 at home. Turner tied the franchise record for consecutive successful stolen bases to start a season.\nRay appeared to suffer the injury on the pitch on which Taylor grounded out to third baseman Deven Marrero for the first out of the bottom of the second. After his first pitch to the next batter Wieters, Ray signaled catcher John Ryan Murphy to the mound and manager Torey Lovullo immediately called for McFarland.\nWieters hit his third homer on a 3-2 pitch, and McFarland committed an error on Ryan Zimmerman’s grounder to the mound with the bases loaded to enable another run to score for a 2-0 lead.\nTaylor’s third homer an inning later made it 3-0.\nArizona scored on Daniel Descalso’s sacrifice fly in the seventh inning after Marte singled and Marrero walked to lead off the inning, then Gonzalez got a force out at second.\nSean Doolittle pitched around a leadoff double in the ninth inning for his fifth save.\nArizona has won nine straight series, the first NL team since the 1907 Cubs to do that, and will play host to the Dodgers and Houston in a seven-game homestand that opens Monday with a four-game series against the Dodgers.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:24:02.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
