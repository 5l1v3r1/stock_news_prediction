It would give Saint-Gobain control over Sika – control that the French group would only use to exploit its own advantage,” Haelg said.\n“And all other stakeholders would end up paying the price. That cannot – and must not – be allowed to happen.”\n$1 = 0.9616 Swiss francs Reporting by John Revill; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T15:29:29.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
