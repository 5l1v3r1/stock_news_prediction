Sonders said it was \"too soon to tell\" if the current correction would \"wash out\" investors' heightened sentiments.\nBut on Monday, the strategist reminded investors that volatility doesn't always have to be negative.\n\"With more volatility comes the ability and opportunity to re-balance more frequently,\" Sonders said. \"You don't have to worry about which person on CNBC has the right market call in the short term. Your portfolio tells you when it's time to do something.\"\nSonders emphasized that an individual's portfolio should not be based on \"what you or anybody else thinks the market's going to do, but your time horizon [and your] risk tolerance.\"\nThat way, the foolproof strategy of adding into weakness and trimming into strength presents itself more plainly instead of being bogged down by contrasting opinions, Sonders said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T05:37:24.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
