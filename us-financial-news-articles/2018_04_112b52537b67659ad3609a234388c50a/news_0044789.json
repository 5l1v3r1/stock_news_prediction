But it could be delayed by one or two months,” he said.\nOn Friday parliament’s portfolio committee on labor was still discussing amendments to the policy.\nSharome van Schalkwyk, acting chair of the committee, said the national minimum wage bill needed to be sent for redrafting.\n“The Department of Labour must take its time and rework the bill for submission again to the committee. This piece of legislation is critical in our country, not only in fighting inequality, but also addressing abuse of vulnerable workers in some sectors,” van Schalkwyk said in a statement on Friday.\nMore than two decades after the end of apartheid in 1994, South Africa’s economy is still characterized by deep wealth inequality and high levels of unemployment.\nReporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:59:11.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
