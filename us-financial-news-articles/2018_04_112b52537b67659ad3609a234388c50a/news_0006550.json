The March 2029 issue was down 0.7 cents to 98.7 cents.\nThe latest move is aimed at seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, plus 17 senior Russian government officials. They freeze the U.S. assets of the people and companies named and forbid Americans in general from doing business with them.\nReporting by Claire Milhench; editing by Sujata Rao\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T11:11:35.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
