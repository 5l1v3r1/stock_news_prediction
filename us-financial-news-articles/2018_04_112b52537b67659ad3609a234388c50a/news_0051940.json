REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\nLike rival Coca-Cola earlier this week, the introduction of new flavour variations and drinks helped the world’s second biggest beverage maker gain back ground in a U.S. market where it has suffered from consumers shifting away from its high-sugar carbonated sodas.\nSales in the North America beverage unit, which makes Lipton tea and Mountain Dew as well as Pepsi itself, fell 1 percent, but were still an improvement over the past two quarters when they decreased at least 3 percent.\nThat helped push shares in the company almost 1 percent higher.\nRevenue from Latin America, and its Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa region by contrast rose 14 percent and 15 percent respectively. Sales in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa rose by 7 percent.\nThe introduction of flavoured sparkling water Bubly, carbohydrates free Gatorade Zero, Lipton Iced Tea with a Splash of Juice, and a line of organic fruit juices called Tropicana Kids this year drove much of the North American recovery.\nPepsi and Coke are also both adding teas and coffees to their offerings and launching low and no-calorie versions of their marquee sodas.\n“Although we continued to face challenges in North America Beverages, the sector had sequential improvement in top line momentum since the fourth quarter of 2017,” Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said in a statement.\nNooyi said the company recognises the need to step up investments in its core carbonated soft drinks portfolio and will continue to do so.\nCoca-Cola earlier this week posted strong soda sales growth and said it gained market share due to the launch of four new flavours of Diet Coke soda and a new marketing initiative started earlier this year.\nThough Pepsi is largely known for its drinks, the company also has another big business - snacks - where it has been introducing healthier options including Brown Sugar Whole Grain Snacks as well as innovating with new flavours and ingredients.\nSales at the snacking division, Frito-Lay, rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter.\nPepsi stuck to its full-year 2018 guidance and said it was on track to improve sales at its beverage unit. It also flagged costs of $700 million to $800 million (501 million to 573 million pounds) it expects to incur this quarter due to the Internal Revenue Service’s new transition tax guidance.\nExcluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 4.3 percent to $12.56 billion, topping analysts’ estimate of $12.40 billion.
