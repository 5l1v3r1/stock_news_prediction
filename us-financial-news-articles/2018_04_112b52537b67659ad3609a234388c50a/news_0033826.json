ING raised its 2018 WTI forecast to $62.50 per barrel from $57.75.\nFor next year, however, ING expects lower prices due to rising U.S. crude output, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016 to over 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd). <C-OUT-T-EIA>\nThe structure of the Brent and WTI forward price curve also points to a tighter market in 2018.\nThe premium for June 2018 over June 2019 prices for Brent and WTI is $5.5 and $6 per barrel, respectively, a market structure known as backwardation in which it is attractive for producers and traders to sell crude immediately instead of keeping it in storage for later sale.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T00:07:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
