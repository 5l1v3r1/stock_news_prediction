FILE PHOTO - Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda attends a news conference at the BOJ headquarters in Tokyo, Japan July 20, 2017. REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo \nKuroda will hold an inaugural news conference at 7 p.m. (1000 GMT), where he is likely to explain how the central bank will address fresh challenges in the coming years such as how to smoothly whittle down its massive stimulus programme. \nThe meeting between Kuroda and Abe, set to last for 10 minutes from 5:50 p.m. (0850 GMT), will likely be a courtesy call after Kuroda’s official reappointment. \nIn the first five years as BOJ governor since 2013, Kuroda’s main task was to deploy a massive stimulus programme to break Japan out of two decades of grinding deflation. \nWhile Kuroda’s stimulus helped reflate growth, it has failed to accelerate inflation to the BOJ’s elusive 2 percent target. \nGiven the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the hit to bank profits from ultra-low rates, the central bank is facing growing calls from lawmakers and analysts to explain clearly how it plans to dial back its ultra-loose monetary policy. \nKuroda has repeatedly said the BOJ was in no rush to follow in the footsteps of other central banks in exiting crisis-mode stimulus. But he has also offered more clues on key points the BOJ would look out for when it rolls back easy policy. \nMarkets are also on the lookout on what Kuroda might say on the escalating U.S.-China trade spat and the fallout on Japan’s export-reliant economy.
