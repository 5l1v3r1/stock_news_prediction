REUTERS/Regis Duvignau Deliveries have been delayed by delivery and quality problems on engines provided by Pratt & Whitney, and most recently engines from French-U.S. venture CFM ( SAF.PA ) ( GE.N ). Pratt-powered A320neo deliveries have been suspended.\nBoth engine suppliers for Airbus narrowbody jets remain “stressed,” but Airbus - whose main rival is Boeing ( BA.N ) - is sticking by a target of delivering some 800 aircraft this year, Enders said.\n“We are quite optimistic they can meet (goals) but it is not going to be a walk in the park,” he said at the company’s annual shareholder meeting, monitored by webcast.\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T16:11:39.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
