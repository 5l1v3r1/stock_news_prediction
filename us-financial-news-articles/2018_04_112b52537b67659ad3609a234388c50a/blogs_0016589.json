Years into a brutal Syrian civil war, supporters of President Bashar Assad have been accused more than once of using chemical weapons. The latest apparent chemical attack hit outside of Damascus. People were left choking and foaming at the mouth as a result of the onslaught, according to reports. Assad's regime has denied using chemical weapons.\nLast week, Trump discussed his desire to pull the American forces fighting the so-called Islamic State from Syria. It is unclear how or if the apparent chemical attack would change his plans. On Sunday, Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., argued Trump's talk about withdrawing troops \"emboldened\" the Assad regime.\nMcCain tweet\nTrump responded to a chemical weapons attack last year by hitting a Syrian government airfield with dozens of missiles .\nTrump said Russian President Vladimir Putin \"may\" bear some responsibility for the latest attack. \"It's going to be very tough\" for Putin if he had a role in it, the president added.\n\"He will, everybody\" involved will \"pay a price\" for the atrocity, Trump said.\nIn a Sunday tweet, the president called the attack \"mindless\" and said Russia and Iran \"are responsible for backing Animal Assad.\"\nTrump tweet\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T18:59:43.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
