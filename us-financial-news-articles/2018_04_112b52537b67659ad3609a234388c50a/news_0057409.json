Aerial strikes and bombardment have relentlessly pounded residential areas for days.\nThe army said it had made advances and killed dozens of militants. Rebels in the area say however that there has been no significant push inside Hajar al-Aswad or the camp, despite hundreds of strikes.\nAt least 19 civilians have been killed and 150 injured since the campaign began, mostly women and elderly, according to Ayman Abu Hashem, a lawyer and former camp resident in touch with residents who have stayed. The sprawling camp was part of a densely populated, impoverished squatter belt only few kilometers away from the heart of the capital.\nTwo sources inside the camp said around 1,500 families remain there.\nChristopher Gunness, a UNRWA spokesman, said the plight of remaining civilians had worsened: “Many are sleeping in the streets, begging for medicine. There is almost no water or electricity. Their suffering is unimaginable.”\nThe camp has been under siege by the army since rebels captured it in 2012. Most civilians fled when Islamic State militants drove out comparatively secular rebels in 2015, but thousands remained behind, many of whom have fled this week.\nAt least 3,500 Palestinian refugees from the camp have in the last week taken shelter in the nearby town of Yalda, according to UNRWA and a resident who confirmed the figure.\nYalda is not controlled by Islamic State fighters but by rebels who have long abandoned fighting under de facto ceasefire deals with the army. The government aims to push them to leave the area for northern Syria under an evacuation deal.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Additional reporting by Stephanie Ulmer-Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:28:50.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
