The services unit, already Boeing's most profitable , is growing more than twice as fast as the broader aircraft services market, offering aircraft maintenance, data analytics and supply chain services.\nMuilenburg said Boeing is focusing on making \"strategic acquisitions\" that will \"really complement our organic portfolio.\"\nThe company expects the global market of servicing commercial and government aircraft will be worth $2.6 trillion between 2017 to 2026. The steadily increasing demand for air travel means Boeing is creating demand in the services market with the hundreds of new airplanes it is producing each year.\nBoeing is also making long-term bets through its HorizonX Ventures arm, which Muilenburg said \"tend to be more partnership models\" than outright acquisitions.\n\"Things like investments in artificial intelligence, robotics and automation,\" Muilenburg said.\nThe venture capital arm of Boeing has started off 2018 with several high profile investments, such as battery start-up Cuberg , Australian satellite company Myriota and British propulsion company Reaction Engines.
