(TSX-V:PRN) (OTCQX:PRFMF) (“Profound” or the “Company”), the only company to provide a therapeutics platform that provides the precision of real-time Magnetic Resonance (“MR”) imaging combined with the safety and ablation power of directional (inside-out) and focused (outside-in) ultrasound technology for the incision-free ablation of diseased tissue, today announced the appointment of Ian Heynen as its Senior Vice-President of Sales and Marketing.\nMr. Heynen brings to Profound over 15 years of progressive leadership experience working with medical device companies. Most recently, he was at Hologic Inc., where he served as Acting President – International, having responsibility for more than $600 million in revenue across all regions outside of the United States. Mr. Heynen’s career with Hologic began in 2010 with that company’s acquisition of Sentinelle Medical Inc., a breast MR imaging company for which he served in the dual role of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer. While at Sentinelle, Mr. Heynen helped negotiate global distribution agreements with GE Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Toshiba Medical through which sales went from start-up first revenue to over $25 million annually. Mr. Heynen holds a B.A.Sc. from University of Waterloo, an M.A.Sc. from UBC, and an MBA from Wilfrid Laurier University. Mr. Heynen is a Licensed Professional Engineer and a Certified Management Accountant.\n“As we continue to drive clinical adoption of TULSA-PRO ® in Europe, advance the technology toward successful commercialization in the United States, and execute our commercial plans for the Sonalleve ® business, we are approaching an important inflection point for accelerated growth,” said Dr. Menawat. “We are excited to have recruited a sales and marketing executive of Ian’s calibre to this role, and have tremendous confidence in his ability to help us maximize our platform’s full commercial potential, both in North America and internationally.”\nAbout Profound Medical Corp.\nThe Profound Medical team is committed to creating the powerful combination of real-time MR-guidance as the imaging platform and ultrasound as the energy source for delivering non-invasive ablative tools to clinicians. These key technology pillars, linked with intelligent software and robotics, have the potential to fulfill unmet needs of patients and clinicians in many anatomies and disease states, including prostate cancer, uterine fibroids, and bone metastases. Our mission is to profoundly change the standard of care by creating a tomorrow where clinicians can confidently ablate tissue with precision; a tomorrow where patients have access to safe and effective treatment options, so they can quickly return to their daily lives.\nProfound Medical is commercializing a novel technology, TULSA-PRO ® , which combines real-time Magnetic Resonance Imaging with transurethral, robotically-driven therapeutic ultrasound and closed-loop thermal feedback control that is designed to provide precise ablation of the prostate while simultaneously protecting critical surrounding anatomy from potential side effects. TULSA-PRO ® is CE marked and Profound Medical is currently conducting a pilot commercial launch of the technology in key European and other CE mark jurisdictions. The Company is sponsoring a multicenter, prospective FDA-registered clinical trial, TACT, which, if successful, is expected to support its application to the FDA for clearance to market TULSA-PRO ® in the United States.\nProfound Medical is also commercializing Sonalleve ® , an innovative therapeutic platform that combines real-time MR imaging and thermometry with thermal ultrasound to enable precise and incision-free ablation of diseased tissue. Sonalleve ® is CE marked for the treatment of uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment of bone metastases. The Company is in the early stages of exploring additional potential treatment markets for Sonalleve ® , such as non-invasive ablation of abdominal cancers and hyperthermia for cancer therapy, where the technology has been shown to have clinical application.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes forward-looking statements regarding Profound and its business which may include, but is not limited to, the expectations regarding the efficacy of Profound’s technology in the treatment of prostate cancer, uterine fibroids and palliative pain treatment.
