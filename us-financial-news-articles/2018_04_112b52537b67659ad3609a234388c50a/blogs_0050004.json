So far, Snap has been no exception to the trend: Not only was the revenue from Spectacles negligible through most of last year , but the company actually ended up writing off nearly $40 million in excess inventory and purchase commitment cancellations.\nSnap did not respond to a request for comment, and Spiegel did not specifically address the release of the new product in the interview.\nNonetheless, FCC documents had indicated that the company might be working on a new model.\nIn the new Wired piece, Spiegel says that hardware is holding augmented reality back, but says \"we can still move forward at a really fast pace empowering very advanced augmented reality products within Snapchat.\"\nThe full Wired report is available here.\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap .", "external_links": ["http://variety.com/2018/digital/news/snap-spectacles-002-1202750097/"], "published": "2018-04-25T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:53:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
