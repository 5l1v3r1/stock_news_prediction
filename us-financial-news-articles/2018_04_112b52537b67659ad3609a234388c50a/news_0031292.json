The results will be encouraging,” Leonidas Fragiadakis told reporters. “The Greek banking system will emerge more than OK.”\nFragiadakis also said the bank was looking to approach two Chinese investors for the sale of a majority stake in its insurance unit National Insurance after a plan to sell it to Dutch-based Exin fell through.\n“We are discussing the details of the procedure to approach the two Chinese investors so that the sale takes place as soon as possible and with a positive impact on National Bank,” Fragiadakis said.
