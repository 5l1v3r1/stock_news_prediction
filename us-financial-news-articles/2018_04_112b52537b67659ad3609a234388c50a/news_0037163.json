The euro last traded down 0.28 percent at 1.2343.\n\"There's been a general weakness in the dollar and risk sentiment seems to be reviving somewhat. That is supporting the euro but also sterling and Asian currencies,\" said Alvin Tan, FX Strategist at Societe Generale.\"\nThe dollar , against a basket of major currencies, gained 0.21 percent at 89.62.\nshow chapters FX trade in Asia is showing a bias toward a weaker US dollar: Strategist 20 Hours Ago | 01:55 Several Asian currencies, including the Korean Won , rose on hopes that U.S.-China trade conflict would calm down.\nElsewhere, the Swiss franc fell to its lowest versus the euro since the Swiss National Bank scrapped its currency peg in January 2015.

It also suggests that President Trump could attempt to 'talk down the dollar' to shrink the US import bill. This will undoubtedly reinforce the appetite for investors to hedge their dollar exposures given the unpredictability and uncertainty over dollar policy going forward,\" MUFG analysts said in a note.\nChina's economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, above expectations and unchanged from the previous quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T07:16:53.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
