The perpetrators of the remaining six have not been identified sufficiently.\nGRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2pKDWOY\nPinheiro’s team, set up in August 2011, has have never been allowed into Syria. Its reports have been based on interviews with more than 6,000 victims and witnesses, videos, documents, satellite imagery, forensic evidence and military analysis.
