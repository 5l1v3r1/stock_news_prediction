REUTERS/Yves Herman/Pool \nKaradzic was convicted two years ago for some of the worst war crimes committed as the former Yugoslavia broke apart in the 1990s, including the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in which around 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed. \nHe is asking judges overseeing his appeal to overturn the 40-year jail sentence imposed and order a re-trial. \nA group of victims from the ‘Bosnian Mothers of Srebrenica’ organisation watched as Karadzic, 72, looking healthy and resolute in a grey suit and red tie, take the floor on the first of the two-day appeal hearing. \nArguing prosecutors had sought to misrepresent him by taking his words out of context, Karadzic said that when he had spoken in 1992 of Bosnian Muslims finding themselves on a “highway to hell” he had not intended this as a threat as they implied. \nThey had misinterpreted him “to blacken me and portray me as a person only concerned with my own people”, he told the court. His comment had instead been “a plea and a warning that we might be led into war” by Bosnia’s decision to secede.

RETRIAL CALL \nMunira Subasic, who lost a son and a husband in the massacre, said Karadzic should be given a life sentence. \n“If it is not a life sentence it is not a punishment ... Everyone who committed crimes should be punished to ensure a better future not for us mothers but for our grandchildren and his grandchildren,” Subasic said.

They will seek a life sentence on that count. \nA final verdict on Karadzic’s appeal is expected by the end of the year.
