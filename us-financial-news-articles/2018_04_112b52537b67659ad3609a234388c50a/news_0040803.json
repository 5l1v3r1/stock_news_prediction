Price pressures were illustrated by a price row with European retailers.\n\nGrowth in the Americas accelerated to 1.2 percent and Asia was also better than the previous quarter at 4.7 percent, while Europe, the Middle East and North Africa slowed to 2.2 percent, hit by declining prices, Nestle said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T08:54:01.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
