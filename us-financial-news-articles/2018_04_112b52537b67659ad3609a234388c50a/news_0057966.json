But just one, the telecoms giant Safaricom, accounts for 1.1 trillion shillings of that, Thomson Reuters data show.\n“You need to bring something else in to offset those concentrations,” Capital Markets Authority Chief Executive Paul Muthaura said.\nMuthaura did not name any new companies planning Kenyan listings. The government plans a $1 billion dual listing of its state oil company by early 2019, which may help reduce the concentration at the NSE.\nMarket capitalisation nudged up to 2.8 trillion shillings in the first quarter, compared with 2.5 trillion shillings in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nForeign investors comprised 57 percent of total market turnover in March, compared with 64.6 percent in December.\n$1 = 100.3000 Kenyan shillings Reporting by Omar Mohammed, editing by Maggie Fick, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:51:16.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
