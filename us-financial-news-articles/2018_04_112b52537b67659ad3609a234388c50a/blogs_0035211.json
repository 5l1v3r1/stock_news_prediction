Morgan Stanley's new price target represents a 42.8 percent upside from Tuesday's close. EBay's stock was up 7.6 percent this year as of Tuesday's closing.\n\"We expect EBAY to start intermediating its own payments (pulling away from PayPal) in '18 as management stated on its 4Q:17 conference call, with a planned full transition in mid-2020,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak said in a note to clients. \"We are bullish about this initiative as we've seen other leading platforms … observe higher user conversion/spend from.\"\n\"As a payment intermediator, EBAY will be responsible for collecting funds from buyers and instructing payment processors to disburse funds to merchants, which is currently done by PayPal. EBAY acting as both marketplace and payment intermediator could simplify and reduce costs for merchants, who would pay a single fee to EBAY,\" he said.\nEBay and PayPal were part of the same company until 2015, when they were split into independent stand-alone businesses.

It will also lead to a 52 percent increase in gross payment margin, he said.\n\"We could be early, as the market may not give EBAY credit for its 2021 payments business for some time,\" Nowak said. \"That said, we expect the '18/'19 testing/gradual roll-out to act as sign posts for progress.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:02:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
