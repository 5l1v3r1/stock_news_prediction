That brings outstanding QDII quotas to $98.33 billion.\nChina unofficially suspended QDII in 2015 when gyrations in Chinese stock and currency markets prompted capital flight. Over the past year, Chinese equities have steadied while the yuan CNY=CFXS has gained sharply against the U.S. dollar, easing worries over capital outflows\nThe QDII scheme was created in 2006 to allow domestic investors to put money into overseas financial markets.\nEarlier this week, China’s forex regulator said it widened the quotas of two other outbound investment schemes in Shanghai and Shenzhen as part of the government’s efforts to liberalize financial markets.\nIn a separate statement on Wednesday, the regulator said the outstanding amount of China’s dollar-denominated Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program rose to $99.46 billion as of April 24, from $99.36 billion at the end of March.\nThe QFII scheme was created by China to allow foreigners to invest in Chinese capital markets.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk and additional reporting by Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch in Shanghai; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T23:17:25.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
