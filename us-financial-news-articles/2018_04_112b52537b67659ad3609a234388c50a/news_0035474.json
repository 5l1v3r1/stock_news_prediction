Hernandez was in custody in Colombia awaiting extradition to the United States. \nThe U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nA source at the attorney general’s office told Reuters that there was no request for Marin to be extradited to the United States, but, “after being released, he contacted the (U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration) and travelled in the last few hours to the United States.” \nA Colombian police source told Reuters that Marin would inform on the trafficking network and Hernandez’s role in it in exchange for judicial benefits. \nThe FARC has said the accusations against Hernandez were false and that his arrest puts the peace process in danger. \nHernandez and Luciano Marin, known by his nom de guerre Ivan Marquez, are both slated by the FARC, now a political party, to take up seats in Congress in July. \nUnder the terms of a 2016 peace deal with the government, the FARC handed over thousands of weapons and pledged to abandon drug trafficking, which had been a key source of financing for the group during five decades of war, in exchange for 10 guaranteed seats in Congress through 2026 and other benefits. \nCrimes committed by FARC members during the war are to be adjudicated by a special tribunal, but those committed after demobilization are subject to regular judicial procedure, which includes the possibility of extradition. The government has said that Hernandez’s alleged crimes took place after the deal was signed.
