The United States supports all efforts to ensure that LeT does not have a political voice until it gives up violence as a tool of influence,” the statement added. \nPakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to request for comment. \nIn October 2017, Pakistan’s electoral commission barred the Milli Muslim League from contesting elections, saying the party had links with militant groups and could not be registered with the commission. \nIn March 2018 the Islamabad High Court ordered the election commission register the party. \nUnder pressure from the United States, the United Nations and international institutions to crack down on terrorist financing, Pakistan drew up secret plans last December for a “takeover” of charities linked to Saeed. \nSaeed has since taken the government decision to court. \nSaeed was placed under house arrest in January 2017 after years of living freely in Pakistan but a court ordered his release in November 2017. \nSaeed’s freedom in Pakistan, where he holds public rallies, has been a thorn in Islamabad’s relations with India and the United States.
