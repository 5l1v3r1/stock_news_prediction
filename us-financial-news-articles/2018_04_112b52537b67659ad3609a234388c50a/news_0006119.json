The only hope for preserving their species is through in vitro fertilisation using their eggs and stored semen, according to Ol Pejeta. \nThousand of southern white rhinos still roam sub-Saharan Africa, but decades of rampant poaching have drastically cut the number of northern whites. Poachers could sell northern white rhino horns for $50,000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold. \nKenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s. It now has 650, almost all of them black rhinos.

But the minimum sentence for possessing it is just five years. \nAfter a court sentenced a Kenyan man to 20 years in jail for possessing ivory, the top prosecutor sought for the punishment to be changed to a life sentenced. The convicted man’s appeal is still in the courts.

The country is the world’s largest importer and end user of elephant tusks.
