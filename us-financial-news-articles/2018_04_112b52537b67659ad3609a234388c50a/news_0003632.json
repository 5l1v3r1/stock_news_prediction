And the builders borrowed techniques from the aviation industry for the smooth exterior, which is covered in 890 joint-free stainless steel and fiberglass panels. The only horizontal surfaces in the building are the floors.\nThis museum is not meant to hold artifacts of the past but instead is intended to be an incubator for innovation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T16:02:04.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
