San Francisco lost for the third straight time after a pair of 1-0 road wins against the Los Angeles Dodgers to open the year.\nGiants left-hander Ty Blach (1-1), who pitched the first five innings of the 1-0 Opening Day win over Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers, got into immediate trouble in the first when Dee Gordon beat out an infield single to shortstop and Jean Segura bunted for a hit.\nAfter Robinson Cano drew a walk to load the bases, Haniger was rewarded for hitting Seattle’s first ball to the outfield, a two-run single that scored Gordon and Segura.\nKyle Seager and Ryon Healy followed with RBI singles, putting the Giants in a 4-0 hole before they batted.\nPanik’s homer got San Francisco within 4-1 in the fourth. Cano added an RBI double and Guillermo Heredia a sacrifice fly in the fifth, creating a five-run difference and ending Blach’s day.\nBlach allowed six runs on 10 hits in 4 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.\nLongoria’s homer in the seventh, his first of the season, cut the Seattle lead to 6-3 and finished Gonzalez, who allowed six hits, struck out two and did not walk a batter.\nAustin Jackson’s sacrifice fly made it a 6-4 game in the eighth off the third Mariners pitcher, Juan Nicasio, but the veteran stranded the potential tying runs on base when he retired Andrew McCutchen and Buster Posey.\nCloser Edwin Diaz pitched a 1-2-3 ninth, striking out a pair, for his third save.\nGordon and Segura had three hits apiece for the Mariners, who out-hit the Giants 12-9. Seager went 2-for-4.\nPanik, who became the first player in major league history to provide his team’s first three runs of a season with three solo homers, collected two hits.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T08:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:21:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
