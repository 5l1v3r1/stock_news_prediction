FILE PHOTO: Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah waves as he arrives for the opening session of Parliament in Kuwait City December 16, 2012. REUTERS/Stephanie Mcgehee \nSheikh Nawaf, 80-year-old brother of the small Gulf Arab state’s ruler, underwent minor back surgery in 2013 in Germany. A relatively low-profile figure, he became next in line to lead the U.S.-allied oil exporter in 2006, shortly after Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah became ruling emir. \nThe crown prince underwent successful medical check-ups last August in the United States, KUNA reported at the time. \nThe health of leading members of the ruling family is a sensitive issue in Kuwait, where less senior al-Sabah members have long been jostling for position, according to diplomats and analysts. It is not public knowledge who is third in line in Kuwait, an OPEC member state.
