It posted first-quarter sales of $278 million, down 7 percent year over year, in the company's specialty materials segment, which came in below the Wall Street consensus of $285 million.\nThe company's management characterized the smartphone market as \"maturing\" and guided to a \"similar year-over-year decline\" in its second quarter for Corning's specialty materials business during its earnings call Tuesday.\nThe negative comments from technology companies came as Apple shares already declined from a key chip partner's forecast last week.\nApple's stock is cumulatively down 8.4 percent in the four trading sessions through Tuesday, wiping out $75.6 billion of shareholder value. The drop was sparked by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's weaker-than-expected guidance Thursday morning.\nThe world's largest semiconductor foundry and Apple supplier said its revenue forecast range for the second quarter is $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion versus the Wall Street estimate of $8.8 billion. The company blamed \"weak demand\" in the mobile sector for its forecast.\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The shares bounced back slightly Wednesday, up about 1.3 percent.\nWATCH: Apple loses $64 billion in stock value as Wall Street is in 'full panic mode' on iPhone demand show chapters Apple loses $64 billion in stock value as Wall Street is in 'full panic mode' on iPhone demand 3:19 PM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 | 01:02", "external_links": ["http://www.skhynix.com/eng/pr/pressReleaseView.do?seq=2493&offset=1"], "published": "2018-04-25T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T22:17:24.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
