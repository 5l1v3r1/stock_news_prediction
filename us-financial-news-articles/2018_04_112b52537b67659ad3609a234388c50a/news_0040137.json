Three advisors who live in Ecuador did not answer calls seeking comment. \nCorrea borrowed heavily during his 10 years in office, in part through oil-for-loan arrangements with China and Thailand that helped finance the government spending that made him popular. \nProsecutors have accused these officials of violating public debt regulations by negotiating up-front payments for future oil deliveries without registering the operations as indebtedness. \nCorrea has defended the financial operations and has said he is victim of political persecution by President Lenin Moreno, his former vice president.
