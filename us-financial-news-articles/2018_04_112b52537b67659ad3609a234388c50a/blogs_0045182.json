Roughly 26% of respondents in North America expressed more pessimism, flat compared with the previous three-month period.\nThe Global Economic Conditions Survey polled 1,418 accountants between Feb. 27 and March 15.\n“The increase in confidence comes on the back of massive tax cuts which should help boost consumption, increase wage growth and lead to lower unemployment rates,” the report noted. Legislation completed in December lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nGlobally, economic confidence is at its strongest since the inception of the survey in 2009. The uptick began in the middle of last year, said Narayanan Vaidyanathan, head of business insights for ACCA, in an interview with CFO Journal.\n“I think it’s something very unusual,” he said. “Various bits of the world have been limping back [from the financial crisis] and it’s coming together in a robust way.”\nPart of the reason, Mr. Vaidyanathan said, is the boost that has come from low interest rates at central banks seeking to foster economic growth..\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which tracks 35 member countries from the Americas to Europe and Asia, the short-term outlook is for stable growth overall.\nSimultaneous growth among countries the OECD tracks is rare. The OECD economies grew in concert for part of the last decade, in the late 1980s and for a few years before the 1973 oil crisis.\nThere are potential headwinds, however, Mr. Vaidyanathan added. In the U.S., doubts over the outlook for interest rates may shake confidence. Tension over trade between Washington and Beijing is also being closely watched, he said.\n“We are in rather uncertainty time geopolitically in terms in relationships between various big powers around the world,” Mr. Vaidyanathan said.\n \nShare this: ACCOUNTANTS SURVEY tax Previous CFO Moves: Bloomsbury Publishing, Debenhams  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T01:40:56.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
