The National Liberation Army (ELN) has frequently been behind attacks on oil pipelines.\nThe ELN had been negotiating a peace accord with the government in Ecuador, but that nation’s President Lenin Moreno last week said he would no longer host the talks.\nHis decision came after the killing of three media workers kidnapped late in March by another insurgent group.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Helen Murphy; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T03:02:05.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
