The tournament runs from April 13-15. \nThe world champion men’s All Blacks’ 15s side had an outbreak of mumps on last year’s end-of-season tour to the northern hemisphere. \nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen said at the time he had been told by public health officials the combined MMR vaccine given to children who would now be aged between 20 and 30 had been less effective. Tui is 26. \n“We wish Ruby a speedy recovery and will continue to prioritise her health and well-being, and that of the wider team,” the NZOC added. \nGames organisers said it was little wonder that some athletes would succumb to sickness. \n“There are over 8,600 people living together and I can assure you that more people will get sick at some stage but they will be properly looked after,” organising committee chief executive Mark Peters told reporters on Tuesday.
