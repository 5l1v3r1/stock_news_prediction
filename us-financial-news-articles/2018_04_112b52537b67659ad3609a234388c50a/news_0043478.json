REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nMacron is on something of a rescue mission for the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which Trump has vowed to scrap unless European allies strengthen it by mid-May. \nA nuclear non-proliferation conference in Geneva heard repeated calls for parties to the deal — the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany — to ensure its implementation and preservation. \n“The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action continues to be the best way to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme and to realise the promised tangible economic benefits for the Iranian people,” U.N. High representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said. \nBut U.S. non-proliferation envoy Christopher Ford said Iran presented a very real long-term challenge to the non-proliferation regime.

Security Council requirements, and retains the ability to position itself, several years hence, dangerously close to rapid weaponisation.” \nOn a visit to Beijing, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said he had agreed with his Chinese counterpart to block any U.S. attempt to sabotage the deal.

Security Council resolution,” Lavrov said. \nEU disarmament envoy Jacek Bylica said the deal strengthened the international non-proliferation regime, contributed to regional and international security and ensured the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. \nCornel Feruta, a senior official at the International Atomic Energy Agency, said the deal had significantly improved access to Iran. \n“In short, Iran is now subject to the most robust nuclear verification regime and Iran is implementing its nuclear related commitments under the JCPOA,” he said. “It is essential that Iran continues to fully implement those commitments.” \n(This story corrects name of IAEA official, correcting error in UN list of names) Reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Catherine Evans and Matthew Mpoke Bigg", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T11:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T12:20:19.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
