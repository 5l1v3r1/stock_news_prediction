We presented our request in 2007 and we are waiting for it,” said government minister Hirut Woldemariam said.\nEphrem Amare, Ethiopian National Museum director, added: “It is clearly known where these treasures came from and whom they belong to. Our main demand has never been to borrow them. Ethiopia’s demand has always been the restoration of those illegally looted treasures. Not to borrow them.”\nThe V&A could not immediately be reached for further comment on Monday.\nIn launching the Maqdala 1868 exhibition of what Hunt called “stunning pieces with a complex history” this month, he said the display had been organized in consultation with the Ethiopian community in London.\n“As custodians of these Ethiopian treasures, we have a responsibility to celebrate the beauty of their craftsmanship, shine a light on their cultural and religious significance and reflect on their living meaning, while being open about how they came to Britain,” he said in a blog on the museum website.\nWriting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:17:48.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
