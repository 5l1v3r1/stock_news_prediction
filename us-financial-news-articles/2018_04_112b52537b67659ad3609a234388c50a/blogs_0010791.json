As wages grow and the labor market tightens, companies are going to switch to a no-risk\nstrategy and potentially begin contracting,\" Challenger said. \nRetailers announced the most cuts in March — representing over half of the total with 35,042. That number is more than seven times the monthly total for the sector from last year. Retail leads all sectors in job cuts this year, with 56,526 — far surpassing the next two closest sectors of health and consumer. \nWhile job cuts may be growing, the LinkedIn Workforce Report released Thursday found U.S. employers hired significantly more people in March than last year.\nBoth reports come a day before the Labor Department releases its March jobs data. On Wednesday, ADP and Moody's Analytics said U.S. companies hired 241,000 employees in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T15:01:14.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
