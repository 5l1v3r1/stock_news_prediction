(TSX-V:EQX) (OTC:LWLCF) (“Equinox Gold” or “the Company”) has released its audited consolidated financial statements (“Annual Financial Statements”) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Annual Financial Statements and accompanying Management’s Discussion and Analysis are available for download on the Company’s website at www.equinoxgold.com and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nChristian Milau, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Fiscal 2017 was a year of significant change and growth for the Company. During 2017 we completed two major transactions, acquiring the Aurizona Gold Mine in Brazil through the merger with Luna Gold in March and acquiring NewCastle Gold and Anfield Gold in December to add the Castle Mountain Gold Mine in California to our production pipeline and expand the Company’s treasury. We also permitted, financed and initiated construction at Aurizona, executed successful exploration programs at both Aurizona and Castle Mountain and welcomed Ross Beaty to the team as Chairman of the Board of Directors.”\nMr. Milau continued, “The next 12 months will be equally transformative as we advance Aurizona through construction and into production, and we remain on track to pour gold by the end of 2018 with the expectation of producing on average 136,000 ounces of gold per year. We will also complete a prefeasibility study at Castle Mountain in mid-2018 with the objective of designing a robust, long-life mine capable of producing approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually.”\nAppointment of General Counsel\nEffective April 4, 2018, Equinox Gold is pleased to welcome Susan Toews as General Counsel.
