Based on those orders, the opening price will be set based on a designated market maker’s determination of where buy orders can be matched with sell orders at a single price. \nBut the reference price will play a part in Spotify’s eventual pricing. \nThough Spotify has not hired traditional underwriters - a move that will save it millions of dollars in fees - it has hired Citadel Securities as a market maker to set the opening price on the NYSE, with help from Morgan Stanley. \nWhile their roles will be limited, the reference price will be used while building the order book. Early on Tuesday, Citadel Securities and Morgan Stanley will analyze investors’ buy and sell orders and then set an opening price for the stock.
