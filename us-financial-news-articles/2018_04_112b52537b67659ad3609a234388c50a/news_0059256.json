The Company recently announced that it received FDA approval in the United States in addition to Health Canada approval for its clinical trial in Canada.\nWith the engagement of Topstone Research Inc.

In addition, the clinical trial sites have their own internal protocols for review and approval of the Company’s clinical trial protocol, agreement, overall budget and general procedures and equipment requirements.\nOf the potential sites, the Company has approximately 14 clinical trial sites in various stages of the on-boarding process including 5 sites that have approved the Company’s clinical trial agreement pending final review board or budget approvals.
