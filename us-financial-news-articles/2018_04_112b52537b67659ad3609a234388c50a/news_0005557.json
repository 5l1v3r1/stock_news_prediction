We're excited about the future partnership with Hydro One and are confident that this partnership will benefit AEL&P's customers.\"\nThe settlement agreement includes specific commitments that preserve the ownership structure and current operations of AEL&P, ensure customer rates will not be impacted by the transaction, enhance community giving and provide a $1 million rate credit over five years for AEL&P's customers. This rate credit would begin at the close of the transaction.\nThe settlement also clarifies that the transaction will not affect the ownership of Snettisham or RCA approval requirements for any future transfer of Snettisham, formalizes AEL&P's interconnection process and outlines a process for a biennial AEL&P system and planning presentation.\nPlease refer to rca.alaska.gov for the joint application, full settlement agreement and complete list of commitments.\nThe settlement agreement is subject to RCA review and approval.
