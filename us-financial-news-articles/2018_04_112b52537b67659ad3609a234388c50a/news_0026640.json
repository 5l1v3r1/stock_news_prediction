Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - Manchester City vs Liverpool - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 10, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola sat in the stands Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff \nCity have a 13-point lead over second-placed Manchester United with six league games left but have been jolted by a run of three straight defeats in all competitions. \nGuardiola’s side missed the chance to seal the title when they lost 3-2 at home to bitter rivals United last week, either side of two Champions League quarter-final defeats to Liverpool, and the Spaniard believes his side could still be vulnerable. \n“In football it can happen, of course it can, I assure you,” Guardiola told reporters. “It is in our hands. That is a good advantage. But in one week we have lost three games. That has happened. We have to try to focus on our games.” \nCity could clinch their third league title in seven seasons if they beat Tottenham on Saturday and United lose against West Bromwich Albion but Guardiola does not expect Jose Mourinho’s side to lose momentum in the final stretch. \n“My feeling is that United will win a lot of points because they are in a good shape and have top players. They are able to win their games — all six. \n“We are able to win two games. We have handled the pressure — good and bad situations — all season. So, we have to do it, like we have all season.” \nTottenham are fourth in the standings on 67 points and are unbeaten in their last 14 league games.
