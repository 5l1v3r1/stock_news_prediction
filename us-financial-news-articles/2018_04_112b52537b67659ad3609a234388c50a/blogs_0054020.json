And now we have a situation where we really have to start with developing green shipping that we need for the future,\" Norway's Minister of Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen said.\nThe International Maritime Organization's decision on this agreement will be in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, he said.\nAlthough it has traditionally been difficult to agree on a universal method to measure emissions in the huge and diverse shipping and aviation industry, Elvestuen said that will be worked on. Pauline Askin | Reuters Adelie penguins stand atop a block of melting ice on a rocky shoreline at Cape Denison, Commonwealth Bay, in East Antarctica.\nCountries should begin taking steps to reduce emissions however, as climate change becomes more pressing.\n\"Climate change and global warming is much more costly not to do anything, so what we really have to do is to start this change and start it right now,\" the minister said. He added that to achieve this goal, countries, organizations, and even local communities must be mobilized.
