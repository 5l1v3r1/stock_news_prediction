Jose Iglesias had three hits, two runs scored and three RBIs.\nWinning pitcher Jordan Zimmermann (1-0) gave up four runs on seven hits with seven strikeouts over 5 1/3 innings. Zimmermann exited his last start on April 11 in the first inning after being struck in the jaw by a line drive.\nManny Machado hit a pair of solo homers and drove in four runs for Baltimore. Chris Davis supplied a two-run shot, and Adam Jones contributed three doubles.\nLosing pitcher Alex Cobb (0-2) allowed seven runs (five earned) on 10 hits in 3 1/3 innings.\nThe Tigers scored in the first on Victor Martinez’s RBI single.\nDavis hit his second homer this season to give Baltimore a short-lived 2-1 lead in the second.\nDetroit roared right back with four runs in the bottom of the inning. Iglesias knocked in the first two with a triple. Candelario’s single and Nicholas Castellanos’ fielder’s choice grounder brought in the other runs.\nMachado cut the Tigers’ advantage to 5-3 in the third with his first homer of the game.\nCandelario made it 7-3 in the fourth when, with Martin on base, he drilled his third homer over the wall in left-center.\nThe Tigers blew the game open with their five-run fifth. They loaded the bases with no outs on three consecutive singles. Dixon Machado was hit by a pitch to force in a run before Martin’s slam to right-center.\nManny Machado crushed his fifth homer of the season to left in the sixth.\nMachado’s run-scoring groundout and Adam Jones’ ground-rule double cut the Tigers’ lead to 12-6 in the seventh.\nIglesias’ RBI double in the eighth brought home Detroit’s final run. Machado and Jones had run-scoring doubles for the Orioles in the ninth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T04:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:13:33.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
