(OTCQB:CCEL) (the “Company”), the world’s first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992, announced results for the fiscal first quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $6.2 million compared to $5.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, an 8% increase. The revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 consisted of $6.2 million in processing and storage fee revenue and $28,000 in product revenue compared to $5.6 million in processing and storage fees and $165,000 product revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nNet (Loss) Income\nThe Company reported a net loss of approximately $2.5 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended February 28, 2018 compared to net income of approximately $487,000 or $0.07 per basic and diluted common share for the same period in 2017. Net loss for the three months ended February 28, 2018 principally resulted from an 8% increase in revenue offset by a 6% increase in cost of sales, a 16% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, and approximately $3.0 million of non-cash income tax expense related to the reduction of the federal income tax rate to 21% as of January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The decrease in the federal income tax rate caused a decrease in the Company’s deferred tax asset which resulted in an increase in the income tax expense.\nAbout Cryo-Cell International, Inc.\nFounded in 1989, Cryo-Cell International, Inc. is the world's first private cord blood bank.
