REUTERS/Yuri Gripas “We’re going to increase our lending to lower-income countries,” Kim told a news conference about the plan to be discussed by the World Bank’s development committee on Saturday. “Just to be clear on this, there is nothing in the agreement that targets any specific country.”\nReuters reported last week that the $13.5 billion capital increase for the World Bank’s main concessional lending arm would lift China’s voting power and shareholding in the institution and bring lending reforms.\nThe Trump administration has chided the World Bank’s lending to higher-income countries such as China, saying they should “graduate” to non-concessional loans.\nReporting by David Lawder and Makini Brice; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T18:29:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
