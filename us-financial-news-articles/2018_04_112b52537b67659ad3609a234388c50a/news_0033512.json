Financial results of competitors in the satellite services industry have significant variations that can result from timing of capital expenditures, the amount of intangible assets recorded, the differences in assets’ lives, the timing and amount of investments, the effects of other income (expense), and unusual and non-recurring items. The use of Adjusted EBITDA assists Telesat and investors to compare operating results exclusive of these items. Competitors in the satellite services industry have significantly different capital structures. Telesat believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA improves comparability of performance by excluding interest expense.\nTelesat believes the use of Adjusted EBITDA along with IFRS financial measures enhances the understanding of Telesat’s operating results and is useful to Telesat and investors in comparing performance with competitors, estimating enterprise value and making investment decisions. Adjusted EBITDA as used here may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by competitors. Adjusted EBITDA should be used in conjunction with IFRS financial measures and is not presented as a substitute for cash flows from operations as a measure of Telesat’s liquidity or as a substitute for net income as an indicator of Telesat’s operating performance.\nSource: Telesat Canada", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1836f89e-1ac3-4ef6-af72-e5220766385f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=775oGk5DNThpYGcVe3G9OnrqG8oaHQov7cieOTZrGs7aUM8B-9ThsDyEnD7BKJQuOHUV9V5POHkTatuCERFsjw=="], "published": "2018-04-17T00:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T02:43:32.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
