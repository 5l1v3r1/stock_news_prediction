(TSX-V:FLY) (OTCQX:FLYLF) (the “Company” or “FLYHT”) is pleased to announce an aggregate USD $2.9 million in new sales contracts and purchase orders during the first quarter of 2018.\nLogos of participating companies\nThe first test flight for the ecoDemonstrator program.\nTen customers renewed their sales contracts for UpTime TM data services.\nThe renewal was broad and included operators in Canada, the Middle East, Australia, the Caribbean and Mexico. One operator in the Middle East re-signed for a portion of their fleet through a third-party contract which FLYHT had reported expired last summer. Two of the ten also expanded their fleets with Automated Flight Information Reporting System (AFIRS TM ) orders.\nFLYHT also sold AFIRS TM hardware kits to:\na new aerospace and defense Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for integration into one of its airframes, a new global leasing company, and an existing commercial OEM customer.\nIncluded in new sales contract amounts are additional orders from:\nan existing OEM partner (see release on July 15, 2014 ) for parts with related license fees for delivery, and a new agreement with a large global organization to monetize weather data from certain aircraft.\nAt quarter end, the sales order backlog for AFIRS kits and voice and data services exceeded $26 million 1 .\n“We are pleased to sign contract extensions with our current customers, which is the best demonstration of the value they receive from AFIRS,” stated FLYHT’s Chief Executive Officer, Tom Schmutz. “In addition to securing contracts with long-standing and new customers, FLYHT has been supporting the Boeing ecoDemonstrator Program and we are delivering exactly what we proposed.”\nThe Boeing ecoDemonstrator Program started flying in March and continues into April. FLYHT has been streaming flight data from the FedEx Express Boeing 777 Freighter to an UpTime TM Cloud animation which simulates the flight deck instrumentation, displays position on a map and creates a flying aircraft visualization. By also streaming flight deck audio, FLYHT has virtualized the flight deck environment on the ground, enhancing situational awareness and potentially satisfying future regulatory requirements.\n“We believe that FLYHT is the first company to stream cockpit area microphone data in real-time,” Schmutz remarked. “This neatly compliments our being the first to stream the flight data recorder in real time also.”\nFLYHT was issued five Supplemental Type Certificates (STC) for AFIRS 228 in the first quarter. FLYHT received the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) STCs for the Boeing 737– 300/400/500/700/800, the Boeing 757-200 and the Boeing 767-200/300 aircraft. FLYHT was also granted STCs from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the Boeing 737-900ER and Bombardier CRJ 100, 200, 440, 700, 705 and 900 models.\nConference Call Details\nFLYHT will host a live conference call to discuss fourth quarter results on Wednesday , April 11, 2018 at 7 am MDT (9 am EDT, 6 am PDT) .
