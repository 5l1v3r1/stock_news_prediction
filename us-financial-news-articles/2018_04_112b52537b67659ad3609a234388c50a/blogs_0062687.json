In contrast, those who concentrated on arts and performing arts or liberal arts and humanities feel the least secure about their futures, the survey found.\nCredit Karma's survey, which was conducted in April, included more than 1,000 parents and students, ages 18 to 72.\nMajor Reported being “very” or “extremely” confident in their 10-year financial future Political science/government 92% Engineering 90% Teaching/education 86% Computer science 77% Physical sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) 77% Nursing/health professions 75% Business/economics/finance 74% Social sciences (anthropology, sociology, psychology, etc.) 72% Liberal arts/humanities (English, comparative literature, languages, history) 55% Arts/performing arts 50% The key takeaway for college students is to think about \"what are the skills that might help you thrive with the degree that you love,\" said Katie O'Connor, director of content at Credit Karma.\nThat includes potentially pursuing double majors, internships or other strategies that will help boost your prospects at graduation.\n\"Don't not major in performing arts, but look at your career holistically,\" O'Connor said.\nOverall, 57 percent of college seniors said they feel ready to be financially independent. Parents surveyed were even more confident, with 67 percent indicating their child is ready for financial independence.\nThat comes as the unemployment rate is at a 17-year low at 4.1 percent .\nshow chapters Student debt could hold back economic growth, Fed chief says 1:59 PM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 01:23 But high-earning parents of graduating seniors were less likely to say they were confident in their children's financial futures.\nFifty-three percent of parents who make $150,000 or more a year said their college graduate is will be ready for financial independence after graduation. That compares to 72 percent of parents earning $100,000 to $149,999 and 68 percent of those making between $50,000 and $99,999.\nMore from College Game Plan:\nTo land an Ivy League spot, more families turn to pricey private consultants\nHere's why that college scholarship might not be so free after all\nTrump moves to cancel student loan debt for disabled veterans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T21:03:10.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
