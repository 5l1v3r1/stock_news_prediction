She said there was no transparency in the Iranian banking system.\n“The onus of responsibility lies in Iran and we’re going to continue to highlight the risks of doing business there because they haven’t taken the actions that they have promised they would take,” she said.\nMandelker also said she would be discussing with European allies how to disrupt North Korean efforts to evade sanctions.\nShe added that she looked forward to continued close working with Britain on sanctions against Russia.
