Carlyle spun off ManorCare’s real estate to Quality Care’s predecessor HCP Inc ( HCP.N ) for $6.1 billion in 2010 to unlock value. \nThat agreement called for ManorCare to pay $472.5 million of rent in the first year, with annual increases of 3 percent to 3.5 percent over the rest of the lease. Analysts say the amount was above the market and unsustainable. When ManorCare filed for bankruptcy, it owed $446 million in rent that was accruing at a minimum of $39.5 million every month. \nIf approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross in Delaware on Friday, the deal will put ManorCare’s properties and operations back under one roof. A new management team appointed by Quality Care will be led by Guy Sansone, managing director at turnaround advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal, who analysts said is likely to oversee the sale of facilities. \nThe reorganization plan provided for full payment to creditors, vendors and suppliers, besides Quality Care, while Carlyle will lose its entire equity stake. \nThe agreement includes a $116.7 million settlement for ManorCare’s former chief executive, Paul Ormond, who was owed compensation when he stepped down in September. \nThe deal is expected to close in the third quarter following government and regulatory approvals.
