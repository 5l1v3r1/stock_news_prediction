China’s Shanghai Composite index eased 0.9 percent and the blue-chip CSI300 was off 0.7 percent.\nTechnology shares were hit hard on Monday after U.S. President Donald Trump attacked Amazon.com over the pricing of its deliveries through the United States Postal Service and promised unspecified changes.\nThe selling added to what has been a rough patch for technology shares this year. Facebook, Apple and some of their peers had a woeful last quarter as investors reassessed high U.S. stock valuations in light of a cocktail of negative factors.\nSo called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - have been largely responsible for a multi-year bull run in world shares, although the threat of government regulation has raised worries about their outlook.\nInvestors were also on the backfoot as China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and stoking concerns about the impact on global growth.\nChina’s tit-for-tat tariffs hurt the U.S. dollar, although it saw some buying during early Asian trading on Tuesday to last trade at 105.93 yen, from a three-week peak of 107.01.\nThe dollar index was still a shade softer against a basket of currencies.\nOil prices ticked higher after falling more than 3.7 percent on Monday although rising Russian output and the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute still weighed.\nBrent crude rose 16 cents to $67.80 a barrel. U.S. crude gained 14 cents to $63.15.\nSpot gold ticked down 0.2 percent to $1,338.08 an ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo Editing by Jacqueline Wong and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T13:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:54:51.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
