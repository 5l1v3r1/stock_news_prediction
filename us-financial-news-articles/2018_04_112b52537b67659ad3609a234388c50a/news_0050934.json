The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was known to limit screen time for his kids. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates did the same.

But it's really important that she gets time to be with her thoughts and be with her blocks and be with her toys.\"\nReddit, which describes itself as \"the front page of the internet,\" is a social platform for people to post and talk about everything from news to gaming to movies and television, and everything in between.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
