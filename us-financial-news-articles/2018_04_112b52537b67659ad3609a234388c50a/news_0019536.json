The traditional new year, this weekend, is one of Cambodia’s main holidays. \nSam Serey, leader of a little-known group called the Khmer National Liberation Front (KNLF), could not be reached for comment. \nAuthorities have in the past accused the group of various plots and a court in 2014 convicted 13 members of plotting to overthrow the government. Rights groups said at the time the case was an attempt to discredit the opposition in general. \nSam Serey was sentenced in absentia in 2016 to nine years in prison. \nDespite the reports of anti-government plots, Hun Sen has maintained a firm hold on power for decades. \nCritics say he has intimidated opponents and rigged elections while human rights groups criticize his government’s record on rights. \nHun Sen and his government deny violating human rights and say they have brought peace, stability and relative prosperity to one of Asia’s poorest countries after decades of war and instability. \nPolitical analyst Lao Mong Hay said the latest suspected plot should not be used as excuse to crack down. \n“I hope alleged planned attacks will not be used as an excuse to further tighten the security measures and to further curtail the rights and freedoms of the Cambodian people,” he told Reuters. \nA court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party last year after it was found guilty of plotting to take power with the help of the United States. \nThe CNRP and the United States denied the accusation, which followed the arrest of CNRP party leader Kem Sokha on treason charges.
