We're beginning to believe that it could easily reach 300 million subscribers someday and they'll be willing to pay a heck of a lot more for the service. Why? Because it is such a bargain.\"\n\"That's why Netflix is the best-performing stock in 2018 for the S&P 500 ,\" Cramer continued. \"That's why it has a $145 billion market cap, very close to Disney and more than seven times the size of CBS . That's why Netflix is the most powerful force in the entertainment world today.\"\nNetflix's strength goes beyond Netflix itself. The company uses Amazon Web Services to get content onto the internet and ready for streaming, among other functions, and turns to Google's cloud platform for certain workloads.\nShares of Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company, popped more than 4 percent and 3 percent on Tuesday, respectively.\nAnd while social media giant Facebook isn't connected to Netflix on the business side, its stock gained 2 percent thanks to the exchange-traded funds that group the FANG stocks together, Cramer said.\nBetter yet, Netflix's strength extended to the cloud, brightening prospects for companies like Adobe , Red Hat and Salesforce.com , the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\"The more everyone gets familiar with the cloud for ordering from Amazon or watching programs on Netflix, the more comfortable they are using the cloud at work,\" he said. \"No wonder all of the cloud plays roared higher today.\"\nAs the market worries about the fate of U.S.-China relations, Cramer suggested investors look to the FANG stocks as a safe haven from the geopolitical concerns.\n\"Here's the bottom line: in a market that can't get comfortable with the drug stocks — [ Johnson & Johnson ] took a hit on a pretty good quarter — or the banks, as Goldman Sachs got smacked around on a terrific number , the cloud stocks soared today on the back of Netflix, and all I can say is the smallest stock in FANG has got some real broad shoulders,\" Cramer concluded.\nWATCH: Cramer talks FANG's influence on the market show chapters Cramer: Netflix's meteoric rise is helping the rest of FANG 20 Hours Ago | 11:59 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Goldman Sachs.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:59:14.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
