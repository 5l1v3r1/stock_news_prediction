Prices have stayed between roughly $1,305 and $1,360 this year, moving within that range based on safe-haven appetite from investors, swings in the dollar and worries about higher interest rates.\nSome worried money managers have been scooping up gold lately, as trade tensions between the U.S. and China have escalated and hurt stocks. Both countries have enacted tariffs aimed at products from the other country recently, stoking fears of a global trade war that could slow economic activity. But some analysts think markets will recover as long as the tariffs remain limited to individual countries.\nA rebound in stocks could limit demand for gold, as could a rise in the dollar, some analysts said. A stronger U.S. currency makes gold and other commodities denominated in dollars more expensive for overseas buyers. On Tuesday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, was up 0.1%.\n“We think that tariff fears will abate as the administration finds itself engaging in one-to-one negotiations,” said Edward Meir, a strategist at INTL FCStone, in a note to clients. “We therefore think that the trade war frenzy will likely retreat.”\nInvestors will be keeping an eye on economic data and central-bank speeches moving forward for the latest clues about whether the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates two or three more times this year following its March rate increase. Gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys as borrowing costs.\nAmong base metals, front-month copper for April delivery inched up 0.6% to $3.0580 in a fifth straight day of gains. Prices are still down 6.8% for the year following a nearly four-year high in late December, hurt by lukewarm economic data from China, the world’s largest copper consumer, and recent trade worries.\nTight liquidity conditions in China have also hurt sentiment, according to Marwan Younes, chief investment officer of New York-based hedge fund Massar Capital Management, though favorable global growth could lead to a rebound, he said.\n“I think this is what’s really been weighing on metals demand, but as long as this doesn’t translate into a wider global macro story, we think it’s only a temporary issue we should rebound from,” Mr. Younes said.\nWrite to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com and David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T07:17:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
