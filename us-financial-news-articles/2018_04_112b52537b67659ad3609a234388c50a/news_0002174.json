One of the foremost researchers at the center of the evidence-based school reform movement is Australian-based professor John Hattie, whose body of work known as the Visible Learning research is recognized as the world’s largest evidence base of those strategies and innovations that have the greatest impact on student learning. Today, Corwin announced the acquisition of Visible Learning plus , the school change model based on Hattie’s research, from the New Zealand-based Cognition Education Group.\nThe move cements Corwin’s position as a leading global provider of evidence-based professional learning and, significantly, now allows more widespread access to Visible Learning practices through Corwin’s presence in North America and Australia, their existing licensees in the UK (Osiris Education), Scandinavia (Challenging Learning), and the Netherlands (Bazalt and Onderwijs-Advies) as well as future global partners.\n“I am delighted to partner with Corwin, and together, advance the full impact of the Visible Learning plus model across the globe,” said Hattie. “I was first drawn to Corwin because of the organization’s deep commitment to rigorous research and record of service—it’s why we selected Corwin as the exclusive North American partner for Visible Learning plus in 2013 and our exclusive partner in Australia in 2015. Since then, I’ve observed firsthand their unwavering respect for the importance of independent research to inform education policy and practice, which has confirmed for me that Corwin is the best possible partner and permanent home for my lifework.”\n“Corwin’s mission has always been to help all educators realize their greatest impact through sustained professional learning,” said Mike Soules, president of Corwin. “Now, as John Hattie’s global partner and the official provider of Visible Learning plus around the world, we can work with education practitioners and policymakers across the globe to provide teachers and systems with a process for ongoing, data-driven professional learning, shifting the focus from teaching to learning.”\nHattie rose to prominence in the evidence-based school change movement through the meta-analyses he conducted to analyze the impact of individual factors influencing student achievement across multiple studies. The resulting Visible Learning research now represents the world’s largest evidence base on what works best in schools to improve learning, spanning more than 1,400 meta-analyses of 90,000 individual research studies, involving more than 250 million students around the world. To date, Hattie has identified 250 factors that influence student achievement.\nSaid Hattie, “With Corwin as our global partner, we have a real chance to make professional learning an effective tool for teachers to continuously improve their craft and give every student the opportunity to achieve her or his potential.”\nThanks to this partnership and its commitment to continuing this critical research, generations to come will be able to rely on Corwin for the essential insights on what works best in teaching and learning, and tools that enable them to evaluate their own impact on student learning.\nLearn more about the Visible Learning research.\nLearn more about the Visible Learning plus model.\nSee examples of Visible Learning plus in practice.\nCorwin , a SAGE Publishing company, was established in 1990, first as a professional book publisher, now as a full-service professional learning company, offering professional development solutions on the topics that matter most and the delivery methods that work best to achieve a school or district’s objectives.
