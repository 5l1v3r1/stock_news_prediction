Prices rose 1.1 percent in 2017, helped by pent-up demand and stronger economic growth.\nPrices of non-landed private homes rose 5 percent in the first quarter in the core central region, which includes the Orchard Road shopping area, helped by condominium projects such as City Developments’ New Futura and GuocoLand Ltd’s Martin Modern.\nUnits at Martin Modern, for example, are being transacted at about S$2,700 per square foot this year, compared with S$2,300 when it launched last year, estimated Christine Li, head of research, at consultancy Cushman and Wakefield in Singapore.\nShe said high-end properties were also seeing increased demand from foreigners, and now forecasting home prices to rise 7-10 percent this year.\n“Buyers are biting the bullet to just take the plunge, thinking that prices will go much higher in future.”\nThe URA will provide updated detailed data later this month.
