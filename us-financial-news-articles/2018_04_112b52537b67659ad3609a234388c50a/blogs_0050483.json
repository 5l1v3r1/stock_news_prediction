Chinnappa/File photo Xiaomi - which makes dozens of internet-connected products including scooters, water purifiers and televisions - said in a statement on Wednesday that any profits from hardware exceeding the 5 percent quota will be distributed among users, without giving specific details.\nThe promise comes as the company is looking to market its internet services business to investors ahead of an IPO that could potentially value the smartphone maker at $100 billion.\n“We have always viewed our hardware as the gateway to providing our users with Internet services,” said founder and Chief Executive Lei Jun.\nCustomers enter a Xiaomi shop in a shpping mall in Barcelona, Spain February 28, 2018.

Its non-hardware revenue streams are linked to its user interface, “MIUI”, and include entertainment subscriptions and financial services.\nA man checks a Virtual Reality device inside Xiaomi booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Sergio Perez The five percent cap only applies to the company’s consumer hardware products, it said.\nXiaomi has also invested in making its own chipsets and microprocessors, which will not fall under the cap.\nXiaomi rose rapidly to become the world’s largest startup in 2014 by selling its smartphones with thin margins, cutting costs by using online retail channels and doing minimal marketing.\nAfter a slump in sales in 2016, the company has since undergone a strategic shift, opening hundreds of offline stores to sell its growing collection of smart devices and reclaiming a large part of its previous market share.\nIt has also expanded heavily into foreign markets, including India, where it is now the top smartphone vendor, according to research firm Canalys.\n($1 = 6.3112 Chinese yuan)\n(This version of the story corrects to say cap applies to after-tax profits, not total profits)\nReporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T11:00:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
