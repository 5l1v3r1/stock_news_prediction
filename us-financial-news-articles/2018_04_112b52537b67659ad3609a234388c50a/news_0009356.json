New York loaded the bases when Orioles reliever Darren O’Day hit Gary Sanchez above the belt. But O’Day retired Neil Walker on a soft ground ball to get out of the inning.\nBrad Brach notched his first save, striking out Brett Gardner to end the game with Yankees slugger Aaron Judge in the on-deck circle.\nJudge hit his 12th career homer against the Orioles in the sixth inning. It was his 58th career homer in his 189th game, making him the quickest player to get 58 homers.\nThe Yankees went 1-for-9 with runners in scoring position.\nTanaka (1-1) allowed three runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings.\nThe Orioles nearly took a 1-0 lead with two outs in the first.\nMancini appeared to score from first on a double by Jones to left field, but the Yankees challenged the tag play and the call was overturned.\nTanaka retired 10 in a row after Mancini’s two-out single in the third. He received some help from his defense as Stanton made a running catch in left field on Manny Machado to end the third and Walker raced in from first and leaned over the dugout railing to catch a foul pop by Machado to end the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:44:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
