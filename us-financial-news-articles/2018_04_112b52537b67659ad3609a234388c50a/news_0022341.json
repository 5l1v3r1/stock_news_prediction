The championship in Russia is better than in China, but it’s not England or Germany so I adapt myself for this.\n“And now I’m doing the same.”\nSoccer Football - Belgium Training - Belgium Football Centre, Tubize, Belgium - March 26, 2018 Belgium's Axel Witsel during training REUTERS/Francois Lenoir With a top quality squad featuring the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Kevin De Bruyne, Belgium will go to Russia among the favorites and have been drawn to face England, Panama and Tunisia in the group phase.\n“When you start a tournament like the World Cup, you start to win the World Cup,” he said.\n“We have the squad and the team to go as far as we can and we’re going to do our best. First is to try to do better than the last World Cup and the last Euro in France.\n“It’s a good group, but we have our objective is to be first in this one.”\nBelgium reached the quarter-finals of the 2014 World Cup before being knocked out at the same stage of Euro 2016 under previous coach Marc Wilmots, who has since been replaced by former Wigan Athletic and Everton manager Martinez.\nThe Spaniard, who was appointed in August 2016, is working to instill a more ruthless approach into the squad, said Witsel.\n“He wants for us to have a winner’s mentality,” he said. “We missed that even in the friendly games.\n“Before, sometimes we took them like friendly games. Now, even in training, we make some games with some teams and he wants us to put us all the time in competition and I think that is important because if you want to win a World Cup you have to have a winner’s mentality.”\nReporting by Michael Church, Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T07:20:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
