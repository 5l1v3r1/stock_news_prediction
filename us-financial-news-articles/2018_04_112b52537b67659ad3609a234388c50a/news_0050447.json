REUTERS/Kevork Djansezian\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered a lower court to release the “All Eyes on You” rapper and grant him a new hearing because of “credibility issues with a police officer who was a ‘critical witness’” in his 2008 gun and drug convictions, court documents show.\nMeek Mill’s attorney, Joe Tacopina, said on Tuesday that the 30-year-old rapper had been released from jail near Philadelphia.\n“I’d like to thank God, my family and all my public advocates for their love, support and encouragement during this difficult time,” Meek Mill said in statement on Twitter.\n“While the past five months have been a nightmare, the prayers, visits, calls, letters and rallies have helped me stay positive,” he added.\nMeek Mill, whose legal name is Robert Williams, was sentenced in November to two-four years in state prison for probation violations stemming from his 2008 conviction.\nHis case, which became a cause for recording artists, athletes and celebrities, was seen by criminal justice reform advocates as emblematic of a legal system they say treats minorities unjustly and hands out too harsh of punishments.\nActor and comedian Kevin Hart was filmed visiting Meek Mill in prison on Tuesday. Meek Mill counted Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, rapper Jay Z and the owner of football’s New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, among his most prominent supporters.\n“I understand that many people of color across the country don’t have that luxury and I plan to use my platform to shine a light on those issues,” Meek Mill said in Tuesday’s statement.\nMeek Mill’s time in jail resulted from an August 2017 arrest in New York City for allegedly driving a motorcycle recklessly while filming a music video, and a prior altercation in St. Louis.\nA lower court now has 60 days to decide whether he should get a new trial; prosecutors could also choose to drop the charges.\nProsecutors recently agreed with Meek Mill’s defense lawyers on the credibility problems of the police officer in his 2008 conviction, saying the rapper should be granted immediate bail.
