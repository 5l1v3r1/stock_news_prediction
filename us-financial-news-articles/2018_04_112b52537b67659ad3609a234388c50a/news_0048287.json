(NASDAQ: MDXG), a leading developer and marketer of regenerative and therapeutic biologics, today announced certain unreviewed results for the first quarter of 2018, announced its revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2018, and increased its revenue guidance for full year 2018. The Company reaffirmed its expectations for gross margin, operating income, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share. The Company previously announced its unreviewed revenue results for the first quarter had exceeded its first quarter revenue guidance.\nParker H. \"Pete\" Petit, Chairman and CEO stated, \"The first quarter revenue growth is a clear demonstration of the strength of our product lines, our sales management system and the talent we have assembled in our sales and other key functions within our organization. Based upon our strong first quarter performance, we have raised our full year revenue guidance from a previous range of $383 million to $387 million to a revised range of $389 million to $394 million. We are also tracking to our annual goals previously announced on December 13, 2017, regarding gross margin (89% to 90%), operating income margin (15% to 17%), GAAP diluted earnings per share ($0.30 to $0.35) and adjusted earnings per share ($0.45 to $0.50). Furthermore, we are providing second quarter revenue guidance in the range of $96 million to $98 million. The number of active customer accounts grew by more than 25% last year and they are continually broadening as our allografts are becoming part of the standard of care among the physicians who have access to our products. Our cash flow continues to be strong.\"\n\"The winter of 2018 seems to never want to end in the heavily populated north east and other parts of the country,\" commented Bill Taylor, President and COO. \"Through the incredible work ethic and dedication of our sales organization, we overcame the weather obstacles that Mother Nature threw at us this quarter. We also made excellent progress in the execution of our biopharmaceutical strategy. Early in the first quarter, we announced that the first patients had been randomized and enrolled in the Phase 3 Investigational New Drug (IND) clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of our AmnioFixÂ® Injectable in patients with recalcitrant Plantar Fasciitis pain. Shortly after that, we announced the randomization and enrollment of the first patients in the Company's Phase 3 IND clinical trial for our micronized AmnioFix Injectable in the treatment of Achilles Tendonitis. Late in the first quarter, we announced another milestone in our biopharmaceutical strategy with the enrollment of the first patients in our Phase 2B IND clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of AmnioFix Injectable as a treatment for pain associated with Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. As announced, initiation of the Phase 2B study followed quickly after the FDA granted MiMedx RMAT designation for Knee OA. In addition to our strong sales performance and the significant progress in our clinical studies, other aspects of our business operations also achieved very solid results. Our business fundamentals are extremely sound, and we are excited about our prospects for continuing on this trajectory.\"\n\"We are very proud of our organization and the ability of our employees to keep their intense focus on serving our physicians and their patients. Our regenerative biomaterials produce outstanding clinical results, and our employees are unwavering in their dedication. We could not be more gratified with the manner in which our MiMedx Team is performing,\" concluded Petit.\n2017 Form 10-K\nAs previously disclosed, the Audit Committee of MiMedx's Board of Directors has engaged independent legal and accounting advisors to conduct an internal investigation into matters related to allegations regarding certain sales and distribution practices at the Company.
