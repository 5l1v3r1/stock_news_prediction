Ajay Gupta was declared a “fugitive from justice” and left South Africa for Dubai in February.\nThe Gupta family lawyer, Mr Gert van der Merwe, was not reachable for comment, with his office saying he was abroad. The Gupta family spokesman could also not be reached.\nThe Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing after being accused by the public anti-graft watchdog of using their friendship with Zuma to influence policy and amass wealth. Zuma has also denied any wrongdoing.\nReporting by Mfuneko Toyana; Writing by James Macharia; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T16:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:54:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
