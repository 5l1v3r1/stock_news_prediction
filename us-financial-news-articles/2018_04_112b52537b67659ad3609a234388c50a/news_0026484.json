He denies any involvement. \nAmong those detained, more than 50,000 have been formally charged and kept in jail during their trials. \nTurkey’s Western allies have criticised the crackdown. Critics of President Tayyip Erdogan accuse him of using the failed putsch as a pretext to quash dissent. Turkey says the measures are necessary to combat threats to national security.
