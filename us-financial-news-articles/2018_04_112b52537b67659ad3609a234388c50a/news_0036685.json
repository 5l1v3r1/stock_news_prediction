German police, which also involved Germany's GSG9 special operations police unit, wait outside a building as they raid sites across the country, in a crackdown on human trafficking and forced prostitution in Maintal, south of Frankfurt, Germany, April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach \nPolice said on Twitter that the raids, which involved more than 1,500 officers, prosecutors and tax officials, represented the biggest mass search in the history of the federal force. \nThe investigation has turned up 56 people, aged 26 to 66, who are suspected of crimes related to human trafficking, forced prostitution, pimping, withholding of wages and tax evasion, the Frankfurt general prosecutor’s office said in a statement.
