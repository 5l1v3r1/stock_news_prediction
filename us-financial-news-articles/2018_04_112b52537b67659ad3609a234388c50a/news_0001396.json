It was full gas every day for three days.\n“Think of the passion of Twenty20 cricket, IPL and Ryder Cup, and the engagement the fans have with those events. The important thing was that teams and riders liked it.”\nTeam Sky will be joined in the 2018 series by world champion Peter Sagan’s Bora-Hansgrohe team while Team Sunweb, second last year, are fully committed to the races.\nThe exact nature of the Hong Kong finale is yet to be revealed but Bartlett promised a “big finish” to the season.\nUAE Team Emirates team manager Carlo Sarroni said the Hammer race could help establish Hong Kong on the UCI cycling map.\n“Hong Kong has everything to become an important appointment in the world cycling calendar and the Hammer Series leg will be the best way to make a huge step towards this goal,” he said.\nReporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T10:36:21.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
