Related Coverage Saudi Aramco says Jizan facilities safe after Houthis claim attack \nThe coalition has launched thousands of air strikes which have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. \nThe Houthis have stepped up ballistic missile attacks on the kingdom in what it says is retaliation for the air raids. \nThey have frequently claimed attacks, including on Aramco facilities, that Saudi Arabia and its main ally the United Arab Emirates have either said did not happen or were intercepted. \nThe group unveiled what it said was a series of drones, including the Qasef-1, at a ceremony last year. \nThe arms monitor Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said it had evidence showing the Qasef-1 and other Houthi kit was made in Iran and was not of indigenous design and construction “in contrast to Houthi statements”. \nThe coalition accuses the Houthis of being armed and supported by Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny.
