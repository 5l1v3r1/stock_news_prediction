They managed to raise prices and also manage costs there despite higher pulp prices,” said Antti Viljakainen, analyst at research firm Inderes, who has a “reduce” rating on the stock.\nThe majority of Stora’s profit comes from pulp and packaging board. Pulp is needed in making not only paper but also tissues and packaging board, products that are growing on the back of Chinese demand.\nPaperboard demand has also been boosted by increasing global online shopping.\nFor the second quarter, Stora forecast a flat or lower profit than the first quarter due to maintenance shutdowns.
