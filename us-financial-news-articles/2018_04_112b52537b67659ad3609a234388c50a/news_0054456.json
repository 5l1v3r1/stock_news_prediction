Bush’s collection, and 1,200 branches from American-grown cherry blossom trees that lined the hallway outside the State Dining Room.\nInside the dining room, tables were decorated with 2,500 stems of white sweet peas, 1,000 stems of white lilac, and there were plenty of French influences on the menu as a tribute to the guests of honor, French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte. The main course included rack of spring lamb with a burnt cipollini soubise, and the wines paired with the meal included a pair of Oregon products that the vintners fermented in French oak barrels.\nRelated\nVideo: Trump and Macron Discuss Iran Nuclear Deal Macron’s Washington Visit Tests Whether Friendship Trumps Policy Divides President Donald Trump, wearing a black tuxedo, and first lady Melania Trump, wearing a shimmery black Chantilly lace Chanel Haute Couture gown, hand painted with silver and embroidered with crystal and sequins, along with gunmetal stiletto heels, greeted the Macrons with a flourish of trumpets and beating drums. As a steady rain fell, Messrs. Macron and Trump exchanged a handshake and a two-cheeked kiss.\nAt the dinner, which included about 130 business leaders, sports stars and politicians—among them House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Louisiana Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards—Mr. Trump toasted a U.S.-French partnership that was “forged in battle.” “May our friendship grow even deeper, may our kinship grow even stronger, and may our sacred liberty never die,” Mr. Trump said.\nMr. Macron toasted the alliance, noting “how deep, how strong, and how intense the relationship is between our countries.” He also pointed to the personal relationship and parallels between the two presidents, noting they were underdog candidates and “both know that none of us easily changes our minds.”\n“But we will work together, and we have this ability to listen to one another,” he said, closing by praising “the unbreakable friendship between France and the United States.”\nWrite to Michael C.
