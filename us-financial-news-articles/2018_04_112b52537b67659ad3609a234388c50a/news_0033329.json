More information about the risks and uncertainties affecting DIV’s business and the businesses of its royalty partners can be found in the “Risk Factors” section of its Annual Information Form dated March 28, 2018, which is available under DIV’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nIn formulating the forward-looking information and financial outlook contained herein, management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting DIV and its royalty partners will continue substantially in the ordinary course, including without limitation with respect to general industry conditions, general levels of economic activity and regulations. These assumptions, although considered reasonable by management at the time of preparation, may prove to be incorrect.\nTo the extent any forward-looking information or statements in this presentation constitute a “financial outlook” within the meaning of securities laws, such information is being provided investors with timely disclosure of material financial information with respect to the financial performance of the Company and its royalty partners prior to the completion of year end audits.\nAll of the forward-looking information and financial outlook disclosed in this news release is qualified by these cautionary statements and other cautionary statements or factors contained herein, and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that it will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, DIV.

By considering these measures in combination with the most closely comparable IFRS measure, management believes that investors are provided with additional and more useful information about the Company than investors would have if they simply considered IFRS measures alone. The non-IFRS financial measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that non-IFRS measures should not be construed as a substitute or an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n“Same Store Sales Growth” is used as a non-IFRS measure in this press release. Further details with respect to this non-IFRS measure will be included in the Company’s management’s discussion and analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 once filed.\nThird Party Information\nThis news release includes information obtained from third party company filings and reports and other publicly available sources.
