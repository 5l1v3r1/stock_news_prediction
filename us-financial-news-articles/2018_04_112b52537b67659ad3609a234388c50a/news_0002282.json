It is designed to have a maximum impact on traffic,” the state-appointed head of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, told Le Journal du Dimanche.\nTransport Minister Elizabeth Borne has promised a gradual opening of the rail network to competition from 2020 and has offered assurances that existing rail workers would have to make few sacrifices.\n“Current rail workers will keep their (employment) status and most of their advantages if they are moved to a competitor. In these conditions, I’ve got to ask what’s the problem?” Borne told Le Parisien newspaper.\nA reform of the labour code in September left unions divided with the biggest, the CFDT, opting out of strikes organised by the second-biggest, the CGT.
