Strategic alternatives to be considered may include a commercial agreement – such as a licensing, joint venture or partnership – with another company, a merger or other business combination with another party, or a specific action approved by the Board that warrants an announcement. The company does not intend to discuss the process or comment unless and until the Board believes disclosure is appropriate or has approved an action.
