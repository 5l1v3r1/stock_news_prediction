Elliott believes shareholders need a united board, not one divided and mired in litigation with its own statutory auditors,” it said.\n“Shareholders deserve the opportunity to unlock significant value by supporting Elliott’s proposal, which begins with electing a truly independent Board of Directors on April 24,” the fund added in a statement.
