A car hangs on the wall of Jaguar's Castle Bromwich manufacturing facility in Birmingham, Britain, November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Darren Staples \nOutput will be cut at its central English Solihull and Castle Bromwich plants, affecting some 1,000 agency workers, the source said. \nA spokesman at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) declined to comment on the number of jobs which would be lost but the firm said it would be making changes to its output plans.
