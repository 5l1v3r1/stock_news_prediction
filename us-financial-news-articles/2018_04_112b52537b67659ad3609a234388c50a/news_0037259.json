Now, it’s adding new features to build up its community of AR developers and, in turn, attract and retain users. \nSnap is releasing seven new templates into Lens Studio that will give developers the ability to create virtual face paint and baseball hats, distort faces, and even attach 2D and 3D images to a user’s head .
