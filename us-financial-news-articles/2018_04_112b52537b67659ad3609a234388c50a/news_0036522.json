But even though the airline faced a \"perfect storm,\" it continued to operated with \"very solid\" load factors, he added. \nThe airline will be cutting some of its routes in the year ahead as it continues with a review to turn its business around. Etihad will suspend flights to Edinburgh, Scotland and Perth, Australia, as part of that review, but Baumgartner said that did not affect the airline's global ambition.\n\"This is a constant evaluation that is not a one-time cut and then you are done for the next 10 years.
