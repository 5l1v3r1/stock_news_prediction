The last time Germany won the Fed Cup title was in 1992 in Frankfurt.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Clare Fallon\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:54:38.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
