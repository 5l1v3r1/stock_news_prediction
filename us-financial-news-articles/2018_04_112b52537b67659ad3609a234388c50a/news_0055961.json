The issue at play regards the Employee Retirement Income Security Act which requires the bankers that serve retirement accounts to put the interest of their client ahead of those of the bank.\nPeople familiar with the matter told the Journal that the bank has workers retention goals associated with keeping retirement accounts in-house. Those individuals also allege that bankers would put clients’ money intentionally in shares that involve a high fee.\nDuring its annual financial report last month, Wells Fargo acknowledged the federal inquiries and said “A review of certain activities within Wealth and Investment Management (WIM) being conducted by the Board, in response to inquiries from federal government agencies , is assessing whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations, including with respect to rollovers for 401(k) plan participants, certain alternative investments, or referrals of brokerage customers to the Company’s investment and fiduciary services business.”\nLast week, the bank agreed to pay a $1 billion fine over misconduct claims surrounding its auto and mortgage lending businesses.
