REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo State lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and oil major Eni, who jointly control Saipem, included Cao’s name in the slate of directors they will propose at a shareholder meeting in May.\nCao’s name was second in the list, a position which traditionally indicates the name of the potential CEO.\nSaipem shares have fallen more than 80 percent in the last three years as the sector continues to suffer from lower spending from oil majors.
