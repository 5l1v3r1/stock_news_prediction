I want to be capable of competing and if you want to compete in the Premier League or this market, then you have to compete in everything ... \n“I’d like to do that and at the same time, I like to improve players, coach players, follow a business plan, a realistic business plan in modern football. I have no problem with that because I did it in the past.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T10:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T12:08:26.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
