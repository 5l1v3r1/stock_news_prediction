It is difficult because we lose our run for the Europa League cup, but congratulations to Burnley. They deserve it,” said the Frenchman. \n“They have been consistent in their play. There were a lot of battles in the beginning of the match. It was close but after the two goals it was surprising,” he added. \nDyche was less certain that qualification was now on the cards. \n“We’re in very good shape,” he said. “The biggest thing for me is to stay focused on what we want to do. Now it’s open-minded and see how far we can go.” Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ken Ferris, Neville Dalton", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T20:29:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
