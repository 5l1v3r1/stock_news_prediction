It says it only recognizes about 231,000 internally displaced Congolese compared with U.N. estimates of around 4.3 million - 19 times higher.\nThe government is also shunning a conference this month in Geneva organized by the United Nations and other donors in an effort to raise $1.7 billion for Congo, saying the focus on humanitarian woes is deterring investment.\nIn the statement, U.N. Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock said that since the Level 3 emergency was activated for Congo last October over 1.1 million people had received life-saving aid.\n“The benchmarks established on 20 October 2017 to measure the L3 scale-up have largely been met. The L3 status will accordingly be deactivated on 20 April 2018,” Lowcock said.\nThe crisis in Congo’s perpetually volatile east - where conflict, hunger and disease killed millions in civil wars around the turn of the century - has been further fueled by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired in 2016.\nKabila denies clinging to power and says that elections have been delayed because of logistical problems.\nRenewed violence between Lendu farmers and Hema herders in the eastern Ituri province since February has also killed dozens and forced more than 60,000 to flee to neighboring Uganda.\nReporting by Fiston Mahama; Writing by Aaron Ross; Editing by Tim Cocks and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T21:35:26.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
