They were charged with “providing information that is destructive to national defence to a foreign state” after they were caught filing stories to RFA. \nBoth men deny the charge against them which carries a prison term of up to 15 years. \n“It is very unjust. They intend for us to suffer,” a handcuffed Yeang Sothearin told reporters as police took him away after the hearing. \n“The government took revenge on us because we broadcasted the real situation about Cambodia.” \nA government spokesman, Phay Siphan, rejected any suggestion the government was taking revenge on the pair, saying: “We cannot accept what he said.” \nThe reporters were arrested days before the Supreme Court dissolved the main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party after it was accused of plotting to take power with the help of the United States. \nThe party and the United States denied the accusation. \nHun Sen and his government reject accusation of human rights violations.
