REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Vornado, one of New York’s largest property owners which has a 49.5 percent stake in the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, did not disclose the terms of the potential deal.\n“I believe we now have a handshake to sell our interest to our partner at a price which will repay our investment plus a mezzanine type return,” Vornado’s Chairman Steven Roth wrote in a letter to shareholders.\nIn February, Vornado said it would sell its minority stake in the building, which is controlled by Kushner Cos - the real estate company once headed by President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nKushner in January 2017 sold his interests in Kushner Cos to a family trust as part of an effort to avoid conflicts of interest. The building has faced scrutiny as a series of foreign investors, including a former Qatari prime minister, considered investing in its planned redevelopment.\nReporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T06:26:59.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
