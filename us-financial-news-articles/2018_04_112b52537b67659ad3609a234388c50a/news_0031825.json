We found it to be widespread. The way that these women were being exploited ... was just harrowing,” she said.\nOne woman was Quote: d in the report saying: “We cannot be alone outside the camp, it’s not safe for us. But really it’s the same inside the camp. Nowhere is safe.”\nReports of abuse inside and outside such camps were confirmed to the Foundation by several rights organizations working in Iraq.\nWaldman said those targeting women included security forces protecting the camps and members of militia groups.\n“They’re abusing their power,” she said.\nRepresentatives for the Iraqi government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWomen whose husbands or fathers have been killed or gone missing are vulnerable to forced marriages, destitution and violence, aid workers say.\nMany are at added risk if they are illiterate and do not know how to obtain identity documents for access to government help or food aid.\n“After what they’ve gone through, their vulnerability makes them victims of human exploitation once again,” Karl Schembri, Middle East regional media adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council, told the Foundation.\nAmnesty warned the situation was likely to get worse due to funding shortfalls for the country’s humanitarian crisis.\nIraqi officials say $88 billion is needed for reconstruction alone, significantly more than what has been pledged or given by international donors.\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry; Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
