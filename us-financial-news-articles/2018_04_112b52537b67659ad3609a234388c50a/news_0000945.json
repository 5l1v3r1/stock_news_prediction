On Tuesday, Italy’s statistics office ISTAT said in a statement it had received this guidance from Eurostat on March 31. \nISTAT released its 2017 annual figures for deficit and debt on March 1. \nThe budget deficit came in at 1.9 percent of gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in 2016 and below the government’s target of 2.1 percent. Debt fell last year to 131.5 percent of output from a record high of 132.0 percent in 2016. \nISTAT said it would incorporate Eurostat’s calculations in revised data to be issued on Wednesday. $1 = 0.8154 euros Reporting by Steve Scherer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:55:46.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
