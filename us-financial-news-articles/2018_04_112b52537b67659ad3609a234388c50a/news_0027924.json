REUTERS/Mike Theiler “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said in an e-mailed statement provided to Reuters. “I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.”\nAt a hearing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday, a judge ordered a lawyer for Cohen to disclose that Hannity is a client of Cohen.\nReporting By Jessica Toonkel; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T01:45:51.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
