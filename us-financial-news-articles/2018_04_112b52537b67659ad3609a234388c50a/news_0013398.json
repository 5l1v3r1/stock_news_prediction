We had an hydraulic leak in (the last) Melbourne race and were fortunate to finish the race,” a Mercedes spokesman said. \n“Unfortunately we couldn’t repair the box within the six race cycle so need to take a fresh one, incurring the grid penalty.” \nHamilton finished second in the Australian season-opener two weeks ago, after storming to pole position. \nThe race was won by Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, thanks to a stroke of luck provided by the deployment of the virtual safety car at just the right time for the German, also a four-times champion. \nFerrari were one-two at the top of the end of day practice timesheets in Bahrain on Friday, with 2007 champion Kimi Raikkonen ahead of Vettel. \nHamilton is still on course to rack up his 27th successive points finish, a result that would equal Raikkonen’s all-time record. \nThe Briton’s team mate Valtteri Bottas took pole in Bahrain last year, the fifth year in a row that a Mercedes driver had done that, but Vettel won the race. \nThe winner in Bahrain has started on pole on five of the past 13 occasions.
