We’re all excited to contemplate six great new Silva novels in the future, starting with the marvelous The Other Woman,” said Jonathan Burnham, Publisher and President of Harper.\nSilva was the first author to publish as part of the company’s Global Publishing Program. Since then, his books have been published by HarperCollins in 24 countries and 15 languages, hit bestseller lists in six markets, and seen a 60% percent increase in sales from The Heist to The English Spy and continued sustained growth with the publication of The Black Widow. For the seven novels Harper has published, sales have accumulated to 5.5 million copies worldwide.\nSilva's critically acclaimed, bestselling series based around art restorer and spy Gabriel Allon is being developed into a television series by MGM—the home of James Bond and The Handmaid's Tale.\nDaniel Silva is the award-winning, number one New York Times bestselling author of The Unlikely Spy, The Mark of the Assassin, The Marching Season, The Kill Artist, The English Assassin, The Confessor, A Death in Vienna, Prince of Fire, The Messenger, The Secret Servant, Moscow Rules, The Defector, The Rembrandt Affair, Portrait of a Spy, The Fallen Angel, The English Girl, The Heist, The English Spy, The Black Widow, House of Spies and The Other Woman (2018).
