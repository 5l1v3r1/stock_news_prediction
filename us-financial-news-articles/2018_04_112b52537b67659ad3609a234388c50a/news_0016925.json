Mats Pettersson was appointed Chairman and Deirdre P. Connelly was appointed Deputy Chairman. It was decided to grant 5,184 restricted stock units and 14,954 warrants to employees of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries.\nEach restricted stock unit is awarded cost-free and provides the owner with a right and obligation to receive one share in Genmab A/S of nominally DKK 1. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is equal to the closing market price on the date of grant of one Genmab A/S share, DKK 1,210.\nThe restricted stock units will vest on the first banking day of the month following a period of three years from the date of grant. Furthermore, the restricted stock units are subject to vesting conditions set out in the restricted stock unit program adopted by the board of directors in accordance with the general guidelines for incentive-based remuneration adopted by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. Information concerning Genmab's restricted stock unit program can be found on www.genmab.com under Investors > Stock information > Restricted stock units.\nThe exercise price for each warrant is DKK 1,210. Each warrant is awarded cost-free and entitles the owner to subscribe one share of nominally DKK 1 subject to payment of the exercise price. By application of the Black-Scholes formula, the fair value of each warrant can be calculated as DKK 419.69.\nThe warrants vest three years after the grant date, and all warrants expire at the seventh anniversary of the grant date. The new warrants were granted pursuant to the warrant plan adopted by the board on March 28, 2017. Information concerning Genmab’s warrant schemes can be found on www.genmab.com under Investors > Stock information > Warrants.\nAbout Genmab\nGenmab is a publicly traded, international biotechnology company specializing in the creation and development of differentiated antibody therapeutics for the treatment of cancer.
