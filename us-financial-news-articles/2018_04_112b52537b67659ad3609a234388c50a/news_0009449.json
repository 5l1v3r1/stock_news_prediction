The office of the website was shut down on the same day. \nBased on police investigations since Tuesday, a prosecutor in Cairo’s Dokki district accused Sabry of belonging to a terrorist group, publishing false news, using text and visuals that contradict the constitution, and inciting demonstrations, said Eman Mohamed, the defendant’s lawyer. \nPolice and prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment. \nSabry denied the accusations, Mohamed told Reuters. Mohamed said the defence team had presented to the prosecution documents that proved the website has the necessary permits to operate. \nThe editor-in-chief’s arrest came two days after the Supreme Council for Media Regulation, an official oversight body, told the Masr al-Arabia website to pay about $2,800 as a fine for republishing a New York Times article on alleged irregularities during last week’s presidential election. \nThe New York Times defended its reporting. “We stand by the accuracy of our reporting and strongly condemn any arrests meant to intimidate journalists and stifle freedom of the press,” Danielle Rhoades Ha, a spokeswoman for the New York Times Co, said on Tuesday. \nMasr al-Arabia is one of about 500 websites that in recent months have been blocked in Egypt, although some are still accessible through virtual networks. Rights groups say the closures amount to a crackdown on freedom of expression. \nAuthorities say curbing fictitious news is necessary for national security. \nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi won a second term with 97 percent of the votes on a turnout of 41 percent, official results showed on Monday.
