In North America, sales rose just 1 percent, negatively impacted by Monster, which Randstad acquired for $429 million in 2016.\nMonster sales fell 16 percent, following a fall of 15 percent in the previous quarter.\nIts EBITA margin was minus 1.7 percent versus minus 0.3 percent a year earlier, reflecting higher costs.\nRandstad Chief Executive Jacques van den Broek said he hoped to turn Monster around in 2018 through continued investment in branding and technology. But efforts to generate new business were so far unable to make up for a “leaking away” of traditional revenue streams, he said.\n“The top line for us is still an issue,” he said in an interview... We have created a cost base where we can work with lower revenue, but the minus 16 percent should not continue through the year.”\nLooking ahead, Randstad said it expects the next quarter to be impacted by “a moderate increase in underlying operating expenses” but that its gross margin is expected to be broadly stable quarter on quarter.\n“Overall market circumstances remained positive. We continue to outperform in most relevant markets,” he said.\n$1 = 0.8187 euros Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:55:05.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
