But Gurley writes that he loves that \"no driver-partner is ever told where or when to work\" at Uber. \n\"This is quite remarkable — an entire global network miraculously 'level loads' on its own,\" Gurley wrote. \nGurley's vote of confidence is especially notable given that his firm, Benchmark, pitted itself last year against former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick , after accusations of sexual harassment, legal misconduct and stolen intellectual property rocked the company. CNBC's conversations with Gurley's friends and colleagues last year revealed \"how he spent much of 2017 glued to his phone, losing sleep and eating poorly, obsessing over a single four-letter word: Uber.\" Sources told CNBC Gurley left the board \"in part to preserve his mental and physical health.\" As of January Benchmark sold a significant stake in Uber , but still holds a position in the company. \nBut in Thursday's post , Gurley made it clear that he still felt there was value in Uber, \"[i]n spite of all the ink that journalists, analysts, and pundits have spilled on Uber over the years.\" \n\"What is missing from the conversation is why this job type is so special and unique to so many millions of people,\" Gurley wrote. \"There is simply no way for the vast majority of employers in the world to offer a completely independent and autonomous work-schedule.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T18:56:55.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
