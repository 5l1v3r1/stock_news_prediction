Now this initiative is officially vetoed because of the supreme court’s decision,” he said.\nEnvironmentalists say increasing swathes of land, including the Amazon forest, are being felled for grazing and cropland, and for development projects.\nDeforestation in the Amazon fell in the August 2016 to July 2017 monitoring period for the first time in three years, although the 6,624 square kilometres (2,557 square miles) cleared of forest remains well above the low recorded in 2012 and targets for slowing climate change.\nReporting by Karla Mendes; Editing by Robert Carmichael.
