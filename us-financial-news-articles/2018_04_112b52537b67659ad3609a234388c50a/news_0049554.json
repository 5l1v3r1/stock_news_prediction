CenterPoint already serves customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas.\nConsumers, companies and local governments are becoming more energy efficient and adopting conservation measures, resulting in a drop in consumption as well as prices. That has hit margins across the sector, leading a handful of companies to merge to cut costs and streamline operations.\nShares of CenterPoint, which is funding the deal using debt and equity, were down more than 3 percent in early trading. Vectren was up 5 percent at $68.97, below CenterPoint’s offer price of $72 a share.\nCenterPoint’s offer represents a premium of nearly 10 percent to Vectren’s Friday close.\n“There’s a perception out there ... that CenterPoint overpaid for Vectren,” utilities analyst Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Securities said, adding that there was “not a lot of accretion assigned to the deal”.\nCenterPoint said it would continue to target earnings per share growth of 5-7 percent in 2019 and 2020 following the deal, which is expected to close in the first-quarter next year.\nThe newly formed company is expected to have electric and natural gas delivery operations in eight states with assets totaling $29 billion, the companies said in a statement.\nCenterPoint Energy will also assume all outstanding Vectren net debt.\nReuters reported earlier on Sunday that both companies were nearing a deal.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
