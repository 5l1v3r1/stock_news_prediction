April 4-8, 2018.\n“NCSBN is celebrating its anniversary year by not only reflecting on its many past accomplishments but by investing in the future of the nursing workforce, which is why we are delighted to be able to make this contribution to provide scholarships to qualified undergraduate nursing students,” states Thomas.\nNCSBN is a gold level sponsor of the “Forever Nursing... The Endowment Campaign for the FNSNA” and is a long-term supporter of the foundation and its mission.\nFNSNA President Carol Toussie Weingarten, PhD, RN, commented, “NCSBN’s awesome contribution again shows the deep commitment to nursing students. We are truly grateful for their continued support to the future of the nursing profession!”\nAbout FNSNA\nFNSNA was created in 1969 and honors Frances Tompkins, the first executive director of the National Student Nurses' Association. Organized exclusively for charitable and educational purposes, the Foundation awards scholarships to qualified nursing students annually. More than $4.5 million dollars in scholarships to undergraduate nursing students, and over $3.9 million in Promise of Nursing Undergraduate Scholarships have been awarded.\nAbout NCSBN\nNCSBN marks its 40th anniversary milestone in 2018 with the inspiring theme of “Regulatory Excellence Surging Toward the Future.” Founded March 15, 1978, as an independent not-for-profit organization, NCSBN was initially created to lessen the burdens of state governments and bring together boards of nursing (BONs) to act and counsel together on matters of common interest. It has evolved into one of the leading voices of regulation across the world.\nNCSBN’s membership is comprised of the BONs in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories — American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands. There are also 30 associate members that are either nursing regulatory bodies or empowered regulatory authorities from other countries or territories.\nNCSBN Member Boards protect the public by ensuring that safe and competent nursing care is provided by licensed nurses. These BONs regulate more than 4.8 million licensed nurses.\nMission: NCSBN provides education, service and research through collaborative leadership to promote evidence-based regulatory excellence for patient safety and public protection.\nThe statements and opinions expressed are those of NCSBN and not the individual member state or territorial boards of nursing.\nContact: Dawn M.
