It said several factors, including salary negotiations, supported the bank’s target of 15 percent inflation this year.\nThe statement said if inflation fell slower than expected in coming months the bank would raise its policy rate.\nConsumer prices in Argentina rose 2.3 percent in March, slightly down from the 2.4 percent increase in February. Twelve-month inflation was 25.4 percent, the same level as February.\nThe bank said in its twice-monthly policy statement it did not expect significant depreciation of the peso currency in the coming months, after it sold over $2 billion in reserves this year to halt the peso’s slide.
