The company said on April 18 it would continue to bargain in good faith and remained committed to achieving a win-win solution for the company and the two unions. \nCanadian commodity producers remain worried about the impact of a strike on shipments, but some analysts say the country’s federal government is likely to quickly legislate strikers back to work. \nOn Thursday, Canadian Labour Minister Patty Hajdu said she expects all parties to stay at the table until they get a deal. \nWade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, whose members include Cargill Inc and Richardson International, said grain producers rely on CP to deliver about 400,000 tonnes of grain a week. \nTeck Resources the world’s second-biggest exporter of metallurgical coal used for making steel, is largely beholden to CP for transportation of coking coal to west coast ports since the company doesn’t have access to the railroad’s larger rival Canadian National Railway Co, a Scotiabank analyst wrote in a note to clients.
