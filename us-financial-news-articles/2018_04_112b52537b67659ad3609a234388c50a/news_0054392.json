An extremely joyous experience!\"\n\"I Still Have Faith In You\" is due to be performed by the group's holograms in a December TV special broadcast by the BBC and NBC. There was no word on when the second track will be released.\nThe band members have long said they will never perform live together again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:41:12.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
