The two sides are due to meet again on Monday, she said. \nLATAM told Reuters on Thursday it had canceled 800 flights through April 18 and that the strike would affect at least 126,000 passengers. \nLATAM was created in 2012 through a merger between Chile’s LAN and Brazil’s TAM. The group, headquartered in Santiago, has operating units in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.
