In the highlights that follow, all comparisons are of the current three-month period to the same period last year unless otherwise indicated.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nNet Income increased 22.4% to $11.1 million from $9.1 million EPS increased 15.8% to $.44 from $.38 Book Value Per Share increased 9.1% to $14.44 at 3/31/18 from $13.24 at 3/31/17 Cash Dividends Per Share increased 7.1% to $.15 from $.14 ROA and ROE were 1.13% and 12.50%, respectively, compared to 1.02% and 11.75% Total Assets increased 16% to $4.2 billion at 3/31/18 from $3.6 billion at 3/31/17 15.9% growth in the average balance of Loans 10.7% growth in the average balance of Noninterest-Bearing Checking Deposits 10.5% growth in the average balance of Total Deposits Effective Tax Rate of 7.9% versus 24.2% The Mortgage Loan Pipeline at quarter end remained strong at $215 million The Credit Quality of the Bank’s loan and securities portfolios remains excellent\nAnalysis of First Quarter Earnings\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.1 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 22.4%, over the same quarter last year. The increase is attributable to increases in net interest income of $1.5 million, or 6.3%, and noninterest income of $839,000, or 34.2%, and a decrease in income tax expense of $1.9 million. These items were partially offset by increases in noninterest expense of $1.5 million, or 11.4%, and the provision for loan losses of $724,000.\nThe increase in net interest income is mainly attributable to growth in average interest-earning assets of $348.3 million, or 10.0%. This growth is mainly comprised of an increase in the average balance of loans of $417.3 million, or 15.9%, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of securities of $71.1 million, or 8.5%. Loans grew primarily due to increases in residential and commercial mortgage loans. Securities declined because of portfolio runoff and a deleveraging transaction completed in the first quarter of 2017. Although it had little impact on the average balances of securities or deposits for the first quarter of 2018, toward the end of the first quarter the Bank enhanced its on-balance-sheet liquidity with the purchase of approximately $106 million in GNMA mortgage-backed securities funded substantially by brokered certificates of deposit.\nThe growth in average interest-earning assets was funded by increases in the average balances of noninterest-bearing checking deposits of $89.3 million, or 10.7%, interest-bearing deposits of $193.9 million, or 10.4%, long-term borrowings of $54.7 million, or 14.4%, and stockholders’ equity of $46.9 million, or 15.0%. Substantial contributors to the growth in deposits were new branch openings, the Bank’s ongoing municipal deposit initiative and deposit promotions. Substantial contributors to the growth in stockholders’ equity were net income and the ongoing issuance of shares under the Corporation’s Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (“the Plan”), partially offset by cash dividends declared. During the first quarter of 2018, 269,361 shares were issued under the Plan which contributed $7.3 million to capital.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 2.71%, down 21 basis points from 2.92% for the same quarter last year. This decrease occurred partially because short-term interest rates increased more than intermediate and long-term interest rates thus resulting in a flattening of the yield curve. In addition, because the Bank has more deposits and borrowings subject to immediate repricing than loans, in a rising rate environment the Bank’s funding cost will increase more rapidly than earnings on loans and securities. The increase in short-term interest rates was driven by the Federal Reserve Bank’s increases in the federal funds target rate. Beginning in December 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank announced six twenty-five basis point increases for an overall increase of 1.50%. These increases have caused the Bank to pay more on overnight borrowings and made it necessary for the Bank to raise the rates being paid on many of its deposit accounts in order to remain competitive. The cost of deposits and borrowings increased by 27 basis points from .81% for the first quarter of 2017 to 1.08% for the 2018 quarter. The higher cost of funding was not accompanied by equivalent increases in the rates earned on the Bank’s loan and securities portfolios. The yield earned on the Bank’s total interest-earning assets was down slightly when comparing the first quarter periods. If the yield curve does not meaningfully steepen with an improvement in intermediate and longer-term interest rates or flattens further, the Bank may experience a further erosion in net interest margin which would inhibit growth in net interest income and earnings and may even cause net interest income and earnings to decline.\nNet interest margin in the first quarter of 2018 was also negatively impacted by a decline in mortgage prepayment penalty income from $640,000 in the first quarter of last year to $226,000 in the current quarter and, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), a decrease in the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% last year to 21% in 2018. These two factors account for reductions in net interest margin of 5 and 10 basis points, respectively. The lower federal income tax rate reduced net interest margin because it reduced the positive adjustment to net interest income required to put such income on a tax equivalent basis.\nThe increase in the provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 versus the same quarter last year is largely due to more loan growth in the current quarter and a larger decrease in the allowance for loan losses in the 2017 quarter from improved economic conditions. Loans grew $185 million in the first quarter of this year versus $130 million in the same quarter last year. The impact of these items was partially offset by a larger reduction in the provision for loan losses in the 2018 quarter versus the same quarter last year due to a decrease in historical loss rates.\nThe increase in noninterest income of $839,000, or 34.2%, is primarily attributable to an increase of $139,000 in cash value accretion on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”), a $565,000 BOLI death benefit and an increase of $89,000 in the net credit relating to the non-service cost components of the Bank’s defined benefit pension plan. Cash value accretion increased because of purchases of BOLI during the first quarters of 2017 and 2018 of $25 million and $20 million, respectively. These purchases contributed $24.5 million to the growth in total average assets for the first quarter of 2018 over the same quarter last year. The non-service cost components of the Bank’s pension plan included in noninterest income are comprised of expected return on pension plan assets and interest cost on the benefit obligation. These items are included in noninterest income under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-07 which was adopted by the Corporation on January 1, 2018. Income statement items for the first quarter of 2017 were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nThe increase in noninterest expense of $1.5 million, or 11.4%, is primarily attributable to increases in salaries of $819,000, or 13.2%, employee benefits and other personnel expense of $332,000, or 18.1%, occupancy and equipment expense of $292,000, or 11.6%, and other real estate owned (“OREO”) expense in the first quarter of 2018 of $115,000. The increase in salaries is primarily due to new branch openings, additions to staff in the back office, higher stock-based compensation expense and normal annual salary adjustments. The increase in employee benefits and other personnel expense is largely due to increases in placement and agency fees of $126,000 relating to branch and back office staffing, payroll tax expense of $97,000 and group health insurance expense of $42,000. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense includes the operating costs of new branches and increases in maintenance and repairs expense. OREO expense of $115,000 in the first quarter of 2018 relates to one commercial real estate property acquired by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure during the fourth quarter of 2017 and sold during the first quarter of 2018.\nThe decrease in income tax expense of $1.9 million is due to a reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate from 35% last year to 21% effective January 1, 2018 pursuant to the Tax Act, the recognition in the current quarter of the tax benefits of New York State and New York City net operating loss carryforwards that originated in 2017 and higher tax benefits in the current quarter from BOLI and the vesting and exercise of stock awards. Considering the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21% and tax benefits derived from the Bank’s municipal securities portfolio, BOLI, stock-based compensation and the maintenance of a captive REIT, management expects the Corporation’s effective tax rate in the remaining quarters of this year to be in the range of 14% to 16%.\nAnalysis of Earnings – First Quarter 2018 Versus Fourth Quarter 2017\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $3.5 million over $7.6 million earned in the fourth quarter of last year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in net interest income of $756,000 and noninterest income of $2.8 million and decreases in the provision for loan losses of $139,000 and income tax expense of $109,000. The positive impact on earnings of these items was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $224,000. The increase in net interest income occurred for substantially the same reasons discussed above with respect to the first quarter periods. The increase in noninterest income was mainly due to a loss on sale of mortgage-backed securities in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $1.9 million and the reasons discussed above with respect to the first quarter periods. The decrease in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to improvements in economic conditions and historical loss rates in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by more loan growth in the 2018 quarter. Although pre-tax earnings increased in the current quarter and the prior quarter included a $909,000 credit to income tax expense resulting from a reduction in the Corporation’s net deferred tax liability, income tax expense was lower this quarter because the statutory federal income tax rate declined to 21%. In addition, the current quarter’s income tax expense includes the recognition of the tax benefits of New York State and New York City net operating loss carryovers. Finally, significant excess tax benefits were realized this quarter from the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards. The increase in noninterest expense includes higher salaries and employee benefits expense largely due to the reasons discussed above with respect to the first quarter periods, partially offset by a fourth quarter 2017 valuation allowance of $725,000 on OREO.\nAsset Quality\nThe Bank’s allowance for loan losses to total loans decreased 3 basis points from 1.15% at year-end 2017 to 1.12% at March 31, 2018. The decrease is primarily due to adjustments to certain qualitative factors to reflect improved economic conditions and reductions in historical loss rates and compound annual growth rates on certain pools of loans. The provision for loan losses was $1.5 million and $788,000 in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of the provision in each quarter was driven mainly by loan growth, offset by improved economic conditions and, in the first quarter of 2018, further offset by reductions in historical losses and growth rate trends on several pools of loans.\nThe credit quality of the Bank’s loan portfolio remains excellent. Nonaccrual loans were essentially unchanged from year-end 2017 amounting to $992,000, or .03% of total loans outstanding, at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.0 million, or .03%, at December 31, 2017. Troubled debt restructurings amounted to $1.4 million, or .04% of total loans outstanding at March 31, 2018. Of the troubled debt restructurings, $1.3 million are performing in accordance with their modified terms and $96,000 are nonaccrual and included in the aforementioned amount of nonaccrual loans. Loans past due 30 through 89 days amounted to $3.1 million, or .10% of total loans outstanding, at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.8 million, or .09%, at December 31, 2017.\nThe credit quality of the Bank’s securities portfolio also remains excellent. The Bank’s mortgage securities are backed by mortgages underwritten on conventional terms, with 83% of these securities being full faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government and the balance being obligations of U.S. government sponsored entities. The remainder of the Bank’s securities portfolio principally consists of high quality, general obligation municipal securities rated AA or better by major rating agencies. In selecting municipal securities for purchase, the Bank uses credit agency ratings for screening purposes only and then performs its own credit analysis. On an ongoing basis, the Bank periodically assesses the credit strength of the municipal securities in its portfolio and makes decisions to hold or sell based on such assessments.\nCapital\nThe Corporation’s Tier 1 leverage, Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Total risk-based capital ratios were approximately 9.2%, 14.9%, 14.9% and 16.2%, respectively, at March 31, 2018. The strength of the Corporation’s balance sheet positions the Corporation for continued growth in a measured and disciplined fashion.\nShareholders are currently permitted to purchase up to $75,000 per quarter of the Corporation’s common stock at a 3% discount under the stock purchase component of the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Shares issued under the Plan provide additional capital that is being used to accommodate balance sheet growth.\nKey Strategic Initiatives\nKey strategic initiatives will continue to include loan and deposit growth through effective relationship management, targeted solicitation efforts, new product offerings and continued expansion of the Bank’s branch distribution system on Long Island and in the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. With respect to loan growth, the Bank will continue to prudently manage concentration risk and further develop its broker and correspondent relationships. Small business credit scored loans, equipment finance loans and SBA loans, along with the Bank’s traditional commercial and industrial loan products, will be originated to diversify the Bank’s loan portfolio and help mitigate the impact on net interest margin of the flattening yield curve.\nThe Bank’s growing branch distribution system currently consists of fifty-two branches in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island and the New York City boroughs of Queens, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The Bank expects to open three more branches over the next 12 months and continues to evaluate sites for further branch expansion. In addition to loan and deposit growth, management is also focused on growing noninterest income from existing and potential new sources, which may include the development or acquisition of fee-based businesses.\nChallenges We Face\nBeginning in December 2015, there have been six twenty-five basis point increases in the federal funds target rate to its current level of 1.50% to 1.75%. These increases have exerted significant upward pressure on non-maturity deposit rates and have caused these rates and overnight borrowing rates to move upward. At the same time, the Bank generally lends and invests at a spread to intermediate and long-term U.S. treasury rates. Although there have been recent increases in these rates, such increases have been more modest than the increases in the federal funds target rate. As a result of these factors, the yield curve has flattened, net interest margin has declined and lending and investment rates remain suboptimal. While further increases in the federal funds target rate are expected in the foreseeable future, management does not believe there are near term prospects for meaningful improvement in intermediate and long-term interest rates. In this scenario, the yield curve could flatten further and exert more downward pressure on net interest margin and earnings.\nThe banking industry continues to be faced with new and complex regulatory requirements and enhanced supervisory oversight. The markets expect that regulatory relief will be forthcoming, but the timing, magnitude and positive impact of any such relief on financial institutions like the Bank are yet to be determined. In the current environment, banking regulators are increasingly concerned about, among other things, growth, commercial real estate concentrations, underwriting of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, capital levels, liquidity, cyber security and predatory sales practices. Regulatory requirements, the cost of compliance and enhanced supervisory oversight are exerting downward pressure on revenues and upward pressure on required capital levels and operating expenses.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited) 3/31/18 12/31/17 (dollars in thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 69,918 $ 69,672 Investment securities: Held-to-maturity, at amortized cost (fair value of $7,027 and $7,749) 6,936 7,636 Available-for-sale, at fair value 813,840 720,128 820,776 727,764 Loans: Commercial and industrial 108,741 109,623 Secured by real estate: Commercial mortgages 1,245,194 1,193,007 Residential mortgages 1,693,333 1,558,564 Home equity lines 81,673 83,625 Consumer and other 6,030 5,533 3,134,971 2,950,352 Allowance for loan losses (35,154 ) (33,784 ) 3,099,817 2,916,568 Restricted stock, at cost 33,184 37,314 Bank premises and equipment, net 40,020 39,648 Bank-owned life insurance 79,291 59,665 Pension plan assets, net 19,232 19,152 Deferred income tax benefit 4,468 — Other assets 18,718 24,925 $ 4,185,424 $ 3,894,708 Liabilities: Deposits: Checking $ 950,681 $ 896,129 Savings, NOW and money market 1,775,662 1,602,460 Time, $100,000 and over 247,099 203,890 Time, other 230,207 119,518 3,203,649 2,821,997 Short-term borrowings 172,777 281,141 Long-term debt 437,027 423,797 Accrued expenses and other liabilities 10,525 10,942 Deferred income taxes payable — 2,381 3,823,978 3,540,258 Stockholders' Equity: Common stock, par value $.10 per share: Authorized, 40,000,000 shares;
