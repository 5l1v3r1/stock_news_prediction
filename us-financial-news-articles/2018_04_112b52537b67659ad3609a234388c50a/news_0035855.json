Chief Executive Randall Stephenson began his eagerly awaited testimony in court Thursday in defense of his company’s proposed Time Warner Inc. acquisition, calling it a “vision deal” that was crucial for AT&T to compete in a rapidly shifting digital-media landscape. \nTime Warner “met all the needs we were looking for,” Stephenson told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who is deciding whether to allow the $85 billion transaction. \nThe AT&T chief took the witness stand shortly after noon in a dark suit and blue tie, explaining his long history with the company and how he came to believe that AT&T T, -1.11% , with its wireless and satellite assets, needed to own a media company like Time Warner TWX, -0.54% , which owns the Turner networks, HBO and Warner Bros. studios. \nStephenson said AT&T was focused on growing so it could compete for advertising dollars with technology giants like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.90% , Facebook Inc. FB, +1.05% and Google owner Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +1.31% GOOG, +1.46% , rather than the traditional TV providers that vie for its customers today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T23:54:22.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
