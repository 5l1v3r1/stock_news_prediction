REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nMusk, who also leads electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, is seeking to revolutionise transportation by sending passengers packed into pods through an intercity system of giant, underground vacuum tubes known as the hyperloop. \nThe funding comes about five months after Musk said the Boring Company would compete to fund, build and operate a “loop” to connect downtown Chicago with O’Hare Airport. \nMusk had earlier sold Boring Company hats and flamethrowers to raise funds. \nThe Boring Company says tunnel-digging projects can cost as much as $1 billion per mile. Its goal is to lower these costs by a factor of 10 or more, its website says.
