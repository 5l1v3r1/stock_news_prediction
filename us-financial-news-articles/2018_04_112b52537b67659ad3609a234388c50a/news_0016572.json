REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol \nTrain staff last week began three months of nationwide rolling strikes in a dispute over the government’s planned overhaul of state-run railway SNCF, in the biggest challenge yet to Macron’s attempts to modernize the French economy. \nTalks between workers and ministers have so far hit a wall. Some unions are stiffening their resistance, while the government has dug in its heels on the main aspects of its reform, which include the end of job-for-life guarantees for rail staff. \n“The status quo is not viable,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in an interview published in the newspaper Le Parisien on Sunday. “It’s urgent, we need to advance, and everyone should know we are determined to see this through to the end.” \nOfficials at the Communist-rooted CGT union said on Friday strikes could drag on well beyond June if nothing shifted, adding train workers were ready for a “marathon”. Related Coverage Macron's rail reforms and French union strikes \nThe SNCF forecast that 43 percent of workers needed to make the train network run smoothly would walk out on Monday as stoppages continue, affecting local trains as well as regional lines and some international journeys. \nThat marked a slight a dip in participation compared with 48 percent in the last 48 hours of walkouts on Tuesday and Wednesday last week. \nStrikes have been called for two days out of every five until the end of June, and the shutdown is already causing havoc for commuters and holiday-makers at the start of mid-term school vacations in France.

TEST FOR MACRON \nThe showdown is one of the toughest challenges yet of Macron’s presidency, as well as a test for unions seeking to show they still have clout. \nMacron came to power last May on a promise to shake up Europe’s second-biggest economy, in a bid to modernize some of France’s creaking institutions and spur jobs growth. He has so far faced down unions to liberalize labor regulations.

Officials at the more reform-minded CFDT union said on Sunday they did not want a drawn-out conflict but that their proposed amendments to the shake-up had fallen on deaf ears. \nLocking horns with the rail sector has backfired on previous French governments - paralyzing train strikes in 1995 forced then-Prime Minister Alain Juppe to pull planned reforms. BREWING PROTESTS \nThe SNCF reform has drawn public support so far, and 56 percent of French people thought the train stoppages were unjustified, according to an Ifop poll published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche. But discontent is also brewing in other sectors. \nStudents have disrupted several universities across France in protest at a planned new selection system in higher education. Garbage collectors and other public workers have also held demonstrations. \nThough nowhere near as potent, the various protests come as France prepares to mark the 50th anniversary of the student-led riots of May 1968, which gridlocked the country and led to the adoption of more progressive social policies.
