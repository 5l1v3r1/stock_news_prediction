I hit it in the air pretty good,” Dickerson said.\nThe win validated a stellar performance by Pirates starter Ivan Nova.\nNova did not get a decision but pitched eight shutout innings, using only 81 pitches. He allowed six hits — never more than one in any inning — with five strikeouts. For his fourth start in a row, he did not walk a batter.\n“With Nova pitching so good, we really wanted to give him the win,” Dickerson said in reference to the club winning.\nPirates closer Felipe Vasquez (1-0) got into and out of a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the ninth with two groundouts sandwiched around a popup to preserve the shutout.\nDetroit starter Michael Fulmer also had a strong outing. Fulmer pitched six scoreless innings, giving up four hits, striking out nine and walking one, needing 75 pitches. His final inning, he had a mound visit from pitching coach and an athletic trainer who looked at Fulmer’s pitching hand.\nLeft-hander Daniel Stumpf pitched a perfect seventh. Pittsburgh got two runners on in the eighth against Joe Jimenez but could not score.\nThe teams played their full three-game series in less than 24 hours after Tuesday’s opener was rained out. They played a doubleheader Wednesday.\nNova got an immediate challenge when the first batter of the game, Leonys Martin, hit a triple but Nova then induced three groundball outs to strand Martin.\nPittsburgh came close in the eighth. Adam Frazier hit a two-out double, and Gregory Polanco was intentionally walked. On a grounder by Starling Marte toward third, Frazier eluded a tag by third baseman Niko Goodrum, but it was ruled Frazier left the basepath and was out.\nPirates manager Clint Hurdle argued to no avail and was ejected.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:35:49.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
