Global fixed income is the second largest asset class in CalPERS’ portfolio, behind only global equity.\nCalPERS’ senior portfolio manager for fixed income, Arnie Phillips, will serve in Ishii’s role on an interim basis until a permanent replacement is seated.\n“Curtis has always been at the center of advice for the investment team,” Chief Investment Officer Ted Eliopoulos said at a CalPERS board meeting on Monday. “His advice and counsel and recommendations are respected and have provided great leadership to CalPERS over the years.”\nDuring his tenure, Ishii helped manage assets of what is now a $351 billion fund through the tech bubble burst of the early 2000s, the European debt crisis and the Great Recession, among other financial storms.\nHe leaves his post after helping earn CalPERS a total of $4.3 billion in excess dollar return above the benchmark, Eliopoulos said.\nIshii’s departure comes at a time of greater managerial change for CalPERS.\nLast week, Elisabeth Bourqui was named chief operating officer for the agency, and Beth Richtman was designated CalPERS’ first managing director of its sustainable investments program.\nIshii will continue to advise the fund during a transition period through July.
