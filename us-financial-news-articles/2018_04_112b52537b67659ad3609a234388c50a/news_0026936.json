REUTERS/Mark Blinch Director Rima Das’ “Village Rockstars”, which tells the story of a group of children in the countryside who form a music band, will “move you to tears without actually telling you a dramatic story”, said filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, who headed a 10-member jury for the awards.\nSridevi won for her performance as an angry mother who avenges her daughter’s rape in Ravi Udyawar’s “Mom”. It was the 54-year-old’s last film before she died during a trip to Dubai on February 24.\n“I said don’t give her the award just because she has passed away, because it is unfair to the other girls, but every time it kept coming back to Sridevi,” Kapur said.\nPankaj Tripathi in a scene from Newton.

Pankaj Tripathi won a special mention for his role in the film.\n“I am absolutely delighted. I had no idea I was even in the running.
