I can, however, pinpoint one late-arriving surprise: This week was the first time I have ever been excited to vacuum my home.\nThe milestone came with the arrival of the Dyson Cyclone V10 Absolute. You’ve likely seen its commercials: Stylish parents in a stylish home pass the vacuum back and forth cleaning up after stylish but messy children—like it’s a toy both are eager to play with.\nIf you’re still hefting around an old fashioned tank-sized vacuum, this light, cordless machine (5.9 pounds) will indeed seem like a joyous epiphany, something like the first time you got an iPod and realized you didn’t need to lug binders of CDs around anymore. But as for Dyson’s claims that it’s “the only vacuum you’ll need!” that may be a bridge too far at this stage of the cordless revolution.\nThe V10’s design in particular turns what is usually a slog into something like play. The sci-fi minded user might feel like a novice Jedi wielding a lightsaber, uncertain of its power, not exactly sure where to point it. The gentle swoosh of emptying the dust chamber (0.2 gallons) is satisfying, although its trigger-activated suction can grow ergonomically tiresome. But you probably won’t have to worry about your wrist cramping. The battery will die before too long.\nUnlike previous versions of the Cyclone, which had just two settings and an only slightly shorter battery life, the V10 can toggle between low, medium and max suction (powerful enough to pick up coins, paper clips, buttons and the rest of the junk drawer smorgasbord I dumped around the apartment), the efficacy of each setting depending on how serious a mess you’ve made.\nAt max power and with the torque-drive cleaner head attached, the charge will last 10 minutes at best—a far cry from the “up to 60 minutes” Dyson stamped on the box, which applies only to the lowest setting with the small crevice attachment in play.\nThat’s plenty for those using it in smaller apartments, or in the car (it easily transforms into a hand-held), or for my wife, who liked it for impromptu spot cleans so much that I may be demoted from vacuum duty.\nBut unless you’re in the habit of cleaning a room at a time, and waiting three hours between charges, the idea that this will replace regular vacuums is the realm of speculative fiction.
