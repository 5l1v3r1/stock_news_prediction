That means buying 10-year U.S. Treasuries yielding 3.00 percent with currency hedging leaves Japanese investors with a meagre return of 0.4 percent.\nHigher hedge costs have prompted many investors, including Nippon Life, to buy higher-yielding and riskier bonds.\n“Although there are signs of overheating in U.S. credit markets, with historically tight spreads, we will carefully select corporate bonds in order to avoid risks associated with credit events,” Akiyama said.\nThe insurer, one of Japan’s biggest institutional investors with total assets of 67 trillion yen, also plans to increase its holding of foreign stocks, including private equity funds.\nIt remains reluctant to buy domestic bonds, whose yields have been stuck at lows due to the Bank of Japan’s aggressive easing steps.\nNippon Life said any full-fledged buying in super-long JGBs will start only after 20- or 30-year bond yields rise to 1 percent or above, Akiyama added.\nYields on 20-year JGBs, a tenor of choice for Japanese life insurers, are currently around 0.540 percent.\nThe insurer plans to be more committed to sustainable finance and investment such as green bonds and other Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG)-labelled projects, officials said.\n$1 = 109.34 yen Reporting by Tomo Uetake, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T12:34:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
