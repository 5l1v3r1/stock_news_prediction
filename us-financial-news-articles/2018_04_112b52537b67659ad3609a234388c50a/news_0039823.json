Emerging-market equity funds, which attracted $1.3 billion during the latest week, are yet to post a single week of withdrawals this year. \nWithin stocks, energy sector funds posted $405 million in withdrawals after three straight weeks netting cash. Economic growth and higher oil prices would normally boost the equities, but S&P 500 energy sector stocks sport the highest price-to-earnings ratios based on profits Wall Street analysts expect over the coming 12 months, according to Credit Suisse Group AG. \nRate-sensitive real estate sector funds reeled in $208 million after three consecutive weeks of withdrawals, Lipper said. \nThe following is a breakdown of the flows for the week, including mutual funds and ETFs: \nSector Flow Chg Pct of Assets($ Count \n($ blns) Assets blns) \nAll Equity Funds 4.595 0.07 6,994.738 12,111 \nDomestic Equities 3.289 0.07 4,704.833 8,598 \nNon-Domestic Equities 1.306 0.06 2,289.905 3,513 \nAll Taxable Bond Funds 6.314 0.23 2,739.914 6,040 \nAll Money Market Funds -34.902 -1.30 2,647.066 1,038 \nAll Municipal Bond Funds -0.515 -0.13 400.823 1,458 Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; additional reporting by Kate Duguid; editing by Jennifer Ablan and G Crosse", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T02:24:16.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
