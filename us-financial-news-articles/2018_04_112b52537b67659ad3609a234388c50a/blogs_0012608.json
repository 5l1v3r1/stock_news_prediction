Still, the sentence handed to Ms. Park, the 66-year-old daughter of South Korea’s longest-serving president, was the heaviest the courts have meted out to any figure in the graft affair that shook the country from late 2016. \nIn a related case, \nLee Jae-yong, \nthe third-generation Samsung heir considered the country’s most powerful businessman, was imprisoned last year for bribery and embezzlement, and released earlier this year on a suspended sentence. He has appealed his case to the Supreme Court. \nFriday’s verdict makes Ms. Park the third South Korean president to be convicted after leaving office. Another killed himself while being investigated on corruption charges, while Ms. Park’s predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, was arrested last month on corruption charges that he has described as politically motivated. \nThe scandal that brought down Ms. Park focused attention on the country’s traditionally close links between the government and family-run business conglomerates, known as chaebols, that dominate the economy. \nThe court found the former conservative leader guilty on nearly all charges , including bribery, disclosing state secrets, and abuse of power. \n“As head of state and president, the defendant should have exercised her power for the freedom and happiness of this country’s people,” said the presiding judge, Kim Se-yun. Instead, he said, Ms. Park put the country “in turmoil.” \nThe former president was acquitted on two bribery counts related to some of Samsung’s payments to organizations controlled by her friend, \nChoi Soon-sil. \nMs. Park, who in 2013 became South Korea’s first female leader, is expected to appeal. She had previously denied any wrongdoing. Her lawyers couldn’t be reached for comment. Prosecutors said they would review the case and determine whether to appeal. \nMs. Park wasn’t present for the verdict, which was televised nationally. She hasn’t appeared in court since October, when the same court approved an extension of her arrest warrant, prompting her legal team to quit in protest. Ms. Park has since been represented by designated public attorneys. \nThe verdict adds to convictions against high-profile government and corporate officials implicated in the scandal, including Mr. Lee of Samsung and Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin . Mr. Shin denies wrongdoing and has appealed the case to a higher court. \nIn February, Ms. Park’s longtime confidante Ms. Choi, who was alleged to have colluded with the former president to extract bribes, was sentenced to 20 years in prison . She also has appealed. \nThe graft scandal burst into the open in the fall of 2016 when prosecutors alleged that Ms. Park shared confidential documents with Ms. Choi and conspired with her to extort tens of millions of dollars from business groups, including Samsung and Hyundai. \nAs the probe widened, prosecutors homed in on a deal in which Samsung allegedly channeled funds to a German company to pay for equestrian training for Ms. Choi’s daughter in return for political favors from Ms. Park’s administration. Samsung denied wrongdoing. \nThe accusations prompted millions of South Koreans to take to the streets, demanding Ms. Park’s resignation. She was impeached in late 2016 and removed from office in March last year. In a snap election that followed, voters swept \nMoon Jae-in, \nthe first left-leaning president in nearly a decade , to power. \nIn response to Friday’s verdict, the presidential Blue House said the situation was “heartbreaking” for South Korea and Ms. Park. \n“History that is not remembered can be repeated. We will not forget today,” presidential spokesman Kim Eui-kyeom said. \nWrite to Eun-Young Jeong at [email protected] ADVERTISEMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T12:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T14:58:26.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
