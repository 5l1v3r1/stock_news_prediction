The CURE LP iView and Cure LP QMax System clearance compliments Meditech's recent 510(k) of the CURE Lumbar Plate System in 2017 with additional plating options. The CURE LP allows surgeons to utilize the lumbar plating system along with its novel lumbar Talos® fusion devices, which are manufactured with the PEEK-OPTIMA™ HA Enhanced polymer.\nThe CURE LP is a low profile titanium plate that incorporates a proprietary, one-step locking mechanism to prevent screws anchored on the spine from loosening and backing out. The special 510(k) includes additional sizing options for surgeons. The CURE LP-iView is similar to the standard CURE LP anterior plate but includes a through hole with rib to nest with the Talos®-A (HA) Interbody Device. And, the CURE LP-QMax is a four hole direct lateral plate complimenting the previously cleared two hole plate. The CURE LP anterior plates, sacral plates and the new iView and Qmax plates will be combined in one tray with streamlined instruments to make it easier on hospital and surgery centers to process the system. All systems will be provided sterile packaged to aid with implant tracking while helping to reduce implant related infections. The CURE Lumbar Plate System is intended for use via a lateral or anterolateral surgical approach.\nWith the introduction of the CURE Anterior Cervical Plating (ACP) last year, Meditech continues its philosophy of giving back which led to a partnership with CURE International, the namesake of the CURE ACP and CURE LP, an organization that serves children with physical disabilities in underserved areas of the world. A portion of proceeds from the sale of every plate will help CURE International treat patients in underserved areas who are in need of surgical care.\n\"After the introduction in late 2017 with our CURE LP system, we have continued to listen to surgeons and build upon our existing platform by providing additional plating options. Surgeons now have the flexibility of choosing from multiple plate configurations for their patients that require supplemental fixation. When coupled with our Talos®-A (HA) Interbody Fusion Device, manufactured with our next generation osteoconductive polymer, we provide a full and robust system for surgeons who utilize the anterior and anteriorlateral approaches to treat degenerative spinal conditions,\" Eric Flickinger, Co-founder of Meditech Spine, noted.\nFor more information visit Meditech Spine .\nABOUT MEDITECH SPINE, LLC\nMeditech Spine, LLC , is a spinal device company developing innovative instrumentation for treating complex spinal issues.
