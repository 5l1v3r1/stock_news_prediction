There has been some speculation that the two should merge. \n“After the financial crisis there was an intense debate about the issue of ‘too big to fail’, and whether banks should be allowed to grow so big that they can’t be allowed to go bust,” Roeseler told Handelsblatt, adding that if two big banks were to merge now, the same problem would be created again.
