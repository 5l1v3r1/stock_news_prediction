The concerns driving stocks into correction territory didn't push him into the bear camp in February, and they aren't doing so now. He believes the issues are temporary.\n\"The market is likely to calm down once it gets a good signal of some resolution that's livable within the trade area, and we get to see the effects of tax reform come on board,\" Stoltzfus said.\nAccording to Stoltzfus, the uncertainty will likely be swept away by a strong first quarter earnings season, which starts a week from Friday.\n\"We've had five or six quarters in a row now with earnings expanding. We should see an increase in earnings growth coming up,\" said Stoltzfus, who contends market and economic fundamentals remain solid.\nHis latest thoughts came as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were battling back from a deficit of more than 1 percent — ultimately closing in positive territory. The Dow did the same thing with a 2 percent early daily loss.\nStoltzfus, who's overweight U.S. equities, predicts financials , technology, industrials and consumer discretionary stocks will help lead the market back to historic highs.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
