To round my amateur and pro career together in this way and win the last one I had to win and join that prestigious list of Spanish winners, it’s hard to explain how good it feels and how satisfying it is.” \nThe 23-year-old sneaked ahead overall after the fourth hole before Elvira got his nose in front with an eagle on the fifth. Rahm, who had birdied three of the opening seven holes, bogeyed the ninth to open up a three-way tie at the top of the leaderboard. \nRahm and Elvira were both tied at 19 under on the 15th and a playoff beckoned, but Elvira hit the water with his first shot on the penultimate hole, leading to a double bogey. \nRahm narrowly escaped the water on the 17th and made it into the clubhouse in a strong position with a birdie on the final hole, embracing his grandmother after completing the round. \nThat left Elvira or Dunne needing an albatross on the 18th to force a tie but that was too tall an order with Dunne getting a birdie to pip the Spaniard to second place. \n“It’s been amazing,” added Rahm. “It’s truly been the hardest Sunday I’ve ever had in any tournament that I’ve won because the crowd wanted it so much and I wanted it so much.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Toby Davis and Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T21:00:33.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
