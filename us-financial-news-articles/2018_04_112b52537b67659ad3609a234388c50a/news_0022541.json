The deficit is how much Washington’s spending exceeds its revenues.\nCBO forecast 3.3 percent growth in 2018 in gross domestic product, a broad measure of the economy, and 2.4 percent GDP growth in 2019.\nIn the next few years, deficits will “grow substantially” before stabilizing in 2023, resulting in a projected cumulative deficit of $11.7 trillion for 2018-2027, the CBO said.
