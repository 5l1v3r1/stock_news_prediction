The loss snapped a two-game win streak for Minnesota\nUtah led 61-50 at halftime behind Rubio’s 16 points, 10 from Favors and 8 each from Exum and Jerebko.\nWiggins paced Minnesota with 17 points and Towns added 11 in the first half.\nUtah expanded its lead to 87-71 after three quarters as Rubio added seven more points and Mitchell started getting hot, scoring eight points in the first four minutes of the period.\nThe Jazz return home to host the Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday while Minnesota is off until Thursday, when the Timberwolves begin a back-to-back at the Nuggets and the Lakers.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:44:20.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
