That is harmful,” Sulathireh said.\n“When you tell them LGBT is a form of sickness, it adds to the prejudice that LGBT people face,” she said.\nHomosexual sex is against the law in Malaysia, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and caning.\nThe forum organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLast year, the health ministry planned a contest for teenagers to come up with ideas on how to “prevent” homosexuality and transgenderism, sparking criticism from activists and a change in the plan.\nIn 2012, authorities issued guidelines and held seminars aimed at helping teachers and parents spot signs of homosexuality in children.\nReporting by A.
