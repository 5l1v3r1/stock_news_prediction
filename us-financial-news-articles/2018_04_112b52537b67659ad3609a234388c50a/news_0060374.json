An outstanding multi-billion pound fine from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is expected to put the bank back into the red at full-year results this year, although RBS said on Friday it had no news on the talks.\nRestructuring costs for the first quarter fell to 209 million pounds from 509 million in the same period a year ago.\nRBS also reported a common equity tier one capital ratio of 16.4 percent, up from 15.9 percent in February. Analysts say such additional capital gives the bank enough of a buffer to absorb a hefty fine from the DOJ.\n$1 = 0.7182 pounds Reporting by Lawrence White and Emma Rumney; editing by Carolyn Cohn\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:42:06.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
