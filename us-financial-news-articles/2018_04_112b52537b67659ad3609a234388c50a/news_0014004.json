It is a no-brainer,” said one London-based syndicate banker who focuses on emerging markets within Europe, Middle East and Africa. “Certainly I am advising my clients to press the button if the price is right.” \nThis year, more frontier market issuers — a subsection of developing economies designated less developed and riskier — have joined the long bond bonanza, with Kenya and Senegal each selling 30-year bonds for the first time.
