Soccer Football - FA Cup Semi Final - Chelsea v Southampton - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 22, 2018 Chelsea's Olivier Giroud celebrates after the match Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley \nGiroud netted one of the best goals seen at Wembley in recent years when he took a pass from Eden Hazard and with two touches weaved past three Southampton defenders and the keeper before scoring with a flick of his boot. \n“My second passion is actually skiing,” Giroud joked with BT Sport. \n“But to be serious Eden gave me a good ball but I saw a lot of players in front of me. I just tried to dribble it a little bit and I had a bit of luck. That’s what I wanted to do.” \nGiroud, who signed for Chelsea in January after falling out of favour with London rivals Arsenal, was given a standing ovation by Chelsea’s supporters when he was replaced by Spain’s Alvaro Morata. \nFormer Real Madrid striker Morata has struggled after a strong start to his first season at Stamford Bridge. But he scored with an emphatic header to seal Chelsea’s 2-0 semi-final win over Southampton and set up a final against Manchester United on May 19.
