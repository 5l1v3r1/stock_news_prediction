So has Nicolas Muzin, a lobbyist for Qatar who is also a defendant in the case.\nJudge Walter said in the filing he had “serious concerns” about whether his court had jurisdiction over Qatar. He also said while Broidy had found IP addresses in Qatar linked to the hack he failed to identify the location of the alleged computer in Doha, a city of 1.3 million to 1.5 million people, behind the hacking or show it had a relationship to the government.\nBroidy has not shown that Qatar or Muzin “are responsible for the unauthorized access of Plaintiffs’ email accounts” or that they disseminated “the allegedly illegally-obtained emails and documents to various media outlets,” Walter said.\nLee Wolosky, a lawyer for Broidy, said temporary restraining orders are typically hard to get, especially when not all parties have been properly served with court papers, as is the case with Muzin because he is not currently on U.S. soil.\nWolosky said he would pursue relief through another motion, an avenue left open by the judge.\n“We will continue to litigate this case vigorously,” Wolosky said in an email.\nIn his lawsuit Broidy claims that Qatar, embroiled in a diplomatic and trade dispute with the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and others in the region, has sought to use the hacked emails to hinder his advocacy for Qatar’s rivals.\nIn an emailed statement Muzin said he was “pleased that the Court quickly saw through Elliott Broidy’s specious allegations.”\nMitchell Kamin, a lawyer representing Qatar, declined comment on Wednesday’s decision.\nReporting by Nathan Layne and Karen Freifeld in New York; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T01:23:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
