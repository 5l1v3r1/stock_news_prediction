(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:HOPE), the holding company of Bank of Hope (the “Bank”), today reported unaudited financial results for its three months ended March 31, 2018. Net income for the 2018 first quarter increased significantly to a record $51.2 million, or $0.38 per diluted common share, up 185% from $18.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share, for the 2017 fourth quarter (1) and up 41% from $36.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted common share, for the year-ago first quarter.\nThe significant improvements in net income reflect, among other things, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017, which lowered the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.\n“We are off to a strong start in 2018 with a first quarter performance that demonstrates the benefits of the recent tax reform, as well as many other positive operating trends,” said Kevin S. Kim, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Most notably, we had our strongest quarter ever in terms of loan production with a record $1.1 billion in new loan commitments and new loan disbursements of $764 million. We are also very pleased with the improved production mix of 45% commercial real estate, 31% C&I and 24% consumer, with the majority of our production this quarter coming from our non-CRE categories. We believe these results reflect the benefits of our investments over the last year in our C&I and residential mortgage platform and talent.\n“Total deposits increased $664 million, or 6%, from year-end 2017, reflecting solid growth in all major deposit categories and a proactive effort to gather deposits ahead of the additional rate hikes expected this year. While it is expected that our funding costs will increase given the rising rate environment and competitive deposit market, we believe we are well positioned to mitigate the compression on our margin with higher loan volumes. All-in-all, our profitability metrics improved considerably with an ROA of 1.44% and an ROE of 10.61% for the 2018 first quarter, and we look forward to building on the momentum of our strong first quarter performance,” said Kim.\n(1) The Company's fourth quarter 2017 financial results included a one-time, non-cash, incremental income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $25.4 million resulting from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities (the “DTA”) and low income housing tax credit (the “LIHTC”) investments due to the enactment of the Tax Act. Excluding the one-time, non-cash tax expense, net income for the 2017 fourth quarter would have been $43.4 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share. Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding tax reform adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in the accompanying financial information.\nFinancial Highlights\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) At or for the Three Months Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Net income $ 51,232 $ 17,984 $ 36,210 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.38 $ 0.13 $ 0.27 Tax reform adjustments: Deferred tax asset $ — $ 23,835 $ — Investments in affordable housing partnerships $ — $ 1,588 $ — Net income, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 51,232 $ 43,407 $ 36,210 Diluted earnings per share, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 0.38 $ 0.32 $ 0.27 Net interest income before provision for loan losses $ 120,068 $ 126,392 $ 114,905 Net interest margin 3.66 % 3.84 % 3.77 % Noninterest income $ 19,850 $ 16,451 $ 17,603 Noninterest expense $ 68,453 $ 73,028 $ 67,699 Net loans receivable $ 11,206,022 $ 11,018,034 $ 10,471,008 Deposits $ 11,510,569 $ 10,846,609 $ 10,703,777 Nonaccrual loans (2) $ 68,152 $ 46,775 $ 37,009 ALLL to loans receivable 0.77 % 0.76 % 0.75 % ALLL to nonaccrual loans (2) 126.86 % 180.74 % 212.54 % ALLL to nonperforming assets (2) (3) 61.71 % 67.51 % 74.65 % Provision for loan losses $ 2,500 $ 3,600 $ 5,600 Net charge offs $ 580 $ 2,692 $ 6,284 Return on assets (“ROA”) 1.44 % 0.51 % 1.09 % Return on equity (“ROE”) 10.61 % 3.70 % 7.75 % Efficiency ratio 48.92 % 51.12 % 51.09 % (1) Net income and diluted earnings per share excluding tax reform adjustments are non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company provides the following supplemental information to facilitate a better understanding of financial performance. Net interest income and operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 included the following pre-tax acquisition accounting adjustments and merger-related expenses associated with past and current acquisitions:\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited) Three Months Ended 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Accretion on purchased non-impaired loans $ 3,197 $ 7,629 $ 2,676 Accretion on purchased credit-impaired loans 5,772 5,167 5,348 Amortization of premium on low income housing tax credits (84 ) (85 ) (84 ) Amortization of premium on acquired FHLB borrowings 347 353 441 Accretion of discount on acquired subordinated debt (264 ) (263 ) (259 ) Amortization of premium on acquired time deposits and savings 1 3 3,476 Amortization of core deposit intangibles (615 ) (675 ) (676 ) Total acquisition accounting adjustments $ 8,354 $ 12,129 $ 10,922 Merger-related expenses 7 (12 ) (947 ) Total $ 8,361 $ 12,117 $ 9,975 Net Interest Income. Net interest income before provision for loan losses for the 2018 first quarter totaled $120.1 million, compared with $126.4 million in the 2017 fourth quarter and $114.9 million in the year-ago first quarter. The decline in net interest income before provision for loan losses from the immediately preceding quarter largely reflects the recognition during the 2017 fourth quarter of approximately $3.0 million of additional accretion income related to acquired loans that was one-time in nature. No such benefit was recognized during the 2018 or 2017 first quarters. In addition, the Company noted that the 2018 first quarter had two fewer days of interest accrual when compared with the preceding fourth quarter.\nThe net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest earning assets) for the 2018 first quarter declined 18 basis points to 3.66% from 3.84% in the 2017 fourth quarter and declined 11 basis points from 3.77% in the year-ago first quarter. The 2018 first quarter net interest margin was adversely impacted by the changes in the Company’s weighted average yield on loans and weighted average cost of deposits.\nThe weighted average yield on loans for the 2018 first quarter declined by 8 basis points to 5.04% from 5.12% in the 2017 fourth quarter, but increased 22 basis points when compared with the year-ago first quarter weighted average yield on loans of 4.82%. The decline in the weighted average yield on loans from the immediately preceding quarter largely reflects the impact of the previously mentioned additional accretion income. The increase in the weighted average yield on loans from the year-ago first quarter reflects the benefits of the increase in the fed funds rate in March, June and December of 2017 of 25 basis points each on the Company’s variable rate loan portfolio.\nThe weighted average cost of deposits for the 2018 first quarter increased 11 basis points to 0.91% from 0.80% in the 2017 fourth quarter and increased 36 basis points from 0.55% in the year-ago first quarter. The increases reflect the progressively competitive deposit market, as well as a modest shift in the mix to the higher-rate time deposits.\nNoninterest Income . Noninterest income for the 2018 first quarter increased 21% to $19.9 million from $16.5 million in the 2017 fourth quarter and increased 13% from $17.6 million in the year-ago first quarter. The Company recognized net gains on sales of SBA loans of $3.5 million, $2.6 million and $3.3 million in the 2018 first quarter, 2017 fourth quarter and 2017 first quarter, respectively. Net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans amounted to $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $420,000 for the 2018 first quarter, 2017 fourth quarter and 2017 first quarter, respectively. The increase in other noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 included $3.5 million of income recorded on certain equity investments held by the Company.\nNoninterest Expense . Noninterest expense for the 2018 first quarter totaled $68.5 million, down 6% from $73.0 million in the preceding fourth quarter and up 1% from $67.7 million in the year-ago first quarter. As previously announced, the Company’s 2017 fourth quarter reflected elevated levels of noninterest expense due to several items, which were one-time or non-core in nature. Following an analysis of its LIHTC investments on an individual investment basis, the Company recognized a $3.3 million LIHTC impairment during the 2017 fourth quarter. 2017 fourth quarter noninterest expense also included $2.2 million of expenses related to special projects, as well as $1.0 million in expenses following an annual reassessment of the Company’s BOLI liabilities. The Company’s 2018 first quarter included $1.8 million of expenses related to special projects.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense of $39.4 million for the 2018 first quarter was relatively stable with $39.6 million in preceding fourth quarter, but increased 15% from $34.2 million in the prior-year first quarter. The total number of FTEs, excluding employees on leave, as of March 31, 2018 was 1,502, compared with 1,470 as of December 31, 2017 and 1,352 as of March 31, 2017.\nIncome Tax Provision . The effective tax rate for the 2018 first quarter was 25.7%, compared with 72.8% in the preceding fourth quarter and 38.8% in the 2017 first quarter. The significant improvement reflects the enactment of the Tax Act, which lowered the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Company recognized during the 2017 fourth quarter a $25.4 million charge related to the revaluation of its DTA and LIHTC investments as a result of the passage of the Tax Act. Excluding the $25.4 million charge, the effective tax rate for the 2017 fourth quarter would have been 34.4%.\nBalance Sheet Summary\nLoans receivable increased 2% to $11.29 billion at March 31, 2018 from $11.10 billion at December 31, 2017, reflecting a 7% annualized growth rate. Year-over-year, loans receivable increased 7% from $10.55 billion at March 31, 2017.\nTotal new loan originations funded during the 2018 first quarter increased to $764.3 million and included SBA loan production of $78.2 million and residential mortgage loan originations of $179.2 million. This compares with 2017 fourth quarter new loan originations funded of $663.5 million, which included SBA loan production of $66.7 million and residential mortgage loan originations of $193.0 million. In the year-ago first quarter, new loans originations funded totaled $587.4 million, including SBA loan production of $75.3 million and residential mortgage loan originations of $58.0 million.\nSales of SBA loans to the secondary market and gains derived from those sales are based substantially on the production of SBA 7(a) loans. SBA 7(a) loan originations totaled $73.9 million for the 2018 first quarter, compared with $66.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $51.9 million for the year-ago first quarter. During the 2018 first quarter, the Company sold $48.6 million of its SBA loans held for sale, compared with $36.6 million in the immediately preceding fourth quarter and $44.9 million in the first quarter a year ago.\nAggregate loan pay offs and pay downs in the 2018 first quarter increased to $411.6 million from $380.9 million for the immediately preceding fourth quarter but declined modestly from $414.6 million in the year-ago first quarter.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 amounted to $11.51 billion, up 6% from $10.85 billion at December 31, 2017 and up 8% from $10.70 billion at March 31, 2017. Noninterest bearing demand deposits accounted for 26.5%, 27.6% and 27.7% of total deposits as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nCredit Quality\nThe provision for loan and lease losses for the 2018 first quarter was $2.5 million, compared with $3.6 million for the immediately preceding 2017 fourth quarter and $5.6 million for the year-ago first quarter.\nFor a more detailed understanding of the changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”), the composition of the ALLL has been segmented for disclosure purposes between loans accounted for under the amortized cost method (referred to as “legacy loans”) and loans acquired through the Wilshire Bancorp, Center Financial, Pacific International and Foster Bankshares transactions (referred to as “purchased loans”). The purchased loans are further segregated between non-impaired and credit-impaired loans.\nThe composition of the ALLL as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 is as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Legacy loans (1) $ 72,045 $ 67,648 $ 64,055 Purchased non-impaired loans (2) 2,601 4,853 2,468 Purchased credit-impaired loans (2) 11,815 12,040 12,136 Total ALLL $ 86,461 $ 84,541 $ 78,659 Loans receivable $ 11,292,483 $ 11,102,575 $ 10,549,667 ALLL coverage ratio 0.77 % 0.76 % 0.75 % (1) Legacy loans include loans originated by the Bank’s predecessor banks, loans originated by Bank of Hope and loans that were acquired that have been refinanced as new loans.\n(2) Purchased loans were marked to fair value at acquisition date, and the ALLL reflects provisions for credit deterioration since the acquisition date.\nThe Company defines nonperforming loans to include delinquent loans past due 90 days or more on nonaccrual status, delinquent loans past due 90 days or more on accrual status (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans) and accruing restructured loans. Nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2018 increased to $68.2 million, or 0.60% of loans receivable, from $46.8 million, or 0.42% of loans receivable, at December 31, 2017 and $37.0 million, or 0.35% of loans receivable at March 31, 2017. Accruing restructured loans amounted to $59.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $67.3 million at December 31, 2017 and $49.0 million at March 31, 2017. Total nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 increased to $129.6 million, or 1.15% of loans receivable, from $114.4 million, or 1.03% of loans receivable December 31, 2017 and $86.3 million, or 0.82% of loans receivable at March 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets, including nonperforming loans and OREO, totaled $140.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $125.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $105.4 million March 31, 2017. As a percentage of total assets, nonperforming assets was 0.97% at March 31, 2018, 0.88% at December 31, 2017 and 0.78% at March 31, 2017.\nFollowing are the components of criticized loan balances as of March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017:\n(dollars in thousands) (unaudited) 3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Special Mention (1) $ 196,082 $ 214,891 $ 225,967 Classified (1) 344,648 353,584 309,996 Criticized $ 540,730 $ 568,475 $ 535,963 (1) Balances include purchased loans which were marked to fair value on the date of acquisition.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, net charge offs totaled $580,000, or 0.02% of average loans receivable on an annualized basis. This compares with 2017 fourth quarter net charge offs of $2.7 million, or 0.10% of average loans receivable on an annualized basis, and $6.3 million, or 0.24% of average loans receivable on an annualized basis, for the year-ago first quarter.\nThe ALLL at March 31, 2018 was $86.5 million, or 0.77% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale), compared with $84.5 million, or 0.76% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) at December 31, 2017 and $78.7 million, or 0.75% of loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale), at March 31, 2017. The coverage ratio of the ALLL to nonperforming loans (excluding purchased credit-impaired loans) was 66.69% at March 31, 2018, 73.88% at December 31, 2017 and 91.18% at March 31, 2017.\nImpaired loans (defined as loans for which it is probable that not all principal and interest payments due will be collected in accordance with the contractual terms) totaled $128.1 at March 31, 2018, compared with $114.3 million at December 31, 2017 and $129.6 million at March 31, 2017.\nCapital\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements to be generally classified as a “well-capitalized” financial institution, as summarized in the following table:\n3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Minimum Guideline\nfor “Well-Capitalized”\nInstitution Common Equity Tier 1 Capital 12.35 % 12.30 % 12.22 % 6.50 % Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 11.61 % 11.54 % 11.72 % 5.00 % Tier 1 Risk-based Ratio 13.15 % 13.11 % 13.05 % 8.00 % Total Risk-based Ratio 13.86 % 13.82 % 13.76 % 10.00 % Tangible common equity per share and as a percentage of tangible assets are summarized in the following table:\n3/31/2018 12/31/2017 3/31/2017 Tangible common equity per share (1) $ 10.81 $ 10.68 $ 10.32 Tangible common equity per share, excluding tax reform adjustments (1) $ 10.81 $ 10.87 $ 10.32 Tangible common equity to tangible assets (2) 10.44 % 10.54 % 10.74 % (1) Tangible common equity represents common equity less goodwill and net other intangible assets.
