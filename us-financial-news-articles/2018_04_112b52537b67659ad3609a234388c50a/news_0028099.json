REUTERS/Aly Song The 30-year-old turned up the heat at a cold Shanghai International Circuit with a scorching lap of one minute, 33.018 seconds which put him a 0.451 seconds clear of Raikkonen.\nCrucially, it was a full second clear of Hamilton’s quickest effort.\nThe Briton was fastest in both of Friday’s practice sessions but appeared to struggle for grip on the cold track on Saturday morning, even spinning at one point as asphalt temperatures plummeted to 15 degrees centigrade.\nIt was left to Valtteri Bottas, therefore, to lead Mercedes’ challenge. The Finn duly picked up the baton to set the third quickest time but was 0.743 seconds off Vettel’s pace.\nFormula One - F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai, China - April 13, 2018 - Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel during practice.
