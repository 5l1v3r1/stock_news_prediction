He was based at a mosque in the southern French city of Marseille.\nThe European Court of Human Rights had initially asked France to suspend the expulsion, after the imam’s lawyer had raised risks of torture, before saying on Thursday that additional information provided by French authorities had convinced it not to block the expulsion.\nFrance, which has been targeted over the past three years by attacks claimed by Islamic State, announced in February steps including prison isolation zones and more stringent licensing rules for faith-based schools to combat what it calls a slow-burning threat from Islamist radicalization.\nThe country has Europe’s largest Jewish and Muslim communities. The latter is estimated to number upwards of five million.\nAn Elabe poll last month showed 80 percent backed the expulsion of radicalized foreigners, while more than half of its respondents said Macron was not doing enough to counter terrorism.\nReporting by Jean-Francois Rosnoblet and Gilbert Reilhac, Writing by Ingrid Melander, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T14:20:40.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
