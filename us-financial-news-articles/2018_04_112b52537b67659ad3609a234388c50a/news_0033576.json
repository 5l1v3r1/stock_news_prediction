Those protests were partly driven by young Egyptians angered by lack of job prospects.\nMonday’s CAPMAS figures indicated that 24.8 percent of youth between the ages of 15 and 29 were unemployed, with the figure rising to 31.8 percent among Egyptians with higher levels of education.\nThe official employment figures, however, only count a labour force of 29.5 million Egyptians, or less than a third of the country’s population of 96.8 million.\n“In general, there are very clear improvements in the economy. The questions remain: how broad are these improvements and how many new jobs are being created?” said Angus Blair, chief operating officer of Pharos Holdings, an investment bank.\nEgypt’s Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI), a monthly measure of non-oil private sector activity and job growth, has meanwhile declined in each of the past 29 months except for one.\n“The PMI Survey has reported that the private sector in Egypt has seen a contraction in non-oil employment for about two years, so the question is where is the rise in employment coming from?” said Blair.
