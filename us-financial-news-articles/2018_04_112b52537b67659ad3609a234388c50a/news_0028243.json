Emerging markets sold off in mid-week due to concerns of Western military action in Syria that could drive a confrontation with Russia. But Trump tempered his remarks over the subject on Thursday and even as he consulted allies such as Britain and France, who could join in any U.S.-led strikes on Syria, there were signs of efforts to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control. \"For now, investor caution over Syria seems to be fading,\" analysts at H. Commcor brokerage wrote in a client note. The Mexican and Colombian pesos firmed 0.4 and 0.5 percent, respectfully. The Brazilian real, however, fell 0.6 percent as traders fretted over the most uncertain presidential election in decades. Following the arrest of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was leading polls and had rallied against President Michel Temer's austerity platform, traders now await fresh surveys to assess whether market-friendly candidates will gain strength. Traders booked profits from recent gains ahead of a poll in the weekend, driving the benchmark Bovespa stock 1.4 percent lower. In a report, analysts at Guide Investimentos said investors should check the polls for signs of growing support for former São Paulo governor Geraldo Alckmin and former Supreme Court Justice Joaquim Barbosa. Shares of Cyrela Brazil Realty SA, Latin America's largest homebuilder, fell sharply after it reported lower launches in the first quarter despite rising sales. BRF SA, Brazil's largest chicken processor, dropped 1.2 percent following three straight daily gains. The man tapped by pension funds to preside over BRF's board said this week he refused to take part in an alternative board lineup, deepening a rift between the food company's shareholders.
