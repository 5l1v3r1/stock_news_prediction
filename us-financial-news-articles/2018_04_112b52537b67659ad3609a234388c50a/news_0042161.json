Beyond Tubman’s $20 bill, women’s rights icons Alice Paul and Marian Anderson were to appear on the back of the $10 bill. The $5 bill featuring Martin Luther King, Jr. on the back has also been delayed.\nDonald Trump is a fan of Andrew Jackson . And Treasury Secretary Mnuchin has the final say on all currency redesigns—and has historically shown a reluctance to make the changes a priority.\n“Ultimately we will be looking at this issue,” he said last year . “It’s not something that I’m focused on at the moment.”", "external_links": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/what-happened-to-the-plan-to-put-harriet-tubman-on-the-dollar20-bill"], "published": "2018-04-19T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T19:12:11.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
