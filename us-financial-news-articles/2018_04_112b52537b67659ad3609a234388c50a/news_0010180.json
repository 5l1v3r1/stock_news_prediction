The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, the benchmark for the bloc, rose to a 5-day high of 0.525 percent\nEuro zone stocks slightly reduced gains but remained within their daily trading range, last up 0.5 percent.\nThe euro briefly jumped to the day’s highs of $1.2378 and was up 0.4 percent on the day.
