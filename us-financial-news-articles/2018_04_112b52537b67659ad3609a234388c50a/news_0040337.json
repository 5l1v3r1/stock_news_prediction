Healthy persons infected with Salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with Salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.\nThe potentially affected powder products are packaged in kaft paper, foil-lined heat sealed pouches and sold in 25 grams, 100 grams, 250 grams, and 1000 grams sizes. The units were sold directly to consumers nationwide in January and February of 2018 via company websites.
