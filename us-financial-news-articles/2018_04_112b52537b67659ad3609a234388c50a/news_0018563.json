It’s a solution and a constructive principle that is interesting because we create the house directly on site and in addition thanks to the robot, we are able to create walls with complex shapes,” said Benoit Furet, a professor who worked on the project. \nThe 95 square metre (1000 square feet), five-room house will be allocated to a local family which qualifies for social housing, authorities said. \nThe Y-shaped home is equipped with multiple sensors that monitor air quality, humidity and temperature, as well as equipment to evaluate and analyse the thermal properties of the building. \nResearchers believe this technology will enable tenants to save on energy costs. \nAuthorities in Nantes are planning further 3D-printed building projects, including a public reception building and a housing estate.
