Related Coverage Factbox - Deadly attacks in Western Europe \nBroadcaster ZDF said police were searching his apartment and that he had contact with far-right extremists, but there was no evidence thus far that he was a far-right extremist himself. \nThe Sueddeutsche Zeitung said the man had psychological problems. The Interior Ministry in North Rhine-Westphalia would neither confirm nor deny the report. \nBode said investigators were looking at the possibility that other suspects fled the scene, though they had no evidence that this was the case, he added. \nBild newspaper said police were searching for two possible additional suspects after witnesses said they had seen two people jump out of the van. Jens R. had no police record, the newspaper said. \n“The crime scene investigators are checking out the crime scene, trying to identify, investigate and secure traces. That is our current task,” Bode said.

REUTERS/Staff \nA police spokeswoman said: “The danger is over.” \nMartin Wiech, who said he had studied in Muenster, told Der Spiegel he had driven to Muenster to go shopping and was now unable to return to his car. \n“Unbelievable that something like this could happen in Muenster. It is one of the most peaceful cities I know,” he said. MERKEL “SHAKEN” \nThe incident came one year to the day after a truck attack in Stockholm that killed five people. \nIt also evoked memories of a December 2016 truck attack in Berlin that killed 12. In that attack, Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck, killed the driver and then ploughed into a crowded marketplace, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. \nChancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was “deeply shaken”.

France shares in Germany’s suffering.” \nDer Spiegel reported that police were investigating a similar incident that occurred in the eastern German city of Cottbus on Friday evening, when a man drove his car into a group of people, injuring two, before fleeing.
