(OTCBB: ORBN) (the “Company”), parent company of Willamette Valley Bank, reported net income of $1,222,001 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $808,042 during the first quarter of 2017. This represents a 51% increase over the year ago quarter. The improvement in quarterly net income was the result of a 12% increase in commercial loan balances and 47% increase in mortgage production from the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in our effective tax rate following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was also a significant factor in our quarterly financial results. On April 18, 2018, the Board of Directors announced a two-for-one stock split for shareholders of record on May 1, 2018.\nAnnualized return on assets rose to 2.38% compared to 1.83% in the year-ago period and return on equity reached 20.57% compared to 16.38% in 2017. Total assets rose to $217 million from $177 million and earnings per share for the quarter were $1.14 compared to $0.74 for the same quarter a year ago. The company declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $1.20 per share was paid on March 15, 2018.\n“Our solid financial performance in the first quarter is the result of efforts to enhance our presence throughout the Willamette Valley,” Neil Grossnicklaus, President and CEO stated. “Strong and consistent earnings over the last year enabled the Company to increase its quarterly dividend and pay a special cash dividend to our loyal shareholders.”\n“We are pleased with the growth in core deposits that has enabled us to increase our local small business lending,” commented Ryan Dempster, Chief Financial Officer. “Residential mortgage lending has remained strong during a time of year that is normally slower due to seasonality.”\nAbout Oregon Bancorp, Inc.\nOregon Bancorp, Inc. is the parent company of Willamette Valley Bank, a community bank headquartered in Salem, Oregon.
