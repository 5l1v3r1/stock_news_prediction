Mission Accomplished!” Trump said in a Twitter post. \nTrump’s message echoed the words of a banner that hung behind former President George W. Bush when he gave a speech in 2003 from the USS Abraham Lincoln, during the Iraq War. \nThat visual dogged Bush’s presidency as the war dragged out, with worsening American casualties, for the remainder of his two terms in office. \n(This version of the story refiles to fix typographical error in paragraph 3).
