Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 23, 2018 Williams' Lance Stroll during practice REUTERS/Brandon Malone \nThe team are bottom of the overall standings after two of the 21 races and the only ones yet to score. \nThe last time Williams, who finished fifth overall last year, went home empty-handed from the opening two races of the year was in 2013. \nBahrain was particularly sobering last Sunday, with Canadian Stroll and Russian rookie Sirotkin finishing as the last of the classified finishers. \nThey moved up to 14th and 15th after post-race penalties were applied to Force India’s Sergio Perez and Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley. \nThe Williams pair had qualified in 18th and dead last, with Sirotkin the higher of the two. \n“In Bahrain it was shocking how much of a step backwards (it was),” 19-year-old Stroll, in only his second season of Formula One, told reporters on an overcast day at the Shanghai International Circuit.
