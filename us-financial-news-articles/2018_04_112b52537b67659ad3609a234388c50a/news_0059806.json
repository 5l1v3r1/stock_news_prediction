The company had earlier said it expects to start construction in 2019.\nThe expansion has pitted environmentalists worried about spills and global warming against industry advocates who say the project will shore up discounted Canadian oil prices and attract investment to Alberta’s oil sands.\n“We continue to advance more than $20 billion of medium- to longer-term projects, including Keystone XL, Coastal GasLink and the Bruce Power life extension program,” TransCanada Chief Executive Officer Russ Girling said.\nThe company expects to invest C$21 billion in the near term, down from the C$23 billion it had earmarked earlier.\nTransCanada said earnings from its Canadian natural gas pipelines fell 10.2 percent to C$253 million in the reported quarter.\nNet income rose to C$734 million, or 83 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter from C$643 million, or 74 Canadian cents per share, for the same period in 2017. ( bit.ly/2r4qjZn )\nExcluding items, TransCanada earned 98 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nRevenue rose marginally to C$3.42 billion from C$3.41 billion.
