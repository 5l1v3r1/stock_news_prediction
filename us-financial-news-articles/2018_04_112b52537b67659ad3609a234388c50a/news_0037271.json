That is how serious these things are.”\nThe government-backed Royal Commission into Australia’s banking sector is just a couple of months into what is expected to be a year-long investigation and public grilling of senior executives in the country’s financial sector.\nThe centre-right government agreed to call the inquiry after years of scandals in Australia’s financial sector, including interest-rate rigging, accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate insurance payouts, and accusations of money-laundering.\nIt is currently focusing on the provision of financial advice by AMP and the four largest banks: Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia , National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking Corp.\nIn coming months, the inquiry will turn its attention to large insurers and pension funds.
