After her admission, the company forced her to resign, claiming that she violated its social media policy. \nNow Briskman has filed a lawsuit against her former employer, claiming unlawful termination. Briskman’s lawyers allege that Akima, a government contractor, forced her to resign “out of fear of unlawful retaliation by the government,” suggesting that such behavior violates “the basic tenets of Virginia employment law.” They argue that Briskman’s “expression of disapproval” of the president is protected by the First Amendment . Briskman gestures with her middle finger as a motorcade with U.S. President Donald Trump departs Trump National Golf Course October 28, 2017 in Sterling, Virginia.

She is therefore seeking the other two weeks of pay and coverage of her legal fees, amounting to $2,692.30 in damages.
