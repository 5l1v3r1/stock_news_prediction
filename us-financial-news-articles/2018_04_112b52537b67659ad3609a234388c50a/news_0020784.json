Medicaid is a federal-state insurance program for low-income people of any age. \nThe study team focused on Commonwealth Care Alliance members with at least six months of enrollment in one of two meal delivery programs, and compared them to members who were similar but not participating in a meal program. \nOf the meal recipients, 133 got meals that were medically-tailored for certain conditions, such as diabetes or a need for soft foods. Another 624 got untailored meals from the non-profit Meals on Wheels organization. More than 2,300 non-meal-recipients were in the comparison group. \nThe research team looked at the number and costs of emergency room visits, hospital admissions, use of emergency transportation, inpatient visits, outpatient visits and pharmacy use. \nThey found that people in the medically-tailored meal program had fewer emergency room visits and inpatient admissions and less emergency transportation use than the comparison group. Those in the nontailored meal program had fewer emergency visits and lower transportation use but about the same rate of inpatient admissions. \nPeople in the medically tailored meal programs had lower medical spending, by about $570 per month, than the comparison group and those in the nontailored meal program had about $156 lower medical spending per month. \nThe average monthly meal-program costs per participant were $350 for the medically-tailored program and $146 for the nontailored program. \nSubtracting the program costs, that could mean a savings of $220 for the medically tailored meal program and $10 for the nontailored food program, the study authors write. \n“Addressing issues like food insecurity, though we still need to learn more about the best way to do so, is a promising strategy for improving health,” Berkowitz said in an email. \nFederal funding supports 35 percent of local food delivery programs. Studies like these could play into conversations about federal funding cuts to programs such as Meals on Wheels, Anthony Campbell of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who wasn’t involved in the research, said in an email. “This study is an excellent example of the type of rigorous research needed.” \nThe budget conversation will also become more prevalent as the U.S. population grows older and requires more support, said Ellen Barnidge of St. Louis University in Missouri, who wasn’t involved in the study. \n“With the older adult population growing, we need to support programs that keep vulnerable older adults who want to remain in their homes able to do so,” she said by email. “It appears from other studies that home-delivered meal programs decrease nursing home admissions, too.” \n“There’s sometimes a stigma attached with accepting these services, and some people don’t access services they’re eligible for,” said Dr. Julie Bynum of the University of Michigan School of Medicine in Ann Arbor, who wasn’t involved in the study. “This isn’t just about having food on your table but taking care of your overall health and staying out of places like the emergency department,” she said in a telephone interview. \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2JEIRI2 Health Affairs, online April 2, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T22:49:46.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
