The move toward a more aggressive Fed came as the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield hovered around 3 percent , which multiple bond experts have predicted would be a key level.\nThe probability had been just 33 percent a month ago and less than 40 percent as of late last week.\nThe CME computes the probability of a rate hike by taking the end-month futures contract, subtracting the level at the beginning of the month, and dividing that by 25 basis points, which is the assumed level of each rate hike. (A full explanation of the process is here . The fed funds contracts are here . To get the implied funds level for each month, subtract the contract level from 100.)\nFOMC members themselves, in their latest forecast in March, still indicated three increases in the funds rate this year. However, with increasing signs of inflation picking up and as the market begins to price in more hikes, the committee could begin to set its sights higher.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:09:41.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
