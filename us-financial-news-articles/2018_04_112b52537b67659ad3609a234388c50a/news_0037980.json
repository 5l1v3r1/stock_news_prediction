Deutsch, CEO. “This quarter's performance reflects year-over-year pre-tax, pre-provision income growth of 23% with positive operating leverage achieved through strong revenue growth and expense growth in line with our expectations. We have worked hard to return to positive operating leverage following stepped up investments in staff and technology throughout 2017.”\n“The bank continues to exhibit strong credit quality in the form of lower Criticized and Classified loans, and our market-linked fee businesses achieved positive net flows on a consolidated basis amid increasing market volatility.

The Company’s Core net interest margin (non-FTE basis) increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 2.90% driven primarily by higher asset yields and a mix shift from investments to loans, partially offset by increased deposit and borrowing costs.\nNet interest margin (FTE basis) was 2.95% for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 1 basis point from the first quarter of 2017.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher levels of assets under management in the Investment Management, Wealth Advisory, and Wealth Management and Trust segments.

On April 13, 2018, the Company completed the sale of its ownership interest in Anchor. Anchor’s results remain consolidated in the Company’s results during current and prior periods. For presentation purposes, Anchor’s AUM are excluded from current and prior period AUM amounts, but are included in the calculation of Core Fees and Income. The Company classified the assets and liabilities of Anchor as held for sale at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which are included with Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For regulatory purposes, the goodwill and intangible assets of Anchor will be included in consolidated calculations. See footnotes 6 and 8, below.\n(2) Total revenue is the sum of Net interest income, Total core fees and income, and Total other income.\n(3) Net income from discontinued operations consists of contingent payments net of expenses related to our divested affiliate, Westfield Capital Management Company, LLC. The Company received its final contingent payment in the first quarter of 2018 related to this affiliate.\n(4) Adjustments to net income attributable to the Company to arrive at net income attributable to the common shareholders, as presented in these tables, include decrease/ (increase) in noncontrolling interests redemption value and dividends paid on preferred stock.\n(5) When the Company has positive net income from continuing operations attributable to the common shareholders, the Company adds additional shares to basic weighted average shares outstanding to arrive at diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the diluted earnings per share calculation.
