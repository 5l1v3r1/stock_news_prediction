I was just hanging on,” said the Australian of his performance.\n“I was a passenger. When you’re on wet with slick tires... you’ve just got to hang on and hope to God you make it to the other side.”\nHonda’s Spanish veteran Dani Pedrosa was second fastest, 0.177 slower than Miller’s time of one minute 47.153 seconds, with Frenchman Johann Zarco a close third for the non-works Tech3 Yamaha team.\nReigning champion Marc Marquez, Pedrosa’s team mate and the race favorite, will start in sixth place while Ducati’s championship leader Andrea Dovizioso qualified eighth.\n“I decided to try the slick tires but it was too risky,” said Marquez. “As soon as I exited the pit I realized that if I touched the wet side of the track the risk of crashing was great.\n“It’s a pity we’re not on the front row but I’m happy because I think we’ve worked well this weekend.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T01:22:31.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
