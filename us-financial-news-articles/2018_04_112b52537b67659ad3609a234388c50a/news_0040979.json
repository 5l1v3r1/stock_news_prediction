Orlando Arcia followed Braun’s homer with a solo shot during a seven-run sixth inning that allowed Milwaukee to turn the game into a blowout.\nJesus Aguilar went 3-for-4 with three RBIs and two runs as the Brewers won their third consecutive game.\nHall of Famer Robin Yount (1,406 RBIs from 1974-93) is the only other Milwaukee player with 1,000 or more RBIs.\nLewis Brinson, a former Brewer, hit his first two homers of the season for the Marlins. Miami has lost 11 of its past 14 contests.\nBrewers right-hander Chase Anderson (2-1) allowed three runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He struck out three and walked two.\nMiami left-hander Dillon Peters (2-2) struggled with his control, walking five and throwing two wild pitches in 4 2/3 innings. Peters allowed four runs and three hits while striking out four.\nThe Brewers used a three-run fifth inning to take a 5-3 lead.\nCain led off the inning with a tying homer that hit the top of the left field wall and bounced over.

Braun came off the bench and delivered his three-run shot to left-center to make it 11-3, and Arcia followed with his blast to center.\nMilwaukee pushed across a run in the first inning as Christian Yelich was caught stealing but remained in a rundown between first and second long enough for Cain to score from third.\nBrinson tied the game in the third with his first homer, a shot to center field.\nThe Brewers took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the inning as Cain doubled, moved to third on a grounder and scored on a wild pitch by Peters.\nBrinson was at it again in the fifth as he followed a leadoff walk to Cameron Maybin with a two-run blast to straightaway center to give Miami a 3-2 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:24:09.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
