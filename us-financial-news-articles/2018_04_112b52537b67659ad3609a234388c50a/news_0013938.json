We are held in high esteem within the Commonwealth and we’ve done so over many, many Games. \n“And to have something like this take away our success so far and the success we’re going to have is really, really disappointing. \n“We will interview Sean McComb when he comes in and we will be meeting with the police to see what action needs to be taken as a result of this.” \nMcVeigh added it was possible that the light-welterweight boxer could be sent home early from the Games.
