But it would be good if he could match those statements with actions,\" ambassador John McCallum said, referring to Xi's speeches at Davos last year and at the Boao forum this year. \n\"Their actions have not always matched their words. So the more they could act, the more it would help the world to preserve the international system and avoid a descent into a trade war,\" he added. \nThe escalating trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world have resulted in China slapping a 25 percent levy on U.S. imports including products such as soybeans, cars and whiskey â€” a tit-for-tat after President Donald Trump targeted a list of Chinese imports. \nChina is the biggest export market for Canadian soybeans and while it might be true that Canada might stand to benefit from tariffs on U.S. soybeans , the ambassador told CNBC's Martin Soong that a trade war in general will still have a negative impact on Canada, and the global economy at large.

And I think the Chinese want a simpler trade deal and we want a more ambitious trade deal and that is why I think those discussions are still ongoing.\" \n\"But I do believe both China and Canada would like it to happen at some point, so I'm quite optimistic even though it hasn't happened yet,\" he concluded.
