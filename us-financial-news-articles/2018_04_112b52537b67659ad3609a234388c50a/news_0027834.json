But it wasn’t easy.\nJohn Wall led Washington with 23 points and 15 assists, and Markieff Morris scored 22 points and grabbed 11 rebounds.\nToronto led 86-85 after a back-and-forth third quarter, setting up a pressure-packed finish for the top seed in the East. The Raptors grabbed the momentum early in the fourth quarter after Wizards forward Mike Scott was called for a flagrant foul on Kyle Lowry. The Toronto point guard hit two free throws and assisted on a Miles’ 3-pointer to cap a 7-0 spurt for the Raptors.\nMiles’ second 3-pointer of the quarter put Toronto up 103-96 with just over six minutes to play. Miles finished with 12 points, and Wright added 18 points, 11 coming in the decisive fourth quarter.\nLowry set up Ibaka for a layup that gave the Raptors a 10-point lead with 1:42 to play.
