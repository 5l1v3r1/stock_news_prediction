(NYSE: RLI) – RLI Corp. reported first quarter 2018 net earnings of $12.2 million ($0.27 per share), compared to $19.8 million ($0.45 per share) for the first quarter of 2017. Operating earnings (1) for the first quarter of 2018 were $26.7 million ($0.60 per share) compared to $19.4 million ($0.44 per share) for the same period in 2017.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Per Diluted Share 2018 2017 Net earnings (2) $ 0.27 $ 0.45 Operating earnings (1) $ 0.60 $ 0.44 (1) See discussion below: Non-GAAP and Performance Measures. (2) Unrealized losses on equity securities and the related taxes were included in net earnings in 2018. See discussion below: Recently Adopted Accounting Standard and Tax Reform. Highlights for the quarter included:\nUnderwriting income (1) of $17.5 million, resulting in a combined ratio (1) of 90.8. 11% increase in gross premiums written and 9% increase in investment income. Favorable development in prior years’ loss reserves resulting in a $12.5 million net increase in underwriting income. Book value per share of $18.82, a decrease of 2% from year-end 2017, inclusive of dividends.\n“RLI is off to an excellent start in 2018 with a 91 combined ratio and continued strong organic growth across much of our product portfolio,” said RLI Corp. Chairman & CEO Jonathan E. Michael. “Gross premium in the quarter was up 11%, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Most of our products contributed to this growth, including a healthy mix of newer and mature products. Underwriting income, combined with investment income growth of 9% in the quarter, drove operating EPS of $0.60 per share.” He continued, “Our results reflect the hard work of our talented team, who remain focused on delivering superior products and service to our customers.”\nUnderwriting Income\nRLI achieved $17.5 million of underwriting income in the first quarter of 2018 on a 90.8 combined ratio, compared to $13.1 million of underwriting income on a 92.9 combined ratio in the same quarter for 2017. Results for both years include favorable development in prior years’ loss reserves which totaled $12.5 million and $4.7 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table highlights underwriting income and combined ratios by segment.\nUnderwriting Income (1) Combined Ratio (1) (in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Casualty $ 1.6 $ (6.8 ) Casualty 98.8 105.8 Property 5.9 8.8 Property 83.3 75.5 Surety 10.0 11.1 Surety 65.4 63.5 Total $ 17.5 $ 13.1 Total 90.8 92.9 (1) See discussion below: Non-GAAP and Performance Measures. Other Income\nRLI’s net investment income for the quarter increased 9.4% to $14.2 million, compared to the same period in 2017. The investment portfolio’s total return was -1.5% for the quarter.\nComprehensive earnings were -$14.2 million for the quarter (-$0.32 per share) compared to $31.6 million ($0.71 per share) for the same quarter in 2017. In addition to net earnings, comprehensive earnings included after-tax unrealized gains/losses from the fixed income portfolio in 2018 and after-tax unrealized gains/losses from the fixed income and equity portfolios in 2017. See Recently Adopted Accounting Standard and Tax Reform discussion below.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated investees was $5.2 million for the quarter compared to $4.9 million from the same period last year. These results are related to Maui Jim, Inc. ($4.2 million), a producer of premium sunglasses, and Prime Holdings Insurance Services, Inc. ($1.0 million), a specialty E&S insurance company. For the first quarter of 2017, equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees from Maui Jim and Prime was $4.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively.\nDividends Paid in the First Quarter of 2018\nOn March 20, 2018, the company paid an ordinary dividend of $0.21 per share, the same amount as the prior quarter. RLI’s cumulative dividends total more than $611 million paid over the last five years.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standard and Tax Reform\nAs disclosed in RLI’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, accounting guidance for financial instruments changed in 2018 under ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. We adopted this accounting standard update, effective January 1, 2018, using a cumulative-effect adjustment. This adjustment moved the historical unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on the equity portfolio from accumulated other comprehensive earnings to retained earnings, but had no impact on overall shareholders’ equity. In addition, for 2018 and forward, the change in fair value for equity securities is required to be recognized through net earnings rather than through other comprehensive income. As defined below, we exclude these unrealized gains and losses in arriving at operating earnings and earnings per share from operations. For the first quarter of 2018, $26.8 million of unrealized losses, gross of tax, were recognized within pre-tax earnings and the income tax expense was reduced by $5.6 million. The impact to our income statement will vary depending upon the level of volatility in the performance of the securities held in our equity portfolio and the overall market.\nThe change in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% commencing January 1, 2018, as enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), contributed to a lower effective tax rate for 2018 as compared to 2017.\nNon-GAAP and Performance Measures\nManagement has included certain non-generally accepted accounting principles (“non-GAAP”) financial measures in presenting the Company’s results. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures better explain the Company’s results of operations and allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying trends in the Company’s business. These measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In addition, our definitions of these items may not be comparable to the definitions used by other companies.\nOperating earnings and earnings per share (EPS) from operations consist of our GAAP net earnings adjusted by the net realized gains/(losses), net unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities for 2018 only and taxes related thereto. The adjustment for net unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities is only applicable for 2018 due to the adoption of the above mentioned accounting standard update. Net earnings and net earnings per share are the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to operating earnings and EPS from operations. A reconciliation of the operating earnings and EPS from operations to the comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the 2018 financial highlights below.\nUnderwriting income or profit represents the pretax profitability of our insurance operations and is derived by subtracting loss and settlement expenses, policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses from net premium earned, which are all GAAP financial measures. The combined ratio, which is derived from components of underwriting income, is a performance measure commonly used by property and casualty insurance companies and is calculated as the sum of loss and settlement expenses, policy acquisition costs and insurance operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned, which are all GAAP measures.\nOther News\nAt 10 a.m. central daylight time (CDT) tomorrow, April 19, 2018, RLI management will hold a conference call to discuss quarterly results with insurance industry analysts.
