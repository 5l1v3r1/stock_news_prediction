Lucinda again filling in for Polina. Feel free to ping me at Lucinda.shen@fortune.com .\nNow onto the news.\nZuora popped 43% to $20 in its first day of trading Thursday, giving the company, which helps subscription-based firms manage billing and pricing, a valuation of around $2 billion.\nFor the firm’s early investors, it’s confirmation that investors also believe that the subscription economy has space to grow.\n“The subscription economy is in its early innings,” Shasta Ventures Managing Director Jason Pressman told Term Sheet (Shasta owns an 8.3% stake in the company, now worth about $153.7 million post-offering). “You’ve certainly seen tech companies have a mass migration to subscriptions. But with a lot of industries its still nascent. I think recurring use physical farm, construction equipment, cars, and trucks are very much a place where you see a subscription economy making more and more sense.”\nNotably, Zuora names construction equipment maker CAT and car maker Ford among its clients.\nThat’s not to say you’ll be sleeping on subscription-service bedsheets after programming your $3-a-month alarm clock any time soon.\n“We don’t think the whole world will shift to subscription,” Pressman added. “For example, we don’t think any one is going to subscribe to cement.”\nThough in the short term, an initial public offering could help Zuora bring in some subscription-curious companies.\n“We are relatively small, and having this public platform will raise our visibility,” Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo told Term Sheet. “I think this raise is less about capital, and more about the strength of our company. Part of it was to establish that we are a mature, stronger company—which I think will make customers more comfortable.”\nIt’s the argument for a public offering, after a dry spell of tech IPOs in recent years.\nPerhaps Zuora’s successful debut may add to the “pros” column for tech firms weighing an IPO. Its performance comes following a string of strong tech IPOs this year, including that of Zscaler and Dropbox. Now firms such as Eventbrite and Upwork are reportedly preparing for their own offering, the Wall Street Journal reports.\nAdvertisement THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...\n• President Trump May Want the U.S. to Rejoin the TPP.
