It was the downstream and chemicals that were the surprise, that outperformed versus our numbers,” Bouchard said.\nOil sands producer Cenovus ( CVE.TO ) posted a first-quarter loss, hurt by shipping bottlenecks on Wednesday. Low oil prices and a slow ramp up at its offshore Indonesia project saw Husky Energy ( HSE.TO ) cut its 2018 production on Thursday.\nImperial, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ), said total revenue and other income rose about 11 percent to C$7.93 billion.\nThe oil producer and refiner’s production fell to 370,000 gross oil-equivalent barrels per day from 378,000 a year earlier due to lower volumes at its Cold Lake oil sands project in northeastern Alberta.\nHowever, the company’s income from refining rose about 37 percent to C$521 million.
