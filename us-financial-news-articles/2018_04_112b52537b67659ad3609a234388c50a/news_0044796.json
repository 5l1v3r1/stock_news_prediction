It did not name the airliner involved.\nBoth countries have accused each other of a series of mid-air incidents since Abu Dhabi and other powers imposed travel, diplomatic and trade sanctions on Qatar in June.\nThe UAE, along with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt, accuse Qatar of supporting regional foe Iran as well as Islamist extremists. Qatar has denied the charge and accused the four countries of trying to curtail its sovereignty.\nThere was no immediate comment by Qatari officials on the accusation.\nReporting by Noah Browning; Editing by Edmund Blair and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T14:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T15:24:56.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
