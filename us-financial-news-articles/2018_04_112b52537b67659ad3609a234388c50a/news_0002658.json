ECS will continue to operate under the ECS brand name and will also operate as a separate segment of ASGN. The President of ECS, George Wilson, and the current ECS leadership team will continue to execute the strategy and oversee the day-to-day operations of the business.\n“We’re excited by the combination of ASGN and ECS,” said Peter Dameris, CEO of ASGN. \"The addition of ECS’ government services solutions to our business portfolio will complement and elevate our statement of work offerings and provide us access to the $130 billion federal IT services market. As we look ahead, our mission as an organization is to be the premier provider of highly skilled human capital that will drive the economy into the next generation.\"\nIn connection with the acquisition and to fund the purchase consideration, ASGN amended its existing credit facility. The amended credit facility consists of (i) a $200.0 million five-year revolving credit facility (undrawn at close) which bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.25 to 2.25 percent, based on ASGN’s applicable leverage ratio, and (ii) term B loans totaling $1.4 billion (all of which is outstanding at closing), consisting of two tranches: (a) a $578.0 million tranche maturing on June 5, 2022, and (b) an $822.0 million tranche maturing on April 2, 2025. The term B loans bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.0 percent. At closing, the company’s leverage ratio (ratio of debt to trailing 12-month pro forma Adjusted EBITDA) was approximately 3.67 to 1. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, served as the administrative agent for the amendment to the credit facility.\nFor income tax reporting purposes, the acquisition was treated as an asset purchase, resulting in a step up in the tax basis in the intangibles assets acquired. This “step-up” in tax basis is expected to result in an annual cash income tax savings of approximately $12 million ($9 million of which relates to amortization of goodwill and trademarks) over the next 15 years from the amortization of these assets for income tax purposes.\nIn connection with the closing, ASGN granted restricted stock unit awards to 54 ECS employees covering approximately 162,000 shares. Of these, George Wilson and another employee were each granted an award as described below. If applicable performance targets are met and subject to continued service to the company, the grants will vest as follows: (a) for 60 percent of the award, one-half on the second anniversary of the grant date, and 25 percent on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and (b) for the remaining 40 percent of the award, in equal installments on the first, second, and third annual anniversaries of the grant date. The awards granted to the other ECS employees will vest, subject to the employee’s continued service, (x) as to 40 percent of the award, over four years with 50 percent of each award vesting on the second anniversary of the closing and 25 percent of such portion vesting on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date, and (y) as to 60 percent of the award, in 12 substantially equal installments on each quarterly anniversary of April 1, 2019, and further subject to ECS’ achievement of a 2018 performance target. The restricted stock unit awards were granted to the ECS employees as employment inducement awards pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules.\nConcurrent with the acquisition, On Assignment changed its name to ASGN Incorporated to better reflect the combined company’s business.\nAbout ECS\nECS is a leading information technology provider delivering solutions in cloud, cybersecurity, software development, IT modernization, and science and engineering.
