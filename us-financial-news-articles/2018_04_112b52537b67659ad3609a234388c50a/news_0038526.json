That sent shares of those companies into a tailspin.\nShares of Philip Morris International were on track for their biggest single-day decline ever , while household-product makers were punished for Procter & Gamble’s disappointing sales results and signs the broader industry is struggling to raise prices.\nAlthough investors have been more muted in their response to companies that are reporting stronger-than-expected results so far, those that miss expectations or offer weak guidance have faced a harsh rebuke from investors.\n“People believed these companies were solid. You take a Procter & Gamble or a Unilever and you think about them as cornerstones of your portfolio,” said Arian Vojdani, an investment strategist with MV Financial. “Consumer staples don’t look as strong as people expected.”\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.9% in recent trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 162 points, or 0.7%, to 24584. The Nasdaq dropped 1%.\nInvestors worry that consumer-product makers are in a rut, as weak inflation, Amazon.com’s push into selling more household goods and shoppers’ fading loyalty to name brands make it hard for those companies to raise prices and grow anywhere near the rates of the market’s most desirable stocks, such as shares of tech companies.\nPhilip Morris, the seller of Marlboro cigarettes, was the biggest drag on the broad index after it reported revenue that missed analysts’ expectations and cautioned investors that slowing sales volume in the Middle East and other markets, along with pricing competition, could be a drag on earnings this year.\nShares fell 16% and were on track to touch their lowest price since 2015.\nProcter & Gamble, the maker of Tide and Bounty paper towels, reported weak sales growth in key markets, especially in its Gillette shaving business. Shares slipped 2.4%.\nEuropean consumer goods companies were also under pressure after Unilever, which sells Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, and Nestlé both struggled to raise prices in the first quarter and saw some of their weakest sales growth in years. Unilever shares fell 2.2%, while Nestlé rose 0.2%.\nThe broader consumer-staples group in the S&P 500 fell 3.6%, as cigarette makers and household-product companies like Clorox and Church & Dwight declined.\nTechnology companies stumbled, with chip makers among the biggest decliners. The Technology Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund fell 1.4%, cutting its weekly gain nearly in half.\nFinancial stocks, meanwhile, rose as bond yields moved higher, but the gains weren’t enough to offset the broad declines suffered in the S&P 500’s 10 other sectors.\nThe KBW Bank index of the biggest U.S. banks added 1.7%, with many of its constituents rising on a spike in the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note’s yield. Higher interest rates typically widen the spread between what banks charge on loans and what they pay on deposits, which should boost their earnings.\nThe yield for the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.917%, according to Tradeweb, from 2.867% a day earlier.\nTraders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

Earlier, Asia-Pacific stocks mostly rose, supported by gains in energy companies and Chinese markets.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.4%, while Australia’s S&P ASX 200 edged up 0.3%. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8% and Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average edged up 0.2% in its fifth straight session of advances.\n—Nathan Allen contributed to this article.\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com and Riva Gold at riva.gold@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T10:53:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
