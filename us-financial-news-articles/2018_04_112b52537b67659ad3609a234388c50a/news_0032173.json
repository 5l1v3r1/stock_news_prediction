(NYSE: AZZ), (the \"Company\"), a global provider of metal coating services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services, today announced that it has completed its restatement previously announced on March 29, 2018 and filed its amended previously issued audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of Fiscal Year 2018 . The amended filings are available on the company's investor relations website.\nAs previously reported, the restatements described above result from a correction to the accounting method historically used by the Company to record revenues for certain contracts within its Energy Segment. In particular, the Company determined that for certain contracts for which revenue was recognized upon contract completion and transfer of title, the Company instead should have applied the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with ASC 605-35. In general, the percentage-of-completion method results in a revenue recognition pattern over time as a project progresses as opposed to deferring revenues until contract completion. The Company determined that the impact of applying the percentage-of-completion method to certain of its revenue contracts was materially different from its previously reported results primarily for certain current asset balance sheet accounts under its historical practice.\nThe Company is working diligently and expeditiously towards completing and filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 and its Form 10-K for Fiscal Year 2018 and expects to announce their filing dates shortly. The Company also expects to issue Fiscal Year 2019 guidance once it completes its Fiscal Year 2018 filings.\nAbout AZZ Inc.\nAZZ Inc. is a global provider of metal coating services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the markets of power generation, transmission, distribution and industrial in protecting metal and electrical systems used to build and enhance the world's infrastructure.
