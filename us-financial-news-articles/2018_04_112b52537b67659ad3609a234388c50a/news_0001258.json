(“Bear State”) (NASDAQ: BSF), parent company of Bear State Bank, and Arvest Bank (“Arvest”) announced today they have received all required regulatory approvals for the previously-announced merger between the parties. Shareholders of Bear State previously approved the merger at a meeting held on November 15, 2017. Bear State and Arvest anticipate closing the merger on or about April 20, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nTo satisfy the conditions imposed by the Federal Reserve’s order of approval, Bear State has entered into an agreement with First Financial Bank of El Dorado, Arkansas to sell both of the Bear State Bank branches located in Mena, Arkansas. The two Mena branches had deposits totaling approximately $58 million and loans totaling approximately $30 million as of February 28, 2018. The closing of the sale of the Mena branches is expected to occur within 180 days following the closing of the merger with Arvest.\nFollowing the merger, customers of Bear State Bank and Arvest will not notice any immediate changes. At a later date, Bear State Bank’s branding will change to Arvest Bank, with the full conversion of systems expected to occur later in 2018. In addition, Bear State Bank and First Financial Bank will be providing additional information to customers in Mena affected by the divestiture of those branches.\nAbout Bear State Financial, Inc.\nBear State Financial, Inc. is the parent company for Bear State Bank.
