In December, almost 200 nations agreed to limit plastic pollution of the oceans, warning it could outweigh fish by 2030.\nIn contrast to plastic bags, the researchers found the amount of plastic fishing debris - including nets, floats, buoys - caught has risen. Measures introduced to curb this will take a while to have an impact, Maes said.\nSeveral European countries have introduced deposit return schemes for single use bottles in a bid to increase recycling.\nBritain said it plans to follow later this year as plastic is wreaking havoc on the marine environment – killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading precious habitats.\nPlastics which have been in the seas for a while may sink into the sea floor, or be torn up and gradually turned into microplastics. They can take hundreds of years to degrade.\nCleaning up the oceans is a very complex issue but the crucial thing is to stop more plastic waste entering the seas, and then think about cleaning it up, Maes said.\n“We can’t be mopping the floor while the tap is still open,” he said.\nReporting by Alex Whiting @Alexwhi, Editing by Katy Migiro.
