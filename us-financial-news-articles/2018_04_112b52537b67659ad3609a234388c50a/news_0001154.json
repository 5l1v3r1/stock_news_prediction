He brings a unique mixture of specialized skills, educational background and software-as-a-service and healthcare payments industry experience to his leadership of Payspan. His background includes Lean Six Sigma Black Belt certification and 30 years of experience taking on progressive responsibilities for Fortune 500 and private equity-backed companies, such as GE, ADP, Open Solutions and Alegeus Technologies.\n“As COO, it was rewarding to be a part of a team simplifying financial transactions in a healthcare landscape,” says Pinataro. “Now as CEO, I look forward to accelerating our pace of innovation to help customers increase revenue, improve member engagement, and reduce administrative costs through our focus on healthcare payments.”\nPinataro has served in C-level and upper management positions for software-as-a-service companies since 1998, as well as served in the fintech and healthcare industries since 2002. Throughout his career, he has been instrumental in crafting product strategy, driving sales growth, improving profitability, raising client reference-ability, and building employee engagement for companies with up to $480 in revenue across 40 countries.\nPinataro has a solid record of delivering revenue and EBITDA growth while leading both single and multiple business units with up to $120 million in revenue. Pinataro serves on the board of Atlanta’s Technology Executives Roundtable. He earned his MBA from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, a master’s degree in environmental engineering from the University of Portsmouth, and a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering from the United States Naval Academy.\nChapman comes to Payspan with 25 years of C-level and upper management experience.

His experience includes leading all aspects of operations, sales, marketing, business development, legal, human resources and IT for a number of pre-revenue start-ups to companies with $100+ million annual revenue.\nChapman also has prior experience with Primus Capital, the growth-oriented private equity firm that made a major growth investment in Payspan in December 2016. Prior to his role as CEO of VoApps, he served as CFO of Vendormate, Inc., a Primus-backed SaaS-based healthcare IT company, until it was acquired in November 2014 by GHX, LLC, at the time a Thoma Bravo-backed company.\nThroughout his career, Chapman has raised more than $500 million in buy-out, equity, debt and mezzanine financing for his companies. He recently finished a five-year term on the board of directors of IngeniousMed, Inc. – an Atlanta-based provider of practice management and charge capture software serving the healthcare industry – which was sold in October 2014 to North Bridge Growth Equity, a global private equity firm.\nChapman currently serves on the advisory board of BIP Capital’s Growth Fund III and is an active investor in several technology and tech-enabled service businesses.
