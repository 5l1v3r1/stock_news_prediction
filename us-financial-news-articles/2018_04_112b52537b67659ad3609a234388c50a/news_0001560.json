Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves,\" Sherman said on Twitter.\n\"I looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs. Peaked around for threats and then we headed downstairs and out the front,\" Sherman said.\nResponding to the report of gunfire, police officers entered the building and located at least four people with gunshots, San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini said at a news conference. One of them, a woman with a self-inflicted wound, was dead, he said, and she was believed to be the shooter.\nOne of the victims, a 36-year-old man, was listed in critical condition at San Francisco General Hospital. A 32-year-old woman was listed in serious condition and a 27-year-old woman in fair condition. Authorities did not release names of the victims.\nGoogle said on Twitter that it was coordinating with local authorities. YouTube Chief Executive Susan Wojcicki declined to comment to reporters as she left the building.\nPresident Donald Trump said on Twitter that he had been briefed on the shooting.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved, Trump tweeted. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.\nDozens of emergency vehicles quickly converged on the YouTube campus, and police could be seen on televised aerial video systematically frisking several employees leaving the area with their hands raised.\nLast month, YouTube announced it would ban content promoting the sale of guns and gun accessories as well as videos that teach how to make guns.\nFemale mass shooters are rare. A recent Washington Post analysis shows only three out of 150 U.S. shootings with more than four victims since 1966 were done by women. In 2015, a husband and wife killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California.
