The progress has to be gradual as everyone acknowledges it cannot be done from one moment to the other,” he added.\nReuters reported on Monday that after suffering a political backlash, the ECB is considering shelving planned rules that would have forced banks to set aside more money against their stock of unpaid loans.\nConstancio did not comment on the story, but he said that enough improvement had been seen in this area that NPLs alone would not lead to any banks collapsing.\n“The banks are much better-capitalised than before and that’s very important because it means in the short term that the question of NPLs is not a question of solvency,” he said.\nThe planned rules, which had been expected by March, were seen as a main plank of the ECB’s plan to bring down a 759 billion euro ($930 billion) pile of soured credit weighing on euro zone banks, particularly in Greece, Portugal and Italy.
