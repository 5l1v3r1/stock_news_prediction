REUTERS/Pilar Olivares Greenpeace said that a coral reef near the mouth of the Amazon extends further than previously thought and its findings would be published soon by the scientific journal Frontiers in Marine Science.\nThe research could further complicate plans by oil companies to explore an area that some geologists say could hold up to 14 billion barrels of petroleum, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico.\n“Now that we know that the Amazon coral overlaps the perimeter of Total’s two blocks, the Brazilian government has no choice but to deny the licence for the company to explore for oil in the region,” Greenpeace said in a statement.\nTotal led a group including Britain’s BP Plc ( BP.L ) and Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) in buying five exploration blocks in the Foz do Amazonas basin in 2013, but the discovery of a massive coral reef just 28 kilometres (17 miles) from the blocks has thrown environmental approval for drilling into doubt. As the operator, Total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses.\nRepresentatives for Total did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Greenpeace statement.\nBrazil’s environmental regulator Ibama has repeatedly refused to accept Total’s environmental impact study. Last August Ibama warned that it needed more information or it would suspend the French oil firm’s licence application.\nEnvironmentalists said potential oil leaks in the Foz do Amazonas basin, named for its location near the mouth of the Amazon river, could wreak havoc in the rainforest in Brazil’s far northern Amapá state in addition to harming the reef.\nReporting by Marta Nogueira; editing by Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T03:17:06.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
