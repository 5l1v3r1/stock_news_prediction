British media said the deal could be worth up to 1 billion pounds ($1.40 billion).\nUnder the plan, the FA would keep Wembley as the main venue for major matches, including England internationals and the FA Cup Final, but the national soccer team could play elsewhere in October and November due to clashes with the U.S. National Football League season.\nBritish media reported that Khan, who is worth $7.2 billion according to Forbes, is ready to pay more than 500 million pounds.\nHe would also allow the FA to keep the Club Wembley debenture and hospitality business that is valued at a further 300 million pounds.\nThe money would allow the governing body to reinvest in the English game’s grassroots, particularly pitches.
