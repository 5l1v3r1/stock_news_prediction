(Photo: Business Wire)\nFreestone was most recently vice president and senior actuary, Benefits Division. In his new role, he assumes responsibility for all aspects of Symetra’s stop-loss business, including sales, underwriting and claims. He also will continue to lead the stop-loss actuarial function. Based in Symetra’s Bellevue, Washington headquarters, Freestone will report to Michael Fry, executive vice president, Benefits Division.\n“Symetra’s medical stop-loss unit is a cornerstone of our Benefits Division business line and a critical component of the solutions-driven product suite we offer employers looking to effectively manage their healthcare costs,” said Michael Fry. “As we continue to invest in our stop-loss operations, we are fortunate to have a leader with Jeremy’s proven abilities ready to step up and drive the business forward with clarity, creativity and a customer-centric focus.”\nFreestone joined Symetra in 2005 as an actuarial assistant. He is a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries, a member of the American Academy of Actuaries, and earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington.\nMedical stop-loss insurance protects companies that self-fund their health insurance plans against large or catastrophic claims. Employers with stop-loss insurance are reimbursed for individual employees’ medical costs above a certain pre-determined dollar amount. Stop-loss insurance also protects against unexpectedly large amounts of total medical claims. In such a case, the coverage kicks in once a certain amount has been paid by a client toward all of its employee medical bills.\nAbout Symetra\nSymetra Life Insurance Company is a subsidiary of Symetra Financial Corporation, a diversified financial services company based in Bellevue, Washington. In business since 1957, Symetra provides employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through a national network of benefit consultants, financial institutions, and independent agents and advisors.
