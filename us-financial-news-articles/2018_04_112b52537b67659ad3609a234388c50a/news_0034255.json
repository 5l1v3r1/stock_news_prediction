Bumble used the Facebook login as a way to speed up the registration process and verify identities. Bumble also used the information it gleaned from users’ Facebook profiles to offer common friends and help find potential partners.\nBut the recent data-sharing scandal has raised concerns about the safety of private information on Facebook, prompting Bumble to change course.\nThe dating app isn’t getting rid of Facebook altogether though. Users can still use Facebook to log in if they want to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T03:34:52.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
