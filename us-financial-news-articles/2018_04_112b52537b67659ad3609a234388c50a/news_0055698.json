These plans have not changed, he added.\nOn Oct 30, 2015, Airbus said in a press release it planned to “further increase the production rate” to 60 aircraft a month in mid-2019.\nOn production of other models, Airbus said on Friday it was reducing the number of A330 deliveries to 50 per year in 2019.\nAsked to provide a comparison, Wilhelm told reporters that Airbus was targeting 60 deliveries of the long-haul jet family in 2018.\n(This version of the story corrects number of A330 deliveries in 2018 to 60, in last paragraph)\nReporting by Tim Hepher; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:35:29.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
