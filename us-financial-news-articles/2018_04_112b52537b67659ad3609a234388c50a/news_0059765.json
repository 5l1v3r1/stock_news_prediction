Kim’s father and grandfather who led North Korea before him had never taken their wives to official meetings with other heads of state.\nKim Jong Il, Jong Un’s father, was never seen in public with any of his wives.\nLittle is known about Ri, including her exact age, when she married Kim or whether they had a wedding ceremony.\nHowever, her style and attire have often been the focus of media attention, with state-distributed photograph showing designer handbags by Dior and Chanel hanging off her shoulder.\nRi posed for photographs with her husband, Moon and Moon’s wife ahead of the dinner, holding a black clutch and wearing pink lipstick and eyeshadow before attending a dinner hosted by Moon.\nIn contrast, her sister-in-law Kim Yo Jong, who accompanied Kim Jong Un to the summit from the start on Friday, wore a grey two-piece skirt suit and modest low, black heels.\nFIRST LADY Ri’s first official appearance as Kim’s wife in North Korean state media was in July 2012 at an opening ceremony for an amusement park, seen holding onto Kim’s arm affectionately as they toured the grounds.\nImage consultants say she has helped create a softer, more approachable image for Kim that has aided him as he seeks to burnish his credentials as a world leader.\nDuring his surprise visit to China last month, Chinese state television gave similar coverage to Kim’s visit with President Xi Jinping as they did to Xi’s meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump last year.\nRi was there with her husband and met Xi and Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan, winning praise from social media users in China who called her “beautiful” and compared her to pop stars.\n“Kim Jong Un wants to be seen as a respected state leader inside his country and out,” said Jeong Yeung-tae, head of the Institute of North Korea Studies in Seoul.\n“By bringing his wife along, he’s saying ‘Look at me, I’m as much of a country leader as you are.’”\nRi’s status within North Korea has also risen in recent weeks, after state media began referring to her as First Lady during Ri and her husband’s visit to China.\nThat was the first time the title was used in North Korea in more than 40 years.\nPrior to this, Ri had been called “comrade” or simply, “wife of Kim Jong Un”.\nAccording to South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, the last time North Korean state media referred to someone as First Lady was in 1974 for Kim Song Ae, the wife of Kim Il Sung, the grandfather of Kim Jong Un.\nState media has also called her “respected Ri Sol Ju”, an adjective rarely used for members other than the North’s leadership. Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, is referred to by her party position.\nAnalysts said that doesn’t mean Ri is of a higher rank than Kim Yo Jong.\n“In North Korea, the wife of the leader does not have many roles...If the wife tries to do something political then she would have a hard time,” Jeong, the analyst, said.\n“The sister has a powerful role as her brother’s helper. At the end of the day, Ri is just Kim Jong Un’s wife,” he added.\nFriday’s summit and another between North Korea and the United States scheduled for late May or June are expected to lend more information about the couple.\nSouth Korean intelligence officials have briefed parliament officials that Ri and Kim have three children.\nFormer National Basketball Association star Dennis Rodman, who has frequently visited North Korea, said he met their second child in 2013.
