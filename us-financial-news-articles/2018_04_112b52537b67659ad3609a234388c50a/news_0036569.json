But for lots of people living in those countries it is not the case,” Daley, who married U.S. director Dustin Lance Black last year, told BBC Breakfast.\nA Commonwealth Secretariat spokesman said there were more LGBT events this year than at the last CHOGM in 2015 including a roundtable on LGBT rights and reception to brief lawmakers on economic developments favoring decriminalization.\nHe added that the Commonwealth Secretariat worked closely with parliaments to encourage them “to become parliamentary human rights champions for equality”.\nBut activists angered by the Commonwealth’s failure to put LGBT decriminalization on the agenda said they planning to picket the Commonwealth Secretariat’s offices on Thursday.\nQasim Iqbal, an activist with Pakistani LGBT organization Naz Male Health Alliance, said Britain should apologize for homophobic laws left in its wake, with same sex sexual activity still punishable in Pakistan by up to 10 years in jail.\n“The UK has a responsibility to undo the damage that they caused. They need to not only apologize but also pressure countries to decriminalize by putting conditions on any aide they give,” Iqbal told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nBut Frank Mugisha, an LGBT activist in Uganda where same-sex sexual activity can be punished with life imprisonment, said it was important Britain was not seen as “giving a lecture” as that could further alienate LGBT communities.\nSeychelles activist Fabianna Bonne echoed similar concerns, urging Britain to support activists and advocates with “quiet diplomacy” to help push discussions forward.\nReporting by Meka Beresford, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith @BeeGoldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
