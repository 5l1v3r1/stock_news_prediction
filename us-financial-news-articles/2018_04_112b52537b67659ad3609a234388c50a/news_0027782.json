And I will put on my most miserly face,” he said. \nRegarding reforms proposed by Macron, he said Germany wanted to expand the European Stability Mechanism into a monetary union while also ensuring continued parliamentary control. \nHe said there were “hard nuts to crack” with regard to a proposed banking union, including the high level of non-performing loans in some countries. \n“An unfair situation should not arise in which some members provide the necessary funds to secure deposits, while others do not meet the needed requirements,” he said. \nAsked about Macron’s proposal for a European budget and a European finance minister, Scholz said: “These ideas are bringing new momentum into the European project that we need. But the French president also knows that not all of his ideas can be realised.” (Reporting by Andrea Shalal Editing by Helen Popper)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T22:20:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
