Tucker’s second home run of the series came after an error by Washington second baseman Wilmer Difo that extended the inning.\nScherzer (1-1) gave up five runs (two earned) in five innings. He allowed six hits, struck out seven and walked two.\nAfter giving up the early home run to Tucker, Scherzer gave up a leadoff walk in the fourth to Tucker, followed by a single by Charlie Culberson. Scherzer struck out the next two batters and looked poised to get out of the jam after getting two strikes on Foltynewicz. But the Braves’ starter hit a slider into the gap in left-center field, scoring two and giving Atlanta a 5-1 cushion.\nThe Braves tacked on two more in the eighth inning, behind hot-starting Ryan Flaherty. Flaherty doubled home Lane Adams and then hustled from second base to score on a wild pitch from Trevor Gott.\nThe Nationals’ only run came on an RBI single from Scherzer in the second inning.\nBryce Harper went hitless for Washington, ending a 16-game hitting streak against the Braves, and struck out for the first time this season. Harper popped out with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth inning.\nThe Nationals return to Washington for their home opener against the New York Mets on Thursday.\nAtlanta now heads out of town for three straight road series, beginning in Colorado on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:09:31.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
