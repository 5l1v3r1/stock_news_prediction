Mexico's government has said such caravans of mostly Central Americans, including many escaping violence in Honduras, have occurred since 2010.\nTrump has already blasted Mexico and threatened to upend the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) over the caravan, and on Tuesday also raised the prospect of withholding U.S. assistance. The current trip has also put pressure on Mexican authorities ahead of the July 1 presidential election there.\n\"The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!\" Trump wrote in an early morning post on Twitter.\nOn Monday, the Republican president railed against Democrats over immigration and again pressed U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation to build his long-promised border wall between the United States and Mexico.\nDespite months of efforts, no immigration deal has emerged in the Republican-led Congress, where lawmakers are not expected to pass much major legislation ahead of November's midterm congressional elections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:05:57.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
