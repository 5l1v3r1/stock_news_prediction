They mayor has also expressed support for opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was barred from running in last month’s Russian presidential election which Putin won. \nOn Tuesday, lawmakers in Yekaterinburg - a manufacturing center of almost 1.5 million people - voted by 42-4 to abolish direct elections. In future, the city’s mayor will be chosen by local lawmakers from a shortlist drawn up by a special commission. \nThe idea of scrapping direct elections was proposed by Sverdlovsk region governor Yevgeny Kuivashev. His allies had argued that doing away with elections would save money and streamline decision-making. \nJust under 2,000 people held a rally on Monday, demanding that direct elections be kept and that the governor resign. \nRoizman, whose five-year term ends in September, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the elections were the only chance for Yekaterinburg residents to take part in its political life and that stripping them of the right to elect a mayor was an insult to their intellectual capabilities. \nOpposition leader Navalny said the outcome of the vote ran counter to what people wanted. \n“Forty-two deputies have demonstratively spat not only on the thousands of people who turned up at the rally, but also on the majority who have told every opinion poll that the mayor must be chosen via direct voting,” Navalny wrote on social media. \nLess than 10 Russian cities still have direct mayoral elections with the rest using an appointment system. \nThe Kremlin declined to comment on Yekaterinburg’s decision, saying it was purely a matter for local lawmakers.
