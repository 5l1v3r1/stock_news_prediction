Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’,” he wrote in the post. “You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!”\nIn response, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said in a Facebook post that “smart missiles should fly toward terrorists, not toward the lawful government”.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 129.86 points, or 0.53 percent, to 24,278.14, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 5.99 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,650.88 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 8.66 points, or 0.12 percent, to 7,102.96.\nFacebook and Netflix helped to pare losses in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\nFacebook Inc ( FB.O ) shares were up 1.5 percent as Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg gave a second day of testimony before the U.S. Congress.
