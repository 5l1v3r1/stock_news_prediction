He later said he believed he was innocent.\nHis lawyer, Withoon Yamprai, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\n“I have not received all of the information,” Withoon said.\nThe case has attracted extensive media coverage and suspicion among environmental activists that Premchai would not be properly investigated because of his status and wealth.\nDemocracy activists have posted images of a black leopard on social media, and it has even been daubed on walls, to draw attention to what they see as unfair privilege in society.\nThailand has a poor record in protecting its forests and wildlife from illegal exploitation, environmentalists say.\nProsecutors said their indictment request had been forwarded to police and it would proceed to a provincial court if there were no objections.\nThe attorney-general will make a final decision on the case if police object.\nReporting by Patpicha Tanakasempipat and Panarat Thepgumpanat Additional reporting by Chayut Setboonsarng; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T15:51:53.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
