The data have become a bedrock of thousands of mobile apps, with Mapbox customers including social media company Snap Inc, food delivery service DoorDash and credit card giant MasterCard Inc. \nMapbox has less live traffic information and fewer details on “social” places such as bars than Google, Gundersen said. \nBut Mapbox’s system, an amalgamation of 130 data sources, is appealing to some developers because it allows greater customization, Chen said. Google’s emphasis remains on its consumer Maps app, he said, while Mapbox exclusively focuses on developer tools. \nGoogle did not respond to a request for comment. \nChen said he spent more than five years at Google overseeing development of Google Maps features including estimated wait times at restaurants and a question-and-answer system for users to learn more about businesses. \nSoftBank Vision Fund led a $164 million financing of Mapbox in October.
