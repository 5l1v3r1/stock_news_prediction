Our loan growth for the quarter of 5.95% was down compared to growth in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to the improved economy, pay off of existing loans and increased cash holdings of borrowers. The increased customer deposits along with deposit rate increases has grown interest-bearing deposits in all markets. Non-interest income, led by our Mortgage Division continues to improve. Anticipated loan growth for the second quarter, improved non-interest income and expense control should fuel our earnings during 2018,\" K.
