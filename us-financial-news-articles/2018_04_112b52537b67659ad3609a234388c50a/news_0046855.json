These results reflect the lower federal income tax rate, favorable weather of 9 cents and a loss of (4) cents from the implementation of ASU No. 2016-01, which now requires the mark-to-market of equity investments in the nuclear decommissioning trust funds at EWC.\n\"We've had a solid start to 2018 with success on key projects and regulatory initiatives,\" said Entergy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leo Denault. \"Our results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance and long-term outlooks.\"\nBusiness highlights included the following:\nEntergy New Orleans received approval for the New Orleans Power Station. The LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana's unopposed settlement for its formula rate plan. Entergy Mississippi made its annual formula rate plan filing. Entergy and parties filed a settlement memorandum of understanding with the Vermont PUC for the sale of Vermont Yankee. Indian Point 2 completed its final refueling and maintenance outage before retirement. Entergy was named for a third consecutive year by the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to the list of America's Top Corporations for Women's Business Enterprise, honoring corporations that have implemented world-class policies and programs to enable growth and reduce barriers for women-owned businesses.\nConsolidated Earnings (GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures)\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. 2017 (See Appendix A for reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and description of special items)\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n2017\nChange\n(After-tax, $ in millions)\nAs-reported earnings\n133\n83\n50\nLess special items\n(78)\n(95)\n17\nOperational earnings (non-GAAP)\n211\n178\n33\nEstimated weather in billed sales\n16\n(29)\n46\n(After-tax, per share in $)\nAs-reported earnings\n0.73\n0.46\n0.27\nLess special items\n(0.43)\n(0.53)\n0.10\nOperational earnings (non-GAAP)\n1.16\n0.99\n0.17\nEstimated weather in billed sales\n0.09\n(0.16)\n0.25\nCalculations may differ due to rounding\nConsolidated Results\nFor first quarter 2018, the company reported earnings of $133 million, or 73 cents per share, on an as-reported basis and earnings of $211 million, or $1.16 per share, on an operational basis. This compared to first quarter 2017 earnings of $83 million, or 46 cents per share, on an as-reported basis and earnings of $178 million, or 99 cents per share on an operational basis.\nSummary discussions by business are below. Additional details, including information on OCF by business, are provided in Appendix A and a comprehensive analysis of quarterly variances by business is provided in Appendix B.\nUtility, Parent & Other Results\nFor first quarter 2018, the Utility business reported earnings attributable to Entergy Corporation of $215 million, or $1.19 per share, compared to $165 million, or 92 cents per share, in first quarter 2017. Key drivers for the quarterly increase included higher net revenue and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nNet revenue increased quarter-over-quarter driven by favorable weather in first quarter 2018 compared to unfavorable weather a year ago. Weather-adjusted sales growth was positive, but was more than offset by lower volume in the unbilled period. Rate actions to recover investments that benefit customers were also more than offset by regulatory provisions recorded to return benefits from tax reform to customers at Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans.\nOn a weather-adjusted basis, billed sales increased 3.0 percent, including 4.1 percent and 2.4 percent for residential and commercial billed sales, respectively. Industrial billed sales volume increased 2.6 percent with higher sales to both new and expansion customers as well as existing customers. The increase was driven largely by the primary metals segment. Sales to petroleum refining customers were also higher.\nIncome tax expense was lower due primarily to the reduction of the federal income tax rate. Utility non-fuel O&M increased quarter-over-quarter, driven by higher spending on nuclear operations, primarily labor, and taxes other than income taxes.\nFor first quarter 2018, Parent & Other reported a loss of $(64 million), or (36) cents per share, compared to a loss of $(54 million), or (30) cents per share, in first quarter 2017.\nOn a combined basis, Utility, Parent & Other (non-GAAP) contributed 83 cents to first quarter 2018 consolidated EPS compared to 62 cents to first quarter 2017 consolidated EPS. On an adjusted basis, excluding special items and normalizing weather and income taxes, Utility, Parent & Other contributed 71 cents in first quarter 2018 to consolidated EPS, compared to 83 cents in first quarter 2017.\nAppendix C contains additional details on Utility financial and operating measures, including a reconciliation for non-GAAP Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings and EPS.\nEntergy Wholesale Commodities Results\nFor first quarter 2018, EWC recorded a loss attributable to Entergy Corporation of $(18 million), or (10) cents per share, on an as-reported basis and earned $60 million, or 33 cents per share, on an operational basis. This compared to a first quarter 2017 loss of $(28 million), or (16) cents per share, on an as-reported basis and earnings of $67 million, or 37 cents per share, on an operational basis.\nAs-reported losses in both periods reflected impairments and other expenses recorded as a result of strategic decisions for the wholesale business. These items were considered special items and excluded from operational earnings.\nThe sale of FitzPatrick at the end of first quarter 2017 affected period-over-period variances for multiple line items. Excluding FitzPatrick, quarterly earnings reflected lower other income, primarily due to losses on decommissioning trust funds previously classified as other comprehensive income on the balance sheet, now recorded to the income statement. The decrease was partially offset by lower income tax expense which resulted primarily from the reduction of the federal income tax rate.\nAppendix D contains additional details on EWC financial and operating measures, including reconciliation for non-GAAP EWC operational adjusted EBITDA.\nEarnings Guidance\nEntergy affirmed its 2018 consolidated operational earnings guidance range of $6.25 to $6.85 per share and its Utility, Parent & Other adjusted guidance range of $4.50 to $4.90 per share. See webcast presentation slides for additional details, including Progress Against Guidance on slide 35.\nThe company has provided 2018 earnings guidance with regard to the non-GAAP measures of consolidated operational EPS and Utility, Parent & Other adjusted EPS. These measures exclude from the corresponding GAAP financial measures the effect of special items as described below under \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" The company has not provided a reconciliation of such non-GAAP guidance to guidance presented on a GAAP basis because it cannot predict and quantify with a reasonable degree of confidence all of the special items that may occur during 2018. The only anticipated special items that the company can reasonably estimate at this time are those that relate to the decisions to sell or close the company's merchant nuclear plants; these estimated costs, which are excluded from the earnings guidance, are expected to decrease as-reported EPS by approximately $(2.55) per share in 2018.\nEarnings Teleconference\nA teleconference will be held at 10:00 a.m. Central Time on Wednesday, April 25, 2018, to discuss Entergy's quarterly earnings announcement and the company's financial performance. The teleconference may be accessed by visiting Entergy's website at www.entergy.com or by dialing 844-309-6569, conference ID 9178845, no more than 15 minutes prior to the start of the call. The webcast slide presentation is also posted to Entergy's website concurrent with this release, which was issued before market open on the day of the call. A replay of the teleconference will be available on Entergy's website at www.entergy.com and by telephone. The telephone replay will be available through May 2, 2018, by dialing 855-859-2056, conference ID 9178845. This release and the webcast slide presentation are also available on the Entergy Investor Relations mobile web app at iretr.com .\nEntergy Corporation is an integrated energy company engaged primarily in electric power production and retail distribution operations. Entergy owns and operates power plants with approximately 30,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity, including nearly 9,000 megawatts of nuclear power. Entergy delivers electricity to 2.9 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Entergy has annual revenues of approximately $11 billion and more than 13,000 employees.\nEntergy Corporation's common stock is listed on the New York and Chicago stock exchanges under the symbol \"ETR.\"\nDetails regarding Entergy's results of operations, regulatory proceedings and other matters are available in this earnings release, a copy of which will be filed with the SEC, and the webcast slide presentation. Both documents are available on Entergy's Investor Relations website at www.entergy.com/investor_relations and on Entergy's Investor Relations mobile web app at iretr.com .\nEntergy maintains a web page as part of its Investor Relations website, entitled \"Regulatory and Other Information,\" which provides investors with key updates of regulatory proceedings and important milestones on the execution of its strategy. While some of this information may be considered material information, investors should not rely exclusively on this page for all relevant company information.\nFor definitions of certain operating measures, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and abbreviations and acronyms used in the earnings release materials, see Appendix F.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release contains non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Entergy has provided quantitative reconciliations within this release of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nCertain non-GAAP financial measures in this news release could differ from GAAP only in that the figure or ratio states or includes operational earnings. Operational earnings are not calculated in accordance with GAAP because they exclude the effect of \"special items.\" Special items are unusual or non-recurring items or events or other items or events that management believes do not reflect the ongoing business of Entergy, and may include items such as impairments, gains or losses on asset sales, and other gains or losses occurring as a result of strategic decisions such as Entergy's decisions to shut down or sell its merchant nuclear plants. In addition, other financial measures including net income (or earnings), adjusted for preferred dividends and tax effected interest expense; net revenue; return on average invested capital; and return on average common equity are included on both an operational and as-reported basis. In each case, the metrics defined as \"operational\" would exclude the effect of special items as defined above.\nEntergy reports the combination of the Utility segment with Parent & Other as Utility, Parent & Other, which is all of Entergy excluding the EWC segment, since management uses this combination in making decisions about its ongoing business in light of its decision to exit the merchant power business. Entergy also reports Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings, which combines the Utility segment with Parent & Other, excludes applicable special items and normalizes weather and income tax expense for the periods presented, because it believes that these financial metrics provide useful information to investors in evaluating the ongoing results of Entergy's businesses and assist investors in comparing Entergy's financial performance to the financial performance of other companies in the Utility sector. The methodologies employed to determine the normalized weather and income tax expense adjustments, each of which is further described in this release, involve estimations and the judgement of management.\nIn addition to reporting earnings per share on a consolidated basis, Entergy reports on a per share basis the earnings or loss of each of its segments, together with the combination of the Utility segment and Parent & Other. These per share measures represent the net income or loss of such segment or segments divided by the diluted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Entergy believes such per share measures provide useful information to investors in understanding the results of operations of those businesses and their contribution to Entergy's consolidated results of operations.\nOther non-GAAP measures, including adjusted EBITDA; operational adjusted EBITDA; gross liquidity; debt to capital ratio, excluding securitization debt; net debt to net capital ratio, excluding securitization debt; parent debt to total debt ratio, excluding securitization debt; debt to operational adjusted EBITDA ratio, excluding securitization debt; and operational FFO to debt ratio, excluding securitization debt are measures Entergy uses internally for management and board discussions and cash budgeting and performance monitoring activities to gauge the overall strength of its business. Entergy believes the above data provides useful information to investors in evaluating Entergy's ongoing financial results and flexibility and assists investors in comparing Entergy's credit and liquidity to the credit and liquidity of others in the Utility sector.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures and other reported adjusted items in this release are presented in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be used to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Entergy's operations that, when viewed with Entergy's GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Entergy's business. Investors are strongly encouraged to review Entergy's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it might not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nIn this news release, and from time to time, Entergy Corporation makes certain \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

While weather-adjusted billed sales volume increased across all classes, the net revenue effect was more than offset by lower volume in the unbilled period. Rate changes including E-AR's 2018 FRP and E-TX's TCRF and DCRF also contributed to the increase, but regulatory provisions at E-LA and E-NO to reflect regulatory agreements to return the benefits of the lower effective tax rate in first quarter 2018 to customers more than offset the rate changes.\n(f)\nThe earnings decrease from lower EWC net revenue reflected lower volume from merchant nuclear plants, including FitzPatrick (sold first quarter 2017), largely offset by higher nuclear energy prices. The as-reported variance also reflected cost reimbursements from the buyer related to the FitzPatrick sale (classified as a special item and offset in non-fuel O&M).\n(g)\nThe earnings decrease from higher Utility non-fuel O&M was primarily due to higher spending on nuclear operations, higher energy efficiency and storm reserve costs (largely offset in net revenue), as well as higher spending on fossil work. This was partly offset by higher nuclear insurance refunds in first quarter 2018.\n(h)\nThe as-reported earnings increase from lower EWC non-fuel O&M is primarily due to costs incurred in first quarter 2017 related to the agreement to sell FitzPatrick (classified as a special item and offset in net revenue).\n(i)\nThe as-reported earnings increase from lower EWC asset write-offs and impairments was due to lower impairment charges for EWC nuclear plants, partly due to Palisades no longer being impaired as a result of the decision to operate that plant until May 2022, as well as lower refueling outage costs charged to impairment (classified as a special item).\n(j)\nThe earnings increase from lower EWC decommissioning expense was primarily due to the sale of FitzPatrick in first quarter 2017.\n(k)\nThe earnings decrease from higher Utility taxes other than income taxes was due to higher franchise, ad valorem and payroll taxes.\n(l)\nThe as-reported earnings decrease from lower EWC gain on sale of assets was due to the gain on the sale of FitzPatrick in first quarter 2017 (classified as a special item).\nUtility Net Revenue\nVariance Analysis\n2018 vs. 2017 (Pre-tax, $ in millions)\n1Q\nEstimated weather\n69\nVolume/unbilled\n(9)\nRetail electric price\nReg. provisions for tax reform\n18\n(29)\nOther\n6\nTotal\n55\n(m)\nThe earnings decrease from lower EWC other income (deductions)–other was due largely to losses on the decommissioning trust fund investments in first quarter 2018, including unrealized losses on equity investments that were previously recorded to other comprehensive income for periods prior to 2018. In first quarter 2017, only realized gains along with interest and dividends from the decommissioning trust fund investments, were recorded to the income statement. The as-reported earnings decrease also reflected the absence of gains on the receipt of the Indian Point 3 and FitzPatrick decommissioning trust funds from NYPA in first quarter 2017 (classified as a special item).\n(n)\nThe earnings increase from lower Utility income taxes is primarily due to the change in the federal income tax rate.\n(o)\nThe as-reported earnings decrease from higher EWC income taxes is primarily due to the tax benefit in first quarter 2017, which resulted from the sale of FitzPatrick (classified as a special item). The change in the federal income tax rate, as well as a change in pre-tax income was reflected in the as-reported and operational variances.\nC: Utility Financial and Operating Measures\nAppendix C-1 provides a comparative summary of Utility, Parent & Other adjusted earnings and EPS contribution, each of which excludes the effects of special items and normalizes weather and income tax expense.\nAppendix C-1: Utility, Parent & Other Adjusted Earnings and EPS - Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\nFirst Quarter 2018 vs. 2017\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n2017\nChange\n($ in millions)\nUtility as-reported earnings\n215\n165\n50\nParent & Other as-reported earnings (loss)\n(64)\n(54)\n(10)\nUP&O as-reported earnings\n151\n110\n41\nLess:\nSpecial items\n-\n-\n-\nEstimated weather (p)\n22\n(48)\n69\nTax effect of estimated weather (q)\n(6)\n18\n(24)\nEstimated weather impact (after-tax)\n16\n(29)\n46\nOther income tax items (r)\n6\n(9)\n15\nUP&O adjusted earnings\n129\n149\n(20)\n(After tax, per share in $)(s)\nUtility as-reported earnings\n1.19\n0.92\n0.27\nParent & Other as-reported earnings (loss)\n(0.36)\n(0.30)\n(0.06)\nUP&O as-reported earnings\n0.83\n0.62\n0.21\nLess:\nSpecial items\n-\n-\n-\nEstimated weather\n0.09\n(0.16)\n0.25\nOther income tax items\n0.03\n(0.05)\n0.08\nUP&O adjusted earnings\n0.71\n0.83\n(0.12)\nCalculations may differ due to rounding\n(p)\nThe effects of weather were estimated using heating degree days and cooling degree days for the billing cycles from certain locations within each jurisdiction and comparing to \"normal\" weather based on 20-year historical data.
