In the second half we rectified that. That’s the difference basically of the attitude of the team - that explains nil-nil at halftime and three-nil at full time,” Wenger told reporters. \n“In the second half our pace was much better.” \nThe home side also made numerous changes to the lineup from their previous fixture, most likely with their Thursday night Europa League quarter-final first leg at home to CSKA Moscow in mind.

It was a game changer,” he said. \nThe loss leaves his Stoke side 19th in the league with 27 points, while Arsenal stay sixth with 51 points, 10 points off the Champions League qualification places.
