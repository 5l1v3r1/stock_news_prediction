(“Momentous”) (OTCBB: MMEGD), is pleased to announce it has executed a Letter of Intent to acquire Ignis Studios LLC for $21.5 million in a deal that consists of a combination of cash, performance payments and stock.\nIgnis Studios, LLC has quietly assembled a group of some of the best game development professionals in the world over the past several years. The Ignis team has created games for some of the most notable game companies in the world including Sony, LucasFilm, Tencent, Riot Games, Blizzard Entertainment and many others. The business plan calls for the creation of 10 new games annually, introduced to the marketplace with expectations that at least three will pick up traction and become financially lucrative.\nTo check out the initial Ignis portfolio of games, visit the Ignis website at http://ignisstudios.com .\nONLY 3 GAMES NEED TO REACH LOW ADOPTION TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT PROFITABILITY.\nViral adoption results normally generate over $2M a day in revenue. Games like \"Candy Crush Saga\" are in this category. Moderate adoption results normally generate $50k-$300k a day in revenue. Games like \"Cookie Jam\" are in this category. Low adoption results normally generate $15k-20k a day in revenue. Games like \"Bubble Cloud\" are in this category.\nIgnis gaming projections for 2018 are estimated to upwards of 8 plus million in gross revenue. Ignis’ projections are attainable with only 3 out of 10 games reaching low adoption on a yearly basis. If any of the Ignis games reach medium to viral adoption, the revenues grow exponentially.\nMomentous CEO Kurt Neubauer stated, “Added to our Chimera Games business, Ignis Studios presents a major opportunity for Momentous to continue to gather market share and expand further into the game industry.” Mr. Neubauer also stated, ”The Ignis business plan focuses on generating 10 new mobile games a year and continually developing new games. Only a small fraction of the games developed need to reach low adoption in order to realize revenues.”\nGAMES ARE RAPIDLY BECOMING THE WORLD’S FAVORITE PASTIME.\nConsumers are spending more time than ever on games. The reason for this is that games now cater to a much wider variety of interests. This includes lean-forward (gaming intensely or casually), lean-back (viewing game run through video content created by peers or provided by the professional gaming scene), creating unique content and sharing (on-demand and live streaming). Viewing professional or amateur game video content is bringing back millions of past gamers who no longer have the time to play but whose passion is reignited by watching other players and worldwide championships. The term “gamers” is becoming increasingly obsolete, as it fails to capture the variety of ways that games entertain consumers. “Game enthusiasts” would be a more encapsulating term.\nGAME COMPANIES ARE BECOMING GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES.\nAs game content and IP turns increasingly into entertainment franchises, game companies are rethinking their strategic position in the broader entertainment industry. Game companies are the champions of interactive entertainment and are outstanding at stimulating social, creative, and sharing behavior. They also rely almost entirely on direct consumer spending, as opposed to the advertising-based model of many digital or broadcast media companies. At the same time, the number of hours spent watching non-interactive (video) content around game franchises has exploded and is no longer seen as free marketing but as a serious new business opportunity. As traditional media struggle to offer an interactive component around their content, game companies are quickly learning how to monetize video content and its millions of viewers. The biggest game companies already entertain a far greater audience than most of the world’s largest traditional media and entertainment companies.\nSMARTPHONES ARE SET FOR A NEW WAVE OF INNOVATION.\nThe market is set for a new wave of innovation in smartphones that will offer new possibilities for developers of games and apps alike. Crucial developments on the horizon include flexible screens, better battery technology, and the integration of AR and VR into smartphones.\nMobile gaming (smartphone and tablet) was the largest segment in 2017, accounting for 42% of the total global market. The segment also has the most gamers with 2.1 billion, the majority of whom are gaming on smartphones. Console is the second-largest segment with revenues of $33.5 billion in 2017. PC browser game revenues will decrease by 9.3% to $4.5 billion as gamers continue their transition to mobile.\nMobile will remain the largest segment in gaming, growing with a CAGR (2016-2020) of 13.9% to claim 50% of the market by 2020.\n(Market data and statistics in this release are published by NEWZOO).\nAbout Momentous Entertainment Group (MMEG)\nMomentous Entertainment Group, Inc.
