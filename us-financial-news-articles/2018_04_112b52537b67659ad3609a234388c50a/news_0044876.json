The workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids.\nChevron's move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through Venezuela's accelerating political and economic meltdown.\nThe affected staff numbers about 30 people in the coastal city of Puerto la Cruz, although it is unclear how many people Chevron has already removed from the country.\nAsked about the departures, Chevron spokesperson Isabel Ordonez told CNBC, \"Chevron has an executive team in place in Venezuela. Our operations continue.\"\nLast week, the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, who are represented by Chevron lawyers.\nNeither PDVSA nor the government's Information Ministry responded to requests for comment. The public prosecutor's office, which has not publicly announced any charges against the Chevron employees, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nChevron has no plans to exit the country, according to a company employee familiar with the thinking of its board of directors. The oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past, the person said — citing the jailing of employees in Indonesia in 2013 — and the firm believes Venezuela will eventually stabilize.\nChevron, the world's seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the OPEC-member nation.\nThe firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year, to $329 million, according to regulatory filings.\nThe arrests mark an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures' governance, sources familiar with the dispute told Reuters.\nOutside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas. If their executives sign contracts without following their companies' due process rules, they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption. If they don't sign, they stoke tension with their partners at PDVSA, which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures.\nCompanies evaluating an exit from Venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil, according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in Venezuela. But continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses, taking massive write-downs - and, now, the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro.\nPDVSA's deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, according to official data reported to OPEC. Venezuela's oil output so far this year is at a 33-year low.\nThe falling production and arrests of PDVSA executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after Maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience, Major General Manuel Quevedo, as the nation's oil minister and president of PDVSA.\nSeveral of Chevron's foreign staff and some local executives and their families left Venezuela starting last week after the arrests, the four sources familiar with their departures told Reuters. They described the situation as temporary, and said executives may return if proposed talks between Chevron and PDVSA to resolve the dispute are successful.\nChevron executives have had high-level meetings with Venezuelan government officials this week, said two of the people familiar with the matter.\nChevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips in Venezuela in 2007, when the government of then-President Hugo Chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures.\n\"No company can leave because it would lose the assets,\" said a former negotiator of Exxon's 2007 exit from Venezuela. \"At this point, there are just a few options.\"\nFear of arrest Chevron employees remaining in Venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management, according to interviews with employees and family members.\nThe arrested Chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil production and processing project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron.\nChevron has asked employees assigned to Petropiar to temporarily work from the firm's Puerto la Cruz office rather than show up at its partner's oil production and processing facilities, according to one person familiar with the situation.\nThe two men had refused to sign a multi-million dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by Petropiar, according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute. Such decrees, which skip competitive bidding, have been cited by Venezuelan and U.S. prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases.\nAlgarra and Vasquez are now being held in a detention center in Barcelona run by Venezuela's intelligence unit, known as Sebin. Coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite off assets, cutting staff Several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their Venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations, keeping only a skeletal staff in the country.\nSpain's Repsol took a pre-tax charge of about $1 billion on its Venezuelan assets in the prior quarter. Italy's ENI said it was owed 500 million euros ($615 million) in delinquent payments from PDVSA last year.\nService provider Schlumberger wrote down its Venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by $938 million. Halliburton earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country, adding a $312 million charge on top of $647 million in charges last year.\nOther international oil firms, including France's Total , have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated.\n\"I can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power, lack of water,\" said Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne last week at an oil summit in Paris.\nThe company would maintain a presence there, however, on the hope the crisis would ease.\n\"It is important to stay in a country even in difficult times,\" Pouyanne said, \"because people will remember it.\"\n— CNBC contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T22:51:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
