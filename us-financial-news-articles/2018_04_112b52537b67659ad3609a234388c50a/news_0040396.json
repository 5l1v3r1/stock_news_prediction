Photo: Reuters\nA former official at Venezuela’s state oil company pleaded guilty in U.S. court to a money-laundering charge, admitting to taking bribes from American companies for business with the oil firm.\nThe ex-official, Cesar Rincon, is one of five men whom the U.S. has charged with conspiring to solicit bribes from U.S. businesses. The allegations are part of a larger, ongoing investigation of bribery at Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA.\nThe five, known as the “management team,” sought payments to help companies win business from PdVSA, or to ensure money the oil company owed to the firms was paid, the U.S. Justice Department alleged. The men then allegedly laundered, and concealed, the proceeds of the scheme through a series of complex international financial transactions, prosecutors said.\nA 20-count indictment against the “management team” members charged each person with at least one count of money laundering, and with conspiracy. Two face counts of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The FCPA bars the use of bribes to foreign officials to get or keep business.\nMr. Rincon, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, also agreed to forfeit $7 million. He admitted to taking bribes from two men who have already pleaded guilty to violating the FCPA, as well as from owners of other energy companies in the U.S., the Justice Department said.\nSentencing is scheduled for July 9.\nOne of the remaining four defendants is in custody in the U.S. after being extradited from Spain, while two remain there pending extradition. A fourth person is at large, the Justice Department said. Lawyers for the men couldn’t immediately be identified.\nThe Justice Department has announced guilty pleas by 11 people, including Mr. Rincon, as part of the broader PdVSA investigation.\nWrite to Henry Cutter at henry.cutter@wsj.com.

Neil White, Deloitte Risk and Financial Advisory principal and Global Internal Audit Analytics leader at Deloitte & Touche LLP, discusses how internal audit can perform with greater assurance and confidence while gaining considerable efficiencies over time by making greater use of analytics. However, the function cannot make headway on its own. Rather, organizations should consider setting a strategy for the future state of such an analytics program and develop a long-term roadmap for how to get there.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
