(NYSE:TS) (BAE:TS) (BMV:TS) (MILAN:TEN) (“Tenaris”) today announced its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 in comparison with its results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSummary of 2018 First Quarter Results\n(Comparison with fourth and first quarter of 2017)\n1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 Net sales ($ million) 1,866 1,589 17 % 1,154 62 % Operating income ($ million) 212 168 26 % 36 489 % Net income ($ million) 235 162 45 % 206 14 % Shareholders’ net income ($ million) 235 160 47 % 205 15 % Earnings per ADS ($) 0.40 0.27 47 % 0.35 15 % Earnings per share ($) 0.20 0.14 47 % 0.17 15 % EBITDA ($ million) 354 319 11 % 198 79 % EBITDA margin (% of net sales) 19.0 % 20.1 % 17.2 % In the first quarter of 2018, sales, which rose 17% quarter on quarter and 62% year on year, were boosted by an exceptional level of shipments for East Mediterranean pipelines and a high level of sales during the peak Canadian drilling season. Earnings per share, operating income and EBITDA continue to recover and benefit from higher absorption of fixed costs although the EBITDA margin was affected by higher raw material costs and lower margins on the East Mediterranean shipments.\nDuring the quarter, we had a further increase of working capital of $364 million, reflecting an increase in receivables associated with a high level of sales towards the end of the quarter. Net cash flow used in operations amounted to $30 million. After capital expenditures of $92 million, our net cash position declined to $557 million at the end of the quarter.\nMarket Background and Outlook\nIn the year to date, shale drilling activity in the USA has grown steadily while, in Canada, growth is being affected by takeaway capacity constraints and wider commodity price spreads. In the rest of the world, higher oil prices are leading to a gradual recovery in onshore drilling activity. In Latin America, despite promising results from the reform programs in Brazil and Mexico and further interest in the Vaca Muerta shale play in Argentina, drilling activity has been slow to pick up outside Colombia and the new deepwater play in Guyana.\nThe full extent of US Section 232 tariffs on steel imports is still unclear but as far as imports of steel pipes are reduced by quotas or the application of the 25% tariff, Tenaris expects to be well placed to increase production at its US domestic facilities.\nIn the coming quarters, we expect shipments to be lower than the first quarter but sales and margins should benefit from price increases that compensate recent increases in raw material costs. EBITDA and operating income should continue to show growth through the year.\nAnalysis of 2018 First Quarter Results\nTubes Sales volume (thousand metric tons) 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 Seamless 651 593 10 % 509 28 % Welded 285 171 67 % 74 283 % Total 936 764 23 % 583 61 %\nTubes 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 (Net sales - $ million) North America 807 707 14 % 477 69 % South America 285 296 (4 %) 203 40 % Europe 153 133 15 % 130 17 % Middle East & Africa 456 290 57 % 230 98 % Asia Pacific 66 51 29 % 46 45 % Total net sales ($ million) 1,766 1,478 20 % 1,085 63 % Operating income ($ million) 194 150 29 % 31 524 % Operating margin (% of sales) 11.0 % 10.1 % 2.8 % Net sales of tubular products and services increased 20% sequentially and 63% year on year. In North America sales increased 14% sequentially, reflecting high sales in Canada in the peak drilling season and higher sales in the United States onshore. In South America sales declined 4% sequentially, as slightly higher sales of OCTG in Argentina were offset by lower sales elsewhere. In Europe sales increased 15% thanks to an increase in demand for mechanical pipe and line pipe for power generation and hydrocarbon processing industry. In the Middle East and Africa sales increased 57%, boosted by an exceptional level of shipments of line pipe products for the Zohr project in the East Mediterranean and stable sales elsewhere. In Asia Pacific sales increased 29% thanks to higher shipments throughout the region and particularly in Thailand.\nOperating income from tubular products and services amounted to $194 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $150 million in the previous quarter and $31 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential increase is a result of an improvement in the margin on higher sales. While during the quarter average selling prices declined 2% (reflecting a mix of products with higher participation of welded line pipe products) and costs of sales remained stable (higher direct cost of sales offset by a positive volume effect on fixed costs), the operating margin improved following the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.\nOthers 1Q 2018 4Q 2017 1Q 2017 Net sales ($ million) 100 111 (10 %) 68 46 % Operating income ($ million) 19 18 2 % 5 246 % Operating income (% of sales) 18.7 % 16.5 % 7.9 % Net sales of other products and services decreased 10% sequentially but increased 46% year on year. The sequential decrease in sales is mainly related to lower sales of sucker rods.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses , or SG&A, amounted to $350 million, or 18.7% of net sales, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $344 million, 21.6% in the previous quarter and $294 million, 25.5% in the first quarter of 2017. Sequentially, SG&A declined as a percentage of sales due to a better absorption of fixed costs on higher sales and lower provisions for contingencies and doubtful accounts and the termination of the amortization of intangible assets of our Canadian subsidiary for $13 million.\nFinancial results amounted to a loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a gain of $4 million in the previous quarter and a loss of $4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The loss of the quarter is mainly explained by lower interest results on a lower net cash position and a foreign exchange loss, net of derivatives results, of $7 million, mainly related to the negative impact from Euro appreciation against the U.S. dollar on Euro denominated intercompany liabilities in subsidiaries with functional currency U.S. dollar. The net foreign exchange loss is to a large extent offset in equity, in the currency translation adjustment reserve.\nEquity in earnings of non-consolidated companies generated a gain of $46 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a gain of $26 million in the previous quarter and a gain of $35 million in the first quarter of 2017. These results are mainly derived from our equity investment in Ternium (NYSE:TX) and Usiminas (BSP:USIM).\nIncome tax charge amounted to $15 million in the first quarter of 2018, positively affected by currency movements on the tax base used to calculate deferred taxes at our subsidiaries which have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency for $20 million. This compares to an income tax charge of $36 million in the previous quarter and an income tax gain of $47 million in the first quarter of last year positively affected by the effect of the Mexican and Argentine peso revaluation on the tax base used to calculate deferred taxes at our Mexican and Argentine subsidiaries which have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nNet cash used in operations during the first quarter of 2018 was $30 million as we had a further increase of working capital of $364 million, reflecting an increase in receivables associated with a high level of sales towards the end of the quarter, compared to a cash generation of $26 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $13 million used in the previous quarter.\nCapital expenditures amounted to $92 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $121 million in the previous quarter and $139 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nAt the end of the quarter, our net cash position amounted to $557 million, compared to $680 million at the beginning of the year.\nConference call\nTenaris will hold a conference call to discuss the above reported results, on April 27, 2018, at 08:00 a.m. (Eastern Time).

EBITDA is an approximation to pre-tax operating cash flow and reflects cash generation before working capital variation. EBITDA is widely used by investors when evaluating businesses (multiples valuation), as well as by rating agencies and creditors to evaluate the level of debt, comparing EBITDA with net debt.\nEBITDA is calculated in the following manner:\nEBITDA= Operating results + Depreciation and amortization + Impairment charges/(reversals).\n(all amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars) Three-month period ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating income 212,197 36,014 Depreciation and amortization 141,802 162,218 EBITDA 353,999 198,232 Net Cash / (Debt)\nThis is the net balance of cash and cash equivalents, other current investments and non-current investments less total borrowings. It provides a summary of the financial solvency and liquidity of the company. Net cash / (debt) is widely used by investors and rating agencies and creditors to assess the company’s leverage, financial strength, flexibility and risks.\nNet cash/ debt is calculated in the following manner:\nNet cash= Cash and cash equivalents + Other investments (Current)+ Non Current Investments – Borrowings (Current and Non-current).\n(all amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars) At March 31, 2018 2017 Cash and bank deposits 328,675 427,619 Other current investments 999,576 1,613,665 Non Current Investments 234,739 316,003 Borrowings (1,005,595 ) (708,231 ) Net cash / (debt) 557,395 1,649,056 Free Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a measure of financial performance , calculated as operating cash flow less capital expenditures .
