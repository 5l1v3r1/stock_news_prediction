In addition to the macro data presented in the report, there are also segment-specific findings by industry, state, gender, age, experience and pay level.\nThe updated WVR from the ADP Research Institute ® will include all of the same segment-specific data, but also include updates to provide improved, more granular insights.\nEnhancements to the report will include the use of monthly data, rather than quarterly numbers, to sharpen labor market picture, the addition of information around new entrants to the workforce and deeper insights into seasonality and employment by firm size.\nDetailed information about changes to the methodology and an updated calendar of release dates will be available at http://workforcereport.adp.com/ on Wednesday, April 25.\nWVR data dating back to 2014, with the new methodology, will be available.\nWHEN: Wednesday, April 25, 2018\nABOUT ADP (NASDAQ: ADP) :\nPowerful technology plus a human touch.
