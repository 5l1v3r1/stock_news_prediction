The stock closed on Tuesday at 27.50 euros. Immofinanz’s shares closed at 2.19 euros, above the 2.10 euros per share, minus any dividend, Starwood is offering.\nImmofinanz last month dismissed that offer as too low, while CA Immo said it needed more information to form an opinion.\nThe offer for CA Immo runs to May 16, while the offer for Immofinanz lasts until May 30, the offer documents published on Wednesday showed.\nTogether they are worth up to around 824 million euros ($1.02 billion), according to Reuters calculations. Both partial tender offers are independent and are not contingent on any minimum acceptance threshold.\nImmofinanz already owns 26 percent of CA Immo. It said in February it was considering selling that stake after it effectively abandoned its plan to take over the company.\nStarwood has said it supports both companies’ management teams and does not plan to acquire a majority of either firm. Both will also remain listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange, it has said.\n“Starwood Capital considers Austria, Germany and (central and eastern Europe) as attractive markets and is committed to increasing its real estate exposure there,” it said on Wednesday.
