Political leaders and investors hope this would ease tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme and pave the way for the North and South to end their decades-long conflict.\nThat helped Seoul shares briefly rise more than 1 percent to a one-month high and the won firmed. MSCI’s index of Asian shares outside Japan rallied 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei share average rose 0.7 percent to two-month peaks.\nThe dollar meanwhile hit its highest since Jan. 12 against a basket of currencies, having benefited from the recent run in U.S. Treasury yields — 10-year yields hit 3 percent this week for the first time since January 2014.\nWith a weekly gain of more than 1.5 percent, the greenback is set for its best weekly performance since late-November 2016.\n“U.S. rates didn’t matter for the dollar, now they do and our positioning metrics suggest there is further scope for short dollar positions to be unwound,” said Michael Sneyd, global head of FX strategy at BNP Paribas in London.\nFor Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar (Reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Additional reporting by Saikat Chatterjee and Helen Reid in LONDON and Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE; Editing by Toby Chopra)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh"], "published": "2018-04-27T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T02:25:25.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
