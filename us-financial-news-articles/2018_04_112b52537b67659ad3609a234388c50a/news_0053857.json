Thank you everyone for all your support,” his mother Kate James wrote.\nMedical experts in Britain had agreed that more treatment for Alfie would be futile, but his parents wanted to take him to Rome, where the Vatican’s Bambino Gesu hospital had offered to care for him.\nA British court rejected an appeal by the parents on Wednesday to take their son to Italy.\nThe case stirred strong feelings over whether judges, doctors or parents have the right to decide on a child’s life. Alfie’s parents were supported by Pope Francis and Poland’s President Andrzej Duda.\n“I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie. Today I pray especially for his parents, as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace,” the pope tweeted on Saturday.\nCandles and placards are pictured during a protest in support of Alfie Evans, in front of the British Embassy building in Warsaw, Poland April 26, 2018.
