This is all due to the U.S., specifically its new sanctions against Russian oligarchs and top officials, and the ramping up of its rhetoric against the Kremlin over its support for Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, in the wake of the regime’s alleged chemical weapons attack on the rebel-held Damascus suburb of Douma. Wall Street Journal \nGlencore Caught Up \nMeanwhile, shares in Rusal, controlled by the freshly-sanctioned oligarch Oleg Deripaska, fell a further 8.7% on Tuesday after seeing their value halved on Monday. And Ivan Glasenberg, the CEO of mining giant Glencore, has resigned from Rusal’s board. Glencore owns an 8.75% stake in Rusal and also saw its shares fall (by 5%) on the news of the Deripaska sanctions. Glencore said it was “committed to complying with all applicable sanctions in its business.” CNBC \nUber Loss \nUber has lost another big case at the European Union’s top court. The court ruled this morning that a French court was within its rights to fine Uber for running an illegal transport service (specifically its UberPop service, which used regular people as drivers rather than licensed professionals.) Uber has consistently tried to pitch itself as a tech platform rather than a transport service, a status that comes with different regulatory burdens. Fortune \nDeutsche Bank \nDeutsche Bank has explained the ouster of CEO John Cryan, saying he was too slow in his decision-making. Paul Achleitner, the chair of Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board, pointed out that the bank’s share price has fallen from €17 ($21) a year ago to less than €11 today. He also defended the nomination of former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain to the supervisory board—German media have criticized Thain’s pre-crisis spending, but Achleitner says the board “needs members with long experience in international finance.” Bloomberg Advertisement Around the Water Cooler \nFacebook Criticism \nAs Mark Zuckerberg prepped for his first congressional hearing today, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes said he was amazed Zuck hadn’t had to explain the company’s data-sharing practices before. “[Zuckerberg] and the whole corporate leadership at Facebook—it’s shocking to me that they didn’t have to answer more of these questions earlier on. The idea that this was unforeseeable seems like a stretch,” Hughes said at a Financial Times event. FT \nBlack Lives Matter \nSpeaking of Facebook, it turns out that the biggest Black Lives Matter page on the social network was in fact a fake, run by a middle-aged white guy in Australia who published links to fundraising pages, and apparently raised nearly $100,000 through the ruse. The revelation brings up issues around how well Facebook authenticates those running pages on its platform. Fortune \nPizza Night Data \nHow much data do you reveal when you go about your daily routine using modern technology? The Wall Street Journal has a great piece on that, using as an example two imaginary people who are trying to set up a pizza-and-movie night. Let’s just say that the simple activity involved in doing this gives a huge amount of data to companies from Apple and Facebook to Domino’s. WSJ \nTrump Fury \nPresident Donald Trump is livid over an FBI raid on the offices of his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is “an attack on our country” and a “real disgrace,” the president thundered. Agents took documents relating to the porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleges an affair with Trump, and whom Cohen paid $130,000 shortly before the election.
