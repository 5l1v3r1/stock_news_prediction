This trade implies shares of IBM will be above $161.38 by this Friday.\n\"When you see that sort of short-dated call-buying that's usually for the print here,\" Nathan said Monday on CNBC's \" Fast Money .\"\nDespite the optimism among options traders, Nathan warns that IBM's stock has been struggling to maintain its gains off recent earnings reports.\n\"[It's] actually tacked two good prints the last two quarters,\" Nathan said on \"Fast Money,\" \"but it's given it all back either over weeks or in a matter of days.\"\nIn January, shares of IBM were trading near a seven-month high before sinking more than 4.5 percent on its fourth-quarter results. This despite the fact that the tech company beat earnings per share estimates and posted positive revenue growth for the first time in 23 quarters.\nIBM's stock is up more than 4 percent year to date, but down more than 6 percent in the past year.
