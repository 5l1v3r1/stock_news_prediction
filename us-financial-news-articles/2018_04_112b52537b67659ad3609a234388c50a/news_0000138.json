A hearing in that case is set for June.\nThe latest legal action involves California’s Senate Bill 50, which was signed into law in October and gives the state right of first refusal over many federal land conveyances.\nIf the California State Lands Commission waives its right of first refusal, it issues a compliance certificate. Without this document, the land transfer cannot be legally recorded in a county property office.\nThe Justice Department in its lawsuit argues that Senate Bill 50 is preempted by federal law.\nReporting by Sarah N.
