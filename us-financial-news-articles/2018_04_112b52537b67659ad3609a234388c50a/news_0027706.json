It was the largest annual increase since the series started in 2015.\nThe vacancy rate, which measures the share of unfilled jobs out of those available, rose to 2.9 percent from 2.4 percent.\nA higher job vacancy rate generally points to economic growth. The countryâ€™s labor market was unexpectedly robust last year, but economists expect the rapid pace of jobs growth to slow in 2018.\nJob openings rose in 8 out of 10 of the major industrial sectors, with vacancies in accommodation and food services up 25 percent from a year ago, and job openings in manufacturing jumping 39 percent.
