Tesla declined to comment on this, while Intel was not immediately available for comment on the WSJ report.\nSeparately, Andrej Karpathy, Tesla’s director of AI and Autopilot vision, will now have overall responsibility for all Autopilot software within the company, the spokeswoman said.\nEarlier this month, Tesla withdrew as a formal party to the National Transportation Safety Board’s probe into a fatal March 23 crash in California in which the semi-autonomous “Autopilot” driving system was in use, before the board revoked its status.\nDriver Walter Huang’s death in the crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, prompted investigations by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe NTSB has three pending probes into Tesla crashes.
