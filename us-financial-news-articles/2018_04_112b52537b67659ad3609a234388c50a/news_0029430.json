The scheme had about $90 billion issued to institutions at the end of March. \nNo new QDII quotas have been granted since 2015, when China’s stock market crash triggered massive capital outflows. \nEarlier this year, China resumed Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership, another outbound investment scheme, signalling Beijing is less worried about capital outflows.
