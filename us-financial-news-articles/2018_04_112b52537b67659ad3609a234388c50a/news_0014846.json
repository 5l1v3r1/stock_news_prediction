Both teams have already clinched playoff berths.\nThe Wild will finish third in the Central Division and face the Winnipeg Jets in the first round of the playoffs.\nBrown opened the scoring with the game’s first shot 55 seconds after puck drop by deflecting Christian Folin’s point offering, setting off a crazy game.\nRyan Murphy responded on Minnesota’s second shot at the 3:12 mark. After taking a cross-ice pass just inside the blue line, Murphy juked to avoid a checker and sent a shot that deflected off a defender and past Quick, which would be a trend all night.\nMatt Dumba tallied 5:02 into the affair to give Minnesota a 2-1 lead when his point shot also ricocheted off a defender.\nThen it was the hosts’ turn to regain the lead. After Brown’s second of the night during a five-on-three power play at 7:42 of the second period evened the count, Tobias Rieder put the Kings ahead 3-2 at 12:57 of the second period with a nifty redirect of Folin’s pass.\nDaniel Brickley, who signed with the Kings as a free agent out of Minnesota State, collected an assist to make his NHL debut more memorable.\nBrown then collected his hat trick with 50 seconds remaining in the second period with a shot that deflected off Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin to make it 4-2.\nThe Wild roared back, though. At 5:42 of the third period, during a delayed penalty, Dumba sent a cross-ice feed that Eric Staal buried, and then Nate Prosser scored a short-handed goal with 10:36 remaining in regulation to force overtime.\nStalock stopped 23 shots for the Wild.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T13:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:13:43.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
