(\"FMSA\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: FMSA) in connection with the proposed acquisition of FMSA by SCR-Sibelco NV subsidiary Unimin Corporation (\"Unimin\"). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders, including equity award holders, will receive $170 million in cash, or approximately $0.74 per share based on Fairmount's current diluted share count.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether FMSA's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at the close of the transaction, FMSA shareholders will own a meager 35% of the combined company.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether FMSA's Board acted in the best interests of FMSA's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own FMSA shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
