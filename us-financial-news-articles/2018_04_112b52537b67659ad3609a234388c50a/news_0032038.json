Chris Rusin allowed two hits in two scoreless innings of relief, and Adam Ottavino pitched a clean ninth with two strikeouts.\nStory hit a three-run homer in the fourth and Blackmon added a solo shot in the eighth for the Rockies (10-8), who lead the National League with 26 homers. They have homered in seven of their past eight games, hitting a total of 14 in that stretch.\nColorado is 8-2 in its past 10 road games after dropping its first two of the season.\nSteven Brault (2-1) gave up five runs and five hits in six innings, with two walks and one strikeout for Pittsburgh (11-5).\nThe Rockies scored twice in the first. DJ LeMahieu walked and scored on Chris Iannetta’s double. Iannetta then came around on Blackmon’s groundout to make it 2-0.\nIn the fourth, Story broke an 0-for-9 skid when he smacked a three-run shot to left for a 5-0 lead. Ian Desmond, who walked, and Carlos Gonzalez, who singled up the middle, scored on the blast.\nFrancisco Cervelli hit a one-out triple to right in the fifth for the Pirates’ first hit. He scored on Colin Moran’s sacrifice fly.\nPittsburgh made it 5-2 in the sixth when Gregory Polanco drew a two-out walk and scored on Starling Marte’s triple to center.\nBlackmon boosted Colorado’s lead to 6-2 with a solo shot to left in the eighth off reliever Tyler Glasnow. All seven of Blackmon’s home runs have come on the road. He is 5-for-12 with three homers and seven RBIs since he returned from a four-game absence because of a right quad injury.\nThe Pirates played without second baseman Josh Harrison, who was put on the disabled list earlier in the day because of a broken left hand suffered on a hit by pitch Sunday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:10:30.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
