Negotiate for more \nYour chance to maximize your college aid package doesn't end once you've submitted your FAFSA application. \n\"There is an appeal process,\" college admissions expert Danny Ruderman tells CNBC Make It . \"Once you submit the FAFSA, be sure to submit supplements or new addendums.\" \nThe Department of Education allows families to appeal because, he says, \"you can fill out the FAFSA in December, and by the time that your child is going [to college] the next fall, things can change.\" \nJavice adds that families who have recently been affected by a natural disaster have much to gain from submitting supplements and addendums. \n\"To those who have been affected by [Hurricanes] Harvey and Irma, you should be negotiating your aid because of the natural disaster,\" she says. \"You will likely be in a great position to negotiate and get free college aid because of the unfortunate events that happened.\" 3. Negotiate with your school \nOnce you have been accepted by a college and been offered a financial aid package, students should negotiate with the school for more assistance . \n\"Most students don't know that they should never, ever, ever accept their first aid package,\" says Javice. \nShe says that across the country, schools offer around $80 billion in financial aid discounts to their students, \"of which, $15 to 20 billion is reserved for aid appeals, and about half of that is usually not allocated, because people don't know that they should be doing this.\" show chapters 12:37 PM ET Wed, 26 April 2017 | 00:46 4. Look at outside scholarships \nWhile federal student aid and college provided aid are often the best places to start financing your college degree, there are also thousands of outside college scholarships that students can apply for. \nIn fact, Ben Kaplan, CEO of PR Hacker and author of \" How to Go to College Almost for Free ,\" funded his undergraduate degree at Harvard with 24 scholarships totaling $90,000 . \n\"I won two dozen of them and accumulated $90,000 in scholarship money, which at the time, combined with a year's worth of AP credit (which basically let me enter Harvard as a sophomore) covered the entire cost of Harvard for me,\" he explained to CNBC Make It . \nIn order to maximize their awards, Kaplan suggests that students look for scholarships in creative places, apply for many scholarships and fine-tune their applications over time. 5. Apply to a free program \nOne way to minimize your college costs is to see if you qualify for a tuition-free program. For instance, these eight colleges do not charge tuition . \nThere are also multiple colleges across the country that offer tuition-free programs for students who are Pell Grant eligible. \nIn 2017, the University of New Hampshire (UNH) announced that it would charge New Hampshire residents receiving Pell Grants absolutely no tuition. \n\"UNH's Granite Guarantee allows us to remove more of the financial barriers to higher education that many New Hampshire families face,\" said UNH President Mark Huddleston . \"This new program demonstrates our strong commitment to ensuring a UNH education is affordable and accessible to New Hampshire's best and brightest.\" This is an updated version of a post that appeared previously.
