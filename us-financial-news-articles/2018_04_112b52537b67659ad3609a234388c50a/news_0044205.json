REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nApple ( AAPL.O ) led the way after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ( 2330.TW ) cut its revenue target to the low end of forecasts and blamed softer demand for smartphones. \n“The big story for the APAC region today will be fallout from TSMC’s miss, which will weigh heavily on the tech sector, with first order impacts on the Semis and Samsung Electronics/ Galaxy supply chain,” analysts at JPMorgan said in a note. \n“The miss appears largely to have been due to Apple iPhones, and so may also weigh on the Apple supply chain.” \nTaiwan's main index .TWII slid 1.4 percent with techs sinking 3.5 percent and TSMC off more than 5 percent. \nStocks in South Korea .KS11 took a 0.3 percent dip, with the tech sector losing 1.6 percent. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS shed 0.8 percent, again led by a 0.7 percent fall in technology. \nJapan's Nikkei .N225 recouped early losses to rise 0.1 percent as gains in energy and financials outweighed the drop in tech. \nWall Street had also been hit by weak results from tobacco company Philip Morris ( PM.N ), which sent its shares down as much as 17.7 percent and dragged on the S&P 500. \nThe Dow .DJI ended down 0.34 percent, while the S&P 500 .SPX lost 0.57 percent and the Nasdaq .IXIC 0.78 percent. INFLATION FUEL \nOil prices were creeping up again after hitting their highest since late 2014 on drawdowns in global supply and as Saudi Arabia looks to fatten its export revenue. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 edged up 6 cents to $73.83 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 added 7 cents to $68.36. \nA global oil glut has been virtually eliminated, according to a joint OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel, two sources familiar with the matter said, thanks in part to an OPEC-led supply cut deal in place since January 2017. \nAnalysts at CBA noted market measures of inflation expectations had spiked higher this week as oil prices surged, with some hitting highs not seen since mid-2014. \nThat in turn pressured fixed-income debt with yields on 10-year Treasuries US10YT=RR jumping to a one-month top at 2.93 percent. Yields are up 10 basis points in just two days, the sharpest move since early February. \nIn currency markets, the main mover was sterling which dived late on Thursday when Bank of England Governor Mark Carney cooled expectations for an interest rate hike in May, pointing out there were “other meetings” this year. \nSterling dropped more than a cent to $1.4078 GBP=D4 , leaving the week's peak of $1.4373 a distant memory. \nThe sudden retreat in sterling helped support the U.S. dollar more broadly and the dollar index .DXY was steady at 89.956. \nThe euro also eased back a touch to $1.2341 EUR= , while the dollar inched up on the yen to 107.62 JPY= and looked set to test the recent top at 107.78. \nOn the radar later in the day will be IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington where free trade and protectionism is certain to be high on the agenda along with Sino-U.S. tensions.
