REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo \nExcluding the impact of currencies, Puma now expects sales to increase between 10 and 12 percent in 2018, up from a previous target for a 10 percent rise, it said on Thursday. \nIt forecasts operating profit in the range of 310 million to 330 million euros ($382-$407 million), compared with previous guidance for 305 to 325 million euros. \n“The first quarter saw a strong increase in sales and profitability, but several uncertainties in our business environment have recently developed,” Puma said, citing adverse currency developments, political instability and a uncertain trade environment between China and the United States.
