But a fresh round of U.S. sanctions on Russian businessmen hit shares in several Russia-exposed companies on the FTSE.\nShares in Russian steelmaker Evraz were the biggest fallers, down nearly 10 percent. Miner Glencore also fell 2.4 percent, while mid-cap Polymetal was down 5.3 percent.\nShares in Jersey-based EN+ Group, which manages the assets of tycoon Oleg Deripaska, dropped 27.5 percent.\n“Glencore and the miners will definitely be (down) as a result of the Russian situation. If we see further escalations, we might look to go a little bit more bearish on these particular stocks in these particular sectors,” Jasper Reimers, senior analyst at Vertex Capital Group, said.\n“At this stage, there’s no major concern - I don’t think there are any major escalations just yet.”\nShares in Rolls Royce were the biggest gainers, up around 1.7 percent after the company agree to sell parts maker L’Orange to U.S.-based engineering company Woodward Inc for 700 million euros ($859 million), as part of a plan to simplify its business.\n“As well as providing a healthy boost to the balance sheet, it suggests chief executive Warren East is not sitting on his hands despite reporting good progress on a transformation of the business at last month’s full year results,” Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said in a note.
