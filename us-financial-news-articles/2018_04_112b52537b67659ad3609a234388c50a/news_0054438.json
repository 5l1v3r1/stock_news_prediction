It was only big enough for a bunk-bed and a dresser and that was it.\"\nHis two youngest grew up after his business took off. In fact, it was his youngest daughter who first broke the news to him that he'd become a billionaire . \"She was scooping ice cream for $7 an hour,\" Koch tells CNBC Make It. \"One of the other girls asked her: 'Oh my gosh, I read in the newspaper that your dad's a billionaire. Why are you scooping ice cream for $7 an hour?' And she just looked at the girl and said, 'Because I need the money!'\"\n\"I'm very proud of her,\" continues Koch, who says the best way to teach work ethic is to lead by example. \"They saw me working really hard and enjoying it. So they learned from that that work can be fulfilling and good and it's not something that you have to view as negative.
