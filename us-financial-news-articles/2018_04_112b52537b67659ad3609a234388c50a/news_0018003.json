Cricket World Cup 2019 in England and Wales,” Hohns said. \n“For that reason, there has been a bit of a focus in this contracting period on white-ball cricket, as we look ahead to trying to win back-to-back World Cups.” \nBatsman Shaun Marsh and wicketkeeper Tim Paine, who assumed the captaincy from Smith during the South African series, also return to the central list. \nFast bowlers Jackson Bird and Chadd Sayers, both of whom featured for the test team in the last six months, did not receive a central contract. \nInjured bowlers James Pattinson and Nathan Coulter-Nile both also missed out, but all four remain in contention for upgraded domestic contracts if they are called into the national side, Hohns said. \n“Jackson and Chadd have missed out on this occasion, but they remain in the frame for Australian honours moving forward and can be upgraded if selected,” Hohns said. \n“We would like to see both James and Nathan now put some consistent games together for their states. \n“They are both quality fast bowlers and we have no doubt that if they can play regularly and remain fit in the upcoming season, they will become very positive selection options for us.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Gold Coast, Australia; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T05:21:26.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
