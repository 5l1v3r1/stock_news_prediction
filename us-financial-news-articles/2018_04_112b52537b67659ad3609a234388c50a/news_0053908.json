Operating and financial highlights for the first quarter appear below.\nRevenues of $445 million were up 1% led by growth across the Property Intelligence & Risk Management (PIRM) segment and market outperformance by the Underwriting & Workflow Solutions (UWS) segment which largely offset the impact of an estimated 10% decline in U.S. mortgage origination unit volumes. Operating income from continuing operations rose 36% to $44 million attributable to productivity and cost management program benefits as well as the positive effects of revenue growth and favorable business mix. Net income from continuing operations increased $16 million, or 123%, to $28 million. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was up 127% to $0.34. Adjusted EPS totaled $0.52 per share, up 41%. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% to $103 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 23%. The Company completed the acquisition of eTech Solutions and repurchased 400,000 of its common shares.\n“CoreLogic is off to a very strong start in 2018 delivering top line growth, strong margin expansion and high levels of free cash flow. Operationally, both PIRM and UWS executed extremely well against our business plans as we continued to outperform the U.S. mortgage market volume trends and expand our footprint in areas such as property insights, international, insurance & spatial solutions and valuations,” said Frank Martell, President and Chief Executive Officer of CoreLogic. “We also drove up Adjusted EBITDA margins almost 300 basis points through productivity, cost management and favorable revenue mix. I believe our first quarter margin improvement is an important indicator of the progress we are making toward achieving our longer-term profitability targets.”\n\"We head into the balance of 2018 excited by the opportunities inherent in our strategic plan which is focused on delivering unique, must-have insights that power and connect the global housing ecosystem over the long term. We remain focused on capitalizing on our scale and market leadership and the opportunities presented by a strong purchase-driven mortgage cycle in the U.S. where we have built solutions that are poised to capitalize on the benefits of high operating leverage. In addition, our insurance & spatial solutions and international businesses provide us with opportunities for high margin non-cyclical growth,” Martell added.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nFirst quarter revenues totaled $445 million compared with $440 million in the same 2017 period. PIRM revenues rose 5% to $174 million, driven by organic growth in property insights, including international operations, and benefits from insurance & spatial solutions related acquisitions completed in 2017. UWS segment revenues totaled $273 million, down 1%, as organic growth and the 2017 acquisition of Mercury Network largely offset the impact of lower U.S. mortgage loan unit volumes and planned vendor diversification by two appraisal management clients.\nOperating income from continuing operations totaled $44 million for the first quarter compared with $33 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 36% year-over-year increase in operating income was principally attributable to revenue growth and favorable business mix as well as cost productivity related gains. First quarter operating income margin was up approximately 260 basis points to 10%.\nFirst quarter net income from continuing operations totaled $28 million compared with $13 million in the same 2017 period. The increase was primarily attributable to operating upsides outlined previously, along with a net tax benefit in the current quarter, which more than offset higher interest expense and depreciation and amortization. First quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.34 compared with $0.15 in 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.52, up from $0.37 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA aggregated $103 million in the first quarter compared with $90 million in the same prior year period. The 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA was principally driven by revenue growth, improved business mix and cost productivity. PIRM segment adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $50 million. UWS segment adjusted EBITDA increased 21% to $65 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 280 basis points to 23%.\nProductivity Programs\nAs previously announced, the Company intends to incur cash and non-cash charges of approximately $15 million over the course of 2018 relating to its expansion of certain efficiency programs and infrastructure enhancements. These charges will be reflected in the Company’s GAAP financial results and will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS metrics which are non-GAAP measures. This program is expected to increase overall operating efficiency and accelerate the transformation of certain technology and data platforms. In addition, the Company expects to further consolidate its real estate footprint, reduce SG&A costs and automate and/or outsource certain business activities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $124 million compared with $119 million at December 31, 2017. Total debt as of March 31, 2018 was $1,732 million compared with $1,777 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had available capacity on its revolving credit facility of $700 million.\nNet operating cash provided by continuing operations for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 was $384 million. Free cash flow (FCF) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 totaled $307 million, which represented 62% of adjusted EBITDA. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 400,000 of its common shares for $18.5 million. The Company also completed the acquisition of UK-based eTech Solutions in February 2018 utilizing cash on hand.\nTeleconference/Webcast\nCoreLogic management will host a live webcast and conference call on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Pacific time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss these results.

Risks and uncertainties exist that may cause the results to differ materially from those set forth in these . Factors that could cause the anticipated results to differ from those described in the include the risks and uncertainties set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. These additional risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: our ability to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches; limitations on access to or increase in prices for data from external sources, including government and public record sources; changes in applicable government legislation, regulations and the level of regulatory scrutiny affecting our customers or us, including with respect to consumer financial services and the use of public records and consumer data; systems interruptions that may impair the delivery of our products and services; difficult conditions in the mortgage and consumer lending industries and the economy generally; our ability to protect proprietary rights; our technology and growth strategies and our ability to effectively and efficiently implement them; risks related to the outsourcing of services and international operations; our indebtedness and the restrictions in our various debt agreements; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of certain acquisitions and/or divestitures and the timing thereof; the inability to control the operations or dividend policies of our partially-owned affiliates; and impairments in our goodwill or other intangible assets. The speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake to update to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the are made.\nUse of Non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures which are provided only as supplemental information. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with or a substitute for U.S. GAAP. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected adjusted EBITDA or projected adjusted earnings per share to respective GAAP results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of special charges or gains.\nThe Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and FCF, provides useful supplemental information to investors and management regarding the Company's financial condition and results. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock compensation, non-operating gains/losses and other adjustments. Adjusted EPS is defined as income from continuing operations, net of tax per diluted share, adjusted for stock compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, non-operating gains/losses, and other adjustments; tax affected at an assumed effective tax rate of 26% and 35% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. FCF is defined as net cash provided by continuing operating activities less capital expenditures for purchases of property and equipment, capitalized data and other intangible assets. Other firms may calculate non-GAAP measures differently than CoreLogic, which limits comparability between companies.\nCORELOGIC, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nUNAUDITED\nFor
