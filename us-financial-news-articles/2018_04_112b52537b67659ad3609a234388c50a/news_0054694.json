Yet the agency had not shown it considered those factors.\n“HHS’ decision was, therefore, arbitrary and capricious,” Blake wrote.\nThe ruling came in one of four lawsuits announced in February by organizations and local governments that received grants under the program, which was launched during Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration.\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington state blocked HHS from terminating grant funding for programs run by affiliates of Planned Parenthood.\n“This is a major victory for the rule of law and evidence-based policymaking, as well as a victory for the young people of Baltimore who need more access to education, not less,” Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh said in a statement.\nHHS did not respond to a request for comment.\nCongress has appropriated about $110 million annually since 2010 for the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which serves 1.2 million young people nationally.\nIn July, however, HHS told recipients of 81 of the five-year grants that it would terminate their agreements two years early, according to the lawsuits. Another three were terminated in September.\nAmong those affected was Healthy Teen Network, a non-profit that was awarded $3.6 million, and the city of Baltimore, which had been awarded $8.75 million.\nTheir lawsuit said the cuts followed the appointment in June of Valerie Huber, who had been an advocate for abstinence-only sex education, as chief of staff for the Office of Assistant Secretary of Health.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:04:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
