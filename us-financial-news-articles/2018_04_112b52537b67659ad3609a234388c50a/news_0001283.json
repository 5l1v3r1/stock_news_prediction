That was up around 42 percent from December 2016. It ended 2017 with $3.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents.\n\"The only way they can get out of it is to do a capital raise,\" said Schlossberg. \"That's the big question: Can they do another capital raise and kind of pull the rabbit out of the hat and go forward?\"\nLast week, Moody's analysts downgraded their credit rating on Tesla to B3 from B2. The firm said the company would need to raise more money and soon to cover its cash flow and expansion plans.\nA large chunk of the market is betting on Tesla's failure, added Schlossberg.\n\"The shorts are feeling like they're just circling like sharks in the water at this point and I think they finally may have nailed the company to the downside,\" he said. Musk is \"facing some very serious problems because debt is absolute. Stock is relative, sales are all relative.\"\nTesla has short interest at 22.6 percent of its float, making it the most shorted stocks on the Nasdaq 100. The Nasdaq 100 has an average 3.5 percent short interest.\nTesla shares have fallen 35 percent since hitting a 52-week high in September. The descent puts Tesla well within bear market territory of a 20 percent drop from its recent highs.\nTesla's technical picture puts Oppenheimer's Ari Wald on the sidelines. Wald, head of technical analysis, told \"Trading Nation\" that Tesla's 200-day moving average has moderated and its recent downside gap makes any solid rebound more challenging. Shares could see a bounce if they reach $240, a March 2017 low, though $280 could prove a level of resistance, he added.\nTesla shares trade around 24 percent below a 200-day moving average of nearly $334. Tesla broke firmly below that key level in mid-March after bumping against it since the beginning of the year. It is on track for a 19 percent drop in 2018, its worst annual decline in its history.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
