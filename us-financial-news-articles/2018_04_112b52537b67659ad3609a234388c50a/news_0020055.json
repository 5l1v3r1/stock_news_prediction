Highlights of those results, including both GAAP and adjusted metrics, are below and incorporated here.\nAdjusted pre-tax income for the March 2018 quarter was $676 million, a $104 million decrease from the March 2017 quarter, as record revenues were offset by higher fuel prices and other increased costs including a $44 million impact from severe winter weather.\n\"The Delta people delivered a strong March quarter, and our record revenue was a direct result of the great service and operational reliability they provided for our customers. It's an honor to recognize their hard work with $183 million toward our 2018 profit sharing,\" said Ed Bastian, Delta's Chief Executive Officer. \"We have confidence in our plan to grow earnings in 2018 through top-line growth, improving our cost trajectory, and leveraging our international partnerships.\"\nRevenue Environment\nDelta's adjusted operating revenue of $9.8 billion for the March quarter improved 8 percent, or $715 million versus the prior year. This revenue result marks a March quarter record for the company, and was driven by improvements across Delta's business, including a 23 percent increase in cargo revenue and a $78 million increase in total loyalty revenue. Delta's Branded Fares initiative drove $421 million in premium upsell revenue in the period, a 23 percent increase from the prior year.\nTotal unit revenues excluding refinery sales (TRASM) increased 5.0 percent during the period, with foreign currency contributing just over 0.5 points of benefit. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth, with all geographic regions delivering positive results.\n\"We are seeing Delta's best revenue momentum since 2014, with positive domestic unit revenues, improvements in all our international entities, strong demand for corporate travel and double-digit increases in our loyalty revenues,\" said Glen Hauenstein, Delta's President. \"With our solid pipeline of commercial initiatives, delivered with industry-leading Delta service, we expect to maintain this momentum and deliver total revenue growth of 4 to 6 percent for the full year.\"\nReve nue 1Q18 ($M)\nIncrease (Decrease)\n1 Q18 versus 1Q17\nC hange Unit\nY oY Revenue Yield Capacity\nDomestic 6,301 6.9 % 2.6 % 3.2 % 4.2 %\nAtlantic 1,059 14.7 % 11.5 % 8.6 % 2.9%\nLatin America 827 4.3 % 5.7 % 5.9 % (1.4)%\nPacific 578 1.7 % 3.9 % 3.4 % (2.0)%\nT otal Passenger 8,765 7.2 % 4.3 % 4.3 % 2.7%\nCa rgo Revenue 202 23.4 %\nOther Revenue, adjusted* 788 12.7 %\nT otal Revenue, adjusted* 9,755 8.0 % 5.0 %\n*Excludes Third Party Refinery Sales\nSee Note A for reconciliation of total unit revenue (TRASM) change\nJune 2018 Quarter Guidance\nFor the June quarter, Delta expects solid top-line growth and an improving cost trajectory will mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices. The company will also benefit from a reduction in its book tax rate.\n2Q18 Forecast\nEarnings per share\n$1.80 - $2.00\nPre-tax margin\n14% - 16%\nFuel price, including taxes and refinery impact\n$2.07 - $2.12\nTotal unit revenue excluding refinery sales (year-over-year)\nUp 3% - 5%\nCASM-Excluding fuel and profit sharing (year-over-year)\nUp 1% - 3%\nSystem capacity (year-over-year)\nUp 3% - 4%\nSee Note A for information about reconciliation of projected non-GAAP financial measures\nCost Performance\nTotal adjusted operating expenses for the March quarter increased $817 million, driven by higher fuel prices, investments in employee wages and profit sharing, and higher depreciation expense.\nAdjusted fuel expense increased $317 million, or 20 percent relative to March quarter 2017, as the year- over-year increase in market fuel prices was tempered by the lapping of prior year hedge losses and improved fuel efficiency. Delta's adjusted fuel price per gallon for the March quarter was $2.01, which includes $0.05 of benefit from the refinery.\nCASM-Ex increased 3.9 percent for the March 2018 quarter compared to the prior year period driven by April 2017 wage increases and accelerated depreciation due to aircraft retirements. Unit costs were further pressured by approximately 1 point from the impact of severe weather and foreign exchange. Delta expects this period will mark the highest non-fuel expense growth for the year.\n\"We expect unit cost growth of 1 to 3 percent in the June quarter, as we lap prior year investments in our people and our business,\" said Paul Jacobson, Delta's Chief Financial Officer. \"As we move through depreciation pressure from our fleet retirements and gain benefits from our upgauging and One Delta initiatives later in the year, we are on track for our 0 to 2 percent full year unit cost target.\"\nAdjusted non-operating expense was flat year-on-year for the March quarter as a $62 million improvement in pension expense was offset by higher interest costs and the seasonality of joint venture partner earnings. The company expects 2018 full-year adjusted non-operating expense to be $200-250 million lower than 2017, due to pension expense savings.\nTax expense declined $117 million for the March quarter, primarily due to the reduction in Delta's book tax rate from 34 percent to 23 percent.\nCash Flow and Shareholder Returns\nDelta generated $1.3 billion of operating cash flow, as the seasonal build of cash was partially offset by the $1.1 billion profit sharing payment to employees and a $500 million voluntary pension contribution in the March quarter, completing funding for the full year. Delta generated $173 million of free cash flow during the quarter, after the investment of $1.2 billion into the business primarily for aircraft purchases and improvements.\nFor the March quarter, Delta returned $542 million to shareholders, comprised of $325 million of share repurchases and $217 million in dividends.\nS trategic Highlights\nIn the March quarter, Delta achieved a number of milestones across its five key strategic pillars.\nCulture and People\nNamed one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired Companies for the fifth consecutive year. Named one of the 2018 Fortune \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" for a second straight year.\nOperational Reliability\nDelivered 52 days of zero mainline cancellations and 19 days of zero system cancellations, up nine days from the March quarter 2017. Achieved mainline on-time performance (A0) of 74.2 percent for the March quarter, up from 73.5 percent in the prior year.\nNetwork and Partnerships\nIncreased efficiency through upgauging strategy with domestic seat capacity increasing 3.4 percent on 0.9 percent higher departures in the March quarter. As part of its re-fleeting, Delta added 43 more Boeing 737-900s and Airbus A321s into service, contributing to the 105 additional AVOD equipped aircraft across the fleet year-over-year. Received final approvals from regulatory authorities for new joint venture partnership with Korean Air, offering one of the most comprehensive route networks in the trans-Pacific market.\nCustomer Experience and Loyalty\nExperienced double-digit growth in co-brand spend, helping drive $85 million of incremental value from Delta's American Express agreement in the March quarter. New card acquisitions set a record for the March quarter, following a record 2017 with over 1 million new card acquisitions. Introduced more seamless check-in experience at 32 Delta Sky Clubs with roll-out of ambassador handheld devices. Delta installed CLEAR check-in technology in 50 Delta Sky Clubs, further streamlining the check-in process for CLEAR members.\nInvestment Grade Balance Sheet\nMade a $500 million voluntary contribution to the pension plan and ended the quarter with an unfunded liability of $6.3 billion, a $642 million reduction from the end of 2017.\nChanges to Accounting Standards\nOn Jan. 1, Delta adopted several new accounting standards, including the new revenue recognition standard which drove 0.5 points of margin and $0.05 per share of pressure in the March quarter. This represents substantially all the margin and earnings impact related to new accounting standards for 2018.\nThe prior periods presented here have been recast to reflect adoption of these new standards. In addition, Delta made the following changes to its income statement:\nDelta is no longer disaggregating passenger revenue by mainline and regional carriers. Ancillary business expenses have been consolidated into a single operating expense line item. Regional carriers fuel expense is now reported within aircraft fuel and related taxes instead of within regional carrier expense.\nM ar ch Quarter Results\nSpecial items for the quarter consist primarily of mark-to-market adjustments on refinery fuel hedges and unrealized gains/losses on investments.\n($ in millions except per share and unit costs)\nGAAP Adjusted\n1 Q18 1Q17 1Q18 1Q17\nPre-tax income 718 849 676 781\nNet income 547 561 523 518\nDiluted earnings per share 0.77 0.77 0.74 0.71\nOperating revenue 9,968 9,101 9,755 9,040\nOperating expense 9,128 8,102 8,942 8,125\nFuel expense 1,856 1,482 1,883 1,566\nAverage fuel price per gallon 1.98 1.62 2.01 1.71\nConsolidated unit cost (CASM/CASM-Ex) 15.35 14.00 11.10 10.67\nNon-operating expense 122 150 137 134\nTotal unit revenues (TRASM/TRASM-Ex) 16.77 15.73 16.41 15.62\nA bout Delta\nDelta Air Lines serves more than 180 million customers each year.

The reasons Delta uses these measures are described below.\nDelta sometimes uses information (\"non-GAAP financial measures\") that is derived from the Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"). Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The tables below show reconciliations of non- GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The prior periods presented here have been recast to reflect the adoption of new accounting standards.\nForward Looking Projections. The company is not able to reconcile certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures because the adjusting items such as those used in the reconciliations below will not be known until the end of the period and could be significant.\nPre-tax Income and Net Income, adjusted. We adjust pre-tax income and net income for mark-to-market (\"MTM\") adjustments and settlements on fuel hedge contracts, the MTM adjustments recorded by our equity method investees, Virgin Atlantic and Aeroméxico, and unrealized gains/losses on our investments in GOL, China Eastern and Air France-KLM, to determine pre-tax income and net income, adjusted:\nMTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. We also record our proportionate share of earnings/loss from our equity investments in Virgin Atlantic and Aeroméxico and the unrealized gain/loss on our investments in GOL, China Eastern and Air France-KLM in non-operating expense. We included the income tax effect of adjustments when presenting net income, adjusted.

We then adjust for MTM adjustments and settlements for the reason described below:\nMTM adjustments and settlements. MTM adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the period. These items adjust fuel expense to show the economic impact of hedging, including cash received or paid on hedge contracts during the period.

We adjust CASM for the following items to determine CASM- Ex for the reasons described below:\nAircraft fuel and related taxes. The volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.\nAncillary businesses and refinery. These expenses include aircraft maintenance and staffing services we provide to third parties, our vacation wholesale operations and refinery cost of sales to third parties. Because these businesses are not related to the generation of a seat mile, we adjust for the costs related to these sales to provide a more meaningful comparison of the costs of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.\nProfit sharing. We adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nChange\nCASM (cents)\n15.35\n14.00\nAdjusted for:\nAircraft fuel and related taxes\n(3.12)\n(2.56)\nAncillary businesses and refinery\n(0.83)\n(0.51)\nProfit sharing\n(0.30)\n(0.26)\nCASM-Ex\n11.10\n10.67\n3.9%\nN on-operating Expense, adjusted .

We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include:\nHedge deferrals. During the March 2016 quarter, we deferred settlement of a portion of our hedge portfolio until 2017 by entering into transactions that, excluding market movements from the date of inception, would provide approximately $300 million in cash receipts during the second half of 2016 and require approximately $300 million in cash payments in 2017. Free cash flow is adjusted to include the impact of these deferral transactions in order to allow investors to understand the net impact of hedging activities in the period shown.\nReimbursements related to build-to-suit facilities and other. Management believes investors should be informed that these reimbursements for build-to-suit leased facilities effectively reduce net cash provided by operating activities and related capital expenditures.\nNet purchases (redemptions) of short-term investments. Net purchases (redemptions) of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust free cash flow for this activity, net, to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow position core to operations.\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ 1,343\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(927)\nAdjustments:\nHedge deferrals\n(19)\nReimbursements related to build-to-suit facilities and other\n76\nNet redemptions of short-term investments\n(300)\nTotal free cash flow\n$ 173\nCa pital Expenditures, net .
