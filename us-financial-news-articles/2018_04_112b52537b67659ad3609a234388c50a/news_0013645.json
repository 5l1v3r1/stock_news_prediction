Syrian regime forces and their allies are denying international monitors access to the Duma area,” the State Department told Reuters, using an alternative spelling for the city.\n“The Duma victims’ symptoms, reported by credible medical professionals and visible in social media photos and video, are consistent with an asphyxiation agent and of a nerve agent of some type,” it said.\nReporting by Lesley Wroughton; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Tim Ahmann\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T21:38:36.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
