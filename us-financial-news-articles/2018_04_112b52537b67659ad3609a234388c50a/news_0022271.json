He said an appeal was planned.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s office for Houston was not immediately available for comment.\nStockman could face up to 20 years in prison for each fraud count when he is sentenced in August, local media reported.\nAccording to a criminal complaint, Stockman and two of his congressional employees diverted money from a charity in Nevada called “Life Without Limits” for his personal and political use, including one payment of $350,000 in 2013.\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas has previously said that from May 2010 to October 2014 Stockman solicited approximately $1.25 million in donations based on false pretenses.\nWhen he was in Congress, staunch conservative Stockman gained notoriety for threatening to seek the impeachment of the then president Barack Obama if he tried to implement gun control regulations through executive action.\nIn 2014, Stockman was trounced in a Republican primary challenge to incumbent U.S. Senator John Cornyn for his seat in the Senate.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Daniel Wallis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T23:45:36.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
