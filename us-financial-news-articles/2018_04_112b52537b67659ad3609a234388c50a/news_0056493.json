The new Ford Focus car is displayed during a media preview at the Auto China 2018 motor show in Beijing, China April 25, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker said it now plans to cut $25.5 billion (£18.29 billion) in costs by 2022, up from a total of $14 billion the company announced to investors last fall.\nFord said it now expects to hit a pretax profit margin of 8 percent globally and 10 percent in North America by 2020, ahead of a previous target of 2022.\nThe company’s stock was up 2.16 percent at $11.35 in after-hours trading.\nResponding to a shift consumer demand in favour of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks, Ford said it planned to trim its North American car portfolio to just two models: the sporty Mustang, which debuted 50 years ago this month and a new compact crossover called Focus Active that will be introduced in 2019.\nFord “will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America,” including the midsize Fusion and full-size Taurus, the company said.\nThe automaker has been under pressure from Wall Street investors to improve its product lineup and lift flagging profit margins. In 2017 the company’s pretax profit fell to $8.4 billion from $10.3 billion.\nIn March, Ford executives unveiled ambitious plans to shift the struggling automaker’s product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and reduce development and manufacturing costs - aimed at boosting profits and the automaker’s share price.\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday as the company reported first-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said “we have looked at every single part of the business.”\n“We are driven to turn this business around.”\nFord reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, with a 7 percent increase in revenue and a lower effective tax rate offset a jump in costs, especially higher commodity prices.\nThe No. 2 U.S. automaker reported a first-quarter net profit of $1.74 billion, or 43 cents per share, up from $1.6 billion, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share of 41 cents.\nDespite the higher profit, Ford’s adjusted pretax profit margin fell to 5.2 percent from 6.4 percent in the same quarter in 2017.\nCFO Shanks said the company expected that commodity costs would represent a $1.5 billion “headwind” in 2018, $500 million of which came in the first quarter.\nThe lion’s share of the automaker’s quarterly profit was driven by high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs in North America. Europe was the only region to turn a profit for Ford.\nThe company’s loss in its Asia-Pacific region was down to a slump in sales in China.\nEarlier this month, Ford unveiled five new models for China, the world’s biggest auto market for 2018, part of a business revitalization effort centred around a plan to launch over 50 new or redesigned vehicles by 2025.
