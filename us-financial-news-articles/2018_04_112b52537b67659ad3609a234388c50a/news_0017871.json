After completion, Renova would be a 48.83 percent shareholder in the company, Sulzer has said. \nSulzer Chief Executive Greg Poux-Guillaume told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview on Wednesday he expected to be “freed” from U.S. sanctions within days. \nThe MSCI however said it was “uncertain at this time whether the company would still be subject to the sanctions following this transaction”. \nWithout clarity by April 16 the Swiss firm would be deleted by the close of April 18, it added. \nSulzer also could be deleted from the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes. \nThe United States last week imposed fresh sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, a number of officials and companies to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity.” \nNone of the 14 firms on the list were existing constituents of the MSCI Russia Indexes, the MSCI said.
