REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch \nSimmering antipathy between the coalition partners - Merkel’s conservatives and the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD) - boiled over at the weekend in a row over law and order, ending any honeymoon period for the awkward allies. \nThe two groups only agreed to team up to prolong their “grand coalition” - in power since 2013 - because they were desperate to avoid fresh elections, after they both haemorrhaged support in last September’s national poll. \nThey have achieved little since taking office last month. Merkel is using the meeting at Schloss Meseberg, her country residence outside Berlin, to try to end the cabinet bickering and launch a flood of reforms before the summer break. \nTransport Minister Andreas Scheuer said ministers made a constructive start to their talks on Tuesday.

Their coalition deal includes a clause that foresees reviewing government progress after two years - giving each the opportunity to leave the alliance if it is not working for them. \nAn Infratest Dimap poll for ARD published on Thursday showed just 32 percent of respondents were happy with the government. \nThe government situation is complicated by a regional election in Bavaria in October, at which Merkel’s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), fears losing its absolute majority if the far right makes gains. \nAiming to see off the rising far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), CSU Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said last month Islam does not belong to Germany - a comment that infuriated the SPD. \nCoalition sources say the art of governing in the coalition will be to find a happy medium between substantive policy work and party political skirmishes that allow the camps to differentiate themselves from each other. \nWith over six months gone since September’s election, Merkel is keenly aware that voters expect the government to address their economic, social and security concerns quickly. In the past, she has used cabinet retreats as team-building exercises. \nNATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker are joining Tuesday’s meeting - a way of Merkel signalling to her cabinet the importance of the biggest European Union country having a stable government.
