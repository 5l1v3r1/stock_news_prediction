When they went to look at one potential site, they were subjected to gunfire and light shelling and withdrew.\nThe fact-finding mission will be unable to depart until it is given a green light for departure by the U.N. security detail, the source said.\nReporting by Anthony Deutsch; Writing by Toby Sterling; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:11:30.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
