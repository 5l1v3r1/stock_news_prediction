The GammaPod is completely noninvasive and could potentially allow our patients to receive a full course of treatment in only one to five fractions.\"\nThe GammaPod uses a first-of-its kind breast cup system that immobilizes the affected breast to minimize motion and provides stereotactic localization for treatment planning. This enables clinicians to precisely target the area to be treated and direct highly conformal doses of radiation that fall off sharply to spare surrounding healthy breast tissue, the heart and lungs. During treatment, the dose is dynamically painted to the target as the patient's breast moves through the point where 25 beams converge to deliver a focal dose of radiation. Additionally, the beams rotate continuously during treatment, which creates thousands of beam angles to improve the uniformity of target coverage.\n\"ASUIUD is a forward-thinking academic medical center and we are excited they share our vision for improving the treatment experience and quality of life for patients,\" said Cedric Yu, DSc, chief executive officer of Xcision. \"With GammaPod, ASUIUD will be the first center in Europe to offer patients a completely noninvasive option for stereotactic partial breast irradiation.\"\nASUIUD will join the GammaPod Research Consortium, which was founded by the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore, to investigate postoperative and preoperative applications for GammaPod. Postoperatively, researchers plan to study how GammaPod may provide new possibilities for safely treating patients in fewer treatment sessions with higher doses to improve patient convenience and satisfaction. Reducing the number of treatment sessions could also help the ASUIUD improve patient throughput and reduce wait times.\nDr. Trovò believes that GammaPod could one day be used as the primary treatment for appropriately selected patients.\n\"The potential to one day treat patients noninvasively with a single dose of radiation that ablates the tumor and avoids surgery could revolutionize our field,\" Trovò said. \"It would reduce the burden of treatment on patients while lowering the costs for our society.\"\nGammaPod has received 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In Europe, GammaPod is for investigational use only and cannot be marketed or put into service until it has been made to comply with the Medical Device Directive (93/42/EEC). In Italy, Tema Sinergie S.p.A. is the exclusive distributor of the GammaPod system.\nAbout Xcision Medical Systems\nXcision Medical Systems, LLC is a medical technology company developing advanced stereotactic radiotherapy solutions with the potential to dramatically raise the quality of treatments and improve the lives of patients and their loved ones.
