REUTERS/Ben Nelms/File Photo The workers, whose collective agreement expired late last year, are asking for more predictable schedules to combat crew fatigue, among other demands, a Teamsters spokesman said by telephone.\nThe union also said in the statement that it opposes cuts and concessions requested by CP, because the company is reporting higher profits and strong fundamentals.\nA spokesman for CP, Canada’s second-largest railroad, could not be immediately reached for comment.\n“We have come to a point where Teamsters are prepared to go on strike for the third time in six years to obtain a fair and reasonable contract renewal,” Doug Finnson, president of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference, said in the statement.\nCP and the union have clashed in recent years, when the railroad’s former CEO, the late Hunter Harrison, cut costs at the Calgary-based company to improve efficiency. Current Chief Executive Keith Creel met with the union last year, striking a more conciliatory tone.\nThe labor unrest comes at a time of tighter rail capacity in Canada, with CP and rival Canadian National Railway ( CNR.TO ) facing strong demand for grain shipments and other commodities.\nThe union said a ratification vote is underway at CN that would guarantee “labor peace for the foreseeable future.”\nReporting By Allison Lampert; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:24:34.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
