REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo Sweden’s Volvo and German competitors Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) are enjoying brisk business as fleet buyers step up purchases during what many analysts expect to be the peak year of the current demand cycle.\nThe flipside of strong demand was higher transport costs and increased spending on staff working overtime to complete orders.\nThe first major European major truck maker to report on the quarter, Volvo raised its guidance for the North American and Indian heavy-duty truck market as well as for construction equipment in nearly all markets.\nOperating profit at the group, which makes trucks, construction equipment, buses and engines, rose to 8.30 billion crowns ($976 million) from 6.83 billion and topped the 8.17 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.\n“The operating profit is better than expected, but if you look for weaknesses the margin is below forecast,” Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said.\n“This should be weighed against an extremely strong order intake, and they also raised their outlook for trucks in North America, and for all construction gear markets save Europe.”\nVolvo shares, which have outpaced both sector and Swedish blue chip indices over the past year with a 17 percent gain, were down 3.9 percent on the day by 0842 GMT.\nSIGNS OF STRAIN Bolstered by a completed 10 billion crown cost-cutting scheme, Volvo has seen its profitability and share price climb over the past year, raising market expectations.\nIts operating margin rose to 9.3 percent from 8.9 percent, but fell shy of the 9.5 percent seen by analysts as rising costs dented profitability in its trucks business.\n“Looking ahead, the strong order intake means that the supply chain constraints and associated higher costs will remain in the near-term,” Chief Executive Martin Lundstedt said in a statement.\nChief Financial Officer Jan Gurander said Volvo was grappling mainly with bottlenecks for powertrains - engines, axles and gearboxes - while the upturn across many manufacturing industries left forged and cast materials in high demand.\nThe high rate of deliveries to meet booming demand also forced it to use more speedy transport, sometimes by air, at a steep cost. Shipment delays yielded additional expenses.\n“We get late incoming materials ... which means that we have to have extra shifts in the weekend to complete trucks, and so on,” he told a news conference.\nThe Gothenburg-based manufacturer said order intake of trucks, which sells under brands Volvo, Mack, Renault and UD Trucks, grew 29 percent, beating the 21 percent rise seen by analysts.\nGEELY DEAL While the demand outlook could hardly be rosier, Volvo’s future ownership and strategy is in greater doubt.\nChinese carmaker Geely’s purchase of shares in Daimler and a yet-to-be closed deal for a stake in AB Volvo has left the rivals facing the unsettling prospect of having the same major owner.\nFor Geely Chairman Li Shufu, whose Zhejiang Geely Holding already owns Swedish automaker Volvo Car Group, the deals seem intended to drive cooperation between companies in which it is an owner, though what it means in practice remains in doubt.\n“Our view is that potential partnerships that fulfill all legal and regulatory requirements, and which are mutually beneficial, should always be discussed,” Li wrote in a rare article published in Swedish and German media this month.\nAB Volvo’s top executive and chairman voiced cautious optimism regarding the likely Geely ownership at the group’s annual shareholders’ meeting this month, but also showed some surprise at the deal to buy activist fund Cevian’s stake.\n($1 = 8.5082 Swedish crowns)\nReporting by Niklas Pollard and Johannes Hellstrom; editing by Jason Neely/Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T13:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:48:47.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
