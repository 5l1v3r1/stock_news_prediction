The agreement brings one of the nation’s most established independent insurance brokerage firms, with more than 450 professionals and 11 offices, to Alliant and expands the firm’s growing national footprint and areas of expertise.\n“Adding a national leader like Crystal & Company to the Alliant team will add a potent combination of forward-thinking people and best-in-class products and services to what is already one of the nation’s most robust insurance platforms,” said Tom Corbett, Chairman and CEO of Alliant. “As two organizations that share a legacy of entrepreneurialism and specialization, we are well-positioned to provide the industry standard for quality and service in both existing and new verticals as we expand our reach.”\nFounded in 1933, New York-based Crystal & Company provides insurance and employee benefits consulting services to a global client base.
