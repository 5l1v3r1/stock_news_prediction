REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nThe first trading day of the second quarter began with a broad selloff concentrated in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors, as losses by Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ), Tesla ( TSLA.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), among others, took center stage from retaliatory trade measures China unveiled on Sunday. \n“It’s more complicated than just a tech selloff. What’s hurting everything is that the S&P went through its 200-day moving average,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. “That attracts momentum sellers and they don’t care what the fundamentals are.” Related Coverage Instant View: Stocks tumble, led by tech pullback and trade fears \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 458.92 points, or 1.9 percent, to 23,644.19 after dipping below its 200-day moving average.

Walmart stock fell 3.8 percent. \nU.S. Treasury yields US10YT=RR fell to two-month lows as investors fled sliding stocks for safety ahead of Friday’s closely watched jobs report. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 4.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.14-to-1 ratio favored decliners. \nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 7.71 billion shares, compared to the 7.29 billion average over the last 20 trading days.
