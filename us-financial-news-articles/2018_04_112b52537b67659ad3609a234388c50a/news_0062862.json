We were able to improve our pricing power due to the popularity of our flagship porcelain ceramic tiles abetted by our strong market presence. Our revenue rose 7.1% for the second half of 2017 from the year-ago period primarily due to an 8.5% rise in our average selling price. In addition, our cash flow was reasonably strong after adjusting for asset write-offs during the year,\" said Mr. Jiadong Huang, Chief Executive Officer of China Ceramics.\n\"For fiscal year 2017, we utilized production facilities capable of producing 31 million square meters of ceramic tiles per year. Consistent with our practices in past quarters, we maintained a reduced utilization of existing plant capacity based on the current market environment to keep our operating costs low. We intend to bring additional capacity online as the business environment improves.\"\n\"For the remainder 2018, we are cautiously optimistic about an improved business environment due to new land sales and continued development activity as well as the government initiative to build rental homes as a means of balancing China's urban residential dynamics. In the long-term, we believe that real estate will continue to be vital to China's economy and essential for domestic growth. We plan to target those cities in China that offer potential for new property development and will continue to forge strong relationships with larger property developers,\" concluded Mr. Huang.\nSix Month Results Ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 485.3 million (US$ 72.7 million), as compared to RMB 453.1 million (US$ 67.1 million) for the same period of 2016. The 7.1% year-to-year increase in revenue was due to (i) the 8.5% increase in our average selling price to RMB 27.2 (US$ 4.0) for the second six months of 2017 from RMB 25.1 (US $3.8) for the same period of 2016, which was partially offset by (ii) the 1.2% decrease in the sales volume of ceramic tiles 17.9 million square meters for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 18.1 million square meters for the same period of 2016.\nGross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 57.8 million (US$ 8.7 million), as compared to a gross loss of RMB 80.3 million (US$ 11.9 million) for the same period of 2016. The gross profit margin was 11.9% as compared to a 17.7% gross loss margin for the same period of 2016, where the latter period's gross loss margin was due to (i) a significant decrease in the average selling price due to price cuts to spur sales of slow-moving inventory, and (ii) a RMB 59.4 million (US$ 8.9 million) write-off of inventory.\nOther income for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 7.3 million ($1.1 million), as compared to RMB 7.0 million ($1.0 million) for the same period of 2016. Other income is primarily comprised of rental income that the Company received by leasing out one of its production lines from its Hengdali facility pursuant to an eight-year lease contract.\nSelling expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB 6.1 million (US$ 0.9 million), as compared to RMB 5.8 million (US$ 0.8 million) for the same period of 2016. The decrease in selling expense was mainly due to a decrease in adverting and travel expenses.\nAdministrative expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB 79.8 million (US$ 12.0 million), as compared to RMB 35.0 million (US$ 5.2 million) the same period of fiscal 2016. The increase in administrative expenses was primarily due to the write-off of bad debt due to uncollectible debt associated with our vendors.\nLoss from asset devaluation resulting from an impairment of non-current assets (fixed assets and land use rights) for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 36.7 million (US$ 5.5 million) as compared to RMB 230.4 million (US$ 34.3 million) for the same period of 2016. The loss from asset devaluation resulted from an impairment of non-current assets due to decelerating growth in China and an expected contraction in the demand for the Company's products.\nOther expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB 3.6 million (US$ 0.5 million), as compared to RMB 6.9 million (US$ 1.0 million) for the same period of 2016. The reduction in other expenses is attributable to a decreased loss on the disposal of fixed assets.\nNet loss for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 82.2 million (US$ 12.4 million), as compared to a net loss of RMB 351.3 million (US$ 52.4 million) for the same period of 2016. The decrease in net loss was mainly due to increased gross profit and a lower loss from asset devaluation for the six months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period of 2016.\nLoss per basic share and fully diluted share for the six months ended December 31, 2017 were RMB 24.29 (US$ 3.66), as compared to loss per basic and fully diluted share of RMB 127.47 (US$ 18.99) for the same period of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for year ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 821.8 million (US$ 121.7 million), as compared to RMB 793.7 million (US$ 118.3 million) for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit was RMB 50.4 million (US$ 7.5 million), as compared to gross loss of RMB 30.1 million (US$ 4.5 million) for the same period of 2016. The gross profit margin was a 6.1% as compared to a negative 3.8% gross loss margin for the for the same period of 2016. Other income was RMB 14.34 million (US$ 2.1 million), as compared to RMB 15.2 million (US$ 2.3 million) for the same period of 2016. Selling expenses were RMB 12.0 million (US$ 1.8 million), as compared to RMB 12.8 million (US$ 1.9 million) for the same period of 2016. Administrative expenses were RMB 88.8 million (US$ 13.2 million), as compared to RMB 46.7 million (US$ 7.0 million) for the same period of 2016. Loss from asset devaluation resulting from an impairment of non-current assets was RMB 36.7 million (US$ 5.4 million) as compared to RMB 230.4 million (US$ 34.3 million) for the same period of 2016. Other expenses were RMB 5.24 million (US$ 0.8 million), as compared to RMB 11.4 million (US$ 1.7 million) in the same period of 2016. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was RMB 88.0 million (US$ 13.0 million), as compared to a net loss of RMB 321.8 million (US$ 48.0 million) for the same period of 2016. Loss per share on a basic and fully diluted basis were RMB 26.36 (US$ 3.90) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to basic and fully diluted earnings per share of RMB 116.51 (US$ 17.36), in the same period of 2016 (as adjusted for the one for eight reverse stock split in June 2016.\nStatements of Selected Financial Position Items for Fiscal Year End 2017\nCash and bank balances were RMB 2.3 million (US$ 0.4 million) as of December 31, 2017, compared with RMB 0.1 million (US$ 0.01 million) as of December 31, 2016. Inventory turnover was 95 days as of December 31, 2017, as compared to 108 days as of December 31, 2016. We had a reversal of inventory impairment of RMB 2.73 million in 2017 as a result of an improved inventory turnover rate due to increased sales. Subsequent to the RMB 75.1 million of inventory that was impaired for the year ended December 31, 2016, we believe that the value of our current inventories is realizable. Trade receivables turnover, net of value added tax, was 206 days as of December 31, 2017, as compared with 209 days as of December 31, 2016, a slight decrease. This high trade receivables turnover days was primarily due to a continued difficult economic environment which has prompted us to offer extended credit terms to certain customers resulting in a higher trade receivables turnover figure than normal. Trade payables turnover, net of value added tax, was 32 days as of December 31, 2017 compared with 51 days as of December 31, 2016. The average turnover days was within the normal credit period of one to four months granted by our suppliers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash flow used in operating activities was RMB 3.6 million (US$ 0.5 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to cash used in operating activities of RMB 4.6 million (US$ 0.7 million) for the same period of 2016.\nCash flow used in investing activities was RMB 0.6 million (US$ 9,000) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to cash flow generated from investing activities of RMB 1.0 million (US$ 0.2 million) mainly due to the sale of fixed assets of RMB 1.07 million for the same period of 2016.\nCash flow generated from financing activities was RMB 5.6 million (US$ 0.8 million) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to cash flow used in financing activities of RMB 1.0 million (US$ 0.2 million) primarily due to the repayment of short-term loans for the same period of 2016.\nPlant Capacity and Capital Expenditures Update\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, we utilized plant capacity capable of producing 31 million square meters of ceramic tiles annually out of a total effective annual production capacity of 66 million square meters. Our Hengda facility now has an annual production capacity of 37 million square meters of ceramic tiles as a result of two old furnaces having been put out of use in the facility; the Company utilized production capacity capable of producing 9.6 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 18.2 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the entire fiscal year 2017. Our Hengdali facility has an annual production capacity of 29 million square meters (not including the leasing out of 10 million square meters of production capacity to a third party) and we utilized production capacity capable of producing 7.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and 12.7 million square meters of ceramic tiles for the entire fiscal year 2017. Our annual production capacity has been effectively reduced from 72 million square meters of ceramic tiles to 66 million square meters of ceramic tiles due to an eight-year contract to lease out one of the production lines from our Hengdali facility that we entered into in March 2016. We will bring our unused production capacity online as customer demand dictates and when there are signs of improvement in China's real estate and construction sector.\nWe incurred RMB 5.6 million (US$ 0.9 million) in capital expenditure attributable to the purchase of manufacturing and production equipment (a kiln for RMB $4.9 million and a desulfurization tower for RMB 0.7 million) for the year ended December 31, 2017. We review the level of capital expenditures throughout the year and make adjustments subject to market conditions. Although business conditions are subject to change, given the currently challenging market conditions we anticipate a low level of capital expenditures for 2018 other than those associated with minimal upgrades, small repairs and the maintenance of equipment.\nBusiness Outlook\nIn fiscal 2017, we increased the pricing of our ceramic tile products by 10% each in April and July, respectively. This followed a 20% reduction in the prices of our slow-moving products beginning on October 1, 2016, that was instituted in an effort to convert some of our inventory into cash. Our renewed pricing strength in fiscal 2017 was generally accepted by the marketplace as our fiscal 2017 sales volume increased 10.6% from fiscal 2016.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of 2018, we expect conditions to slowly improve with a potential expansion in residential land supply, which will ultimately result in real estate development, especially in certain Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. In addition, the Chinese Government began a program to increase the development of rental homes, affordable housing and housing co-owned by individuals and the state to help stem real estate speculation. There have also been efforts to develop rural land into rental housing which could help to address housing shortages and stabilize price increases in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. These initiatives could lead to additional real estate development and help to offset inventory declines in certain regions. In addition, local governments have begun to go forward with construction projects which has resulted in property investment growth. In the long-term, we believe that the real estate sector continues to be vital to sustaining China's strong economic growth since it is an important component of China's GDP.\nWe typically receive orders from customers two months in advance of production on a rolling basis. We enter into dealership agreements with customers, and a sales or purchase contract each time a customer places an order. As of December 31, 2017, our backlog was approximately RMB 70.7 million (US$ 10.8 million), which represents approximately the next two months of revenue. This as compares to a backlog of approximately RMB 61.4 million (US$ 8.9 million) as of December 31, 2016, a year-over-year increase of 15.1%. Under normal circumstances, our backlog is an indicator of revenues that might be expected in the next quarter, though it is subject to change due to unforeseen business conditions and events including credit payment terms.\nWe operate as efficiently as possible, keeping our inventory levels manageable, and we manufacture ceramic tiles consistent with expected sales. We believe that our building materials sector continues to have excess production capacity and that consolidation will continue to occur. Competitive pressures over the last three years has led to a contraction in our sector as many smaller firms who lack our advanced manufacturing capabilities, ability to conform to environmental standards and deep product platform have exited the space.\nWe view the growth of the real estate sector and our building materials sector as sustainable since China's urbanization, where the population continues to shift from rural to urban areas, serves as its foundation. In addition, urbanization is expected to lead to a more consumption-driven economy, a key objective of government policy. We have refocused our efforts to where we see active real estate development and where property developers use our products as part of their finished home products. We believe we have a competitive advantage in our sector due to our comprehensive product platform, customization capabilities, marketing expertise and strong reputation. Our goal for the year ahead is to continue to strategically penetrate regions with sound fundamentals and generate sustainable sales volume consistent with current real estate development trends.\nEvent Occurring After Fiscal Year 2017\nOn April 19, 2018, we sold an aggregate of 770,299 common shares to certain individual investors in a registered direct offering (the \"Offering\") at a price of US $1.56 per share, the closing price of the Company's common shares on the same date.

For more detail on these measures and reconciliation of such measure to the most comparable IFRS financial measures, please refer to page 12 of this release.\nFINANCIAL TABLES\nCHINA CERAMICS CO., LTD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs of December 31,\n2017\n2016\nUSD'000\nRMB'000\nRMB'000\nASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nNONCURRENT ASSETS\nProperty and equipment, net\n13,363\n87,316\n130,542\nInvestment property, net\n764\n4,994\n6,791\nLand use rights, net\n668\n4,364\n5,920\nGoodwill\n-\n-\n-\nDeferred tax assets\n32\n209\n4,765\nLong-term prepaid expense\n-\n-\n1,494\nTotal noncurrent assets\n14,827\n96,883\n149,512\nCURRENT ASSETS\nInventories, net\n29,334\n191,667\n212,742\nTrade receivables, net\n81,473\n532,361\n553,542\nOther receivables and prepayments\n329\n2,152\n8,854\nIncome tax refundable\n4\n27\n6,521\nCash and bank balances\n356\n2,328\n110\nTotal current assets\n111,496\n728,535\n781,769\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nTrade payables\n9,348\n61,084\n84,257\nAccrued liabilities and other payables\n4,549\n29,719\n37,640\nAmounts owned to related parties\n5,512\n36,017\n35,626\nIncome tax payable\n591\n3,862\n1,309\nTotal current liabilities\n20,000\n130,682\n158,832\nNET CURRENT ASSETS\n91,496\n597,853\n622,937\nNET ASSETS\n106,323\n694,736\n772,449\nEQUITY\nShare capital\n32\n206\n151\nReserves\n106,291\n694,530\n772,298\nTotal stockholders' equity\n106,323\n694,736\n772,449\nCHINA CERAMICS CO., LTD AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\n(Unaudited)\nSix months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nUSD'000\nRMB'000\nRMB'000\nNet sales\n73,128\n485,342\n453,116\nCost of goods sold\n64,425\n427,579\n533,461\nGross profit (loss)\n8,703\n57,763\n(80,345)\nOther income\n1,098\n7,284\n7,031\nSelling and distribution expenses\n(923)\n(6,127)\n(5,798)\nAdministrative expenses\n(12,023)\n(79,797)\n(34,937)\nFinance costs\n1\n4\n651\nLoss from asset devaluation\n(5,528)\n(36,683)\n(230,359)\nOther expenses\n(546)\n(3,624)\n(6,943)\nLoss before taxation\n(9,218)\n(61,180)\n(350,700)\nIncome tax (expense) credit\n(3,167)\n(21,017)\n(597)\nLoss attributable to shareholders\n(12,385)\n(82,197)\n(351,297)\nLoss per share\nBasic (RMB)\n(3.66)\n(24.29)\n(127.47)\nDiluted (RMB)\n(3.66)\n(24.29)\n(127.47)\nCHINA CERAMICS CO., LTD.

Such non-GAAP financial measures are offered to supplement the Company's audited financial statements, this earnings release and the accompanying tables and include EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nEBITDA is calculated as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA less loss from asset devaluation, inventory write-down and bad debt expense. Both are measures of the Company's operating performance.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing its financial results and believes they are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's ongoing operational performance. In addition, the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with other methods for assessing China Ceramics' operating results in a manner that is focused on the performance of its ongoing operations. Readers are cautioned not to view non-GAAP financial measures on a stand-alone basis or as a substitute for results under IFRS, or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies, and should refer to the unaudited reconciliation presented below. The Company has provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure below as adjusted for the periods indicated:\nCHINA CERAMICS CO., LTD.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP: Net Income to EBITDA (1)\nSix months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\n(all figures in 000's)\n2017\n2016\nRMB\nUSD\nRMB\nUSD\nNet loss\n(82,197)\n(12,385)\n(351,297)\n(52,421)\nInterest expense\n4\n1\n(702)\n(109)\nInterest income\n(32)\n(5)\n(37)\n3\nIncome tax expense\n21,017\n3,167\n5,533\n814\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n7,245\n1,092\n22,374\n3,292\nEBITDA\n(53,963)\n(8,130)\n(324,129)\n(48,421)\nLoss from asset devaluation (2)\n36,683\n5,527\n230,359\n34,124\nInventory write-down (3)\n(2,733)\n(412)\n75,078\n11,259\nBad debt expense (4)\n71,565\n10,783\n23,940\n3,546\nAdjusted EBITDA\n51,552\n7,768\n5,248\n508\n(1) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(2) Non-cash write-down of fixed assets and land use rights for the second six months of fiscal 2017; non-cash write down of fixed assets for the second six months of fiscal 2016\n(3) Non-cash inventory write-down\n(4) Non-cash write-off of bad debt expense\nCHINA CERAMICS CO., LTD.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP: Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA (1)\nYears ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\n(all figures in 000's)\n2017\n2016\nRMB\nUSD\nRMB\nUSD\nNet loss\n(88,026)\n(13,038)\n(321,802)\n(47,957)\nInterest expense\n213\n32\n84\n13\nInterest income\n(32)\n(5)\n(1,791)\n(269)\nIncome tax expense\n9,741\n1,443\n5,581\n832\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n15,514\n2,298\n44,951\n6,740\nEBITDA\n(62,590)\n(9,270)\n(272,977)\n(40,641)\nLoss from asset devaluation (2)\n36,683\n5,433\n230,359\n34,329\nInventory write-down (reversal) (3)\n(2,733)\n(405)\n75,078\n11,259\nBad debt expense (4)\n71,565\n10,599\n23,940\n3,491\nAdjusted EBITDA\n42,925\n6,357\n56,400\n8,438\n(1) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(2) Non-cash write-down of fixed assets and land use rights in fiscal 2017; non-cash write down of fixed assets in fiscal 2016\n(3) Non-cash inventory write-down\n(4) Non-cash write-off of bad debt expense\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-ceramics-announces-second-half-and-full-year-financial-results-for-fiscal-2017-300638622.html\nSOURCE China Ceramics Co., Ltd.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-ceramics-announces-second-half-and-full-year-financial-results-for-fiscal-2017-300638622.html", "http://www.cceramics.com/", "http://www.federalreserve.gov/"], "published": "2018-04-30T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T17:58:22.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
