A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, who announced on Monday an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/Files\nThe company said it now expects revenue of $4.975 billion to $5.025 billion. It had previously forecast net revenue of $5 billion, plus or minus $75 million.\nThe narrowed forecast comes in largely below analysts’ estimates of $5.015 billion.\nSeveral other Apple suppliers such as contract chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, Corning Inc and AMS have also pointed to soft demand from smartphone customers.\nAnalysts have attributed the softness to weaker-than-anticipated demand for Apple’s iPhone X.\n“Looking ahead to our third fiscal quarter, we expect continued strength in demand from datacenters while wireless remains weak,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said in a statement.\nThird quarter net revenue is expected to be in the range of $5.05 billion, plus or minus $75 million. Analysts on average expect net revenue of $5.23 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nShares of the company were down 0.7 percent at $231.23 in premarket trading.
