This year looks to be OK, but if this kind of trade war stuff does escalate, that could put a dampener on things,” Khalaf added.\nWorries over global trade and a tumble in U.S. heavyweight tech stocks have hit risk assets such as equities so far this year, while a spate of profit warnings and Brexit-related uncertainties have dented appetite for British stocks.\nThe FTSE 100 slid in line with the broader European market, with financials, industrials and health stocks shaving the most points off the index.\nA rise in the pound also put pressure on large, overseas-earning stocks.\nMining stocks were a bright spot as solid manufacturing data from China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, boosted the price of copper to a one-week high.\nShares in Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto all rose between 0.3 and 0.7 percent.\nThe FTSE’s muted start to the second quarter follows its worst first quarter since 2011, while March saw its third straight month of declines.
