China rejects the charge.\nChina’s media, which is strictly controlled by the government, has come out in defence of the country, painting the country as a victim of an overly aggressive United States bent on taking illegitimate unilateral action.\n“The White House has completely lost its sense of reality!,” said the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper in a Friday commentary, alleging the United States is acting unilaterally and engaging in trade protectionism.\nMeanwhile, the nationalist Global Times said in an editorial published late on Thursday that the “Chinese are aware that the only option now is to hit the U.S. hard enough so that it will remember the pain.”\nReporting by Engen Tham Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T06:43:15.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
