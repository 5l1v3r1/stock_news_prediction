Therefore Magyar Nemzet and its online version mno.hu will close,” the publisher said in on its website.\nThe timing of the announcement, two days after Orban won a two-thirds majority for the third time with the ability to amend the constitution to entrench his power, suggests the newspaper’s closure had political dimensions.\n“Simicska dedicated his past year to revenge (against Orban), and his media portfolio was a conduit for that,” Policy Solutions analyst Tamas Boros said. “Now that he sees Orban with another two-thirds majority, it was no longer worth his while.”\n“He sees the results, anticipates government revenge, and is shutting down unprofitable media organisations.”\nMagyar Nemzet publisher’s will also close Lanchid Radio, a sister radio station, at midnight on Tuesday and seek buyers for other Simicska group outlets.\nOrban has become the central European country’s dominant leader by projecting himself as a saviour of its Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, an image which resonated with more than 2.5 million voters on Sunday.\nOrban’s Fidesz party, in power since 2010, has turned public broadcasters into obedient mouthpieces, his closest allies have bought big stakes in privately owned media and advertising has been channelled to heavily benefit government-friendly outlets.\nBusinessmen close to the premier purchased then-shuttered Nepszabadsag, the country’s top opposition newspaper, in 2016. They also bought up nearly all regional dailies and acquired dozens of radio licenses covering the entire country.\nThe only remaining independent publications with widespread reach are the RTL television group owned by Germany’s Bertelsmann and the news website Index.hu, where a close Simicska associate sits on the board of the foundation that owns the company.\nThe other independent national newspaper, Nepszava, is owned by ex-Socialist Party treasurer Laszlo Puch via an Austrian company, but has far less readership than Index.\nReporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T15:05:58.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
