The general government primary balance has a different methodology in calculating categories of revenue and spending from that outlined in the bailout programme. \nAthens exceeded its bailout target in 2016 when it announced a primary surplus of 4.19 percent versus a target of 0.5 percent. The primary balance does not include interest payments on debt — which in Greece’s case represents about 178 percent of its GDP. \nGreece has received 260 billion euros in financial aid from euro zone countries and the IMF since 2010. Its third bailout, brokered as the country teetered on the verge of bankruptcy in 2015, is worth up to 86 billion euros and is scheduled to expire in August.
