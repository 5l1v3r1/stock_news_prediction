I was between two cars heading into turn three and I was just slowly and progressively squeezed between the two cars, as I was in the middle,” Sirotkin said.\n“At a point I saw I was not going to avoid a crash so I just lifted, hoping they would squeeze me but not hit me that much, but then already there was nothing I could do,” he added in a team statement.\n“We touched, my car jumped and when I landed, I broke my front suspension and my wing.” (Reporting Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T21:24:22.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
