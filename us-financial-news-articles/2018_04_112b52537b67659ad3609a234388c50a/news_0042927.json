Inspectors had been trying to reach Douma for several days but were delayed after an advance security detail was fired upon on April 17.\nThe OPCW team will attempt to determine whether chemical weapons were used and if so, which. It is not mandated to conclude which side in the conflict used them.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Reporting by Toby Sterling; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T18:46:29.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
