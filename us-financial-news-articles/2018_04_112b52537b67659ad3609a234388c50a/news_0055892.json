The factory will be located near an existing facility the company has in Perrysburg.\nStrong domestic demand for solar energy and changes in U.S. tax policies underpinned the decision, said First Solar’s senior vice president of global manufacturing, Mike Koralewski.\nLast week, First Solar rival SunPower Corp said it would buy a U.S. domestic panel maker, as it sought to dodge the impact of 30 percent tariffs imposed on imported solar panels by the administration of President Donald Trump..\nFirst Solar benefits from having a technology that is not subject to tariffs. Its panels are made from cadmium telluride, while the tariffs apply only to traditional silicon solar products.\nAs a result, solar project developers have increasingly sought out First Solar’s tariff-free panels, and in February the company said it would restart some production at its Ohio factory that was stopped late last year and hire new employees to run those lines.\nThe new factory will produce First Solar’s next-generation Series 6 solar panel technology.\nIn a statement provided by First Solar, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the company’s domestic expansion was “exactly the result we had hoped for.”\nTempe, Arizona-based First Solar is one of the world’s largest solar energy companies. Most of its manufacturing is done in Malaysia.\nThe Ohio expansion will triple the company’s domestic capacity. Construction will begin later this year and is contingent on state and local incentive packages, First Solar said.
