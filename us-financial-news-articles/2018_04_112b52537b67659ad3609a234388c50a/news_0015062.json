As the key science and technology forces in the industry, they are not only technologically experienced in JAVA, C++, irreversible algorithms, asymmetric encryption algorithms, Merkle trees, CAP theory and others, but also in project development and management.\nAs we all know, talents are extremely scarce and highly sought-after for the rapidly developing BlockChain. The three big architects joined Light, which inflects the uniqueness of LightChain projects itself and thus is great of potential and significance for development.\nJust as Leo Chen, the Chief Architect said when joining the Light: \"The LightChain is an exciting project. In my opinion, its first double-chain technology is not only a great creation but also a breakthrough development of BlockChain technology, which fills the gap between the real world and the parallel world and makes it possible for large-scale application of LightChain.\"\nIt is known that the LightChain is different from all the BlockChain technologies on the market, and the Light pioneers the double-chain technology composed of parent chain and child chain. This pioneering technology is created by a research and development group made up of more than 40 BlockChain experts and engineers through 3-year intensive research and hard works and is of epoch-making significance. It gives a revolutionary solution in view of the weakness of the existing BlockChain technologies and also gives a solid technical foundation to the large-scale application of BlockChain Technologies in realistic scenarios.\nThe LightChain does not only reserve the core decentralized characteristics of the BlockChain, but also further improves the transaction speed and guarantees security, which accordingly makes it greatly possible for the pilot application of LightChain in finance, insurance and other industries. It can thus be seen that the emergence of optical chains is expected to create a \"value Internet\" and promotes the entire economic system to achieve technological change, organizational change and efficiency change.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-former-chief-architect-of-microsoft-corp-joins-the-light-and-the-chief-scientist-is-optimistic-about-the-development-of-light-300625952.html\nSOURCE LightChain Corporation", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-former-chief-architect-of-microsoft-corp-joins-the-light-and-the-chief-scientist-is-optimistic-about-the-development-of-light-300625952.html"], "published": "2018-04-07T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T10:54:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
