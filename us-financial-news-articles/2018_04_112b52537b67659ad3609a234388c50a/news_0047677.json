SEMrush, an analytics and software company founded in Russia in 2008, has raised $40 million to expand its operations, according to Eugene Levin, chief strategy officer at SEMrush.\nThe funding round, the firm’s first, was co-led by venture-capital firms Greycroft, e.ventures and Siguler Guff.\nSEMrush helps marketers and publishers optimize their websites for discovery by consumers using popular search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo . The company charges a base fee of $99.95 for freelancers and in-house marketers and has additional pricing tiers for optional features.\nThe company’s customers include Ebay, Quora, Booking.com, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and BNP Paribas.\nThe investment in SEMrush comes as search is becoming increasingly important to marketers and publishers alike. Google now accounts for more than 50% of referral traffic sent to digital publishers, according to the web analytics firm Parse.ly , compared to 27% from the second-biggest referrer, Facebook. Together, Google and Facebook control about 56% of the U.S. digital ad market, according to eMarketer ; competitors like Amazon and Snap, Inc. each have less than 5% of the market.\nSearch-engine optimization firms like SEMrush are in some ways engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse with Google, helping marketers navigate the company’s shifting algorithm for ranking links. Because the rules of search marketing are constantly in flux, the company’s services are perpetually in demand, said Dylan Pearce, a partner at Greycroft who leads the firm’s growth-stage technology and internet investments.\n“When there is a shift in the Google algorithm, the traffic to SEMrush spikes,” Mr. Pearce said. “Because people are going to SEMrush to help them understand what the algorithm change means.”\nSEMrush has revenues between $50 million and $100 million, Mr. Levin said. The company now has nearly 500 employees in Russia, the United States, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Cyprus, he said.\nSEMrush plans to use some of the financing to expand beyond U.S.-based search engines and onto platforms owned by Amazon.com and the Chinese internet company Baidu. SEMrush also plans to buy companies that produce software it can include in its platform and purchase search data from emerging markets to make its platform more effective to marketers in those countries.\nOne potential area of interest for acquisitions is software firms that help public relations firms work with news organizations better, Mr. Levin said. Companies can increase their ranking in Google’s search results by getting links in articles published by authoritative publications.\n“In some cases, links from specifics news portals are more valuable than the traffic and brand recognition that you are going to get from content you create,” Mr. Levin said.", "external_links": ["https://www.parse.ly/resources/data-studies/referrer-dashboard/?mod=article_inline"], "published": "2018-04-24T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T05:07:05.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
