REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo Kering is also preparing to spin off German sportswear brand Puma ( PUMG.DE ), which will leave it with brands ranging from Gucci to Yves Saint Laurent.\nIt acquired Volcom in 2011 for $608 million.\n“In accordance with Kering’s strategy to fully dedicate itself to the development of its luxury houses, Volcom no longer constitutes a core asset and Kering has initiated a disposal process,” the group said in a statement.\nIn a separate move, Kering and fashion label Stella McCartney said last week they had agreed to end their 17-year partnership and the British designer behind the brand would buy out Kering’s 50 percent stake.\nReporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:37:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
