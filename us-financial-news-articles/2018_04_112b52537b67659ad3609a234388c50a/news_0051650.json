Since 2012 he was based in Hong Kong, leading the Asia Pacific natural resources coverage team.\nSatchwell has been with Barclays since joining in London in 2005 and held leadership roles across the Australian financing and risk management businesses. He has also handled responsibility for the broader Asian acquisition and leverage finance teams and industry and advisory teams in Australia. He was most recently part of the Europe and Middle East leveraged finance team in London.\nSatchwell had helped wind down the Australian operations in 2016 as part of the British lender’s retreat from investment banking in at least eight countries in Asia.\nFollowing the exit in 2016, Barclays had continued to do deals in Australia but covered the country from Singapore. It has been particularly active in acquisition-related and term loan B financings for the likes of Ventia, the infrastructure services spin-off from Leighton Holdings, and US data management firm Iron Mountain.
