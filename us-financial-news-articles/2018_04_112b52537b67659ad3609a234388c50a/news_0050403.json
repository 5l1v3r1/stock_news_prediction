The group makes imaging and proximity sensor products used in the iPhone X, according to analysts.\nST declines to identify its customer.\n“For the second half of the year, we see healthy demand, with a strong backlog across all our product groups, end markets, including smartphones,” said chief executive Carlo Bozotti in a written statement on Wednesday.\nFirst-quarter results were in line with market expectations.\nThe group’s quarterly net revenues rose 22 percent to $2.23 billion from a year earlier but fell from the last quarter of 2017 due to a seasonal smartphone dip.\nGross margin rose to 39.9 percent from 37.7 percent.\nThe Geneva-based group said it expected second-quarter revenues to increase by about 1.5 percent, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, from the previous quarter.\nThe mid-point target for gross margin is 40 percent for the second quarter.\nReporting by Mathieu Rosemain; Editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T10:41:24.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
