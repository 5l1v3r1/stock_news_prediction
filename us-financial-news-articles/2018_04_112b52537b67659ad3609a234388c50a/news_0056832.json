But he is likely to steer clear of commentary about future policy moves, keeping the bank’s options open in case the outlook continues to soften.\nThe ECB’s rate decision is due at 1145 GMT, followed by Draghi’s news conference at 1230 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters expect bond purchases to end this year after a short taper and see the first rate hike since 2011 sometime in the second quarter of 2019.\nTRADE WAR? With the bond-buying scheme due to expire in September, the ECB will have to decide in June or July whether to extend purchases or wind them down. But with the risk of a global trade war still looming, it may not decide until absolutely necessary, so retaining the flexibility to adjust policy.\n“The elephant in the room is, of course, the risk of protectionism stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump that is weighing on euro zone businesses,” Berenberg economist Florian Hense said.\nBusiness sentiment has already taken a hit, particularly in export-focused Germany, and a full-fledged trade war could quickly impact growth — a risk already highlighted by policymakers at the ECB’s March meeting.\nA key worry is that protectionist rhetoric from the United States could push down the value of the dollar, an economic anomaly as the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates several times this year, natural support for the U.S. currency.\nA stronger euro would cap inflation, a headache for the ECB as price growth is set to miss its near 2 percent target, the central bank’s sole policy objective, for years to come.\nEuro zone inflation is so weak that even after the creation of 9 million jobs since early 2013, measures of underlying price growth that strip out energy and food are barely rising.\nThis suggests that the euro zone’s economic downturn was more severe than earlier thought and makes the recovery even more protracted.\nThe impact of the euro’s strength has been relatively limited so far, however. The currency is up 1.5 percent against the dollar this year and just 0.3 percent higher on a trade-weighted basis.\nEven if the currency impact were to bite, the ECB has little scope to extend purchases much longer, suggesting it will take an extremely cautious approach to normalising policy, even if it risks erring on the side of caution and moving too late.\n“That any shift is likely to be incremental isn’t new,” Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. “What’s new is that there’s the risk that it turns out to be even more incremental than currently envisaged.”\n$1 = 0.8214 euros Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:48:32.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
