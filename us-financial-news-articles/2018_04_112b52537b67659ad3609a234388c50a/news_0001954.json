Many central banks, including the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, adopted negative rates to combat deflation and low growth. \nSun’s comments mark the first time a policy maker from a major central bank has proposed that negative interest rates should be used as a conventional monetary policy tool to fight recessions. \n“If the interest rate pass-through to deposit markets is complete, the negative interest rate policy (becomes) very effective in boosting credit growth and inflation,” Sun said. \nFurthermore, central banks should promote digital currency to strengthen the effectiveness of negative interest rate policies, he added, contending that it will eventually solve the problem of higher costs of holding paper currency compared with costs of bank deposits.
