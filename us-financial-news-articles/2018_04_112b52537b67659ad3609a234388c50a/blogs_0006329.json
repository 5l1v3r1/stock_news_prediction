The New York Times' stock rallied about 90 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's roughly 22 percent gain since Trump's critical tweet on Nov. 13, 2016. Joshua Roberts | Reuters Donald Trump \nIn the past week President Donald Trump has criticized Amazon five times over tax issues and CEO Jeff Bezos' ownership of the Washington Post , sparking a decline of more than 8 percent in the company's shares since the first tweet over three trading sessions. \nBut many of the companies Trump criticized on social media since his election victory thrived following his negative tweets. \nFor example Trump repeatedly attacked The New York Times including a tweet on Nov. 13. 2016. The media company's shares rallied about 90 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's approximate 22 percent gain in same time period due to its strong earnings and digital subscription growth . Defense companies have come under Trump's fire.\nThe president went after Boeing for its Air Force One price tag on Dec. 6, 2016. Boeing shares are up more than 110 percent since the post versus the S&P 500's approximate 20 percent gain. The White House reached a new deal with the company for two new Air Force One planes in February.\nLockheed Martin was also criticized by Trump for its F-35 \"cost overruns\" on Dec. 22, 2016. Tweet Link \nIts shares rallied about 35 percent through Wednesday versus the S&P 500's approximate 17 percent gain since the tweet. \nTo be sure, much of the gains for Boeing and Lockheed came after meetings Trump had with the chief executives of both companies to discuss his criticism. \nThe two stocks also benefited from Trump's budget, which increased defense spending by nearly $80 billion. \nAnd not every company rallies after a Trump critique. Merck suffered after the president blasted the drug maker for its prices on Aug. 14, 2017 \nMerck shares declined about 13 percent versus the market's 7 percent gain since the post. \nBut overall it seems Trump's attacks aren't materially affecting stock prices over the long run. \nTrump may take more direct regulatory actions against Amazon. But using history as a guide, investors in the e-commerce giant shouldn't be too concerned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T23:12:11.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
