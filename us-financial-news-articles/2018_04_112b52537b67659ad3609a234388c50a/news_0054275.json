BoCom and BoC saw narrowing or steady margins.\n“Looking ahead into 2018, we can see that the measures taken to reduce risk are also reducing the problem of idle funds in banks,” Jimmy Leung, the China financial services leader at PwC, said in an April statement.\n“At the same time, new regulations will push up compliance costs and rising interest rates will affect the cost of capital,” he added.\nReporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai, Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller in Beijing; Editing by Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T14:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:56:41.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
