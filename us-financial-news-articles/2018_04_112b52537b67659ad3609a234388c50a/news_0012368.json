A series of constitutional changes favor his party: Fidesz helped draw the voting districts and eliminated runoffs, giving the party an edge over its fractured opponents. Polls project it to get close to 50% of the vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T18:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T21:56:49.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
