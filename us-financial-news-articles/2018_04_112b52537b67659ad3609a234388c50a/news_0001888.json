Another official said once a ride-hailing company obtained a licence it needed to follow the rules of a public transport provider. The minister also pledged that the government would ensure competition in the ride-hailing sector after Uber Technologies Inc’s deal to sell its operations in Southeast Asia to rival ride-hailing firm Grab.
