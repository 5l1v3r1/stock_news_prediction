But the response from economists has been largely sanguine: global growth itself appears to be holding up well.\nBut is it really? Commodity markets—and global industry— are starting to send some worrying signals.\nWhile manufacturing in most big economies is still expanding, the pace of those gains has slowed noticeably in recent months. Meanwhile, key industrial commodities like copper and aluminum also started selling off in late 2017, well before trade worries started spooking markets.\nThe implication: The strong global manufacturing rebound evident since late 2016 may have already—or be close to—peaking, whether or not a true trade war erupts.\nSlowing momentum in China has been evident for months . A modest bounce after February’s Chinese New Year notwithstanding, China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index appears to have peaked in the third quarter of last year, while Caixin’s alternative index has also trended sideways since then.\nWhat’s new is that other major indexes are now following suit.\nMarkit’s Eurozone PMI is down four points since December, although it still remains comfortably above the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction. Japanese and Korean PMIs have also nudged lower. Even in the U.S., strong headline numbers have masked slowing growth in new orders since the fourth quarter of 2017, along with a rebound in inventories.\nPigs ready for market at an Iowa farm this week.

Aluminum prices are down over 10%, and iron ore is off nearly 9%.\nTheir weakness is particularly striking given that the dollar has continued to slide over the same period—which usually helps commodities.\nSome of that weakness—particularly for aluminum, an early target of U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff ire —is likely related to rising trade tensions and rebounding Chinese production following the end of winter output curbs .\nBut the fact that the sell-off is so broad-based, and started around the time global PMIs began peaking, suggests slowing industrial growth is the main culprit.\nThat’s not to say another manufacturing recession is near. But for the first time since early 2017, major PMIs are all pointing towards slower, rather than faster, growth ahead.\nInvestors hoping comforting tales of a synchronized global uptick will protect their portfolios from severe damage even if trade tensions keep rising should think again.\nWrite to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=700&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=1260&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.32.min.js", "https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=140&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=620&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=860&aspect_ratio=1.5", "https://images.wsj.net/im-6174?width=540&aspect_ratio=1.5"], "published": "2018-04-06T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T17:41:26.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
