CRZO -4.26% is calling on the company to sell assets or combine with a rival, the latest sign that activist investors are focusing more on the energy sector.\nKimmeridge Energy Management Co. has built up an 8.1% stake in Carrizo, according to a securities filing. The firm previously disclosed that it owned 4.9%.\nThe New York investment firm said in the filing that it wants Carrizo to sell its south Texas drilling fields and use the proceeds to pay down debt, buy back stock or invest more in its prolific fields in the state’s western desert.\nThe firm also said it wants Carrizo to explore the possibility of merging with rivals in west Texas.\nKimmeridge said Carrizo’s stock price is low relative to the value of its assets. It has concluded that the company is too indebted and too small in each of the areas it operates to boost its share price without a major makeover.\nCarrizo’s stock has been among the oil-and-gas sector’s poorer performers over the past 12 months. It is down 41%, even after its shares rose 11%, to $17.15, on Thursday following the investment firm’s disclosure.\n“There should be a wave of consolidation,” said Ben Dell, founder and managing partner of Kimmeridge. “The biggest obstacle to that happening is management teams focusing on their own job preservation instead of what’s best for shareholders.”\nCarrizo said it “agrees with Kimmeridge’s assessment that its assets are currently undervalued relative to peer companies with similar-quality acreage,” but that hanging on to its fields and drilling them would lift its shares.\nKimmeridge’s interest in Carrizo is indicative of broader attention that activist investors are paying to the energy sector. Though U.S. oil prices are trading around their highest level in more than three years, energy stocks have been left behind .\nEnergy was the only sector in the S&P 500 to decline in 2017, and this year energy shares are down 4.9%, compared with a 0.4% loss in the broader index.\nSmaller energy companies have fared even worse. Shares of those in the S&P 600 index, which includes Carrizo and similarly sized oil-and-gas producers, have declined 22% over the past year, compared with a 15% gain for the broader index of smaller companies.\nThat underperformance has made the oil patch attractive to activists. Several smaller companies that restructured their balance sheets during the oil-price slump now face demands from the hedge funds that emerged as top shareholders in bankruptcy proceedings.\nWell-known activists have taken aim at larger companies as well. In recent months, Energen Corp. , EQT Corp. and Hess Corp. have each made concessions to activist investors to stave off proxy fights.\nCarrizo’s stock decline has reduced its market value to about $1.4 billion, which is less than the $1.6 billion of debt it carries and down from more than $3 billion in July 2014, when oil prices were above $100 a barrel.\nOil prices have bounced back from their recent nadir to trade at about $63 a barrel, and Carrizo has raised more than $500 million selling drilling fields outside its core operating areas. But its shares have continued to slide.\nLike many of its competitors, Carrizo sold new shares to pay down debt, keep rigs drilling and acquire new fields during the oil-price slump. Carrizo raised more than $900 million in four stock offerings at prices ranging from $45.50 a share in March 2015 to $14.60 last June.\nThe activist stance is an unusual position for Kimmeridge, which typically buys and operates drilling fields with its private-equity funds. Lately, though, the swoon in energy stocks has created opportunities to invest in energy assets cheaply by buying shares of companies, Mr. Dell said.\nWrite to Ryan Dezember at ryan.dezember@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T09:13:29.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
