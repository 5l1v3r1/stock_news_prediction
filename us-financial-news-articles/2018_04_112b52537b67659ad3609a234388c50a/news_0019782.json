Tati has no means to operate as going concern.”\nWhen it was placed under liquidation, Tati had incurred a cumulative loss of 1.6 billion pula ($165 million) and owed creditors one billion pula, with its former parent company BCL being the largest creditor at 800 million pula.\nDixon-Warren said he would urgently appeal the court’s decision to try to protect the creditors’ interest.\nHe said at least three companies had submitted indicative offers to buy Tati and he needed more time to conduct due diligence on them before asking them to submit firm offers.
