Bush and served as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. He also has held senior roles at TPG Capital and Facebook.\nReporting by Matthew Miller; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T05:17:46.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
