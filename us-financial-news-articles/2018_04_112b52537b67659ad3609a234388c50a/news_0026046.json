Net income was $199.1 million, up 12.6%. Diluted earnings per share of $1.13, up 11.9%. Loan originations totaled $7.3 billion, our strongest first quarter ever, up 29.9%.

Net charge-offs were only $154,000, or less than 1 basis point of average loans.\nContinued Franchise Development\nYear-over-year: Loans, excluding loans held for sale, totaled $65.2 billion, up 20.9%. Deposits were $71.3 billion, up 16.4%. Wealth management assets were $113.0 billion, up 25.4%. Wealth management revenues were $99.5 million, up 27.6%.\n“Revenue grew 20% and net interest income grew 18% compared to a year ago, while tangible book value was up 12%,” said Mike Roffler, Chief Financial Officer. “Asset quality remains excellent and capital is strong.”\nIncreased Quarterly Cash Dividend to $0.18 per Share\nThe Bank announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.18 per share of common stock. This first quarter dividend is payable on May 10, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 26, 2018.\nVery Strong Asset Quality\nCredit quality remains very strong. Nonperforming assets were only 5 basis points of total assets at March 31, 2018.\nThe Bank had net charge-offs for the quarter of $154,000, while adding $13.0 million to its allowance for loan losses due to continued loan growth.\nContinued Capital Strength\nThe Bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.47% at March 31, 2018, compared to 11.15% a year ago.\nIn addition, as previously announced, on January 2, 2018, the Bank redeemed all of the outstanding shares of its 5.625% Noncumulative Perpetual Series C Preferred Stock, which totaled $150.0 million.\nTangible Book Value Growth\nTangible book value per common share at March 31, 2018 was $41.46, up 11.6% from a year ago.\nContinued Franchise Development\nStrong Loan Originations\nLoan originations were $7.3 billion for the quarter, compared to $5.6 billion for the same quarter a year ago, an increase of 29.9%, primarily due to increases in business lending, multifamily and construction loans.\nLoans, excluding loans held for sale, totaled $65.2 billion at March 31, 2018, up 20.9% compared to a year ago. The increase was primarily due to growth in single family, multifamily and business loans.\nDeposit Growth\nTotal deposits increased to $71.3 billion, up 16.4% compared to a year ago.\nAt March 31, 2018, checking accounts totaled 62.2% of deposits.\nThe average rate paid on deposits was 0.30% during the quarter, compared to 0.28% for the prior quarter.\nInvestments\nTotal investment securities at March 31, 2018 were $16.5 billion, down 11.0% for the quarter and up 3.6% compared to a year ago.\nHigh-quality liquid assets, including eligible cash, totaled $11.1 billion at March 31, 2018, and represented 12.8% of average total assets.\nDuring the first quarter, the Bank performed a repositioning of its investment portfolio and sold certain intermediate and long-term, fixed-rate investment securities totaling $2.2 billion, and recognized a gain on sale of $10.7 million.\nMortgage Banking Activity\nDuring the first quarter, the Bank sold $161.4 million of loans and recorded a gain on sale of $689,000, compared to loan sales of $645.8 million and a gain of $3.4 million during the first quarter of last year.\nLoans serviced for investors at quarter-end totaled $12.2 billion, up 3.0% from a year ago.\nContinued Expansion of Wealth Management\nWealth management revenues totaled $99.5 million for the quarter, up 27.6% compared to last year’s first quarter. Such revenues represented 13.8% of the Bank’s total revenues for the quarter.\nTotal wealth management assets were $113.0 billion at March 31, 2018, up 5.6% for the quarter and up 25.4% compared to a year ago. The growth in wealth management assets for the quarter was due to client inflows. The year-over-year growth was due to both net new assets from existing and new clients, and market appreciation.\nWealth management assets included investment management assets of $55.1 billion, brokerage assets and money market mutual funds of $48.3 billion, and trust and custody assets of $9.6 billion.\nIncome Statement and Key Ratios\nStrong Revenue Growth\nTotal revenues were $720.9 million for the quarter, up 19.9% compared to the first quarter a year ago.\nStrong Net Interest Income Growth\nNet interest income was $587.8 million for the quarter, up 17.6% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from growth in average earning assets.\nNet Interest Margin\nThe net interest margin was 2.97% for the first quarter. Such net interest margin reflects the new computation of tax-equivalent yields, which were slightly reduced following the enactment of tax reform legislation (the “Tax Reform Act”) in December 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $133.1 million for the quarter, up 31.2% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The increase was primarily from growth in wealth management revenues and gain on sale of investments related to the previously discussed repositioning of the Bank’s investment portfolio.\nNoninterest Expense and Efficiency Ratio\nNoninterest expense was $461.6 million for the quarter, up 21.9% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The efficiency ratio was 64.0% for the quarter, compared to 63.0% for the first quarter a year ago. The increases were primarily due to increased salaries and benefits, information systems and other costs from the continued investments in the expansion of the franchise.\nIncome Taxes\nBeginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduced the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limits certain tax deductions.\nThe Bank’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 19.2%, which reflects the new federal tax rate, along with changes in tax deductions.\nConference Call Details\nFirst Republic Bank’s first quarter 2018 earnings conference call is scheduled for April 13, 2018 at 7:00 a.m. PT / 10:00 a.m. ET.

Statements in this press release that are not historical facts are hereby identified as “forward-looking statements” for the purpose of the safe harbor provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Any statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, predictions, forecasts, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and may be forward-looking. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “can,” “could,” “may,” “predicts,” “potential,” “should,” “will,” “estimates,” “plans,” “projects,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” “expects,” “intends” and similar words or phrases. Accordingly, these statements are only predictions and involve estimates, known and unknown risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in them.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: significant competition to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, from both traditional and non-traditional financial services and technology companies; our ability to recruit and retain key managers, employees and board members; the possibility of earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters affecting the markets in which we operate; interest rate risk and credit risk; our ability to maintain and follow high underwriting standards; economic and market conditions affecting the valuation of our investment securities portfolio, which could result in other-than-temporary impairment if the general economy deteriorates, credit ratings decline, the financial condition of issuers deteriorates, interest rates increase or the liquidity for securities is limited; real estate prices generally and in our markets; our geographic and product concentrations; demand for our products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate, our regulatory compliance and future regulatory requirements; the impact of tax reform legislation; the phase-in of the final capital rules regarding the Basel III framework, changes to the definitions and components of regulatory capital and a new approach for risk-weighted assets; legislative and regulatory actions affecting us and the financial services industry, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including increased compliance costs, limitations on activities and requirements to hold additional capital; our ability to avoid litigation and its associated costs and liabilities; the impact of new accounting standards; future Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessments or changes to regular assessments; fraud, cybersecurity and privacy risks; and custom technology preferences of our customers and our ability to successfully execute on initiatives relating to enhancements of our technology infrastructure, including client-facing systems and applications. For a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties, see First Republic’s FDIC filings, including, but not limited to, the risk factors in First Republic’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.
