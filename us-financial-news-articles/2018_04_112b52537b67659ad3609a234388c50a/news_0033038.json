The hotel marks the sixth of 11 hotels being marketed for sale previously disclosed in October 2017. All hotels, including Red Lion Inn & Suites Bend have signed franchise license agreements to retain their RLH Corporation brand.\nRLH Corporation’s total gain on the sales is expected to be approximately $2 million, and $3.8 million of the proceeds of the sales were used for debt repayment at the closing. Together with the other five previously announced sales, RLH Corporation’s gain of sales is approximately $16 million.\n“We are committed to our strategy we have outlined to become an asset light franchising company,” said RLH Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer Greg Mount. “So far in 2018 we have closed the sale on six of the 11 hotels we announced for sale in fall 2017. Each hotel has stayed in the RLH Corporation family of brands and will continue to drive return for the company.”\nRed Lion Inn & Suites Bend accounted for $2.6 million in revenue on an annual basis in 2017. The hotel’s adjusted EBITDA on consolidated reporting was $0.8 million and RLH Corporation’s share of the adjusted EBITDA was approximately $0.4 million for 2017. This impact does not take into account the previously announced corporate overhead adjustments to reduce operating costs.\nTo learn more about franchising with RLH Corporation, visit franchise.rlhco.com .
