It reported a net profit of 510 million riyals for the same period of last year.\nQNB Financial Services had forecast Masraf Al Rayan’s net profit of 517.7 million riyals, while EFG Hermes had expected it to report a net profit of 520.2 million riyals.\nIn a deal that would create Qatar’s second-largest bank by assets, Masraf Al Rayan is in initial merger talks with Barwa Bank IPO.BABK.QA and International Bank of Qatar.\nThe governor of Qatar’s central bank said earlier this month that he hoped a planned merger between the trio can proceed this year.\nReporting by Tom Arnold; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T19:38:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
