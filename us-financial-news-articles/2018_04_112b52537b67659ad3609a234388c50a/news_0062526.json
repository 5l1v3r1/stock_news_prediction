(NASDAQ: ELTK), a global manufacturer and supplier of technologically advanced solutions in the field of printed circuit boards, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nMr. Yitzhak Nissan , Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer , commented: \"Our revenues in the full year of 2017 decreased to $32.8 million from $33.2 million in 2016, excluding Kubatronik. Our revenues increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $9.1 million compared to revenues of $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding Kubatronik. We continue the implementation of the improvements we made in our manufacturing procedures, in order to supply our increased backlog of orders.\nWe see an increased demand for our products and our backlog of orders has grown significantly. I believe that the adjustments made to our manufacturing and marketing operations will assist the Company to reach its goals quickly and efficiently. I am determined to bring the Company back to profitability in the near future.\nIn March 2018, Nistec Ltd., the Company's controlling shareholder, extended the Company a bridge financing of NIS 4 million (approximately $1.1 million) for working capital. In addition, in April 2018, Nistec provided the Company a letter of commitment to provide additional financing in the amount of up to $2.5 million, valid for one year following the date of the approval of its 2017 financial statements. These supports, along with the financial support provided by Nistec in 2017, reflect my confidence in the Company and my belief that Eltek has the potential to overcome the manufacturing challenges and return to profitability.\nThe results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2017, do not include the operations of Kubatronik Leiterplatten GmbH, which were included in Eltek's results for the comparable periods in 2016. Therefore, we have provided selected financial information on a proforma basis, excluding Kubatronik's results for 2016,\" Mr. Nissan concluded.\nHighlights of the Full Year of 2017 compared to the Full Year of 2016\nRevenues for the full year of 2017 amounted to $32.8 million compared to revenues of $37.1 million in 2016 ($33.2 million excluding Kubatronik).
