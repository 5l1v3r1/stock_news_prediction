And they come amid an escalating tit-for-tat tariff battle between the U.S. and China, of whom Germany is likely to be a major casualty . China has announced tariffs of 25 percent on U.S. car exports — and some of the largest auto manufacturing plants and exporters in the States are German.\nThe new data Monday showed Germany raked in 104.7 billion euros ($128.6 billion) in exports for February, a fall of 3.2 percent on January, although up 2.4 percent on the same month in 2017. Imports slipped by 1.3 percent on the previous month, but increased 4.7 percent year-on-year. Overall, the country's trade surplus widened slightly from 17.3 billion euros in January to 18.4 billion euros in February.\n\"The entire start to the year 2018 has been a disappointment,\" Carsten Brzeski, chief economist for Germany and Austria at ING, said in a research note.
