An ICBC spokesman in Spain did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe judge said the transfers were via a correspondent banking agreement that Caixabank made with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which is under investigation for allegedly laundering hundreds of millions of euros through its Madrid branch. \nA Reuters investigation last year detailed the alleged money laundering scheme following the arrest of seven ICBC executives in Madrid in February of 2016. ICBC has denied wrongdoing and says it is a “law-abiding company.” Reporting by Angus Berwick; Editing by Jesus Aguado", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:45:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
