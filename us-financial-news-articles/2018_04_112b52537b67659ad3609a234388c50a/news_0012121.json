The Energy Ministry has said the row was over how each party’s share of the field’s output was calculated. \nEni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, while Kazakhstan’s KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Lukoil owns 13.5 percent. \nLast September, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told Reuters the former Soviet republic had received an offer from the consortium, but considered it insufficient. \nKazakhstan had previously planned to conclude the talks by the end of last year and then by the end of the first quarter.
