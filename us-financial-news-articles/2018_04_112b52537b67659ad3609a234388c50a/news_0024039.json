The Asian region is an upcoming market where we still can create some market share,” Chief Executive Officer Markus Tacke told Reuters in a phone interview on Thursday. \n“Asia, Latin America, Australia - these are the markets I find attractive to realise our growth.” \nThe merger of Siemens AG’s ( SIEGn.DE ) wind power business with Spain’s Gamesa was completed last year and the combined entity is looking to cash in on combined savings by betting on size and a more focused product portfolio. \nWind turbine makers globally have their eyes on improving efficiency and are building larger turbines that enhance energy generation without significantly increasing costs. \n“It’s an ongoing discussion in the market. We just launched a larger turbine in India. Larger turbines onshore and offshore is an ongoing trend,” said Tacke, who was at a press conference in Chennai, India for a company event. \nWind turbine manufacturers are facing pricing pressure globally as government subsidy cuts pit them against conventional energy sources like coal and gas, but Tacke was optimistic about the future. \n“From our internal numbers as well as some indicators we can take from the market, I think pricing pressure has been stabilising on a quarter-on-quarter basis,” he said, indicating an upward trend.
