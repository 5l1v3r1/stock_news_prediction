The increase mainly reflected the value of a one-time grant of $16.5 million in restricted stock meant to retain his services, the proxy states.\nCaesars’ compensation committee chair is David Sambur, a senior partner at Apollo Global Management, and includes Richard Schifter, a senior advisor at TPG Capital. A prior committee that set executive pay for 2017 also included Apollo and TPG representatives.\nSpokespeople for Apollo and for TPG declined to comment. Representatives for Caesars did not respond to requests for comment.\nA restructuring settlement last year resolved claims by creditors that the private equity firms stripped billions of dollars of assets before putting Caesars’ main operating unit into bankruptcy in 2015. Apollo and TPG led a leveraged buyout of Caesars in 2008.\nIn addition to the removal of Apollo and TPG representatives from the compensation committee, Unite Here asked Caesar’s board to increase employee pay and to cap CEO pay at 150 times that of the median employee.\nFrissora made 601 times as much as his median worker last year, according to the company’s proxy dated April 10, reflecting the new “pay ratio” disclosure requirement for U.S. companies this year.\nThe ratio was higher than at all but 7 of 69 companies that had filed proxies as of March 31 tracked by compensation data firm Equilar.\nReporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T21:18:25.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
