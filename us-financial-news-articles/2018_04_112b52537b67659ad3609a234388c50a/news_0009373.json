Ms. King has been the Transportation Department agency’s deputy administrator since late fall. The NHTSA has been without a permanent administrator since Mark Rosekind departed just before Mr. Trump’s inauguration in January 2017. Ms. King’s appointment would be subject to Senate confirmation.\nMs. King, a former General Electric Co. executive and House Energy and Commerce Committee economist, would take the reins at an agency scrambling to respond to rapidly emerging self-driving car systems and traditional vehicle defects that have spawned record industrywide recalls in recent years.\nMs. King dispatched investigators in March to examine two separate fatal crashes linked to automated-driving technologies. On March 18, a pedestrian was struck and killed by an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car with a safety operator at the wheel in Arizona. A driver of a Tesla Inc. electric vehicle with its semiautonomous Autopilot system activated died March 23 when his sport utility crashed into a barrier near Mountain View, Calif.\nAs administrator, Ms. King would face a challenge that traces back to the Obama administration: ensuring driverless-car technologies receive appropriate safety oversight while crafting policies that encourage development of systems that officials believe will ultimately cut traffic fatalities, which surpassed 37,000 in 2016, according to the most recent government data. Human error causes 94% of vehicle crashes, according to regulators.\nUnder Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, regulators have taken a delicate approach to regulating automated driving, emphasizing the voluntary nature of safety assessment letters from companies detailing their systems that were first suggested under the Obama administration. Regulators are continuing the previous administration’s guidance that states retain control over driver’s licenses, car registrations and traffic laws while leaving oversight of driverless vehicles to federal officials, thus avoiding potentially conflicting safety standards for the new technology.\nBut Ms. King told a House panel in February that the greatest challenge facing NHTSA officials is more conventional: an urgent recall that Ford Motor Co. issued earlier this year instructing tens of thousands of truck owners to stop driving older vehicles with potentially lethal air bags.\nThe do-not-drive recall “keeps me up at night,” Ms. King told lawmakers. The recall involves Takata Corp. air bags that are at heightened risk of exploding and unleashing shrapnel. Nearly all auto makers are in the process of addressing tens of millions of vehicles with as many as 70 million Takata air bags that risk rupturing, a defect linked to nearly two dozen deaths, hundreds of injuries and the largest automotive safety recall in U.S. history.\nThe agency is recovering from criticism that it failed to spot defective ignition switches in older General Motors Co. cars, a safety crisis that emerged in early 2014 and was eventually linked to 124 deaths. In the waning years of the Obama administration, NHTSA officials levied unprecedented financial penalties and other punishments against automotive companies for safety lapses. Regulators also began coordinated oversight of the Takata air bag recalls, which included an independent monitor auditing their progress.\nWrite to Mike Spector at mike.spector@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T06:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T06:43:31.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
