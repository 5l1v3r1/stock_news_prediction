The Gates Foundation and the IFC, the World Bank’s private finance arm, have both declined to comment on the row.\nSHAKE-UP\nThe fund dispute, which erupted this year has jolted Abraaj, a top investor in the developing world founded in 2002 by Arif Naqvi, who in late February handed the running of the fund to two co-chief executives.\nAbraaj has also shaken up its management, suspended new investments, freed up large investors from millions of dollars in capital commitments and is reviewing its corporate structure.\nIt was managing $13.6 billion before deciding to return $3 billion to investors and putting a new $6 billion fund on hold.\nNaqvi remains CEO of Abraaj Holdings, a significant shareholder of Abraaj Investment Management Ltd, the fund management business. Sources say he has spoken to senior bankers about various options for the firm, although Abraaj has not formally hired an adviser to sell the business.\n(This story has been refiled to add dropped word “not” in paragraph 4)\nadditional reporting by Tom Arnold, Dasha Afanasieva and Hadeel Al Sayegh; Writing by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T20:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:48:57.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
