But the company more recently enabled that function at brick-and-mortar retailers, too, through specially designed hardware and mobile systems.\nAn augmented reality look-and-buy payment system would likely raise security concerns and come with bugs to work out. But it could also seal PayPal as an early practical entrant to the budding virtual reality space.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T21:01:30.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
