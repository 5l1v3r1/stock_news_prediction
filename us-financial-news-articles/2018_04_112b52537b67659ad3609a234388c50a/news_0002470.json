(Nasdaq: CECE ) a global leader in air quality and fluid handling, today announced the sale of Strobic to Cincinnati Fan and Ventilator Company, Inc. a portfolio company of Dominus Capital, L.P. The sale of Strobic, along with the previously announced sale of Keystone Filter, generated gross proceeds in excess of $35 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nStrobic, which previously operated as part of CECO's Fluid Handling & Filtration Technologies segment, is a leading provider of technologically advanced exhaust systems for laboratory fume hoods utilized in the university and pharmaceutical end markets. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, Strobic recorded revenue of approximately $18 million.\nThe divestiture of Strobic is part of CECO's recent strategic actions aimed at better aligning its portfolio to serve the industrial air quality and fluid handling markets. CECO's sale of Strobic follows the Company's recent sale of its Keystone Filter brand and products to Porvair plc. Keystone recorded revenue of approximately $4.0 million in 2017.\nCECO's Chief Executive Officer Dennis Sadlowski commented, \"The sale of both Strobic and Keystone represent key milestones in our effort to strategically realign CECO for long-term growth as we focus our portfolio on the Industrial Air Quality Improvement and Fluid Handling markets. We are pleased to have successfully sold these non-core units generating a solid return for CECO shareholders. We will use the net proceeds to reduce our debt, which will result in a substantially improved leverage ratio and allow CECO the flexibility to invest in our strategic growth agenda.\"\nABOUT CECO ENVIRONMENTAL\nCECO Environmental is a global leader in air quality and fluid handling serving the energy, industrial and other niche markets.
