Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - Manchester City vs Liverpool - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 10, 2018 Manchester City's Sergio Aguero on the substitutes bench Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff \nThe 29-year-old has not started a match since City’s 1-0 victory against Chelsea in the Premier League on March 4. \nHis last appearance came from the bench against Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final second-leg last week when the striker claimed he “couldn’t run” after 24 minutes on the pitch. \n“Recovering from an arthroscopy on my knee. Fully motivated to get back soon to the field,” Aguero wrote on his Twitter account on Tuesday. \nWith Premier League title wrapped up and City’s Champions League campaign ended by Liverpool, Aguero will not be rushed back on the field. \nHowever, the striker is expected to be a key figure for Argentina, who play their opening World Cup match against Iceland on June 16.
