This year, the International Monetary Fund expects its economy to expand by 7.2 percent.\nIn another move, Kagame named Yvonne Manzi Makolo as chief executive of the national carrier RwandAir. The airline sacked its previous head in April last year.\nReporting by Clement Uwiringiyimana; Editing by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T15:57:05.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
