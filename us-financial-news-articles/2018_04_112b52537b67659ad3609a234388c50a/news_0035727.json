Direct comparisons are difficult as cities have different definitions of skyscraper. \nMore than 90 percent of the new towers are residential and could deliver 106,000 homes, the report said. \nA record number 115 projects are under construction, more than two-thirds of which are in inner London, it said. \nTall buildings are also becoming a feature of the suburbs, with towers completed outside the city center last year in Lambeth, Battersea and Greenwich in south London and Poplar in the east of the city, the report said. \nOnly seven out of 32 London boroughs - Bexley, Enfield, Havering, Hillingdon, Kensington & Chelsea, Merton and Richmond - have no plans for new skyscrapers. \nThat scenario that is expected to change as the Elizabeth Line, a new train line stretching more than 60 miles (97 km) from west through central London to the east of the capital is expected to open next year, the report said. \nThe safety of high-rise buildings has come under scrutiny after a fire killed more than 70 people in the Grenfell tower in west London last June. \n($1 = 0.7027 pounds) Reporting by Astrid Zweynert @azweynert, Editing by Katy Migiro.
