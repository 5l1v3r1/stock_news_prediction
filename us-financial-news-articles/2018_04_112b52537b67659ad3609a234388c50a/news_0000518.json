A companion app for iOS and Android lets users tweak the torque manually, and provides performance statistics from their day on the mountain. \nROAM said the device could help pros who want to train longer, seniors who experience knee or joint pain, or people with injuries get back out on the slopes faster. \nThe company said the device will be available next winter and will cost around $2,000 to $2,500.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T01:28:21.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
