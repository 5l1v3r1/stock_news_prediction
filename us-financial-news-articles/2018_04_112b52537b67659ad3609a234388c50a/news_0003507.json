Under Dudley, formerly a managing director at Goldman and the bank's chief economist, the New York Fed was criticized for its ties to investment banks it was charged with regulating.\nIt's a plus to be \"without deep ties\" to Wall Street, said University of Oregon professor Tim Duy, adding that Williams is smart enough to \"know his weak points\" and tap the bank's own staff for any expertise he lacks.\nWELLS FARGO AND LACK OF DIVERSITY\nWhile Williams may not conform to some of the stereotypes of a Federal Reserve president and academic economist - he is a \"Trekkie,\" plays first-person-shooter computer games, and sometimes wears red sneakers - he is still a middle-aged white man.\nThe search committee at the New York Fed had included a search for minority candidates in its mandate. Just two of the 12 regional Fed presidents are non-white, and two are women, while there is just one female Fed governor.\nThe post is not open to congressional review, although Williams has also faced criticism over San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which opened millions of fraudulent customer accounts under his watch.\nWhile it is the Federal Reserve Board that makes calls on large bank supervision rather than individual regional Fed bank presidents, critics say the fact that he will now be regulating some of world's most powerful financial institutions is a worry.\n\"Mr. Williams track record raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks given the San Francisco Feds inadequate supervision of Wells Fargo during its many consumer scandals,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren said last week.\nNOT A NEOPHYTE\nAlthough Williams has spent most of his career in the Fed system, he has had other work, with short stints on the Council of Economic Advisers, a semester or two teaching at Stanford and four post-college years managing Berkeley's best-known pizza joint, Blondie's.\nDespite the lack of experience dealing with Wall Street, Williams won't be starting from scratch, says John Taylor, a Stanford professor who wrote a paper with Williams on a problematic jump in financial market spreads in early 2008.\n\"He was one of the first people to notice problems in the balance sheets of financial institutions, way back before the financial crisis really took over,\" Taylor said in an interview.
