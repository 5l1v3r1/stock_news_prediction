Citi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe company, whose largest shareholder is the Rotterdam municipality, said on Monday Jeroen de Haas, chief executive since 2007, will leave on Sept. 1. \nEneco said its supervisory board reached the decision “in close consultation” with De Haas but declined to clarify the reasons for his departure. \nEneco’s 53 municipal shareholders voted for privatisation in October, clashing with the company’s management who wanted to operate as independently as possible and to continue investing heavily in sustainable energy. \nSources had previously valued the company at around 4 billion euros ($5 billion). \nOne of the sources said De Haas had preferred the initial public offering of the company. After months of feuding, shareholders and Eneco’s board had agreed in February that the company would be sold, paving the way for privatisation in the coming months. \nPotential bidders include a consortium led by Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ), French energy company Total SA ( TOTF.PA ), Italy’s Enel ( ENEI.MI ), Engie ( ENGIE.PA ), Verbund ( VERB.VI ), Orsted ( ORSTED.CO ) and Fortum ( FORTUM.HE ). \nIn March, Eneco reported a rise in underlying 2017 sales and profit as well as higher debt due to acquisitions.
