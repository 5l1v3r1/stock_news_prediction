It was the sixth consecutive week that prices were higher than in the corresponding year-ago week.\nThe European Union is by far the biggest export market for Norwegian salmon, buying 81.7 percent of volumes last week, up from 77.5 percent the previous week.\nCombined for China and Vietnam, volumes last week dropped to 295 tonnes from 578 tonnes in same week last year.\nSeparately, volumes to Hong Kong rose to 262 tonnes last week from 211 tonnes in same week last year.
