The 1.9 billion euros price is an enterprise value, including equity and debt. \nSanofi has been reshaping its business in recent months, spending more than $16 billion to buy biotech company Ablynx and U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ, but also selling off some assets. \nEarlier this week, it sold some brands to Charterhouse Capital Partners’ Cooper-Vemedia drugs manufacturing arm for 158 million euros. \n“Following a comprehensive review of strategic options for our generics unit in Europe, we have determined that transferring this business to Advent is the best option to ensure its long-term success,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement. \nThe planned sale of Zentiva began in October after Sanofi spent more than a year carving out the division to create a stand-alone company that could be sold to one of its competitors or to an investment fund. \nIn February, sources told Reuters that private equity firms Carlyle, BC Partners and a consortium of Blackstone and Nordic Capital, had been shortlisted to buy Zentiva along with two industry players, Brazilian drugs firm EMS and India’s Torrent Pharma. \nZentiva operates in 50 markets and has a strong presence in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania. \nIts generic drugs portfolio includes cardiovascular and gastrointestinal drugs as well as painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs based on ibuprofen and leflunomide molecules. $1 = 0.8067 euros Reporting by Matthias Blamont and Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T10:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T10:20:19.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
