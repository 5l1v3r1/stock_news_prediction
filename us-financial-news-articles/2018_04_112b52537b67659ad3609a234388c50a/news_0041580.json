State TV footage showed clouds of smoke rising from the al-Hajar al-Aswad district, part of an enclave including the Palestinian Yarmouk camp that is held by Islamic State and other jihadist groups.\nUNRWA, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinian refugees, has said it is deeply concerned about the fate of thousands of civilians including Palestinian refugees in Yarmouk and the surrounding areas.\nThe conquest of eastern Qalamoun and the enclave south of Damascus will leave just one remaining besieged rebel enclave, north of the city of Homs.\nLarge parts of Syria at the borders with Jordan, Israel, Turkey and Iraq remain outside Assadâ€™s control, however. Anti-Assad rebels hold a chunk of territory in the southwest and the northwest, and Kurdish-led militias, backed by the United States, control an expanse of northern and eastern Syria.
