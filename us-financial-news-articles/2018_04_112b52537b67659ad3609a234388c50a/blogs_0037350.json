Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images The first hit: Pricier autos.\nThe average price paid for a new car reached $34,623 in March, according to Edmunds. Five years ago, that number was $31,078.\nThen there are the loans, which can be a triple whammy.\nRising interest rates make borrowing more expensive. Last month, interest rates on new-car loans stood at 5.7 percent, up from 4.4 percent in March 2013.\nAnd as prices have risen, consumers have been financing larger balances: An average $31,020, compared with $26,533 five years ago.\nPlus, they're taking on loans over a longer period of time. The average auto loan length is now 69.5 months compared with 65.7 months in March 2013. Generally, the longer the loan term, the more you'll pay in interest.\nThe cost of buying a car Loan aspect March 2018 March 2013 Average length (in months) 69.5 65.7 Average monthly payment $525 $455 Average amount financed $31,020 $26,533 Average interest rate 5.70% 4.40% Total finance charges $5,474 $3,372 Total cost $36,494 $29,905 Source: Edmunds.com Part of the reason that costs have climbed is consumers' continuing preference for larger vehicles like SUVs and pickup trucks, which come with higher prices.\nFor example, the average price on a compact car is $20,444, according to Kelley Blue Book. In comparison, a mid-size SUV/crossover runs an average of $38,541 and a full-size pickup truck would set you back $47,069.\nAdded technology and safety features included in new models push prices up further.\nFor consumers with poor credit, the financing cost shifts are especially pronounced. A buyer who finances about $31,000 and pays 11.4 percent in interest for a 69.5-month loan would end up shelling out $11,501 in interest charges. That's $6,027 more than at 5.7 percent.\nshow chapters Auto sales rate comes in at 17.48 million 3:34 PM ET Tue, 3 April 2018 | 00:42 Here are some tips for containing costs.\nChoose backups Often, car shoppers zero in a car they want and don't seriously consider other options.\n\"We're telling people to have a second and third choice,\" Jones said. \"What if the interest rate is better on them? If you can save money over the years of your loan, maybe your backup choice is actually a better option.\"\nPart of looking around means checking in with a number of dealerships, because there can be differences in the deals they offer. Additionally, you can shop around for pre-approval from a lender. That way, you have a backup if a dealership cannot offer a better interest rate with its financing options.\nAim lower The easiest way to save money on a car? Buy a less expensive vehicle.\n\"Sometimes when people buy a car and they love it, after six months of driving it, it's just a car,\" Jones said. \"A less expensive car might be as good an option.\"\nIn other words, new cars don't stay new. They get dirty, need oil changes, and might not be as exciting a possession after the novelty of owning it wears off.\nAt that point, the commitment you've made to make payments every month for five years or more might not look so appealing.\n\"Sometimes when people buy a car and they love it, after six months of driving it, it's just a car.\" -Matt Jones, Senior consumer advice editor at Edmunds.com Keep in mind, too, that new cars generally lose about 10 percent of their value once driven off the lot.\nConsider leasing Leasing can be a way to get the car you want at a lower monthly price.\nThe monthly payments on a lease averaged $120 less than those of traditional auto loans in 2016, Edmunds research shows. For large pickup trucks, which tend to retain more of their value than many vehicles, lease payments averaged $206 less than the average traditional loan payment.\nHowever, a car lease comes with mileage limits, typically about 12,000 annually. If you're over the limit at the end of the lease, you'll pay anywhere from about 15 cents to 25 cents for each extra mile you put on the car. At that rate, each 1,000 extra miles would cost somewhere between $150 and $250.\nAdditionally, the car is expected to be returned at the end of the lease with only normal wear and tear. Going with a lease also means going through the car-buying process again in a few years.\n\"Leases aren't for everybody, but if the goal is to save money, it's an option to consider,\" Jones said.\nMore from Your Money, Your Future:\nWhen you make $2.13 an hour, tips really, really matter\nDog owners, here's what you need to know about liability insurance\nThe top five spots for Gen Xers and younger boomers seeking a fresh start", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T16:02:47.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
