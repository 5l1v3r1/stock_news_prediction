Shares of NewLink Genetics Corp tumbled 39 percent, while those of Nektar Therapeutics were down 8 percent.\nIncyte’s study was evaluating a combination of epacadostat and Keytruda in patients with metastatic melanoma compared with those who were on Keytruda monotherapy.\nKeytruda is approved to treat several forms of cancer, including lung cancer and advanced melanoma, and is a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor that blocks a mechanism tumors use to evade detection.\nKeytruda competes with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo. The companies are looking to expand the reach of these drugs by combining them with other therapies.\nIncyte has already signed deals with Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca to test epacadostat.\nWilliam Blair analyst Katherine Xu said the result was surprising and the failure will make things difficult for the cause of IDO inhibitors.\nMerck and Incyte said the study’s second main goal of overall survival was also not expected to reach a statistical significance.\nIncyte is currently testing its Jakafi as a treatment for graft versus host disease, a medical complication of transplants from a donor. It is also awaiting an FDA decision for baricitinib, an eczema drug it is developing with Eli Lilly & Co .\nIncyte shares were down 17 percent at $68, while Merck was down about 0.5 percent.
