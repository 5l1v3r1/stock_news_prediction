The enactment of a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Governor Bruce Rauner’s vetoes in July saved the state’s credit ratings from falling into junk.\nIllinois said it sold its latest debt at an overall borrowing cost of 4.72 percent.\n“We are very pleased with the strong response that the state received on today’s competitive bids, particularly given the recent volatility in the municipal bond market,” Kelly Hutchinson, Illinois’ capital markets director, said in a statement.\nTax-exempt bond prices dropped on Wednesday, boosting yields 2 to 8 basis points on MMD’s scale.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T00:54:05.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
