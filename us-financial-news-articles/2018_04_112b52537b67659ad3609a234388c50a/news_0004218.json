REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo \nShares in Sky closed up 2.1 percent after Twenty-First Century Fox ( FOXA.O ) said it could legally separate Sky News within the group to allay British regulatory concerns about the channel’s independence under Rupert Murdoch’s ownership. \nFox agreed in December 2016 to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own, but the deal has been repeatedly delayed by the British government and regulators. \nThe blue chip FTSE 100 .FTSE index ended the day down 0.37 percent at 7,030.46 points, while mid caps .FTMC fell 0.32 percent, as trading resumed following the Easter market holiday. \nLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that though the UK market was unloved, a number of factors such as the prospect of higher interest rates spelling the imminent end of the era of cheap money were supportive of M&A activity. \n“In the background there is what is happening in terms of the global economy. This year looks to be OK, but if this kind of trade war stuff does escalate, that could put a dampener on things,” Khalaf added. \nWorries over global trade and a tumble in U.S. heavyweight tech stocks have hit risk assets such as equities so far this year, while a spate of profit warnings and Brexit-related uncertainties have dented appetite for British stocks. \nThe FTSE 100 slid in line with the broader European market, with financials, industrials and health stocks shaving the most points off the index. \nA rise in the pound also put pressure on large, overseas-earning stocks. \nMining stocks were a bright spot as solid manufacturing data from China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, boosted the price of copper to a one-week high. [MET/L] \nShares in Glencore ( GLEN.L ), BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) all rose between 0.3 and 0.7 percent. \nThe FTSE’s muted start to the second quarter follows its worst first quarter since 2011, while March saw its third straight month of declines.
