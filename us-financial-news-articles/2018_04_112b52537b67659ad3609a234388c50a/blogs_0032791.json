But even with those modest edits — you can imagine what they are, sexuality and nudity are out — but we believe that those edits will be quite modest,\" he said.\nThe reopening of cinemas in the kingdom comes as part of social reforms being promoted by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman . The promotion of culture and entertainment are also a part of his \"Vision 2030,\" a program to transform the country's economy and society.\nVision 2030 hopes to see annual Saudi spending on cultural and entertainment activities increase from the current 2.9 percent of total household expenditure to 6 percent by 2030 .\nThe kingdom hopes to have nearly 350 cinemas, with over 2,500 screens, by 2030.\nAMC's license was granted after it signed a memorandum of understanding with the entertainment arm of Saudi's main sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, in December 2017 \"to explore potential trade cooperation opportunities.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T09:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:14:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
