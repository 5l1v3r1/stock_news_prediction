If that all works out, the final green light could then be given at its 2020 annual meeting.\nThe move would represent the latest evolution from the EBRD’s post-Soviet era roots and come as Cold War-style tensions between the EBRD’s main Western shareholders and Russia — for a long time the bank’s largest market — are rising.\nHaving already stopped new investments in Russia in 2014, Chakrabarti said there was no talk of any further punitive measures following the recent ratcheting up of U.S. sanctions.\nThe bank has no exposure to any of the entities targeted by the latest sanctions, he added.\nThe plan to move deeper into Africa meanwhile could dovetail with going into more countries in the north of the continent such as Algeria, or in the Middle East such as Iraq or Libya.\nThe overall expansion could see its annual lending jump by almost a third from around 9.5 billion euros ($11.7 billion) at the moment.\n“On a rough calculation, our finance people reckon we could probably get up to 10 billion euros in our existing region over the next couple of years.”\n“Then they calculate that given our capital base... we could probably get to something like 12.5 to 13 billion euros of lending a year so that is another 2.5 to 3 billion euros of fire power.”\nTRANSITION GAPS Another motivation for expansion was also to reduce concentration risks, he said. The bulk of EBRD investment currently goes into five countries, led by Turkey, Egypt and Ukraine, all of which have economic and political challenges.\nThe EBRD wants to make more policy impact in the countries where it operates but at the moment even in its traditional heartlands like Hungary and Poland attitudes are shifting away from its principles.\n“If we were to look at a range of out countries and not just the big ones like Turkey, Egypt, Hungary and Poland, I think there are undoubtedly issues over applying democratic principles,” Chakrabarti said.\nIn Turkey for instance, EBRD lending volumes dropped last year, not necessarily due to a deliberate decision but because the private sector investors the bank teams up with are becoming warier.\nIt was implementing as few state company projects as possible in Egypt where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi was re-elected this month with 97 percent of votes after the main opposition candidates pulled out citing intimidation.\nLending in Hungary, where right-wing populist Viktor Orban just won a third term on a wave of anti-EU sentiment, remains minimal, while in Poland investments also dropped significantly last year.\n“I can convey the concerns that shareholders feel, that is part of my job. To do these things in private.”\n“But you cannot expect an institution like the EBRD on its own to solve this issue. It is bigger than us.”\n(This refiled version of the story removes extraneous Quote: marks in paragraph eight.)\nReporting by Marc Jones and Sujata Rao; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:55:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
