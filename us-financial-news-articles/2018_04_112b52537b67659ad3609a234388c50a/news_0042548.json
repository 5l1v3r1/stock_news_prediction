REUTERS/Stringer “It is with a heavy heart that I announce the untimely death of Gen. James Ajongo Mawut, SPLA army’s chief of defense force,” Lueth said.\nAjongo joined the Sudan People’s Liberation Army, the formal name of the South Sudanese military, in 1983, when the SPLA was still a rebel group fighting for independence from Sudan.\nHe was appointed to the position after his predecessor Paul Malong was sacked early last year amid resignations by some generals who alleged abuses by the military and tribal bias in the army ranks.\nMalong has since formed his own organisation to challenge President Salva Kiir, accusing him of looting the country’s resources and turning it into a failed state.\nSouth Sudan, which obtained independence from Sudan in 2011 and is the world’s youngest nation, has been mired in civil war since 2013 when Kiir fired his deputy Riek Machar.\nTens of thousands of people have been killed in war that has often been fought along ethnic lines and much of the nation has faced dire food shortages.\n(This version of the story corrects spelling of army chief’s name in paragraph 2 to Mawut, not Madut)\nReporting by Denis Dumo; Writing by Omar Mohammed; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:34:04.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
