The move came even as prices rose, according to data released by the CFTC.\nOn Wednesday this week, both oil benchmarks hit their highest since late 2014 after U.S. President Donald Trump warned missiles \"will be coming\" in response to a suspected gas attack in Syria and after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh.\nOn Thursday, Trump tweeted that an attack on Syria \"could be very soon or not so soon at all.\"\n\"The Syrian escalation risk cannot be fully written off, but we view that it deserves less of a premium than three days ago,\" Petromatrix said in a note.\nA surplus in global oil inventories is also close to evaporating, OPEC said on Thursday, adding its collective output fell to 31.96 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, down 201,000 bpd from February.\nVienna-based OPEC and its oil producer allies are expected to extend their supply reduction pact into 2019 even though the global glut of crude looks set to be eradicated by September, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters.\nThe International Energy Agency (IEA), which coordinates the energy policies of industrialized nations, signaled on Friday that markets could become too tight if supply remains restrained.\n\"It is not for us to declare on behalf of the Vienna agreement countries that it is 'mission accomplished', but if our outlook is accurate, it certainly looks very much like it,\" the IEA said.\nMeanwhile, China's March crude oil imports climbed to the second-highest level on record.\nU.S. drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to April 13, bringing the total count to 815, the highest since March 2015, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>\n(Additional reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York, Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo and Shadia Nasralla in London; Editing by Clive McKeef)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:08:05.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
