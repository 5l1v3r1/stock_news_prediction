Ted Lieu, D-Calif.\nEarlier this month, Lieu and Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., had called for a probe of the rental , saying there is a concern it violated ethics rules.\nElkins' letter also mentions the other pending inquiries when it says OIG will be looking into \"housing arrangements by the Administrator.\"\n\"We have received multiple requests from multiple members of Congress, as well as other OIG Hotline complaints, regarding these same and related issues,\" Elkins wrote.\nA spokesman for Pruitt, when asked about the new probe, said, \"We do not comment on matters pertaining to EPA's IG.\"\nAn EPA ethics official, Kevin Minoli, had initially ruled that Pruitt's rental of the room from Vicki Hart, wife of lobbyist Steven Hart, would not violate federal ethics rules. But Minoli later said he did not have sufficient information about the deal to determine if Pruitt honored the terms of the lease.\nPruitt testified for hours Thursday to two House committees. He said he has \"nothing to hide\" during that testimony, and that much of what has been reported about him is \"half-truths or stories that have been so twisted that they do no resemble reality.\"\nBut Rep. Frank Pallone, the New Jersey Democrat who is ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , told Pruitt he is an embarrassment to President Trump .\"\nPallone also said that if he were president, \"I'd just get rid of you.\"\nLieu, in a statement issued Friday, said, \"I am pleased the EPA OIG has honored the request I made with Rep. Beyer and others to review Administrator Scott Pruitt's purported misconduct.\"\n\"The Inspector General's letter also mentions new matters under review, which shows that Pruitt's alleged corruption may run deep. No one is above the law.\"\nLieu also tweeted about the probe, saying \"My #FridayFeeling is that Scott Pruitt is in deep trouble.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tedlieu/status/989968143778041859", "https://lieu.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-lieu-and-beyer-urge-ig-investigation-epa-administrator-scott-pruitt", "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/04/scott-pruitt-and-the-trump-white-houses-serial-scandals/559055/"], "published": "2018-04-28T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T00:53:55.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
