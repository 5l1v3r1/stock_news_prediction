In some cases, the symptoms have lessened in intensity before returning, the official said.\nCanada has also recently received information from Canadian and American medical specialists that raised concerns of a possible type of acquired brain injury, the official said, while initial theories of a sonic attack first raised by U.S. officials last year or mass psychosomatic causes are now considered to be improbable.\nAir and water quality tests of staff quarters in Havana did not indicate a cause for the health problems, the official told reporters.\nDue to the uncertainty, Canada’s embassy in Cuba will be designated as an unaccompanied post, meaning diplomats will not be accompanied by their families, the government said in a separate statement.\nThe U.S. State Department said last August that Americans linked to its embassy in Cuba had experienced physical symptoms caused by unspecified “incidents” starting as far back as late 2016.\nThe United States said in March it was making permanent last year’s decision to slash staffing at its Havana embassy by around two-thirds as the alleged health incidents among its diplomats remained unsolved.\nCuban officials have denied any involvement or any knowledge of what was behind the incidents. Canada has generally enjoyed good relations with Cuba, even as the United States mounted a decades-long economic blockade against the country.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T00:11:42.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
