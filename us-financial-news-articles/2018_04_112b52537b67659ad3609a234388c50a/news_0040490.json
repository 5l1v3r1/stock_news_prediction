She also declined to disclose the identity of the criminal third-party and said the matter was under investigation.\nSunTrust also said that as of last week, it believed the stolen information had not left the bank.\nRogers said this was not a data breach, adding the employee was not authorized to get that level of information, and that the company was reviewing its systems and capabilities.\n“While management appears to be proactively addressing the data issue, we expect a degree of uncertainty to persist as the duration, breadth, and financial impact of any related investigations (both internal and external) are not yet known,” Evercore analysts wrote in a client note.\nThe incident will not result in any material impact to earnings, the bank said.\nIn a press release shortly after the call, SunTrust said it will offer identity protection services to all of its clients free of charge, not just those potentially impacted.\nSunTrust reported a 36 percent rise in quarterly profit helped by a rise in net interest income and lower expenses.
