But they retain a strong presence in regions outside the capital.\nOn Friday, one soldier was killed by a militant who attacked a checkpoint in Mogadishu. A car bomb in the same place injured two other soldiers.\nAl Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack.\nReporting by Abdi Sheikh; Writing by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T17:03:32.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
