In some cases, you can identify by terminology such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “continuing,” “ongoing,” \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could\" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performances, or achievements expressed or implied by the . Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time those statements are made or management's good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the . Important factors that could cause such differences include, but are not limited to, our ability to grow our business through acquisitions; our ability to integrate, manage and expand VIP’s business; our dependency on a limited number of customers; our ability to implement our growth strategy effectively; our ability to achieve or sustain profitability; competition from veterinarians and others in our industry; reputational damage to our brands; economic trends and spending on pets; the effectiveness of our marketing and trade promotion programs; recalls or withdrawals of our products or product liability claims; our ability to manage our manufacturing and supply chain effectively; disruptions in our manufacturing and distribution chains; our ability to introduce new products and improve existing products; our failure to protect our intellectual property; costs associated with governmental regulation; risks related to our international operations; our ability to keep and retain key employees; and the risks set forth under the “Risk Factors” section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for PetIQ, Inc., filed with the SEC on March 13, 2018.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.

In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any . Consequently, you should not place undue reliance on .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, PetIQ uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on debt extinguishment, management fees, stock based compensation expense, acquisition expenses, and litigation expenses. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts for transactions that management does not believe are representative of our core ongoing business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA stated as a percentage of Net sales. Adjusted EBITDA is utilized by management: (i) as a factor in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation and (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. The Company presents EBITDA because it is a necessary component for computing Adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. In addition, you should be aware when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. Our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these or other unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies do not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Our management does not, and you should not, consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in our financial statements.\nContacts:\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nICR\nKatie Turner\n646-277-1228\nkatie.turner@icrinc.com\nMedia Relations Contact:\nICR\nCory Ziskind\n646-277-1232\ncory.ziskind@icrinc.com\nSource:PetIQ, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8ada3f5f-4a64-41ad-9b76-23f29afed756", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=6J3FThTEPKc-OaWUBs7hv5xquFYcJKeMamZbmlKUEm1e4fu3--LOwEC9PSZh4tXKkTFGKf7TXnZsr0C0DDTDNZTw5eBrWL6DjQBx_O3Ckc8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=31ms4J3MyUy4pq9KkTB_phFet9ydk1yaAiQCsx5-UVTxN-tdPZCwsZR7a7YU7xIPucFWa9MO-z8xiN4kbi3ZXjCCFpM6rpUjN7Y4YafCRi8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Z1pa-hwZZYOUDjUpsgADFZtiwRG9HItnhHvaybuHe2Gg8-kv8_OY0ToQDBdIZpmIjO9i2FwtEj62VVStPlwpK9w1bkzKwfIYJSbxN4SpvZeURkKKr5RIIVqkTsi6UhoTY737WhV27f4g8EDfy5eHwA=="], "published": "2018-04-03T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T01:47:03.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
