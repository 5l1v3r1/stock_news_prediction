Each Right will entitle an eligible holder thereof to acquire 1.21569322 Common Shares at a price of US$0.36470797 per Right (representing a subscription price of US$0.30 per Common Share). The subscription price must be paid in United States dollars. The Rights issued under the Rights Offering will be evidenced by transferable rights certificates (the \" Rights Certificates \"), and will expire at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on May 22, 2018 (the \" Expiry Date \"), after which time unexercised Rights will be void and of no value. The Rights Offering includes an additional subscription privilege under which eligible holders of Rights who fully exercise their Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional available Common Shares.
