26.6 % Less: Currency impact 5.4 % 14.1 % Revenue growth at constant currency 10.3 % 12.5 % We have presented the growth of our revenue on both an as reported and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency revenue information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth, consistent with how we evaluate our performance, as this statistic removes the translation impact of exchange rate fluctuations, which are outside of our control and do not reflect our operational performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating prior year revenue in local currency using the current year's currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. In addition, not all companies that report revenue growth on a constant currency basis calculate such measure in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly-named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table compares revenue and Segment EBITDA by reportable segment:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) % of\nRevenue % of\nRevenue Revenue North America $ 1,329,843 $ 1,208,240 Europe 1,040,430 820,897 Specialty 351,792 314,934 Eliminations (1,301 ) (1,228 ) Total revenue $ 2,720,764 $ 2,342,843 Segment EBITDA North America $ 177,713 13.4 % $ 176,135 14.6 % Europe 75,534 7.3 % 78,694 9.6 % Specialty 41,969 11.9 % 35,441 11.3 % Total Segment EBITDA $ 295,216 10.9 % $ 290,270 12.4 % We have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. EBITDA, which is the basis for Segment EBITDA, is calculated as net income excluding noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest and income tax expense. Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses Segment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. We also consider Segment EBITDA to be a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance, as it provides investors, securities analysts and other interested parties with supplemental information regarding the underlying trends in our ongoing operations. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income to EBITDA and Segment EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands)\nNet income $ 152,763 $ 136,278 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (197 ) — Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 136,278 Subtract: Net loss from discontinued operations — (4,531 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 140,809 Add: Depreciation and amortization 56,458 48,656 Depreciation and amortization - cost of goods sold 4,608 1,948 Interest expense, net 28,515 23,988 Provision for income taxes 49,584 72,155 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 292,125 287,556 Subtract: Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 1,412 214 Add: Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 4,054 2,928 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related 403 — Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 46 — Segment EBITDA $ 295,216 $ 290,270 EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.7 % 12.3 % Segment EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 10.9 % 12.4 % We have presented EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our operating performance and the value of our business.

EBITDA provides insight into our profitability trends and allows management and investors to analyze our operating results with and without the impact of noncontrolling interest, discontinued operations, depreciation, amortization, interest and income tax expense. We believe EBITDA is used by investors, securities analysts and other interested parties in evaluating the operating performance and the value of other companies, many of which present EBITDA when reporting their results.\nWe have presented Segment EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure that offers investors, securities analysts and other interested parties useful information to evaluate our segment profit and loss and underlying trends in our ongoing operations. We calculate Segment EBITDA as EBITDA excluding restructuring and acquisition related expenses, change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, other acquisition related gains and losses and equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Our chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief Executive Officer, uses Segment EBITDA as the key measure of our segment profit or loss. We use Segment EBITDA to compare profitability among our segments and evaluate business strategies. Segment EBITDA includes revenue and expenses that are controllable by the segment. Corporate and administrative expenses are allocated to the segments based on usage, with shared expenses apportioned based on the segment's percentage of consolidated revenue.\nEBITDA and Segment EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to operating income, net income or net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In addition, not all companies that report EBITDA or Segment EBITDA information calculate EBITDA or Segment EBITDA in the same manner as we do and, accordingly, our calculations are not necessarily comparable to similarly named measures of other companies and may not be appropriate measures for performance relative to other companies.\nThe following unaudited table reconciles Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders, respectively:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands, except per share data) Net income $ 152,763 $ 136,278 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (197 ) — Net income attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 136,278 Subtract: Net loss from discontinued operations — (4,531 ) Net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders 152,960 140,809 Adjustments - continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Amortization of acquired intangibles 22,262 21,300 Restructuring and acquisition related expenses 4,054 2,928 Inventory step-up adjustment - acquisition related 403 — Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities 46 — Excess tax benefit from stock-based payments (2,641 ) (3,256 ) Tax effect of adjustments (6,959 ) (8,540 ) Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders $ 170,125 $ 153,241 Weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 311,347 310,300 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to LKQ stockholders: Reported $ 0.49 $ 0.45 Adjusted $ 0.55 $ 0.49 We have presented Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations Attributable to LKQ Stockholders as we believe these measures are useful for evaluating the core operating performance of our continuing business across reporting periods and in analyzing the company’s historical operating results.

The tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the effective tax rate for the applicable period or for certain discrete items the specific tax expense or benefit for the adjustment.
