Instead of having a phone line, you’re using (voice over internet services),” he said. “Everything is shifting to the digital twin alternative.”\nThe money enterprises used to spend on servers and hardware is now being spent on software-as-a-service, and companies now need fewer servers, backup, storage and networking equipment, Mr. Lovelock said. They’re also simplifying their network infrastructure with software instead of implementing large, complex systems, he said.\nWorldwide spending on data center systems is forecast to grow 3.7% in 2018 to $188 billion and has been on a decline, as prices ease for server memory components, according to the report.\nWorldwide spending on devices, which includes PCs, tablets and mobile phones, is forecast to grow 6.6% in 2018 to $706 billion. “We have fewer people buying new (devices), but we have them buying at a much higher price point,” Mr. Lovelock said.\nShare this: IT SPENDING Previous IT Hiring Slows in March Next  : IT Spending, Led by Software, on Track for Biggest Gain in Decade", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T00:34:03.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
