Spitcaufsky also serves on the board of directors of Chanticleer and is currently a 6% beneficial owner of Chanticleer’s common stock.\nLarry Spitcaufsky stated, “It’s exciting to see our collective efforts continue to yield tangible results with the opening of our second Southern California based Little Big Burger. We have a great brand, team and opportunity. My continuing commitment and belief in the value proposition of both Chanticleer Holdings and our Little Big Burger brand remains no better evidenced than by not only my sizeable personal investment in Chanticleer, but also my multi-location commitment involving the ultimate opening of an additional six locations.”\nMike Pruitt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chanticleer Holdings, commented, “We are excited to announce the grand opening of our second Little Big Burger on the West Coast with a partner like Larry who is not only an experienced restaurant owner, but who is also both a board member, as well as large investor in Chanticleer. We continue to look forward to further cultivating our partnership, focusing on building shareholder value, and gaining important scale through introducing our iconic brand to future additional local communities in Southern California.”\nThe value proposition of the Little Big Burger brand is unique and highly scalable. It is a fast-casual restaurant concept offering fresh, high quality cooked-to-order burgers operating out of a small leasehold footprint and leveraging a walk up counter set up which allows the Company to maximize operational efficiencies, while reducing operating expenses and typically yielding industry profit margins in the top 1% of all restaurants.\nA video about Little Big Burger may be viewed at the following link: http://www.chanticleerholdings.com/brands/littlebigburger/\nFor updated information, please follow Little Big Burger SoCal on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/Littlebigburgersocal/ and on Instagram @littlebigburgersocal\nAbout Little Big Burger\nLittle Big Burger (“LBB”) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chanticleer Holdings, Inc.
