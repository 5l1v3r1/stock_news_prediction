Most deaths are among babies and young children in the poorest parts of Africa. \nMainland Australia has been malaria-free for decades. \n“We have robust treatments for malaria in this country,” GOLDOC said. \nA number of athletes have fallen sick at the Games, including three from the same team who were quarantined for 48 hours after contracting influenza earlier in the week. \nThe New Zealand women’s rugby sevens team was placed in isolation after one of their players was diagnosed with mumps.
