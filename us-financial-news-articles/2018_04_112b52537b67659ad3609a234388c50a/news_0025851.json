REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa \nThe group said in a statement that it was “mourning its fighters who were martyred during preparations”. \nIt usually employs those terms to refer to casualties caused by the accidental detonation of weapons or explosives used in attacks against Israel. \nThe Gaza Health Ministry confirmed four fatalities in the incident. Medics at the scene in the Rafah area said the explosion was caused by Israel. But an Israeli military spokesman said the army was not involved.

Slideshow (2 Images) \nIsraeli troops have shot dead 31 Gaza Palestinians and wounded hundreds since the protests began, drawing international criticism of their lethal tactics. \nThe border area remained largely quiet on Saturday. \nProtesters have set up tented camps near the frontier as a protest dubbed “The Great March of Return” - evoking a longtime call for refugees to regain ancestral homes in what is now Israel - moved into its third week. \nIsrael has declared a no-go zone close to the Gaza border fence. \nIsrael withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinian enclave is ruled by the Islamist Hamas movement, designated by Israel and the West as a terrorist group. \nCiting security concerns, Israel maintains a naval blockade of the coastal territory, keeping tight restrictions on the movement of Palestinians and goods across the frontier. \nEgypt, battling an Islamist insurgency in neighboring Sinai, keeps its border with Gaza largely closed.
