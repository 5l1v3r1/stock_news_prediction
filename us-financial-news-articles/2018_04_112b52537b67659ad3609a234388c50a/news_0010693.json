The song also saw a 36% increase in downloads the week after the video was uploaded, according to Billboard , and gained 1.9 million on-demand streams. \nOf course, this is not the first time a meme has caused the resurgence of a song—countless people have been forced to listen to Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” as a result of being ‘ rickrolled .’ \nMoral of the story: never underestimate the branding power of a good meme.
