U.S. crude gained 26 cents to $68.73.\nThe surge came on a Reuters report that OPEC’s new price hawk Saudi Arabia would be happy for crude to rise to $80 or even $100, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to a supply-cutting deal even though the agreement’s original target is within sight.\n“The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold – and costly – reform program,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader.\n“So, they might continue to squeeze the lemon while they have the chance and the hand.”\nThe leap in oil combined with fears that sanctions on Russia could hit supplies of other commodities to light a fire under the entire sector. Aluminium prices reached their highest since 2011, alumina touched an all-time peak and nickel jumped the most in 6-1/2 years.\nSuch increases, if sustained, could fuel inflationary pressures and investors hedged by selling sovereign bonds.\nYields on U.S. two-year Treasuries stood at levels last visited in 2008 at 2.43 percent.\nEXTRA ENERGY Resource stocks were the big winners driving Australia’s main index up 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.6 percent, led by a 2.9 percent rise in basic materials.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.8 percent, with energy up over 2 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent.\nWall Street had also seen hefty gains in the energy and industrial indexes, though that was offset by softness in sectors such as consumer staples and financials.\nIBM’s 7.5 percent drop was the biggest drag on the S&P after the technology company’s quarterly profit margins missed Wall Street targets.\nThe Dow ended down 0.16 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.08 percent and the Nasdaq 0.19 percent.\nIn currency markets, the U.S. dollar remained range bound with its index a fraction firmer at 89.647. It gained a touch on the yen to 107.40 yen, but stayed short of recent peaks at 107.78.\nThe euro hovered at $1.2384, within striking distance of the week’s top of $1.2413.\nThe Australian dollar took a brief knock after jobs data proved unexpectedly soft in March, with employment rising by a meagre 4,900.\nSterling nursed its losses at $1.4195 after a surprisingly tame reading on UK inflation led the market to reconsider the likely pace of future rate rises from the Bank of England.\nData out on New Zealand on Thursday showed annual inflation there had slowed to just 1.1 percent in the first quarter, underlining expectations that interest rates would remain at record lows for many more months to come.\nEditing by Sam Holmes & Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:18:08.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
