Fischer later became vice chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve.\nFrenkel was forced to withdraw his candidacy due to what at the time he called an “unfortunate toxic and poisonous environment created by the media”.\nIsraeli media said Frenkel, currently chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, had been briefly detained at Hong Kong airport in 2006 on suspicion of shoplifting.\nFrenkel said the incident was a misunderstanding.\nThe Hong Kong Department of Justice said they had decided not to proceed with the case and charges were dropped.\nFischer’s deputy Flug became Bank of Israel governor. Her first five-year term ends in October and Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, who also has some say in choosing the next governor, said last month that a search for a new governor would begin after the Passover holiday that ended on Saturday.\nFlug has clashed with Kahlon numerous times since he became finance minister three years ago, mainly on fiscal policy and his affinity for lowering taxes.\nOn Tuesday, Flug said she was undecided on whether to stand for a second term although she played down Kahlon’s importance.\n“There are still seven months until my first term ends,” Flug said. “I haven’t yet thought about it and I have not spoken with the prime minister on that possibility.” (Reporting by Steven Scheer Editing by Hugh Lawson)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:56:35.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
