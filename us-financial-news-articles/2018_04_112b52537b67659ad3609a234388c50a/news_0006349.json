Reuters could not immediately confirm that report.\nPolice in San Bruno warned people in a Twitter message to stay away from the address where YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc's Google, is based.\n\"We are responding to an active shooter. Please stay away from Cherry Ave & Bay Hill Drive,\" San Bruno police said on Twitter.\nLisa Kim, a spokeswoman for Stanford Health Care, said the hospital was receiving between four to five patients from the shooting incident at the YouTube offices.\nEmployees who evacuated the YouTube office and nearby buildings huddled under trees in parking lots.\nA YouTube product manager, Todd Sherman, described on his Twitter feed hearing people running, first thinking it was an earthquake before he was told that a person had a gun.\n\"At that point every new person I saw was a potential shooter. Someone else said that the person shot out the back doors and then shot themselves,\" Sherman said on Twitter.\n\"I looked down and saw blood drips on the floor and stairs. Peaked around for threats and then we headed downstairs and out the front,\" Sherman said.\nGoogle told NBC news in a written statement that it was coordinating with local authorities.\n\"Customers said they heard what could have been gunshots when they were on their way here,\" Natalie Mangiante, an employee at Big Mouth Burgers located near the YouTube building, said by phone. Mangiante said she did not see or notice anything.\nLocal television images showed YouTube employees walking out of the building with their hands raised.\nLast month, YouTube announced it would ban content promoting the sale of guns and gun accessories as well as videos that teach how to make guns.
