(It’s) unlikely that we could consider extradition for this type of offence.”\nTeeroovengadum, 52, was expelled from the athletes’ village and had his Games accreditation canceled during the week.\nRosun intended to compete in the javelin event on April 11, a Mauritius sports ministry spokesman told Reuters.\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T06:29:57.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
