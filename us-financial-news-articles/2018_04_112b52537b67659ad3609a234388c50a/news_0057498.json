REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo DEVELOPING MARKETS SHINE In contrast to North America, first-quarter sales in Latin American markets rose 14 percent, while those in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa gained 15 percent.\nSales in Asia, the Middle East and North Africa were up 7 percent.\nThe company’s Frito-Lay snacking business in North America did better than beverages, rising 3.4 percent in the quarter, although it missed expectations of 4 percent growth. The Quaker business - which includes the eponymous porridge oats - showed flat sales in North America due to cuts in pricing.\n“All North American units miss (but) LatAm (was) surprisingly strong,” Evercore ISI analyst Robert Ottenstein said.\nExcluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 4.3 percent to $12.56 billion, topping analysts’ estimate of $12.40 billion.\nPepsiCo also stuck to its full-year 2018 guidance.\nReporting by Nivedita Balu and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and Sriraj Kalluvila\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:21:09.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
