I don’t care about the rest.” \nThe 25-year-old has scored 30 goals in 32 league appearances for Liverpool in his debut season at the club and is a favourite to win the Professional Footballers’ Association Player of the Year award. \nLiverpool play West Bromwich Albion in the league on April 21 before the first leg of their Champions League tie, three days later.
