Bush, and mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush, died on Tuesday at the age of 92.\nAfter the funeral at St. Martin’s Episcopal Church in Houston, Bush will be buried on Saturday on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Library and Museum at Texas A&M University in College Station, about 100 miles (160 km) away, the university said.\nShe will be buried beside her daughter, Robin, who died at the age of 3 after battling leukemia, the university said in a statement late on Tuesday.\nFirst lady Melania Trump will attend the funeral, her office said on Wednesday. The White House has not yet said whether President Donald Trump will attend.\nFlags flew at half-staff at the White House and the U.S. Capitol in Bush’s honor.\nFILE PHOTO: Former U.S. first lady Barbara Bush acknowledges the cheers from the crowd as she speaks before the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., August 1, 2000. REUTERS/Andy Clark/File Photo On Friday, she will lay in repose at St. Martin’s, which will be open to members of the public wishing to pay their respects, the Houston church said on its website.\nReverend Russ Levinson, senior pastor at St. Martin’s, told the local Fox affiliate in Houston that the church had about 250 members when the Bushes began attending services there, and would often serve coffee on Sunday mornings.\n“Both of them taught in our Sunday school program. Both of them have been involved in our outreach ministries,” he said. The church has grown to about 9,300 members to become the largest Episcopal church in North America, according to its website.\nThe Bush family had said in a statement on Sunday that she was in failing health and would not seek further medical treatment.\nAnn Shumard, senior curator of photographs, speaks with journalists about a photograph of former First Lady Barbara Bush at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2018.

She was a major influence on husband John Adams, the nation’s second president, but died before son John Quincy Adams was elected president in 1824.\nReporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; additional reporting by Steve Holland in Washington; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:53:17.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
