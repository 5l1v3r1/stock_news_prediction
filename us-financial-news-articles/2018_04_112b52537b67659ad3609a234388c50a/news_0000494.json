(NYSE American: YUMA) (the \"Company\" or \"Yuma\") today announced its financial results for the 2017.\nYear End 2017 Highlights\nYuma spud its first San Andres horizontal well in December 2017 and completed it during the first quarter of 2018. All of the associated facilities have been installed and the well is currently in the early stages of production, recovering frac fluids and dewatering the near wellbore area. Net average production for the 2017 was 2,454 Boe/d, or 34.8% higher than the net average production for the prior year of 1,820 Boe/d. Yuma reduced its debt by $11.8 million during 2017, bringing its bank debt down to $27.7 million. Yuma closed its common stock offering of 10,100,000 shares of common stock in October 2017 (including 500,000 shares purchased pursuant to the underwriters' overallotment option) for gross proceeds of $10,100,000 before deducting underwriters' fees and offering expenses.\nManagement Comments\nSam L. Banks, CEO of Yuma Energy, Inc., commented, \"We are looking forward to the results of our first San Andres horizontal well, and continuing to expand our position in the play. During 2018, we intend to take advantage of the low-risk and low-cost growth opportunities within our existing inventory, continue the development and expansion of our San Andres play, and actively pursue acquisitions and mergers.\"\nOil and Natural Gas Reserves â€“ SEC Prices\nThe table below summarizes the Company's estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017, which were prepared in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") guidelines by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (\"NSAI\"), an independent petroleum engineering firm. In preparing its report, NSAI evaluated 100% of the Company's properties at December 31, 2017.\nProved reserves were calculated using prices equal to the twelve-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month prices for each of the preceding twelve months, which were $51.34 per Bbl West Texas Intermediate and $2.976 per MMBtu Henry Hub, for the 2017.

Statements that are not strictly historical statements constitute forward-looking statements and may often, but not always, be identified by the use of such words such as \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"intends,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" \"potential,\" \"possible,\" or \"probable\" or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" or \"could\" be taken, occur or be achieved. The forward-looking statements include statements about future operations, and estimates of reserve and production volumes. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with expectations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the risks of the oil and natural gas industry (for example, operational risks in exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas); risks and uncertainties involving geology of oil and natural gas deposits; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; revisions to reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to future production, costs and expenses; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; health, safety and environmental risks and risks related to weather; declines in oil and natural gas prices; inability of management to execute its plans to meet its goals, shortages of drilling equipment, oil field personnel and services, unavailability of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities and the possibility that government policies may change. The Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the 2017, and other SEC filings discuss some of the important risk factors identified that may affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.

These disclosures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Further, this non-GAAP measure should only be considered in conjunction with financial statements and disclosures prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, such as net income or loss, operating income or loss, standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or any other GAAP measure of financial position or results of operations.\nPV10\nPresent Value Discounted at 10% (\"PV10\") is a Non-GAAP measure that differs from the GAAP measure \"standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\" in that PV10 is calculated without regard to future income taxes. Management believes that the presentation of the PV10 value is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the estimated discounted future net cash flows attributable to the Company's estimated proved reserves independent of its income tax attributes, thereby isolating the intrinsic value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the Company's reserves. Because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid, the Company believes the use of a pre-tax measure provides greater comparability of assets when evaluating companies. For these reasons, management uses, and believes the industry generally uses, the PV10 measure in evaluating and comparing acquisition candidates and assessing the potential return on investment related to investments in oil and natural gas properties. PV10 does not necessarily represent the fair market value of oil and natural gas properties.\nPV10 is not a measure of financial or operational performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. The table below provides a reconciliation of the Company's PV10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows ($ in thousands).\nPresent value of estimated future net revenues (PV10)\n$ 72,903\nFuture income taxes discounted at 10%\n-\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n$ 72,903\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yuma-energy-inc-announces-2017-financial-results-300622843.html\nSOURCE Yuma Energy, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yuma-energy-inc-announces-2017-financial-results-300622843.html"], "published": "2018-04-03T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T01:46:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
