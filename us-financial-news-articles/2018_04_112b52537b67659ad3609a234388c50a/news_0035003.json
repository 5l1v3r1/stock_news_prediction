The same is true of asset managers. We, too, need to intensify our efforts to help deliver long-term value for clients by actively engaging with companies and regulators.” ($1 = 0.6982 pounds) (Reporting by Simon Jessop Editing by Alexander Smith)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T10:20:25.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
