Consumers should keep stay on top of activity on their accounts well after a breach happens, as ensuing fraud doesn't always happen immediately. Published 1 Hour Ago CNBC.com \nShoppers at Lord & Taylor, Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks OFF 5th stores could have gotten more than they bargained for following news of a data breach at those retailers. \nNews of the intrusion, affecting 5 million card holders at the brands, which are owned by Hudson's Bay Company, emerged over the weekend. \nThe attack affected card payments made in some of the retailers' stores in North America. The company said it does not believe its e-commerce and digital platforms were affected.

Those organizations will often provide helpful services that consumers can use to help mitigate the effects on their personal information. \n\"We wanted to reach out to our customers quickly to assure them that they will not be liable for fraudulent charges that may result from this matter,\" Hudson's Bay said in a statement. \"Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring.\" show chapters 6 Hours Ago | 03:17 \nIf you think you were affected by this breach, you can check the websites for Saks Fifth Avenue , Saks OFF 5th and Lord & Taylor for more information. You can also phone the company's call center, starting from April 4, at 855-270-9187. \nSo far, there is no evidence that consumers' Social Security numbers or driver's license numbers have been compromised, according to the company. Consider a fraud alert or credit freeze \nCurtail thieves' ability to open new lines of credit in your name by setting up a fraud alert or by freezing your credit altogether with the three major credit reporting firms â€” Experian, Equifax and TransUnion. \nA fraud alert notifies those companies that your information may have fallen into the wrong hands. As a result, they will take extra steps to verify that any applications for credit in your name are legit. \nA fraud alert, however, does not block access to your credit report, noted Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. Access to that information can be blocked by setting up a credit freeze. \nMore from Personal Finance:", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T22:00:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
