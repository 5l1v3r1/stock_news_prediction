The worst of these have not only failed to provide treatment, but have encouraged ongoing drug abuse in patients trying to break the habit,\" Horton wrote.\n\"We hope that our program will help provide patients and our partners (like Google) information about which programs provide genuine treatment and which are, in essence, scams.\"\n\nGoogle made $27.27 billion in revenue from advertising in the fourth quarter of 2017.
