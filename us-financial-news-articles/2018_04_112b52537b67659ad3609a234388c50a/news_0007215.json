Inventories are expected to have risen by 1.7 million barrels in the week to March 30.\nMoney managers raised their bets on a sustained price rise in Brent crude to the highest level on record last week, bringing total long holdings of futures and options to the equivalent of more than 615 million barrels.\n\"With excessive hedge fund positions still looming over the market, profit-taking should weigh on oil prices over the coming weeks,\" Julius Baer head of commodities and macro research Norbert Ruecker said.\nThere was also pressure coming from the physical market, where top exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to cut prices for all the crude grades it sells to Asia in May, while output from Russia, the world's largest producer, hit an 11-month high.\nPrices for physical barrels of oil in the North Sea are around their lowest since last June, as extensive refinery maintenance across the region eats into demand.
