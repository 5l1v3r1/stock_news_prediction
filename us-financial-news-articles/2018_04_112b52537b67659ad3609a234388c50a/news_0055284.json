Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $13 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $21 million for the first quarter of 2017.\n“Our Coffeyville fertilizer plant performed extremely well during the 2018 first quarter, posting on-stream rates of 100 percent for gasification, 99.8 percent for ammonia and 99.2 percent for UAN,” said Mark Pytosh, chief executive officer. “Operations at our East Dubuque plant were interrupted by 12 days of unplanned downtime related to a boiler feed water coil leak.\n“While late snowfall and lingering winter temperatures delayed the start of the spring planting season, we continue to anticipate a strong application period with solid demand driven by lower than normal customer inventory levels and an estimated 88 million planted corn acres.”\nConsolidated Operations\nFor the first quarter of 2018, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $153 per ton and $322 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $160 per ton and $308 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2017.\nCVR Partners’ fertilizer facilities produced a combined 199,000 tons of ammonia during the first quarter of 2018, of which 59,000 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 339,000 tons of UAN. In the 2017 first quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 219,000 tons of ammonia, of which 80,000 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 342,000 tons of UAN.\nDistributions\nCVR Partners will not pay a cash distribution for the 2018 first quarter. CVR Partners is a variable distribution master limited partnership. As a result, its quarterly distributions, if any, will vary from quarter to quarter due to several factors, including, but not limited to, its operating performance, fluctuations in the prices received for its finished products, maintenance capital expenditures, and cash reserves deemed necessary or appropriate by the board of directors of its general partner.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Partners previously announced that it will host its 2018 first quarter Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, April 26, at 11 a.m. Eastern.
