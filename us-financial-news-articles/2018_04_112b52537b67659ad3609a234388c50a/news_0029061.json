CFO Arnd Zinnhardt said he expected a similar headwind, of about 7 percent, in the second quarter.\nSoftware AG raised the 2018 outlook for growth in its new IoT/Cloud business line to 100-135 percent from 70-100 percent, following sales of 14.9 million euros in 2017.\nIt reiterated its forecast for growth of between 3 and 7 percent in its Digital Business Platform, which achieved sales of 441.5 million euros last year, and for operating margins of 30-32 percent.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T19:43:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
