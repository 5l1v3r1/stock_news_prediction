But it could see a rebound if its use in a chemotherapy-sparing regimen with Opdivo increases. The combination recently won U.S. approval to treat advanced kidney cancer.\nRevenue for the quarter rose 5 percent to $5.2 billion with help from a favorable foreign exchange environment, in line with expectations.\nThe company said net profit for the quarter slipped to $1.5 billion, or 91 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year ago due to expenses associated with a recently-announced collaboration deal.\nHelped by the new U.S. tax law, Bristol-Myers projected an effective 2018 tax rate of 17 percent to 18 percent, below its previous estimate of about 20 percent.\nIt also said research and development costs and marketing, selling and administrative expenses decreased in the quarter.
