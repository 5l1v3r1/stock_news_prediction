REUTERS/Toby Melville \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said financial firms should feel comfortable about relying on a transition deal agreed last month between Britain and the EU. \nThis covers the period between Britain’s planned departure from the bloc next March and the end of 2020, but EU officials say this was a political deal and will not be legally ratified until at least later in the year. \nFirms should therefore press ahead with plans in case of a “hard” Brexit next March, such as setting up new EU hubs. \n“It’s important that we have regulatory engagement now because we are dealing with practical issues... and they affect both sides,” FCA Chief Executive Andrew Bailey said. \nHe told a news conference to discuss the watchdog’s latest business plan that he wants coordination to avoid disruption to derivatives and insurance contracts that straddle borders. \nStarting coordination now would mean a framework is ready once transition has been legally ratified, Bailey said. COSTS OF BREXIT \nThe FCA said it will need to spend about 30 million pounds on dealing with the broad impact of Brexit on the financial sector and cut back or delay some areas of work. \nOne new area, however, is a report due from the watchdog in the third quarter on regulating cryptocurrencies.
