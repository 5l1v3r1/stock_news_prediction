The international growth continues, and at the same time, more people are flying with us in Scandinavia,” Chief Executive Bjoern Kjos said.\nThe company’s passenger capacity grew by 44 percent in March from the same month of 2017, while the load factor increased to 86.7 percent, beating the 84.9 percent predicted by analysts.\nNorwegian’s yield, or revenues per passenger kilometre, rose to 0.35 Norwegian crowns, as expected, from 0.31 crowns in February and 0.34 crowns a year ago.\nThe combination of a higher yield and strong growth would boost March revenues by 54 percent year-on-year, broker Pareto Securities said, adding that this was eight percent more than expected.\nNorwegian’s shares traded 4.7 percent higher for the day at 0706 GMT, beating a 0.6 percent drop in Oslo’s benchmark stock index.
