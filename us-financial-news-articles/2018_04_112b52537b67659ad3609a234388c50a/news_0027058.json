The French military on Saturday targeted Syria's main chemicals research centre as well as two other facilities, hours after President Emmanuel Macron ordered a military intervention in Syria alongside the United States and Britain in an attack on the chemical weapons arsenal. Michel Euler/Pool via Reuters Parly said some of the strikes had targeted two sites used by Bashar al-Assad’s regime to store and assemble chemical weapons near the Syrian city of Homs.\n“The mission is a success. The goals had been carefully chosen and I observe that there are no incidents to report between our forces and other forces active in the region,” Parly told a news conference.\nFrench army chief Francois Lecointre added Syria’s ground-to-air defense system had been effective but that its efficiency proved “very limited.” Russian assets deployed in Syria were “neither active nor proactive” he said.\nHe added that there was no reason to think there could have been any collateral victim.\nWriting by Matthias Blamont; Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T02:59:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
