The role will focus on leading Zerto’s global sales team and building on this year’s record-breaking growth.\nZerto’s total cloud and enterprise sales in Q1 2018 have far surpassed total cloud and enterprise sales in Q1 2017. Carter joins Zerto to build on this momentum. He and the sales team will focus on acquiring new customers, growing enterprise and existing accounts and building Zerto’s partner GTM strategy to increase strategic partner revenue and deepen relationships across the company’s partner ecosystem. Carter will also be instrumental in an aggressive growth strategy as Zerto continues to build itself into a world-class company.\nCarter’s experience spans F200 companies to high-growth start-ups. Most recently, Carter was at Sprinklr, where he was senior vice president of field operations and drove cross-functional GTM strategy for sales, pre-sales, enablement and success teams. Prior to Sprinklr, he was senior vice president of Americas sales for VCE, a division of Dell EMC, formed by Cisco, EMC and VMware, that became the global market leader in converged / hyper-converged infrastructure solutions, achieving the 3rd-fastest ever attainment of $1 billion in annual sales. While at VCE, he was instrumental in driving both operational excellence and sales productivity. Carter has also held sales leadership roles at IBM and Cognos, where his teams consistently attained significant YoY growth.\nIn addition to experiencing tremendous sales growth, Zerto’s channel program has also expanded over the last 15 months, with the introduction of many new partners, such as Sungard Availability Services and Insight Direct, as well as expansion of Zerto’s partnership with IBM, now serving as the replication engine of the IBM resiliency DRaaS solution , and Microsoft, to deliver multi-cloud IT resilience. Plus, the company more than doubled the number of partners certified on selling and delivering the Zerto platform. Underpinning this growth are two recent awards Zerto has received from top channel industry publication CRN, one of which names Zerto’s Director of Global Alliances Peter Kerr as a CRN 2018 Channel Chief and the second, which calls out Zerto as a 5-Star Cloud Vendor in CRN’s 2018 Partner Program Guide .\nSupporting Quote: s\n“Ed will be an incredible asset to the Zerto team, bringing us valuable enterprise sales experience and a proven track record in sales strategies and leadership,” said Ziv Kedem, CEO, Zerto. “We were drawn to Ed because he’s proven himself to be successful at every level and has a reputation of making those around him better. He’s not afraid to raise the bar and challenge himself and his teams to achieve lofty goals. Ed is a great addition to the Zerto family, and we welcome him with enthusiasm during this exciting period of growth.”\nAbout Zerto\nZerto helps customers accelerate IT transformation by eliminating the risk and complexity of modernization and cloud adoption.
