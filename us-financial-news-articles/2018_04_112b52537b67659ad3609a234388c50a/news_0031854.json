Only 27 percent of Americans call the law passed in December a good idea, while 36 percent think it is a bad idea, according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week. In a January poll, 30 percent of those surveyed thought it was a good idea, while 38 percent said it was a bad idea.\nHowever, top Republicans who spoke to CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday argued that the plan's popularity should improve by November. The GOP has billed the law as its signature achievement during the first year of Republican control of Capitol Hill and the White House. It chops tax rates for corporations and trims taxes on many, but not all, individuals.\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , whom Rep. Paul Ryan has endorsed to succeed him as speaker, told CNBC he believes voters will begin to understand the benefits of the law by the midterm elections. He even mused about the possibility of moving tax filing day to November instead of April so it is fresh in voters' minds.\nCameron Costa | CNBC Kevin McCarthy Democrats, driven by an enthusiastic base opposed to many policies proposed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, are pushing to flip 23 Republican seats and win the House majority in November. McCarthy said voters have a choice between the new GOP tax code and one pushed by Democrats, who may try to return some tax rates on the wealthy to the pre-GOP law levels if they win the House.\n\"I think this is a healthy discussion they can have and a healthy debate, and at the end of the day, we're going to win it,\" the California Republican said.\nMeanwhile, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , R-Texas, argued that voters have a \"clear choice\" in November between the Republican law and the previous tax system.\nAs many Americans scrambled to file their taxes Tuesday under the old tax code, Trump joined in on the GOP messaging. He tweeted: \"Employment is up, taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!\"\nTrump tweet\nRepublicans say the tax law will grow the economy, pointing to one-time bonuses or wage increases announced by many companies. Democrats have said it helps corporations at the expense of middle class and working families.\nThe law makes corporate cuts permanent, but individual cuts are only temporary. Republicans have said they want to make household tax reductions permanent.\nDemocrats have also raised concerns about the estimated $1 trillion or more the cuts are expected to add to budget deficits over a decade.
