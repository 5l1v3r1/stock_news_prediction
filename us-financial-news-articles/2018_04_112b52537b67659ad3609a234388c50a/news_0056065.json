Dr. Gebauer studied medicine at Johann Gutenberg University, Mainz/Germany, where he completed his thesis in pharmacology.\nAbout OMEICOS\nOMEICOS Therapeutics is a spin-off company from the Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin. The company has discovered a series of metabolically robust synthetic analogues of omega-3 fatty acid-derived epoxyeicosanoids that have the potential to treat inflammatory, cardiovascular and other diseases. Epoxyeicosanoids, as a newly described class of bioactive lipid mediators, activate cell type-specific endogenous pathways that promote organ and tissue protection. OMEICOS’ small molecules are orally available and show improved biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties compared to their natural counterparts. OMEICOS’ technology is based on ground-breaking scientific results in the field of omega-3 fatty acid metabolism and physiology obtained by the companies’ founders, Dr. Wolf-Hagen Schunck, Prof. John. R. Falck, Prof. Dominik Mueller and Dr. Robert Fischer. The companies’ research activities are supported by a grant from the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). www.omeicos.com\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180427005095/en/\nOMEICOS Therapeutics GmbH\nDr. Robert Fischer, +49 (0) 30 9489 4810\nCEO, CSO\nr.fischer@omeicos.com\nwww.omeicos.com\nor\nMedia:\nMacDougall Biomedical Communications\nMario Brkulj or Kara Mazey\n+49 89 2424 3494 or +1 781-235-3060\nomeicos@macbiocom.com\nSource: OMEICOS Therapeutics", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omeicos.com&esheet=51796603&lan=en-US&anchor=www.omeicos.com&index=3&md5=10379156ce8403db8bf952a704b2c957", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omeicos.com&esheet=51796603&newsitemid=20180427005095&lan=en-US&anchor=www.omeicos.com&index=2&md5=bddb887fcd9a6ba3a35ac92c485f817f", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180427005095/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omeicos.com%2Fmedia-news%2Fnews%2F167-omeicos-secures-extension-of-series-b-financing-round-to-expand-its-technology-into-ophthalmology&esheet=51796603&newsitemid=20180427005095&lan=en-US&anchor=OMEICOS+Ophthalmics&index=1&md5=12cda91fa6bd078ab1158522b77bad8b"], "published": "2018-04-27T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:06:37.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
