Soccer Football - Premier League - West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - April 21, 2018 West Bromwich Albion's Salomon Rondon celebrates scoring their second goal Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers \nThe visitors appeared to have half an eye on Tuesday’s Champions League semi-final against AS Roma but still established a comfortable lead through Danny Ings and Mo Salah. \nIngs’s goal after just four minutes was his first in the Premier League since October 2015. The striker should have had a second soon afterwards and probably been awarded a penalty after being bundled over by Craig Dawson.

Slideshow (11 Images) \nAlbion’s caretaker manager Darren Moore has, however, injected resilience into his side and, with Liverpool’s defence suddenly displaying their early-season sloppiness, Jake Livermore scrambled a goal from a corner after 79 minutes to give Albion hope. \nThe equaliser followed another set piece late on when Chris Brunt delivered a perfect freekick into the area for Rondon to head home. \nLiverpool manager Juergen Klopp, who had rested five players going into the game, complained that the pitch was too dry. “It makes a massive difference,” said a visibly downbeat Klopp, whose team are still not guaranteed a top-four finish. \nKlopp complained they did not get the “right decisions” on the penalty and the foul from Joe Gomez that led to Rondon’s goal. \nAlbion’s Livermore accepted that relegation remained almost inevitable with the bottom-of-the-table team eight points off survival with three games to play. “All we can do is keep fighting,” he said. \nHis team mate Ahmed Hegazi may face retrospective action from the FA after television cameras clearly caught him punching Ings after a tackle.
