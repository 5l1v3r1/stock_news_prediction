According to TIP’s 2017 annual report, HNA is currently the company’s owner.\nBased in Amsterdam, TIP rents trailers for hauling cargo and provides related services such as leasing and maintenance aimed at the trucking industry. It operates 84 locations across 17 countries in Europe including the U.K., France, Italy and Germany as well as Canada.\nHNA bought TIP to complement its existing transportation businesses in aviation, aircraft and sea container leasing and financing. The purchase was also part of a debt-fueled overseas acquisitions spree across industries ranging from hotels to airports.\nSince November, however, HNA has pivoted toward selling assets as it seeks to service its debt of more than $100 billion and shed businesses considered speculative by Chinese authorities.\nHNA has focused much of this effort on its holdings in the financial services and hospitality sectors. The company disclosed this month it had cut its stake in Deutsche Bank AG to 7.9% from 8.8%. HNA initially held just under 10% of the German bank in 2017.\nThe company also generated a significant profit from share sales in Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and two related operations: timeshare business Hilton Grand Vacations Inc. and Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., which owns airport hotels, convention centers and resorts.\nHNA has been garnering interest for its most attractive assets. TIP generated €517 million ($626.7 million) last year in revenue, up nearly 39% from 2015, according to the trailer-leasing company’s latest annual report. Operating profit gained close to 29% to €49 million over that period.\nTIP is targeting annual revenue of €1 billion by 2020 through a combination of acquisitions and expanding existing operations, according to the annual report.\nBased in New York, I Squared invests in infrastructure projects, targeting the transportation, energy and utilities sectors in North America and Europe, among other regions. It beat out three other bidders for TIP, according to some of the people familiar with the matter, underscoring the overall healthy appetite for infrastructure investments.\nGlobally, firms that invest in projects ranging from utilities to bridges had a total of $150 billion of cash to invest as of June 2017, according to Preqin, a data provider.\nI Squared’s recent investments include its $1.86 billion purchase last year of the fixed-line telecommunications business of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.\nWrite to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com and Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T03:21:02.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
