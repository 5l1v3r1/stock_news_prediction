Achleitner is obviously not controlling the process. All is a bit chaotic at the moment.”\nBoth Chief Executive John Cryan and Achleitner have been criticised for Deutsche Bank’s share price and earnings.\nHowever Achleitner, rather than Cryan, should take the fall, said the second shareholder, who also declined to be named.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Achleitner’s behalf.
