Lopez Obrador is ahead by double digits in all major polls and the peso fell 2 percent in just one day in April, hit by political risk.\n“These are not ‘business as usual’ times: there’s much at stake for Mexico in this election,” Bimbo’s Chief Executive Daniel Servitje told an earnings call. “The current situation...demands a cautious stance.”\nExchange rate uncertainty pushed retailer Liverpool to order all the imported products needed for its discount clothing stores Suburbia for the second half of the year.\nIts Liverpool department stores have covered 50 percent of imported merchandise needed for the second half of 2018 and even the first half of 2019, the company said.\nJuan Fonseca, head of investor relations at bottler and retailer Femsa, one of Mexico’s largest companies, said encouraging signs from falling inflation and wage growth were being overshadowed by the fragility of the peso due to political risk.\n“Between now and the election, clearly things are going to be volatile,” he told an analyst call. “There are more data points that would support a cautious case.”\nPreliminary gross domestic product (GDP) data for the first quarter on Monday showed year on year growth of 1.2 percent, driven by a jump in the service sector.\nAnalysts predict Mexico’s gross domestic product will grow 2.3 percent this year as manufacturing activity improves.\nHowever, Scotiabank analysts warned in a recent report that NAFTA and the election could have a significant impact on economic performance. TOUGH END TO THE YEAR\nPolitical leaders from the United States, Mexico and Canada say an initial deal to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is close but issues remain. Negotiations in Washington have been paused until May 7.\nMexican companies fear that scrapping the trade pact, as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to do, or renegotiating the deal in a way that hinders the Mexican economy would hit their earnings. Around 80 percent of Mexican exports go to the United States.\nExecutives at Unifin - which leases equipment and vehicles to mid-sized manufacturing, services and construction companies - said clients postponed business decisions every time they saw news suggesting cancellation of NAFTA.\nMexican cement companies Grupo Cementos Chihuahua and Elementia both warned of a tough second half of the year.\nElementia said government spending on projects was “practically nonexistent” and the private sector was nervous.\n“Consumption might stay, but personally, I don’t think it will grow in the second semester,” CEO Fernando Benjamin Ruiz said.\nSeveral companies, including GCC and Mexican bank Banregio , linked their guidance to the outcome of NAFTA and the election.\nPaper maker Kimberley Clark de Mexico warned that volumes could be hit by the uncertainty, while airlines Volaris and Aeromexico said it could change customers’ behavior.\nThe chief executive of Monterrey-based bottler Arca said that while the economy remained very robust in northern Mexico, a good year depended partly on the fate of the trade pact.\n“If NAFTA is finally agreed...we definitely will see a good year in volume,” Francisco Rogelio Garza said.\nAnalysts at MRB Research and Barclays suggested, however, that markets may not yet be pricing the risks of Lopez Obrador winning the presidency.\nThe former Mexico City mayor, running on an anti-corruption platform, has threatened to cancel a project for a $13 billion airport in the capital and review a major energy reform.\nA victory by Lopez Obrador, known as AMLO, would spell volatility in equities and the peso, Barclays said, adding it would be worrying for sectors from infrastructure and banks to construction.\n“The assumption that AMLO’s bark is worse than his bite has been drifting into an even more complacent argument: that a populist leader is no bad outcome in the short term, implying fiscal thrust and more growth,” MRB Research said.
