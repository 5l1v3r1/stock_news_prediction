It did not provide any reason.\nHowever, the exchange re-instated the suspension on the shares before close of trading on Wednesday following a counter directive from the SEC, it said in a statement.\nIt later then said it had resolved the suspension issue in the interest of investors and that trading on Oando would resume on Thursday.\n“Following consultation with the commission ... trading in Oando’s shares will resume without any impediment in price movement,” the exchange said.\nIn October, SEC said it received two petitions about financial mismanagement by Oando that alleged that transactions were not conducted at arm’s length and that there were discrepancies in its ownership structure.\nThe SEC has said a team of auditors, lawyers, stockbrokers and share registrars would conduct a forensic audit of Oando to ensure independence. Accountancy firm Deloitte has been appointed to handle the audit.\nIn January, the company said it has settled a dispute with a key shareholder and was working on resolving remaining shareholder disputes and getting a suspension of its shares lifted.\nReporting by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:36:54.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
