It must take an active role supporting its diplomatic allies,” Ngo said in a statement.\nA spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland did not comment directly on the Senate motion, but said Canada remained concerned by regional tensions associated with disputes in the South China Sea.\n“It is essential that all states in the region exercise restraint and avoid coercion and actions that will escalate tensions,” the spokesman, Adam Austen, said in an email.\nThe motion passed Canada’s upper house of parliament 43-28, with six abstentions.\nThe Chinese embassy in Ottawa said in a statement that Ngo was trying to “stir up troubles” in a situation that has been calm.\n“This is irresponsible. His purpose is nothing but casting shadows over the China-Canada relations which develop smoothly currently,” the embassy said.\nChina has repeatedly defended the work, saying it has every right to build on what it considers inherent Chinese territory and that it is building public facilities, like weather stations and typhoon harbors.\nThe motion was opposed by a group of independent senators who said it was already out of date when it was introduced two years ago and runs contrary to Canada’s interests in Asia.\nSenators are appointed on the advice of the prime minister and can serve until 75. Opinion polls consistently show voters would like to see the Senate abolished or reformed.\nReporting by Andrea Hopkins; Editing by David Gregorio and Scott Malone\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:20:03.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
