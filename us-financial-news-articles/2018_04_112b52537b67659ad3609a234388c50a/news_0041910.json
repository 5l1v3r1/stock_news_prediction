He asserts that Trump used a fake voice and pseudonym of \"John Barron\" to convince the magazine that he should be on the Forbes 400 list. \nGreenberg said \"Barron\" called him in May 1984 to persuade him to push up his estimate of Trump's wealth. The caller had a thicker New York accent and some different \"cadences,\" but Greenberg is certain he was speaking to the future president. The calls were off the record, but Greenberg believes exposing them now is important. \nIn addition to Trump, several of his confidants also called the magazine to convince it that he belonged on the list. \n\"This was a model Trump would use for the rest of his career, telling a lie so cosmic that people believed that some kernel of it had to be real. The tactic landed him a place on the Forbes list he hadn't earned â€” and led to future accolades, press coverage and deals. It eventually paved a path toward the presidency,\" Greenberg wrote. \nTrump's name appeared on the Forbes 400 list off and on for several years and has been on it since 1996. During the campaign, he claimed to have a personal fortune of $10 billion, but Forbes most recently listed his wealth at $3.1 billion. \nCNBC has reached out to the White House for comment. Greenberg noted that neither the White House nor the Trump Organization responded to his requests for comment. Forbes did not immediately return an email for comment. \nRead Greenberg's full piece in the Post here .
