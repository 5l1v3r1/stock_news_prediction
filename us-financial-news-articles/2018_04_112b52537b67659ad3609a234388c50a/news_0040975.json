They were aware that we were ensuring we were discussing obligations with our legal advisers. They have not made any additional requests.”\nThe FCA says it is the responsibility of listed companies to ensure they identify potential inside information and take steps to disclose it appropriately to the market.\n“The FCA routinely contacts firms or their advisers to clarify press commentary, announcements and events and did so in this case,” a spokesman said.\nShares in WPP initially rose in the days after the first statement before they fell 7 percent on the Monday after Sorrell’s resignation.
