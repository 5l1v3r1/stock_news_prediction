REUTERS/Mike Blake Sears said it was notified of the incident in mid-March and the incident led to unauthorized access to the credit card information of under 100,000 of its customers. \nTechnology firm [ 24]7.ai, which provides online support services for Delta, Sears and Kmart among other companies, found that a cyber security incident affected online customer payment information of its clients, it said. \nThe incident happened on or after Sept. 26, 2017 last year and was found and resolved on Oct. 12, the company said. \nPersonal details related to passport, government identification, security and SkyMiles information were not impacted, Delta said. \nThe No.2 U.S. carrier said while a small subset of its customers would have had their information exposed, it cannot be said with certainty if their information was accessed and compromised. \nSears said its stores were not compromised and their internal systems were not accessed in the breach. There was no impact on the information of customers using a Sears-branded credit card, the retailer said. \nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T06:25:27.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
