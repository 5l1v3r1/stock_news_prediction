That lifted Bezos’s net worth to to $134 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nIt has been a turbulent week for the richest Americans in tech. On Tuesday, Alphabet (googl) spooked investors after first-quarter results sparked concern that the Google parent plans to go on a spending binge, punishing shares of Amazon (amzn) , Facebook (fb) and Netflix (nflx) . Bezos lost $4.6 billion that day, and Alphabet’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin each lost $2 billion.\nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune dropped $2.5 billion on Tuesday, got a reprieve Thursday as his wealth increased by $5.8 billion, a day after the social network posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter. He leapfrogged Spain’s Amancio Ortega to No. 5 in the global wealth ranking.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T18:40:38.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
