The company needs approval from 75 percent of its UK shareholder base and 50 percent of the Dutch base to move forward with the plan, which is aimed at simplifying its structure, and making it easier to issue equity and execute large-scale M&A. \nLast month, UK investor Columbia Threadneedle raised concerns about the move, which could affect Unilever’s inclusion in London’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index. \nOther big shareholders share their concerns. The Financial Times on Wednesday reported that four were “extremely worried” about the proposal, and that Unilever has quietly set up meetings with UK investors to convince them of its merits. \n“All shareholder discussions are quiet because they’re private discussions,” Pitkethly told Reuters. “We have had an open door to all of our shareholders, we’ve engaged extremely widely.” \nUnilever says it will maintain a “premium listing” on the London Stock Exchange, and is in discussions about maintaining its part in the FTSE. \n“We continue a dialogue with the FTSE,” Pitkethly said, noting the dialogue has been “very interesting” so far. “We would be delighted to be included in all the indices, obviously. That would be a fantastic outcome for us but it’s not in our gift.” Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Adrian Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:01:47.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
