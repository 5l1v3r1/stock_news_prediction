Kay Nietfeld/Pool via Reuters \nBefore their talks, the two said they would present a united front at June meeting of European Union leaders on a range of issues including reform of the 19-member euro zone, which Merkel said they agreed was “not yet sufficiently crisis-proof”. \nFrance and Germany, which account for around 50 percent of euro zone output, are essential to the reform drive. \nStressing the need for compromise, Merkel said: “We each bring some different facets but I think the sum of our proposals will make for a good result in the end.” \nHowever, their meeting took place against a backdrop of grumbling by lawmakers from Merkel’s conservative bloc, wary that Macron’s call for more solidarity could see German taxpayers’ money used to fund profligate member states.

Kay Nietfeld/Pool via Reuters \nMacron reiterated a proposal made at the European parliament to subsidize local authorities who welcomed refugees. \n“We can’t let this or that country alone carry the burden of hosting and integrating (migrants),” he said. \nOn a European asylum system, Merkel said the two leaders agreed on many points, and concurred that offering incentives was a better approach than talking about penalties. EURO ZONE REFORM \nMacron’s vision also includes turning Europe’s existing bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), to act as a buffer in any future financial crises in the bloc, which was nearly torn apart in a debt crisis that took hold in 2009.

They want him to be rewarded for efforts to reform the French economy, well aware that a big chunk of French voters remain susceptible to far-right and far-left populists skeptical about the EU. \nBut Merkel’s larger conservative bloc insists on what they call the principle of ‘liability’, whereby individual member states carry responsibility for their own economic risks. \nMerkel said she was very optimistic about completing a banking union. Berlin’s focus has long been on banks first reducing the risks they take in lending. \n“We are also ready, perhaps not in the immediate future but in the longer term, to agree on a common deposit guarantee system,” said Merkel. “But we want liability and risks to be kept together.” \nUnderlining a sense of urgency for reform in Brussels, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici warned momentum could be lost for deepening euro zone integration if decisions are not taken at the June summit. \n“We are some way from reaching a consensus on the priorities and method for moving the euro area forward and time is running out,” Moscovici said in a speech at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.
