He will be at Manchester United next year certainly and I don’t know where I will be.\n“I have worked at a top level for 35 years without any interruption and I think I am the only one who has done that. I am in unknown territory. Will I take a break? I will be surprised if I meet him next year,” he said.\nWenger said he was looking forward to a post-match glass of red wine with Ferguson and he also appreciated the warm reception he was given by the United fans.\n“Once you are not a danger any more, people love you,” he added with a grin.\n“I am thankful to Manchester United because they had a nice gesture. It is the first time I get a trophy before a game. It is very classy from them.”\nThe Frenchman is hoping to add one final trophy to his honors list at Arsenal and his first in European competition with the Gunners playing their second-leg of their Europa League semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Spain on Thursday.\nThe first game, at the Emirates on Thursday, ended 1-1 and although Wenger protected most of his regulars by playing a young, experimental side, he still picked up one injury worry with Henrikh Mkhitaryan going off injured in the second half.\nWenger described the Armenian winger’s injury as a “knock on the knee” but said it was too early to say if he, or goalkeeper David Ospina and midfielder Alex Iwobi, who also picked up injuries, are at risk of missing Thursday’s game in Madrid.\nReporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:22:08.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
