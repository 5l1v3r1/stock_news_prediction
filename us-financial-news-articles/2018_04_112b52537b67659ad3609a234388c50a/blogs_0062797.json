Chico's said it could begin selling items from White House Black Market and Soma via Amazon, \"as the new business channel gains traction.\"\nChico's said it will keep control of marketing, pricing and promotions for its products in this new partnership.\n\"Chico's FAS will be one of the few vertically-integrated specialty retailers with Prime eligibility on Amazon.com,\" Chico's FAS CEO and President Shelley Broader said in a statement.\nAmazon has been looking to add established clothing brands to its site, which could propel the e-commerce giant to become the No. 1 apparel retailer in the U.S. this year. It's been working with Nike , Calvin Klein and Carter's, to name a few, to help dismantle a sea of third-party sellers flooding the site with used or marked-down inventory.\nStill, many brands worry that once they agree to sell on Amazon they will be pressured to slash prices, which would hurt profit margins.\nAccording to Jefferies analyst Randal Konik, Chico's has been cutting back on promotions and is keeping a tighter control on inventories. \"[Merchandise] rebalancing is beginning to yield results at core Chico's, and we see the other divisions following suit,\" he said in a note to clients.\nIn the fourth quarter, same-store sales for Chico's FAS fell about 5 percent, which was better than what analysts were anticipating. Inventories decreased more than 6 percent during the period, while selling, general and administrative expenses also dropped from a year earlier.\nRegarding its partnership with Amazon, Chico's said the deal is \"not expected to be material\" to 2018 results \"given its early nature.\"\nChico's shares are up about 15 percent so far this year.", "external_links": ["http://chicosfas.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/Chicos-FAS-to-offer-Chicos-Brand-Apparel-and-Accessories-on-Amazon/default.aspx"], "published": "2018-04-30T16:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:48:32.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
