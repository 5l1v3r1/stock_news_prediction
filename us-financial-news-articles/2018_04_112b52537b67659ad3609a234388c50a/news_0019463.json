We can give them that help in a way that is dignified and respects their time.”\nPahlka was in Oxford - where Ebay billionaire Jeff Skoll established a center for social entrepreneurship in 2003 - to collect an award, one of six Skoll winners this year.\nThe Skoll Centre at Oxford University aims to increase the impact of social entrepreneurs by helping them to set up new ventures, training leaders and carrying out research, from health to climate change to education.\nBritain is seen as a global leader in the growing social enterprise sector, home to about 70,000 businesses set up to address social and environmental issues that employ nearly 1 million people, according to industry body Social Enterprise UK.\nPahlka said her organization is unusual.\n“Most social enterprises work around government,” she said.\n“They are essentially trying to supplement where government is failing. We take the approach of strengthening government itself to get these social outcomes.”\nCode for America’s websites reduce the time-consuming bureaucracy of form filling that might deter applicants to about 10 minutes, she said, and they are designed for smartphone users to cater to the millions who do not have a computer at home.\nOne innovation is Clear My Record, which allows users to get rid of criminal offences on their data record that might prevent them accessing employment, benefits or credit.\nPahlka was inspired by the election of U.S. President Barack Obama, whose online campaign mobilized masses of young voters as well as donations.\n“The thinking was, if the Internet can help get a president elected, can it help him govern better?” Pahlka asked.\n“The application of modern tech and modern approaches to problem solving can’t be limited to politics. It has to help us do a better job, using tax dollars to get the outcomes that we intend.”\nPahlka went on to work for Obama as his deputy chief technology officer in 2013 and helped found the United States Digital Service, which helps federal agencies improve their websites and simplify digital services.\n“Public servants who help people get food assistance or take care of a kid who needs to be in a foster home - those people need tools to do their jobs,” she said.\n“We weren’t - and still in many case aren’t - helping those people do those jobs.”\nCode for America aims to help more than 500,000 people in need with more effective government services in more than 70 cities, states and counties in 2018.\nReporting by Lee Mannion; Editing by Katy Migiro.
