It will provide support to those who may face litigation from others as a result of a bug submission.\nThe changes are the first made to Uber’s bug bounty platform since the company revealed last November the 2016 data breach of 57 million user credentials, including names, phone numbers and email addresses.\nReuters reported in December that a 20-year-old man was primarily behind the breach, and that he was paid by Uber to destroy the data through the bounty platform after receiving an email from anonymous person demanding money in exchange for user data.\nThe large size of the payment and Uber’s use of the bounty system led some security researchers to criticize the company and suggest it had sought to conceal a criminal breach.\n“An unfortunate reaction to all this was the doubt cast by some people on whether companies should run bug bounty programs at all,” Flynn said.\nUber apologized for how it handled the breach months after new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi was installed following founder Travis Kalanick’s ouster. The company fired its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, and a deputy, attorney Craig Clark.\nAs part of the changes, Uber will test an option allowing researchers to donate their bounties to charity, which the company will match. The company will also update its submission form to include a question that asks whether personal consumer information may be exposed through the discovered flaw.\nFlynn said the added question is intended to more quickly trigger review internally as to whether regulators may need to be notified, a change intended to avoid repeating mistakes made during its response to the 2016 breach. A European data privacy law taking effect next month will require companies to disclose within 72 hours whether user data has been compromised.\nMarten Mickos, the chief executive of HackerOne, which hosts Uber’s bug bounty program and provided input on its updates, welcomed the changes but said they alone would not guarantee Uber would avoid its previous mistakes.\n“It’s not the main thing that was missing in 2016,” said HackerOne Chief Executive Marten Mickos. “The main failure in 2016 was not notifying the authorities.” (Reporting by Dustin Volz; editing by Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:13:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
