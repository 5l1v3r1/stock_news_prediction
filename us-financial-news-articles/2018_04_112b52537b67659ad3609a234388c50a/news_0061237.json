Ultragaz, a unit of Ultrapar, is Brazil's largest LPG distributor and Liquigas is the second biggest.\nIn talks with banks, Petrobras has discussed how to structure the sale process without triggering antitrust issues.\nThe easiest solution would be a sale to foreign buyers with similar businesses, such as Turkey's Aygaz AS or Chile's Empresas Copec SA, sources said.\nSome of the Brazilian rivals that bid for the asset are still interested, such as Copagaz Distribuidora de Gas. But a sale to a Brazilian rival would be trickier, and some representatives of Brazilian companies have been lobbying Petrobras to break up the subsidiary before the sale, one of the sources said.\nA third option would be to require proposals that already include remedies for potential antitrust concerns. So far, no decision has been taken, the sources added.\nPetrobras responded to a request for comment by referring to a previous securities filing in which it said details of the deal had not been defined. Copagaz, Aygaz and Copec did not immediately comment on the matter.\n($1 = 3.50 reais) (Reporting by Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl; Editing by Tom Brown)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T09:55:01.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
