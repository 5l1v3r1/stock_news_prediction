Additionally, Dana Pagliei has been promoted to Corporate Sales Manager in Massachusetts.\nTerri Davis is a San Francisco native who brings 24 years of relevant experience to the role, most recently as Business Development Manager for corporate housing company Oakwood Worldwide. Prior to Oakwood, Terri served in senior sales and account management roles for companies including Restaurant Technologies and Hertz.\nIn her role at Furnished Quarters, Davis will be responsible for developing new regional and global accounts in the San Francisco Bay Area. The hiring of Davis is part of Furnished Quarters’ initiative to bring the best local hospitality and sales talent to its newly opened San Francisco office. The company has already surpassed 100 apartments in the Bay Area and expects to add more as the region’s peak season for short-term furnished apartments approaches.\n“Terri’s wide-ranging sales experience and firsthand knowledge of the market will be a tremendous asset as Furnished Quarters continues its expansion in Northern California,” said Craig Partin, Chief Sales Officer. “Her contributions will aid us as we accelerate our growth efforts in the coming year.”\nDana Pagliei began working at Furnished Quarters in early 2015 as a Sales Coordinator, quickly moving up the ranks to Corporate Sales Associate and now Corporate Sales Manager. Dana previously worked as a Leasing Specialist for Roseland Residential Trust in New Jersey and later Massachusetts.\nAt Furnished Quarters, Pagliei has spearheaded the planning of corporate events, helped grow local accounts and assisted with guest services. As a Corporate Sales Manager, she will play a crucial role in growing Furnished Quarters’ corporate accounts and standing as a top provider of temporary housing both locally in the Greater Boston area and globally.\n“We always look within to develop great people into even greater roles during their tenure,” said Annette Clement, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Furnished Quarters’ Massachusetts office. “This promotion was a natural fit which leverages Dana’s sales acumen and strong relationships with her clients.”\nAbout Furnished Quarters\nFurnished Quarters is the largest independently owned and operated supplier of global temporary housing, offering over 100,000 fully furnished apartments in more than 800 cities around the world.
