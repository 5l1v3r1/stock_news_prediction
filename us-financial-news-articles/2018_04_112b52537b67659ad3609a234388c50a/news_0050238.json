Sohn is one of the most hotly anticipated hedge fund events of the year and is held in Geffen Hall at New York's Lincoln Center. \nThe picks from some of the industry titans: \nJohn Khoury, Long Pond Capital \nLong D.R. Horton (DHI) \nD.R. Horton is moving from an \"asset-heavy to asset-light business model,\" he said. \nThe homebuilder also specializes in the \"healthiest\" part of the market, entry-level homes with an average price of around $300,000. He said the company is moving to become a \"pure play home manufacturer,\" which will benefit its free cash flow generation. \nD.R. Horton shares were up 0.8 percent as of early afternoon trading. \nLi Ran, Half Sky Capital \nLong GrubHub (GRUB) \n\"GrubHub is the leading online food delivery platform in the U.S,\" she said. \nThe hedge fund manager said the company has a large attractive market, a positive economic model and a successful \"proven\" concept. She noted Takeaway.com's success in Europe shows the potential for GrubHub in North America. Ran also is optimistic about GrubHub's restaurant software offering. \nGrubHub shares had been trading 1.8 percent higher. \nGlen Kacher, Light Street Capital \nLong Palo Alto Networks (PANW) \n\"A cybersecurity war is being fought right now,\" Kacher said. Palo Alto Networks has the \"leading hybrid security platform â€¦ [The company] has an attractive valuation.\" \nKacher said Palo Alto doubled its market share in the firewall security business over the last four years. He is optimistic over the company's subscription revenue business, which will allow it to raise its \"recurring revenue\" and profit margins. \nThe pick is important, he said, because a cyber attack could cause economic damage worse than the financial crisis. \nShares were 0.8 percent lower in afternoon trading. \nScott Ferguson, Sachem Head Capital \nLong Whitbread PLC (LON:WTB) \nWhitbread is a \"classic sum of the parts story,\" Ferguson said. \nThe company owns Premier Inn, the dominant UK discount hotel chain, and Costa Coffee. \n\"Premier Inn is a high quality asset. [It] is defensive business that should outperform in a recession,\" he added. \nThe investor said Whitbread trades at a \"steep discount\" relative to its competitors. Ferguson said the company should spin off Costa Coffee to create value. \nShares were little changed on the London market Monday but are up 5.8 percent year to date.
