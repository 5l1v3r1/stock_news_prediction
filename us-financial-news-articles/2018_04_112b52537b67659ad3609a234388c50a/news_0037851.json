Just because we were reliant on banks and couldn’t access the infrastructure directly,” Kristo Käärmann, co-founder of London-based TransferWise, told Reuters.\nBefore getting a settlement account in the Bank of England’s Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, TransferWise was forced to rely on the traditional banking system to access the fastest network.\nKäärmann said his company, which counts Old Mutual Global Investors, venture capital firms IVP and Andreessen Horowitz and British billionaire Richard Branson among its investors, had spent five years trying to get access.\nFounded by Estonian friends Taavet Hinrikus and Käärmann in 2011, TransferWise says it moves more than $2 billion globally every month, saving people some $80 million per month compared to using their bank.\nMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said in a statement that giving TransferWise direct access to the UK’s Faster Payments Scheme would “stimulate competition and innovation” and reinforce financial stability by increasing “diversity and risk-reducing payment technologies”.\nMonzo, a British tech start-up with a banking license, had already been given access to the network.
