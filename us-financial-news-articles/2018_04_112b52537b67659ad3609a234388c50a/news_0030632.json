Sheikh Tamim returned to Doha on Saturday. \nThe QIA’s investments in the United States are stable and strong, and it has so far spent $35 billion executing about 60 percent of its U.S. investment plans for the period 2015-2020, Sheikh Abdullah added. \nIn recent months the QIA has, among other deals, reduced its stakes in upscale jeweller Tiffany & Co and Swiss bank Credit Suisse. \nA banker in the Gulf who does business with the QIA told Reuters he understood the disposals were due to portfolio adjustments and assets presenting attractive profit opportunities, rather than the result of any scramble to raise money for use within Qatar. \nThe QIA is looking for investment opportunities in the United States and Asia, the banker said.
