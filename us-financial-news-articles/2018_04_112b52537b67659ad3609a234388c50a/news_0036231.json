REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido LATAM, Latin America’s largest carrier, said earlier in the day that the two parties had reached an agreement, but the union had cautioned the deal was subject to approval by its members.\nThe deal was rejected by a majority of the union’s 1,000 members, a union spokeswoman said, adding that the airline and its workers were meeting again to try to resolve their differences.\nThe union has cited the duration of staff rotations and salaries of new employees as primary sticking points during months of negotiations with the airline.\nThe week-long strike has primarily impacted flights within Chile, though it has also affected regional connections throughout South America.\nLATAM told Reuters on Monday it had canceled 1,134 flights through April 21, and that the strike would affect at least 196,000 passengers.\nLATAM was created in 2012 through a merger of Chile’s LAN and Brazil’s TAM. The group, headquartered in Santiago, has operating units in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru.\nReporting by Dave Sherwood, Felipe Iturrieta and Antonio De la Jara, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T04:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:00:34.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
