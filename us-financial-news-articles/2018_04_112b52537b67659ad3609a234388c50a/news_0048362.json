After multiple rounds of caucus voting, Romney failed to get a majority of the votes from the delegates, meaning he will face State Representative Mike Kennedy in a primary on June 26. \nDelegates preferred Kennedy to Romney, 51% to 49% respectively. Had either candidate received 60% of the vote, they would have clinched the nomination outright. Now, without having won a majority, Romney will have to win June’s primary to find a place on the ballot in November. Thank you to all the delegates who hung in there with us all day at the Convention. I appreciate the support I received and look forward to the primary election. \n— Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) April 22, 2018 \nNevertheless, in a state that has had only Republican senators since 1977, should Romney win the June primary, he is nearly certain to win the seat.
