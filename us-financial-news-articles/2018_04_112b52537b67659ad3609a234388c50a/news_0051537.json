(“iPic” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IPIC), America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company also reiterated its full year 2018 outlook, including expectations for annual comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%, and updated and reiterated its four key strategic initiatives to create long-term value for stockholders.\nHamid Hashemi, Founder & Chief Executive Officer of iPic® Entertainment, commented, “We remain laser focused on executing our four key strategic initiatives to meaningfully improve our top and bottom-line performance this year and beyond. Through improving profitability from existing locations, opening new iPic’s domestically beginning in 2019, pursuing international growth opportunities, and increasing our digital growth options we believe we will create long-term value for our stockholders.”\nHashemi continued, “We are pleased to reiterate our outlook for 2018, including annual comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%. Our concept is well-positioned within today’s ever-increasing experiential economy to deliver a one-of-a-kind, four-hour guest experience. With just 15 locations in the US, we are still in the very early stage of our domestic growth story while we also see significant opportunity to expand internationally, starting with our recent announcement to enter The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”\nFinancial Results\nThe Company reported fourth quarter results, ended December 31, 2017, including:\nTotal revenue of $37.5 million. Comparable-store sales decrease of 7.9%. Net loss of $(10.6) million. Store-level EBITDA* of $4.9 million. EBITDA* loss of $(1.3) million. Adjusted EBITDA* of $0.7 million.\nThe Company reported full year 2017 results, ended December 31, 2017, including:\nTotal revenue of $139.4 million. Comparable-store sales decrease of 7.7%. Net loss of $(44.5) million. Store-level EBITDA* of $14.6 million. EBITDA* loss of $(8.7) million. Adjusted EBITDA* loss of $(0.7) million.\n* Store-level EBITDA, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of store-level EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFull Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company continues to expect the following:\nTotal revenue growth of +3% to +7%. Comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%. Store-level EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $17.0 million to $18.0 million (unchanged outlook in dollars compared to prior guidance, which was +20% to +30% growth on top of preliminary 2017 EBITDA expectations of $13.7 million to $14.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(1.5) million to $(0.5) million, reflecting a substantial improvement from full year 2017. At least three remodels of existing locations with Generation I auditoriums. Capital expenditures of $20 million to $25 million, net of tenant improvement dollars.\nKey Strategic Initiatives\niPic is executing four key strategic initiatives in order to meaningfully improve its top and bottom-line results over time and create long-term value for stockholders.\nImproving Profitability from Existing Locations : A significant revenue driver going forward will be the remodeling of the Company’s Generation I legacy locations into Generation III designs that, among other things, will include the installation of predominately Premium-Plus seating, including iPic’s latest Patented Pod Seats and Chaise Lounges. Premium-Plus seating currently comprises approximately 35% of seating in our Generation I auditoriums. The Generation III designs, which contain significantly more Premium-Plus seating, generate significantly higher revenue per screen than our Generation I locations. iPic expects to complete five remodels in 2018, including Scottsdale, AZ; Pasadena, CA; Austin, TX; Redmond, WA; and Fairview, TX. Opening New iPic Locations Domestically : The Company currently operates 115 screens at 15 locations in nine states with the ultimate long-term goal of reaching 200 locations across the US. iPic recently signed leases for two new iPic locations in Fort Lauderdale, FL and Atlanta, GA and has a robust pipeline of additional sites in lease negotiations. The Company plans to open at least four new domestic locations per year starting in 2019.\nPursuing International Growth Opportunities : The Company is actively exploring the potential to expand the iPic brand internationally through licensed and/or asset-light partnerships. In March, iPic announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with BAS Global Investments to develop its one-of-a-kind, world-class luxurious restaurant-and-theater iPic locations throughout The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If the Company is able to finalize all agreements and successfully obtain needed operating licenses, iPic believes there is the potential for 25 to 30 iPic locations within the next ten years, and would expect to expand in all parts of the country starting in Riyadh and Jeddah.\nIncreasing Digital Growth Options (Membership and Sponsorship) : The Company plans to leverage its growing membership network as the brand expands and increases its market presence. In 2017, iPic’s active users that have visited a location over the past year accounted for approximately 47% of revenue. In 2017, the Company earned $1.8 million from corporate sponsorships and believes that it has the opportunity to significantly grow its local and national sponsorship revenue.\nConference Call\nThere will be no conference call in conjunction with iPic’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, however, the Company will host a conference call when it reports its first quarter 2018 results in mid to late May.\nKey Financial Definitions\nNew store openings – Our ability to expand our business and reach new guests is influenced by the opening of additional iPic locations in both new and existing markets. The success of our new iPic locations is indicative of our brand appeal and the efficacy of our site selection and operating models.\nComparable-store sales – Comparable-store sales are a year-over-year comparison of sales at iPic locations open at the end of the period which have been open for at least 12 months prior to the start of such quarterly period. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Our comparable iPics consisted of 11 and 14 iPics as of the end of 2016 and 2017, respectively. From period to period, comparable-store sales are generally impacted by attendance and average spend per person. Spend per person is, in turn, composed of pricing and sales-mix changes.\nStore-level EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, store-level EBITDA consists of total revenues less store-level expenses that include food-and beverage cost-of-goods sold, box-office-and-other-income costs-of-goods-sold, labor costs, occupancy expenses and other-operating expenses.\nEBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and which also excludes equity-based compensation expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations.\nAbout iPic® Entertainment Inc.\nEstablished in 2010 and headquartered in Boca Raton, FL, iPic® Entertainment is America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand.

Construction of leased property and equipment financed by lessor $ - $ 10,031 Insurance premiums financed through short term borrowings $ 1,847 $ 2,201 Non-GAAP Measures\nCertain financial measures presented in this press release, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP.” We define these terms as follows:\n“EBITDA” means, for any reporting period, net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, “Adjusted EBITDA” is a supplemental measure of our performance and is also the basis for performance evaluation under our executive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, equity-based compensation expense, pre-opening expenses, other income and loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment as well as certain non-recurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to our ongoing business performance. “Store-Level EBITDA” is a supplemental measure of our performance which we believe provides management and investors with additional information to measure the performance of our locations, individually and as an entirety. Store-Level EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA adjusted for pre-opening expenses, other income, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment, non-recurring charges, and general and administrative expense. We use Store-Level EBITDA to measure operating performance and returns from opening new stores. We believe that Store-Level EBITDA is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring at the store-level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store-Level EBITDA is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency and performance, and we use Store-Level EBITDA as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments we have made to GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur income and expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments used to calculate the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this press release because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Store-Level EBITDA is utilized to measure the performance of our locations, both individually and in entirety.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not GAAP measures of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, iPic openings and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures $ Thousands Twelve Months Ended Three Months Ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (44,523 ) $ (34,223 ) $ (10,568 ) $ (11,149 ) Plus: Interest expense 16,091 10,718 4,173 2,186 Income tax expense 67 87 2 41 Depreciation and amortization expense 19,686 16,019 5,134 4,726 EBITDA (8,679 ) (7,399 ) (1,258 ) (4,197 ) Plus: Pre-opening expenses 1,634 4,395 - 1,301 Other income (5 ) - - - Impairment of property and equipment 3,760 - 428 - Non-recurring charges 2,576 3,848 1,507 3,848 Adjusted EBITDA (714 ) 844 677 952 Plus: General and administrative expense 15,264 14,220 4,202 5,024 Store-Level EBITDA 14,550 15,064 4,879 5,976 Investor Relations:\nICR\nMelissa Calandruccio, CFA\niPicIR@icrinc.com\n646-277-1273\nMedia Relations:\nThe Gab Group for iPic® Entertainment Corporate\nMichelle Soudry\nmsoudry@thegabgroup.com\n561-750-3500\nJonesworks\nStephanie Jones/Michelle Bower\nipic@jonesworks.com\n212-839-0111\nSource: iPicEntertainment Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=gFMyC3lab7bZ79MitHgMdmRSUS2GDnVbEGK-zwkONHQy5ufvZUw99OU_ePVbPa4mXeTshdmG05QCDDRgO0HZLfcJMBa-6Mfu-nv8_jnVscU=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8e72d776-38d9-4014-ae7b-5e311f61265f", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=E2cD91DPo3NRRNLF7lVtAmsDYvu66wQ92akkYYcXZ7IFCRiRw2f_wHh_bVBE8OX5o2WaVbLHoadPpFICoWbQzgBiD7a5JGK2Fgqg1cXVws-5PFf2FN2gckpJRfnzenLPRD7BI1AybRTNazjveBNNYJsgGvHCkFPbHRXerDG-1Gnap054hT0OQ_d7m8dIsRVywQn0GJE2xMFEakeTevXBWxzXjGIycgPQ7SoLmxKPHeHkLRDBO8JDthVmyaLqMPVKGbMK6c8hrSP0InyPO3O8b3FUqU8hglwryfmDvLbevtWWgwzoL4dNAmMJYP4ukZXMutuvuOMJFr803ZZnY-uXazUJTRp5l8WHl--TMaiFTN9BYMvRe24VREIA_YMgOBBqxgdtsQSeQRYD8rFTGrfbwA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=rChAnUFCE05UuLIM2FBb607CXE4q-4YPyJspiD87VXET7rqNWa4uW_cZ-skw3W_P", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pfmqOCELk2Xo4FbsXJHxT5oI2O6jTTPdW0V1ZJ7KFDq3qm4P2W-36c-JxW8h-cKfpS4uCklWgA8YUdcT3IjU3HgcbzVq4g3ZeD0AolgvMcE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XCqn0ALO19lKBPWZDIFP69Xe8BjJ8C663ASSaSNFTGQD1-SLRlkWnFukwTkGlxdRV_mhlbmjgYu_6rFTxKSPaA=="], "published": "2018-04-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T17:47:32.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
