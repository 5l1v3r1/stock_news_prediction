I hope not.”\nThe AQR fund is invested in a portfolio of liquid instruments, balanced across the fixed-income universe. The fund aims to generate returns through security selection within sectors, curve positioning, and currency selection, with minimal active duration or credit bets. It strives to maintain a risk level consistent with its benchmark.\n“We do find, again much like in equities, expensive traditional active fixed income management is a bust; however, the same factors we find effective elsewhere (value, momentum, carry, defensive/quality) show up in bonds,” Asness wrote.\n“So, not surprisingly, we think there is hope, but it’s not because ‘active management works in bonds,’ but because ‘the same basic things that work everywhere also work in bonds.’ Basically, don’t go traditional ‘active’ in fixed income, go factor (and make sure the fees fit that!).”\nAQR relies mostly on a roomful of powerful computers running proprietary models to evaluate reams of publicly available data. Asness and his partners were among the first to build a stock portfolio by using computer models to combine two simple concepts: buying undervalued stocks (a strategy known as value investing) and betting against overvalued ones (which are called “momentum” stocks.\nMomentum refers to the tendency of securities that are rising in price to keep going up for a time, even when they are overvalued.\nWhile AQR has invested in fixed income for over 19 years in its multi-strategy products, this is the first time its expertise has been made available through a standalone fixed income mutual fund.\nReporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T02:36:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
