That followed a surprise drop in March exports reported earlier on Friday, which came amid heightened trade tensions with the United States, though most analysts believe it was likely due to seasonal factors.\n“The export deficit and slower total social financing announced on Friday may have indicated weaker-than-expected macro activity in March, although we think the market has partly priced that in,” Gao Ting, Head of China Strategy at UBS Securities, wrote a note.\nBank shares were also sold on fears of growing margin pressure as the central bank slowly liberalises interest rates.\nChina’s central bank will relax its informal guidance for the upper limit of commercial banks’ deposit rates, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday.\n“For the short-term, the relaxation of the commercial banks’ deposit rate ceiling could be negative for banks, as their net interest margins might be hurt by intensified competition,” said Sun Lijin, a financial analyst with Pacific Securities.\nBucking the broad trend, shares in firms based in Hainan surged after China said it plans to set up an international free trade zone and port on the southern island.\nThe largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were China Hainan Rubber Industry Group Co Ltd up 10.03 percent, followed by Hna Innovation Co Ltd gaining 9.98 percent and Hna Innovation Co Ltd up by 9.98 percent.\nThe largest percentage losses in the Shanghai index were Shanghai Feilo Acoustics Co Ltd down 10.01 percent, followed by Taiyuan Lionhead Cement Co Ltd losing 10.01 percent and Shanghai Hongda Mining Co Ltd down by 9.65 percent.\nThe top gainers among H-shares were Guangdong Investment Ltd up 1.66 percent, followed by CNOOC Ltd gaining 0.81 percent and SINOPHARM GROUP CO LTD up by 0.44 percent.\nAs of 0415 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 22.35 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.\nReporting by Luoyan Liu and John Ruwitch; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T08:42:15.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
