REUTERS/Shohei Miyano/File Photo Some analysts said the trade tension may not have as severe an impact on the dollar as initially thought. And if it ends up having an impact, it could be either a positive or negative factor for the greenback.\n“There is a scenario that is dollar positive in that maybe the current account deficit is reduced or the Fed raises rates,” Steven Englander, head of research and strategy at Rafiki Capital in New York, said.\n“Normally that would be seen as dollar positive. But there is a dollar negative aspect in that perhaps the tariffs apply to some necessary components of the U.S. economy, and slow it down,” he added.\nIn the midst of the U.S.-China trade tension, the dollar has weakened in three of the last five sessions against the yen, down more than 5 percent so far this year. Against the Swiss franc, the greenback has fallen 1.4 percent so far in 2018.\nThe Japanese and Swiss currencies tend to appreciate in times of geopolitical and economic stress.\nChina on Wednesday proposed tariffs on U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. The Chinese plan came hours after Washington unveiled a detailed breakdown of some 1,300 Chinese industrial, transport and medical goods that could be subject to 25 percent duties.\nThe Chinese news dominated the market, overshadowing a U.S. employment report by payrolls processor ADP which showed a higher-than-expected 241,000 private sector jobs created last month.\n“To the extent it is useful, (the ADP survey) points to a labour market still in exceptionally good health,” said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.\nIn afternoon trading, after trading lower for most of the session, the dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 106.72 yen, and gained 0.2 percent versus the Swiss franc to 0.9606 franc.\nThe dollar, however, dipped 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 90.14, as the euro edged up slightly versus the dollar to $1.2280.\nIn the aftermath of the Chinese tariffs, the yuan on Wednesday suffered its biggest one-day loss versus the dollar since mid-February, down 0.6 percent at 6.3094 yuan per dollar.\nThe Chinese currency had been strengthening this year, fuelling speculation on whether Beijing can intervene in markets to limit its rise.\nReporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Additional reporting by Daniel Bases; Editing by David Gregorio and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T09:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:21:49.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
