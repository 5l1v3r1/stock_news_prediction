Trade figures as yet for the month of March were not as yet released.\nCustoms is expected to release dollar-denominated trade data later on Friday.\nChina’s trade performance has got off to a strong start this year, following through on a solid rebound in 2017, thanks to sustained demand at home and abroad.\nBut the export outlook is being clouded by an escalating trade dispute with the United States, which could disrupt its shipments and supply chains, while a cooling property market may curb China’s demand for imported raw materials such as iron ore.
