(NYSE:ALX) filed its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 today and reported:\nNet loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $9.7 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to net income of $21.7 million, or $4.24 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included (i) $23.8 million, or $4.65 per diluted share, of accrued expense for potential additional New York City real property transfer taxes on the 2012 sale of Kings Plaza Regional Shopping Center (previously disclosed on Current Report on Form 8-K dated March 2, 2018) and (ii) $5.1 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, of expense from the decrease in the fair value of marketable securities resulting from a new GAAP accounting standard effective January 1, 2018. Previously, changes in the fair value of marketable securities were recognized through “accumulated other comprehensive income” on Alexander’s, Inc.’s consolidated balance sheets and did not impact its consolidated statements of income. Adjusting net loss for these items, “net income, as adjusted” (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $19.2 million, or $3.77 per diluted share.\nNegative funds from operations (“FFO”) (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $1.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared to positive FFO (non-GAAP) of $29.6 million, or $5.78 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusting negative FFO for the accrued expense for potential additional New York City real property transfer taxes and the decrease in the fair value of marketable securities, positive “FFO, as adjusted” (non-GAAP) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $27.4 million, or $5.36 per diluted share.\nAlexander’s, Inc. is a real estate investment trust which has seven properties in the greater New York City metropolitan area.\nCertain statements contained herein may constitute “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
