Based in the company’s Franklin, Tennessee office, a commercial hub near Nashville, Romine is responsible for building Jackson’s advisory business across the country.\nAn industry veteran, Romine returns to JNLD after serving as the president and chief executive officer of National Planning Holdings ® , Inc. (NPH), Jackson’s affiliated independent broker-dealer network that was sold to LPL Financial (LPL) in August 2017. Prior to leading NPH, he held various sales leadership positions at JNLD since joining the firm in 1997, most recently serving as president from January 2015 – July 2016. Romine began his career in financial services as a retail investment advisor at Dean Witter Reynolds and holds FINRA Series 7, 24, 63 and 66 registrations.\n“Scott has a significant amount of experience leading two parts of our distribution business — the broker-dealer industry and our sales organization — making him the perfect visionary to drive our advisory efforts,” said Greg Cicotte, executive vice president and chief distribution officer for Jackson. “We are excited to have him back at JNLD, and are confident his skillset and institutional knowledge are exactly what we need to build this new initiative and help our partners adapt to our evolving industry.”\nRomine now oversees several key departments that are dedicated to educating financial professionals and supporting the company’s strategic advisory initiatives, including the National Sales Desk, National Accounts, Advisory Sales Strategy, Advisory Resource Group, and Trust/RIA teams.\nThe company also recently named Greg Masucci as senior vice president of National Accounts for JNLD. In this role, Masucci will oversee the National Accounts team, which serves as the liaison for the firm’s valued distribution partners. He joins JNLD from J.P. Morgan Asset Management, where he most recently served as executive director, Global Strategic Relationships. He held various roles during his tenure there, including leadership of the National Accounts teams for both the Wealth Management and Institutional Advisor channels. Prior to joining J.P. Morgan in 2011, Greg held various distribution and sales management roles at Genworth Financial and Merrill Lynch.\n“I am excited for Greg to spearhead our efforts as we revitalize the relationships we’ve built with our distribution partners, as well as establish new partnerships in the advisory space,” Romine said. “His extensive industry experience, strong skillset and creative insight will be instrumental as we further develop our National Accounts team and continue to grow our presence in this market.”\nAnother addition to Romine’s advisory team is Tim Munsie, who recently joined JNLD as senior vice president of the Advisory Resource Group. Munsie comes to JNLD from NPH, where he oversaw the broker-dealer network’s advisory and platform strategy. His group will function as the conduit between JNLD’s products and third-party fintech providers and platforms, particularly those related to the firm’s advisory initiatives.\nDuring the last two years, Jackson has launched several fee-based versions of its leading annuity products. These strategies are designed to ensure advisors and the consumers they serve have access to numerous quality options as they work together to develop a comprehensive financial plan. For more information about these offerings, visit the Products section on www.jackson.com .\nTo support these product launches, JNLD recently formed a team of Regional Advisory Consultants (RACs), responsible for driving Jackson’s advisory business with fee-based advisors who haven’t historically utilized insurance products. The RACs work with contacts across the country by leveraging a hybrid approach of virtual wholesaling and traditional field travel to enhance advisory sales efforts.\n“Since entering the advisory space, we’ve seen tremendous growth and we intend to commit even more resources across the organization to ensure the momentum continues,” Romine said. “This is new territory for the company, so we’re building our advisory efforts from the ground up. We’re working together to ensure all aspects of the business — including our platforms, products and sales teams — are designed to engage and serve financial professionals in the advisory space.”\nJackson is committed to providing education, service support and digital tools to increase the ease of doing business. Financial professionals who would like to learn more about the company’s advisory efforts can contact Jackson at 800-711-JNLD (5653) or visit www.jackson.com .\nAbout Jackson\nJackson is a leading provider of retirement products for industry professionals and their clients.
