Apple knows the apps you've downloaded, the music you've downloaded and the books you've purchased. It also knows all the devices you've bought. Apple doesn't store other identifiable information, like your email or location, as some other tech companies do. Published 10:42 AM ET Wed, 25 April 2018 Updated 23 Hours Ago Jason Lee | Reuters Tim Cook, CEO, Apple\nLike Facebook and Google , Apple has a really simple way to download a file that shows all of the information that Apple knows about you.\nApple has repeatedly said it doesn't store a lot of personal information about users, and I found that to be true. If you've been using iTunes for a long time, however, you might be surprised by what Apple has.\nHere's how to download your own archive of the information Apple knows about you. What Apple knows\nI dug through my archive of data and found that Apple mostly keeps tabs on my interactions with the App Store and iTunes. It has a list of every single app, song, book, music video and in-app purchase I've made on my Apple devices dating all the way back to 2010. There's also a log of every time those apps were updated.\nIt also knows all of the songs I ever stored in iTunes Match, the service that lets you keep a cloud copy of your personal music files wherever you go.\nThere's even a copy of every product that I've purchased from Apple, dating to an iPhone 5, including serial numbers for all of those products. Apple also has a log of every customer support query I've made, ranging from cracked screens to questions about iPhone activation. When repairs were made, it has a log of what was damaged and serial numbers for the old and replacement parts that were added.\nAside from purchases, Apple doesn't seem to know much else. The company's privacy response team, which you need to contact in order to download the file, explains why:\n\"We have not included information contained within your account, if any, such as calendar contents, email contents, iTunes content etc. If you use iCloud you will note that we have extremely short retention periods for how long we store such data and we have provided all data that was available to us at the time at which we processed your request on our systems. I would also like to highlight the following from our message on Customer Privacy at http://www.apple.com/apples-commitment-to-customer-privacy: For example, conversations which take place over iMessage and FaceTime are protected by end-to-end encryption so no one but the sender and receiver can see or read them. Apple cannot decrypt that data. Similarly, we do not store data related to customers' location, Map searches or Siri requests in any identifiable form. How to download your Apple archive\nYou can download your own archive of this data from Apple.
