It is also one of the least-indebted EU members.\nBut its gross domestic product per capita, calculated as power purchasing parity, is 49 percent of the EU average, well below euro zone member states. Many blame that on corruption that scares away investors.\nMoscovici also said that joining the EU’s banking union, which will put Bulgaria’s top banks under the scrutiny of the European Central Bank, was part of the process.\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said Sofia was ready to join the banking union after it enters the Exchange Rate Mechanism, not before as the ECB would prefer.\nIn a publication for a financial conference in Sofia, the deputy governor of Bulgaria’s central bank, Kalin Hristov, argued that joining the banking union before adopting the euro was not a reasonable option.\nHristov pointed out that non-euro zone members that joined still would not be part of the decision making. Nor would they have access to ECB liquidity assistance or the European Stability Mechanism to recapitalise banks.
