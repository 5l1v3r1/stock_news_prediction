Our Loan Acquisition and Servicing Group produced $105.9 million of loans, including originations of $72.9 million and purchases with a recorded investment of $33.0 million, for net growth in the LASG portfolio of $45.6 million, or 7.7%, during the quarter.

Total return is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.\nDeposits increased by $86.4 million, or 9.7%, from June 30, 2017, attributable primarily to an increase in money market accounts of $115.7 million, or 30.9%, offset by a decrease in time deposits of $25.7 million, or 7.6%. Shareholders’ equity increased by $11.0 million, or 9.0%, from June 30, 2017, primarily due to earnings of $11.8 million. Earnings were partially offset by stock option exercises which decreased additional paid-in-capital by $1.1 million. Additionally, there was stock based compensation of $635 thousand, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $128 thousand, and dividends paid on common stock of $266 thousand.\nNet income increased by $471 thousand to $3.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $3.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n1. Net interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $675 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase is primarily due to higher average balances in the loan portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher funding costs and higher average deposit balances.\nThe following table summarizes interest income and related yields recognized on the loan portfolios:\nInterest Income and Yield on Loans Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Average Interest Average Interest Balance (1) Income Yield Balance (1) Income Yield (Dollars in thousands) Community Banking $ 136,824 $ 1,743 5.17 % $ 188,748 $ 2,402 5.16 % SBA 53,069 1,017 7.77 % 44,538 678 6.17 % LASG: Originated 351,271 5,916 6.83 % 256,778 4,075 6.44 % Purchased 241,793 6,732 11.29 % 245,135 7,184 11.89 % Secured Loans to Broker-Dealers - - - 27,933 78 1.13 % Total LASG 593,064 12,648 8.65 % 529,846 11,337 8.68 % Total $ 782,957 $ 15,408 7.98 % $ 763,132 $ 14,417 7.66 %\nNine Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Average Interest Average Interest Balance (1) Income Yield Balance (1) Income Yield (Dollars in thousands) Community Banking $ 142,873 $ 5,242 4.89 % $ 199,566 $ 7,150 4.77 % SBA 52,014 2,772 7.10 % 36,867 1,771 6.07 % LASG: Originated 340,014 16,746 6.56 % 219,140 10,030 6.10 % Purchased 237,183 20,532 11.53 % 236,822 20,925 11.77 % Secured Loans to Broker-Dealers - - - 41,409 256 0.82 % Total LASG 577,197 37,278 8.60 % 497,371 31,211 8.36 % Total $ 772,084 $ 45,292 7.81 % $ 735,804 $ 40,132 7.27 % (1) Includes loans held for sale.

The total return on purchased loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 12.16%.

Noninterest income decreased by $426 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, principally due to the following:\nA decrease in gain on sale of SBA loans of $391 thousand, due to a lower volume of SBA loans sold in the quarter; and A decrease in gain on sale of residential loans of $54 thousand, due to lower volume of residential loans sold in the quarter.\n3. Noninterest expense increased by $133 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the following:\nAn increase of $312 thousand in other noninterest expense, primarily due to $140 thousand of expense related to the quarterly valuation of SBA servicing rights recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2018, and a $167 thousand recovery from a legacy mortgage insurance premium plan that was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2017, with no such recovery recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2018; An increase of $164 thousand in data processing fees, primarily due to the increased cost associated with the outsourcing of data processing; and An increase of $126 thousand in salaries and employee benefits, primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation and a decrease in deferred salaries driven by loan originations, offset by a decrease in salaries due to a decrease in headcount. The increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a decrease in loan expense of $464 thousand, largely driven by lower expense related to loan acquisition, collection, and refinance activity.\n4. Income tax expense decreased by $335 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, $397 thousand of which was due to a decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, offset by an increase related to a higher pre-tax net income amount.\nAs of March 31, 2018, nonperforming assets totaled $14.6 million, or 1.25% of total assets, as compared to $19.0 million, or 1.84% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017, and $14.8 million, or 1.37% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, past due loans totaled $11.2 million, or 1.37% of total loans, as compared to $30.0 million, or 3.87% of total loans as of December 31, 2017, and $13.4 million, or 1.72% of total loans as of June 30, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 12.9%, compared to 12.8% at June 30, 2017, and the Total Capital Ratio was 19.9%, compared to 19.5% at June 30, 2017.\nInvestor Call Information\nRichard Wayne, Chief Executive Officer of Northeast Bancorp, and Jean-Pierre Lapointe, Chief Financial Officer of Northeast Bancorp, will host a conference call to discuss third quarter earnings and business outlook at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 26th.
