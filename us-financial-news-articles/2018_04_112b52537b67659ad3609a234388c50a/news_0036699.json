Bush. Under Trump, he worked at the White House with George David Banks, who handled international energy and environmental issues such as the president's plan to leave the 2015 Paris climate accord.\nCatanzaro, whose move was first reported by E&E News, joins other economics officials who have recently left the White House after a chaotic year. Banks resigned in February because of difficulties getting security clearance. Gary Cohn, who was Trump's top economic adviser, resigned last month.\nLarry Kudlow, Cohn's replacement, said in a release that Catanzaro's dedication to Trump's energy priorities was \"greatly valued and he will be missed.\"\nCatanzaro will return to CGCN Group, an advocacy and public relations company, as a consultant and adviser. Previously he worked at CGCN for clients who pushed Washington to lift a 40-year-old ban on oil exports as shale drilling led to explosive growth in crude output. Congress killed the ban in late 2015 after President Barack Obama's administration had allowed exports of some light oil.\nCGCN managing partner Steve Clark said in a statement that Catanzaro's White House experience \"will be an invaluable resource\" to clients and that the firm will make sure he complies with all relevant ethics guidelines.\nDays after taking office in 2017, Trump, who promised to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington, signed an executive order that said his appointees would refrain from lobbying their own agency for five years after leaving, although there is no criminal penalty for doing so.\nThe White House aide also said Catanzaro will abide by all ethics rules that apply to lobbying the administration.\nUnder Pence, Brooke has had a low profile. Last year he moderated a panel at U.N. climate talks on how fossil fuels and nuclear power will be part of the energy future.
