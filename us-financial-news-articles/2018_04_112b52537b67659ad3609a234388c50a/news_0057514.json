You can seal them, but you can just open them back up,” Lewis said.\nThe second U.S. official concurred, saying that Punggye-ri could be reactivated “in a relatively short period of time” if it is closed.\nIf Pyongyang does halt nuclear testing and shuts the site, the second official said, “It will be possible to ascertain with existing monitoring whether it is being put out of commission permanently or merely closed.” Reporting by Jonathan Landay and John Walcott; Editing by Phil Berlowitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T23:58:55.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
