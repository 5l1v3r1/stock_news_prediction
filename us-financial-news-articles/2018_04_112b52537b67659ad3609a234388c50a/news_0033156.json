Collins said they do not except Nix’s reason for not appearing and is considering issuing a formal summons in an emailed statement to Reuters . \n“There is therefore no legal reason why Mr. Nix cannot appear,” Collins added. \nCambridge Analytica gained information on approximately 87 million Facebook users , passed on from Aleksandr Kogan, who created the app “thisisyourdigitallife.” Facebook said it asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data back in 2015 when it first learned the company inappropriately gained access to the information. After reports surfaced that Cambridge Analytica still had that data, the company claimed it deleted it while suspending then-CEO Nix. Acting CEO Alexander Tayler stepped down weeks later as well, returning to his former position as chief data officer.
