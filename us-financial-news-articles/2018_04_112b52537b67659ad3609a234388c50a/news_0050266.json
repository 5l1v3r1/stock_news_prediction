Did you know that as of 2016, women employed full-time made 20 percent less, on average, than their male counterparts? Though the gap has been slowly improving since the 1970s, experts estimate that equal pay for men and women won't be the norm until the year 2119. Social scientists continue to research the root and solution of unequal pay, but for now, one thing is for sure: We aren't helpless as women in the workplace.\nCurious what you can do to help close the gap ? Here are a few practical ways to do your part in bringing equity to the workforce.\nMore from Levo: \nHere's what it would *actually* take for women to win equal pay \nWithin the gender pay gap, working moms fall even farther behind \n7 tips for finding work that's meaningful to you \nPractice civic engagement  Effective legislation on local, state, and federal levels could make a big difference in eradicating the gender pay gap. Though the gap is a nationwide problem with national consequences, each state has its own pay gap. Do some research on where your state stacks up against other states and call or write state lawmakers, urging them to address gender wage issues in state laws. You can also encourage state lawmakers to support federal efforts toward closing the gender pay gap. On a local level, contact city or community officials and ask them to observe Equal Pay Day in your area to help the cause gain traction.\nEqual pay is likely to be a key issue in upcoming elections, so on top of reaching out to local officials, be intentional about registering to vote and showing up at the polls for local, state, and federal elections.\nHost an event or forum If you're willing to invest a little more time and energy in your passion for equal pay, take your passion to the community and host an issue forum locally on fair pay. Consider inviting local lawmakers, university sociology or economics professors, or business leaders for a forum discussion on paving a way forward in the midst of discrimination in the workplace.\nIf you want to do something a little bit more creative — and provocative — one fair pay advocacy organization suggests hosting an \"unequal\" happy hour. Partner with a local restaurant or bar and host a gathering where men pay full price and women receive 20 percent off, proportional to their average earnings in comparison to men. You and your gal pals will enjoy cheaper drinks, and your male colleagues may begin to realize how it feels to be financially disadvantaged because of their gender.\nshow chapters One woman paid off over $8,000 in credit card debt in 90 days—here's how she did it      7:59 AM ET Fri, 28 July 2017 | 01:13 Share about it on social media  Many people might not even be aware of the disparity in salary between men and women.
