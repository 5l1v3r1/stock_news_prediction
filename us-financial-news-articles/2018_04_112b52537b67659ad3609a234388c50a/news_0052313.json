It has fallen more than 9 percent this week.\nRUSAL: The world’s second-biggest aluminium producer will overhaul its board and management in the hope of persuading the United States to lift sanctions, but it may be forced to suspend aluminium exports for good if the plan fails, sources close to the company said.\nALUMINIUM INVENTORIES: On-warrant aluminium stocks - those not earmarked for delivery and available to the market - rose by 12,475 tonnes to 930,125 tonnes, exchange data showed on Friday.\nALUMINIUM TECHNICALS: A break in aluminium prices below support at $2,260 could cause a loss to $2,195, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\nCOLUMN: U.S. sanctions on Rusal shatter aluminium’s supply chain: Andy Home\nCOPPER: Industrial metals bellwether copper did not trade at the close but was bid down 2.4 percent at $6,796 a tonne, suffering from the impact of a firmer dollar, which makes metals expensive for holders of other currencies\nESCONDIDA: Chile’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, said on Thursday that early contract talks with its workers’ union ended without an agreement, setting the stage for legally scheduled negotiations to begin in June.\nOTHER METALS: LME zinc ended 0.5 percent down at $3,121 a tonne, lead finished 0.4 percent up at $2,346, nickel was bid down 2.3 percent at $13,875 and tin closed with a 2.3 percent decline at $20,900.
