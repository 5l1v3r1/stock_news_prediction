U.S. tech giants such as Google ( GOOGL.O ), Facebook ( FB.O ) and Amazon ( AMZN.O ) would foot a large chunk of any bill.\nThe Commission said top digital firms, whose average revenue growth of 14 percent far exceeded that of other multinationals, faced an effective tax rate of 9.5 percent, less than half the level of traditional companies.\nUnder the plan, companies with significant digital revenues in Europe will pay a 3 percent tax on their turnover on various online services in the European Union, bringing in an estimated 5 billion euros ($6.18 billion).\nThe European Parliament and all 28 member states need to back the tax reforms for them to become law.\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and other EU leaders oppose the Commission’s plans to claw tax from the digital economy. Despite support from big powers Germany and, especially, France, that risks making it very hard to turn the idea into European law.\nReporting by Gernot Heller in Berlin and Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels; Writing by Michelle Martin; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T05:11:00.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
