U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he may travel to China, a move that could ease trade tensions between the world's two largest economies.\nA stronger dollar \"was the trend overnight, mostly due to positive sentiment on trade,\" said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho in New York.\nRising U.S. bond yields have not always fed through to a higher dollar in 2018 as U.S. political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have sometimes caused a breakdown between interest rates and currency performance.\nBut with the 10-year Treasury yield closing in on 3 percent and the gap between U.S. and German government bond rates at a 29-year high, the dollar was bought across the board.\nshow chapters The dollar is going to be weaker this year, says strategist 2:57 AM ET Thu, 19 April 2018 | 02:42 Against a basket of currencies the dollar index rose 0.63 percent to 90.89, its highest level since March 1.\nThe euro fell by 0.59 percent to $1.2213, not helped by a survey showing business activity in April stabilizing across the euro zone.\nThe euro had enjoyed a strong rally until February before finding itself stuck in a trading range with the dollar after the European Central Bank cautioned investors expecting it to raise rates sooner than expected.\n\"I dont think theres going to be any change in policy this week. I think the tone might be a little more dovish, especially on the Euro. The last ECB minutes revealed a little bit more concern on the currency side,\" said Harajli\nThe ECB holds its monetary policy meeting on Thursday.\nThe rise in bond yields also weakened Asian emerging market currencies versus the dollar, with the Chinese yuan and Korean won down and the Indonesian rupiah hitting a two-year low of 13,889 per dollar.\nThe Australian dollar skidded to its weakest since Dec. 13, falling to as low as $0.7613, while sterling and New Zealand dollars also dropped.\nThe yen slumped 0.89 percent to 108.61 yen per dollar, its weakest since Feb. 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T05:20:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
