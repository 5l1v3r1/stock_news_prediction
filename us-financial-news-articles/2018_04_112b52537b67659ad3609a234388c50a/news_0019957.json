Terraces will ascend in a spiraling motion, inspiring the name of the 2.8 million square foot (260,130 square meter) building.\nThe mixed-use Hudson Yards has pushed Manhattan’s core Midtown business area westward toward the Hudson River, drawing a number of marquee firms to the burgeoning district.\nPfizer, the building’s anchor tenant, will occupy 15 full floors as part of an 800,000 square foot lease that includes a lobby that rises as high as 28 feet, Tishman said.\nRelated Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which have spearheaded Hudson Yard’s development, also announced on Tuesday the start of construction of what the companies described as the highest outdoor observation deck in the Western Hemisphere at nearby 30 Hudson Yards.\nFried Frank was legal advisor for Blackstone Mortgage Trust, and Sullivan & Cromwell for Tishman Speyer.\nA Cushman & Wakefield team led by Josh Kuriloff represented Pfizer in the lease negotiation.\nEditing by Bernadette Baum and Daniel Bases\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T17:30:38.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
