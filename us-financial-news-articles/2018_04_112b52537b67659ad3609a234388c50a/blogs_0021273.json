Spotify Premium costs $9.99 per month for ad-free service and access to its music library. Hulu's \"limited ads\" service costs $7.99 per month.\nThe companies are also offering a promotion that allows subscribers to test the limited-ad plan for 99 cents for three months before they're billed the full $12.99 for the bundle. Here's how that pricing works, according to Hulu:\nYou'll pay one bill to Spotify for both services. Your first month is the price of your Premium plan plus the Hulu 3-month trial price. After your trial, you'll then start paying $12.99/month for both. Here's what it looks like:\n1st month: $9.99 + $0.99 + tax\n2nd month: $9.99 + tax\n3rd month $9.99 + tax\nFollowing months: $12.99 + tax\nThe new option is currently only available to users who pay for Spotify Premium, though Hulu said it plans to offer it to everyone sometime this summer. \nOf note: Spotify offers a $14.99 a month premium subscription for families, though there's currently no option to add Hulu if you're paying for that.\nDisclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T16:41:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
