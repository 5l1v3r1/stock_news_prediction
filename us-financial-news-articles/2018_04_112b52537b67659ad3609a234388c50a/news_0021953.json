REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \n“Rampage” is a passion project for Johnson, who is also an executive producer and turned heads during the promotional tour by revealing he had often suffered bouts of depression beginning when he was a teenager. \nBut Johnson says he could not let his early love of the video game get in the way of paying attention to film’s the bottom line. \n“Money’s not growing on trees for anybody, so there’s also responsibility there, we had to make sure that it’s good,” Johnson said. “You want to have fun but you also recognize that the pressure is on to deliver especially in the monster genre.” \nThe film is estimated to gross some $36.5 million in its opening weekend at U.S. and Canadian cinemas, according to boxoffice.com.
