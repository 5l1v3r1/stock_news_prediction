REUTERS/Luc Gnago Its creation was a provision of a new constitution enacted in 2016. Ivory Coast’s main opposition groups boycotted the referendum that approved the charter as well as polls last month that elected 66 members to the 99-seat body.\n“The senate is installed. It is an important chamber for the rooting of democracy,” said Ouattara, addressing the newly elected lawmakers bedecked in green, white and orange sashes - the colours of the Ivorian flag. “It is a chamber of wisdom.”\nThe senate will be headed by Jeannot Ahoussou-Kouadio, a former prime minister and member of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast (PDCI), the main coalition partner of Ouattara’s Rally of the Republicans (RDR).\nIvorian President, Alassane Ouattara, speaks during the opening ceremony of the Senate in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast April 12, 2018.

But opposition members say the body - a third of whose seats will be appointed by the executive - is little more than a power grab.\nThe ruling coalition already dominates the existing National Assembly, which will become the lower house of parliament.\n“This is the worst of democratic retreats. It’s abhorrent,” Boubakar Kone, a spokesman for one of the two rival factions of Gbagbo’s Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) party, told Reuters.\nOuattara has yet to name the final 33 senators, though it is expected the list will include some opposition figures.\nAdditional reporting by Joe Bavier; Editing by Sofia Christensen and Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T20:16:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
