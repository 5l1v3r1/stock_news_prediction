Over the last year, our common shares resumed trading in Peru and Canada and, at our last Annual General Meeting held in December 2017, our shareholders demonstrated their faith in management by re-electing the entire Board of Directors.\nLast year was also a year for focusing on protecting our assets, after COFIDE revoked its mandate to finance our Ollachea Project. We filed an arbitration action against COFIDE and obtained a court order suspending COFIDE’s legal efforts to collect any debt or to execute guarantees related to repayment of the Bridge Loan until the arbitration process is finalized. The Arbitral Tribunal has ratified the court order. At the same time, we have begun to actively pursue alternatives to finance development of the Ollachea Project with banks and investment funds.\nGold production at Corihuarmi increased by 5% over 2016, reaching 24,709 gold ounces, and we reported a gross profit of $7.6 million and a net profit after taxes of US$ 0.8 million.
