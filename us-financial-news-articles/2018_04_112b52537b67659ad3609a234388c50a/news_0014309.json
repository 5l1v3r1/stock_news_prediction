But 56 people who had not reached settlements remained in custody and could face trial, the government said late in January.\nSaud al-Hamad, deputy attorney general for investigations, told Al Sharq Al Awsat that whoever is charged will be referred to court for prosecution in cases related to money laundering or terrorism. He provided no other details about the suspects.\nHamad said some of those under investigation had failed to respect confidential agreements while others committed further, unspecified, offences.\nThe anti-corruption campaign is part of Prince Mohammed’s push to transform an oil-dependent economy long plagued by graft but now contending with lower global crude prices. But it remains shrouded in secrecy with few specific allegations or details of financial settlements revealed.\nReporting By Stephen Kalin; editing by Susan Fenton, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T15:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T11:47:32.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
