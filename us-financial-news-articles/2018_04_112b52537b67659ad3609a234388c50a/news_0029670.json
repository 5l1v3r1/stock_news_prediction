The decision to sell the units was taken “on conclusion of a strategic review of its portfolio of businesses,” Infosys said.\nA whistleblower had alleged irregularities in the $200 million Panaya acquisition and Infosys’ founders had asked the company to probe the claims. Infosys has denied the allegations.\nSikka, who joined Infosys from German software giant SAP SE in 2014, resigned last year, blaming a “continuous drumbeat of distractions” and a long-running row with the founders over company strategy.\nREVENUE GROWTH Infosys forecast 6 to 8 percent revenue growth for the year to March in constant currency terms, which was in line with expectations, local brokerage KotaK Securities said in a flash note after the results. The forecast fell slightly short of Macquarie’s expectation of 6.5 percent to 8.5 percent.\nIndia’s software services exports are expected to register revenue growth of 7-9 percent in constant currency terms in the fiscal year to March 2019, according to a leading lobby group.\nInfosys also tried to cheer investors as it announced a dividend of 20.50 rupees ($0.3141) per share for the fiscal year ending March 2018 and recommended a special dividend.\nThe company has decided to return up to 70 percent of its free cash flow to shareholders every year in a manner decided by the board, Chief Financial Officer M D Ranganath said, adding that the company was giving $400 million to investors as special dividend immediately.\nIt also announced a definitive agreement to acquire U.S-based WONGDOODY, a creative and consumer insights agency.\nNet profit rose 2.4 percent to 36.90 billion rupees in the three months ended March 31, compared with 36.03 billion rupees a year ago, Infosys said.\nEighteen analysts had on average expected net profit of 37.09 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nRevenue from operations rose by 5.6 percent to 180.83 billion rupees in the quarter.\nInfosys’ bigger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reports quarterly earnings on April 19.
