EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This measure is important to management since it is used by potential investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. Investors are cautioned that this non-IFRS financial measure should not be construed as an alternative to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nAdditional Information\nDetailed financial information and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 can be found on SEDAR’s website at www.sedar.com .
