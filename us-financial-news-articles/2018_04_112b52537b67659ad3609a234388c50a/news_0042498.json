Hollywood celebrities launched their own #TimesUp movement this year. [L8N1OX1GJ]\nAmy Adrion, whose documentary “Half the Picture” looks at the dearth of female directors in Hollywood, will join major British film funders to discuss how to create a more inclusive industry.\nOther directors who will discuss their work include this year’s winner of the Sundance U.S. Grand Jury Prize, Desiree Akhavan, whose film “The Miseducation of Cameron Post” tells the story of a girl forced into gay conversion therapy.\nActress Toni Collette will also take part in a Q and A about her horror film “Hereditary”.\nEditing by Claire Cozens, Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.
