The service offers board seat search assistance to both ACCD members and public companies in the board member search process, all at no charge to either ACCD members or the board search companies. The ACCD has, as board candidates, experienced public company director members representing a broad base, including gender, ethnicity, and all aspects of board member service. ACCD Certified Professional Director board member candidates have gone through a rigorous program of director education, much of which is taught by professors from the country’s leading business and law schools.\nACCD Founder and President, Clint Allen, said, “Executive search firms charge six-figure fees for identifying board of director candidates; our ACCD Director Referral Service has no charge to all qualified companies and utilizes search criteria furnished by the participating company to identify our members who fit the desired profile. We have, in the ACCD board candidate group, women and men, African American, Hispanic, Asian and Indian. Experience includes former and current CEO and CFOs, retired Big Four partners, investment bankers and General Officers, Admirals and Generals, from all service branches and many, many more.”\nTo engage the ACCD Director Referral Service, a company in a board member search need only email the organization, ( directorsearch@accdirectors.com ) using their company email address, list the criteria for the search, and the ACCD will scan their board candidate database and identify those with the exact or close search criteria matches. The search company will be sent CVs of those candidates for consideration. There is no further ACCD involvement.\nThe ACCD Director Referral Service is currently accepting search requests at: directorsearch@accdirectors.com\nContact:\nClint Allen\n(781) 449-6700\nSource:American College of Corporate Directors", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/78a9eeb4-9674-4731-a9e8-fec84f699e32", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TT3byfAyIodp_5Zk_qBH7rGtJBq-wh44frYMI93LsRT53IhvGX16057GVTkX9HGMGyNTU_ghLFk8pMOgpjdAw3SvPinrtf5IRQ3n0EqXzW6rkrSUay2tmBcUlQ9DvP20", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=TT3byfAyIodp_5Zk_qBH7rGtJBq-wh44frYMI93LsRRjwHipbQdo0qSWR3xhCviRqA-hO37JFm_r0RU4xTzqhemO0DJKpZu3lDsbh9zhgxT9bFQJ8JiQ1zal-5UYX0DP"], "published": "2018-04-10T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T17:09:18.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
