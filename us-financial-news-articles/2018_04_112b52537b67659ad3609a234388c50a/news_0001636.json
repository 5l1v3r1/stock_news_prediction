Earlier in the session, they fell to 562 yuan, their lowest since November.\nIn December, China temporarily halted coal imports at some small ports by delaying customs clearance after the total import volume exceeded an unofficial government target, two trade sources said in January.\nReporting by Meng Meng and Josephine Mason; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:42:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
