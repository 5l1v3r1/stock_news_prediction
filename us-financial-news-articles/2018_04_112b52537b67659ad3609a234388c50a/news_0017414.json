The Alliance is dedicated to bringing the progressive business community together so we can amplify our voices and find new ways to work together to solve big problems facing our Commonwealth and our country -- from transportation, to diversity, housing, technology education and the environment.\"\nBeth succeeds venture capitalist and Alliance Chair and Co-founder Jeff Bussgang who will continue to serve on the Alliance's Executive Committee as the immediate past chair. \"We created ABL to galvanize and harness business leaders dedicated to tackling economic inequality and social mobility,\" said Jeff. \"We know that making progress on these issues is critical to the long-term success and prosperity of the Commonwealth.
