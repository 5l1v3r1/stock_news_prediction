REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nNorthern Ireland will be Britain’s only land frontier with the European Union after Brexit. Both sides say they are committed to keeping the border with the Irish Republic open, but finding a practical solution has proved elusive so far.\nThe EU and Dublin insist the Brexit treaty must lock in a backstop arrangement in case a future trade pact does not remove the need for border controls. London signed up for this last month but disagrees with the EU’s means of achieving it.

REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n“I am confident that together with unity of the EU27 and a constructive attitude on both sides, we will be able to agree the right solution,” he told a news conference in the Irish border town of Dundalk. However, he added: “There is a real risk and we have to be prepared for any options, including no deal.”\nUnder the EU proposal, if all other attempts to avoid a hard border fail, Northern Ireland would form a “common regulatory area” with Ireland and 26 other EU states, in effect keeping the British province in a customs union with the EU.\nBritain, which is still debating its own Brexit strategy, says an EU-UK free-trade deal to be sealed by 2021 can solve the border issue, and Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected the EU proposal as a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK.
