Thad, who was most recently Chief Operating Officer, succeeds founding CEO Bruce Ge, who will now serve as Chairman.\n“Thad’s expertise and accomplishments make him the ideal person to lead Jobs2Careers in its next growth phase. Not only is he an industry veteran who understands the market inside and out, but he knows how to build the right team to deliver his vision,” said Bruce. “Thad has the integrity to always do the right thing, whether it’s for our partners or our employees. It’s these qualities that made him a natural choice for Jobs2Careers’ new leader.”\nThad joined Jobs2Careers in 2013 to lead new product development. With over ten years of experience in the HR technology industry, Thad’s invaluable experience enabled him to lead the creation of innovative products to serve talent acquisition professionals.

In addition to big-picture vision, Thad has advised Bruce on strategic planning and corporate positioning throughout his tenure.\nUnder Bruce’s leadership as CEO, Jobs2Careers earned a spot in the Inc. 5000 list of fastest-growing companies for four consecutive years and counting.

Jobs2Careers has also won an Association for Corporate Growth Award and has been named a “Best Place to Work” by both the Austin Business Journal and the Austin American-Statesman.\nA hallmark of Bruce’s tenure was his management training program, which he ran himself. Bruce’s lecture series was designed to develop rising leaders internally, so Jobs2Careers would be able to promote from within. That internal growth plan for talent is one reason Bruce can confidently turn Jobs2Careers over to Thad.\n“Bruce has been an amazing leader and mentor and has taught me how to build an organization that leads with data and executes with purpose. Great people grow great companies, and Bruce’s focus on talent has gotten us to where we are now,” said Thad. “I’m incredibly excited to lead this fantastic company into the future, with a focus on growth, technology, and efficiency, and I’m very grateful to Bruce for the opportunity.”\nAbout Jobs2Careers\nJobs2Careers builds technology to help employers effectively find talent.
