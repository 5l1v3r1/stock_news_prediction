Iraq plans to stop flaring by 2021 and is building facilities to process gas captured at its fields into fuel for local consumption or export. Gas flaring costs nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue for the government and would be sufficient to meet most gas‚Äêbased power generation needs, according to the World Bank.\nReporting by Maher Chmaytelli; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T12:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:59:24.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
