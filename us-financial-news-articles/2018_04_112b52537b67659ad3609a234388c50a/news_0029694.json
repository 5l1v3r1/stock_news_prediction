Picture taken March 24, 2018. REUTERS/Christopher Pike Prices have trended sideways since January, buoyed by geopolitical worries but capped by expectations for further U.S. interest rate hikes and strong technical resistance at $1,360-$1,365 an ounce - their January, February and April highs.\nSpot gold was at $1,346.91 an ounce at 1335 GMT, up 0.1 percent, while U.S. gold futures were 0.2 percent higher at $1,350.10 an ounce.\nForces from the United States, Britain and France targeted Syria with air strikes on Saturday, hitting what they said were three of its main chemical weapons facilities.\nGold prices reached an early high of $1,348.69 on the back of the news, but struggled to maintain those gains on expectations the attacks would not mark the start of greater Western involvement in the conflict.\n“Some of the risk (premium) has come down following the air strikes,” Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini said. “Some market participants were thinking that maybe there could be an escalation of the tensions, but that has not happened and therefore prices have come down a bit.”\n“If you consider that the Fed is tightening we should see lower gold prices. Instead, they have been moving sideways,” she said. “There is certainly some risk premium incorporated into prices ... but there is no trigger for higher prices at the moment.”\nSupporting gold in the near term, the dollar sank 0.5 percent against the euro, reaching its lows for the day as Wall Street stocks opened higher.
