You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n*About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share (“EPS”), and non-GAAP diluted shares. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding items such as intangible asset charges, share-based compensation (“SBC”) expenses, and other special items. Intangible asset charges consist of non-cash charges, such as the amortization of intangible assets, as well as in-process R&D charges. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to its historical performance and liquidity. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of the Company’s business.\nNon-GAAP gross profit . The Company defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit excluding intangible asset charges, expenses related to SBC, and litigation charges.\nNon-GAAP income from operations . The Company defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations excluding intangible asset charges, expenses related to SBC, and litigation charges and recoveries.\nNon-GAAP net income and EPS . The Company defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) excluding intangible asset charges; expenses related to SBC; litigation charges and recoveries, net of the related tax effects; and tax adjustments including the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, the provisional income tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Act”), and the net tax effects related to intra-entity transfers of non-inventory assets. The Company excludes income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act because of its one-time nature as well as the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements and the tax effects associated with non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity non-inventory transfers as the Company does not believe these items correlate with the on-going results of its core operations. The tax effects of the non-GAAP items are determined by applying a calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate, which is commonly referred to as the with-and-without method. Without excluding these tax effects, investors would only see the gross effect that these non-GAAP adjustments had on the Company’s operating results. The Company’s calculated non-GAAP effective tax rate is generally higher than its GAAP effective tax rate. The Company defines non-GAAP EPS as non-GAAP net income divided by non-GAAP diluted shares which are calculated as GAAP weighted average outstanding shares plus dilutive potential shares outstanding during the period.\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP measures versus measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP EPS exclude items such as intangible asset charges, SBC, excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with share-based compensation arrangements, and non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets related to intra-entity transfer of non-inventory assets, which are primarily recurring items. SBC has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the Company’s business. In addition, the components of the costs that the Company excludes in its calculation of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS may differ from the components that its peer companies exclude when they report their results of operations. Management addresses these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS and evaluating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS together with net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThree months ended In millions (except per share data) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Revenue: Instruments and accessories $ 460.3 $ 457.1 $ 380.8 Systems 234.5 284.5 160.8 Services 152.7 150.4 138.0 Total revenue 847.5 892.0 679.6 Cost of revenue: Product 201.5 210.7 165.5 Service 52.2 47.3 44.3 Total cost of revenue 253.7 258.0 209.8 Gross profit 593.8 634.0 469.8 Operating expenses: Selling, general and administrative 221.6 217.9 202.9 Research and development 95.5 87.1 73.5 Total operating expenses 317.1 305.0 276.4 Income from operations 276.7 329.0 193.4 Interest and other income, net 13.2 12.3 8.7 Income before taxes 289.9 341.3 202.1 Income tax expense (1) 2.6 372.8 21.3 Net income (loss) 287.3 (31.5 ) 180.8 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest (0.3 ) — — Net income (loss) attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc. $ 287.6 $ (31.5 ) $ 180.8 Net income (loss) per share attributable to Intuitive Surgical, Inc.: Basic $ 2.55 $ (0.28 ) $ 1.62 Diluted (2) $ 2.44 $ (0.28 ) $ 1.57 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 112.8 112.2 111.9 Diluted* 118.0 112.2 115.5 (1) Income tax expense includes the effect of the following item: Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements $ (54.7 ) $ (19.9 ) $ (32.6 ) Income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act** $ — $ 317.8 $ — (2) Diluted net income (loss) per share includes the effect of the following items: Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation arrangements $ 0.46 $ 0.18 $ 0.28 Income tax expense related to the 2017 Tax Act** $ — $ (2.83 ) $ — (*) The fourth quarter 2017 diluted share amount did not include approximately 5.2 million shares, because including such shares would have been anti-dilutive due to the net loss incurred in the period.
