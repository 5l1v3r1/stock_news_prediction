An independent national anti-doping panel has suspended him until Sept. 6, 2021. \n“Ultimately individuals are responsible for what they put into their bodies and this case highlights what can happen if a player is not vigilant,” Stephen Watkins, RFU Anti-Doping and Illicit Drugs Programme Manager, said in a statement. \nYorkshire Carnegie are sixth in the 12-team RFU Championship, the second-tier of English rugby.
