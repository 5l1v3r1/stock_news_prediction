EQM operating income was $178.3 million, which was 23% higher than last year. The Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measure as well as important disclosures regarding projected adjusted EBITDA and projected distributable cash flow.\nEQT GP Holdings, LP (NYSE: EQGP) today announced net income attributable to EQGP of $80.7 million for the first quarter 2018.\nEQM HIGHLIGHTS:\nAnnounced streamlining transaction in a separate news release issued today Increased EQM per unit distribution by 20% compared to Q1 2017 Maintained a 1.42x coverage ratio for the quarter Generated 89% of operating revenue from firm reservation fees Commenced construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline Initiated a binding open season for the MVP Southgate project\nEQM first quarter operating revenue increased $32.8 million, 16% higher compared to the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to higher contracted firm transmission and gathering capacity and increased seasonal storage related services. During the quarter, 89% of operating revenue was generated by firm reservation fees. Operating expenses were flat versus the first quarter of 2017, as higher operating and maintenance (O&M) expense and depreciation and amortization expense were offset by lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. The increase in O&M expense was driven by higher system throughput and SG&A expense was lower primarily from a decrease in personnel costs.\nSTREAMLINING TRANSACTION\nEQM, EQGP, Rice Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: RMP), and EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) today announced a midstream streamlining transaction that includes:\nEQM's purchase of EQT's retained midstream assets for $1.15 billion in cash and 5.9 million EQM common units and Gulfport Energy's 25% ownership in the Strike Force Gathering System for $175 million in cash. The merger of EQM and RMP in a unit-for-unit transaction at an exchange ratio of 0.3319x, which implies a transaction value of $2.4 billion, including the assumption of RMP debt. The RMP debt balance was $325 million as of March 31, 2018. EQGP's purchase of the RMP Incentive Distribution Rights from EQT for 36.3 million EQGP common units.\nFor details on the streamlining transaction please refer to the news release issued today and available at www.eqtmidstreampartners.com or www.ricemidstream.com .\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION\nEQM\nFor the first quarter of 2018, EQM will pay a quarterly cash distribution of $1.065 per unit, which will be paid on May 15, 2018 to EQM unitholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2018. The quarterly cash distribution is 4% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and is 20% higher than the first quarter of 2017.\nEQGP\nFor the first quarter of 2018, EQGP will pay a quarterly cash distribution of $0.258 per unit, which will be paid on May 24, 2018 to EQGP unitholders of record at the close of business on May 4, 2018. The quarterly cash distribution is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017 and is 35% higher than the first quarter 2017 distribution. For the quarter, EQGP expects to receive $69.7 million of cash distributions from EQM and distribute $68.7 million.\nGUIDANCE\nThe financial projections for full-year and Q2 2018 assume a May 1, 2018 effective date for the acquisition of EQT's retained midstream assets and Gulfport Energy's 25% ownership of Strike Force (Ohio Gathering Assets) and a September 1, 2018 closing date for the RMP merger. Over the long-term, EQM is targeting 3.5x debt to EBITDA, which is an investment grade metric; and a 1.1x-1.2x distribution coverage ratio. EQM continues to target annual distribution per unit growth of 15% to 20% for several years. Based on the strength of EQM’s credit metrics and the current organic growth project backlog, EQM is not forecasting any additional public equity issuance at least through 2020.\nEQM 2018 2019 2020 Net Income ($B) $0.70 – $0.80 $0.95 – $1.05 $1.00 – $1.10 Adjusted EBITDA ($B) $0.90 – $1.00 $1.40 – $1.50 $1.55 – $1.65 Distributable Cash Flow ($B) $0.75 – $0.85 $1.15 – $1.25 $1.25 – $1.35 Distribution per unit (using midpoint of guidance)* $4.50 $5.29 $6.21 EQGP 2018 2019 2020 Distribution per unit* $1.21 $1.67 $2.09 Distribution per unit year-over-year growth* 39% 38% 25% *Based on midpoint of 15% - 20% year-over-year distribution growth rate guidance for EQM.\nEQM\nQ2 2018\nNet Income ($MM)\n$170 – $180\nAdjusted EBITDA ($MM)\n$205 – $215\nDue to the seasonal nature of some transmission and storage services, primarily from utility customer contracts, second quarter 2018 revenue from these contracts and services will be lower than first quarter by approximately $20 million.\nEQM is unable to provide a projection of its full-year 2018, 2019 or 2020 net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measure to distributable cash flow calculated in accordance with GAAP. Please see the Non-GAAP Disclosures section of this news release.\nEQM EXPANSION & ONGOING MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nExpansion\nExpansion capital expenditures and capital contributions to Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC (MVP JV), totaled $198 million in the first quarter 2018. The full-year pro forma forecast below assumes a May 1, 2018 effective date for acquisition of the Ohio Gathering Assets and a September 1, 2018 closing of the EQM/RMP merger.\n$MM\nThree Months Ended 2018 Full-year\nMarch 31, 2018 Pro Forma Forecast Mountain Valley Pipeline $117 $1,000 - $1,200 Gathering $67 $485 Transmission $14 $100 Water - $15 Total $198 $1,600 - $1,800 Ongoing Maintenance\nOngoing maintenance capital expenditures are cash expenditures made to maintain, over the long-term, EQM operating capacity or operating income. EQM ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, net of expected reimbursements, totaled $3.9 million in the first quarter 2018. EQM forecasts pro forma full-year 2018 ongoing maintenance capital expenditures of $45 million.\nPROJECT UPDATE\nMountain Valley Pipeline\nIn January 2018, MVP JV began filing requests for partial Notices to Proceed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and subsequently has received permission to begin construction activities in nearly all areas along the route. In the first quarter, MVP JV completed all tree-felling activities subject to the March 31 biological deadline. The 303-mile pipeline is estimated to cost $3.5 billion, with EQM funding its proportional share, or approximately $1.6 billion. MVP JV has secured a total of 2 Bcf per day of firm capacity commitments at 20-year terms and continues to target a late 2018 in-service date.\nMVP Southgate\nThe MVP Southgate project will receive gas from MVP and extend approximately 70 miles south to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance Counties, North Carolina. The project is anchored by a firm capacity commitment from PSNC Energy. The final project scope will be determined after a binding open season, which is scheduled to end on May 11, 2018. The preliminary project cost estimate is $350 to $500 million. EQM is expected to have between 33% and 48% ownership in the project and will operate the pipeline. Subject to approval by the FERC, MVP Southgate has a targeted in-service date of the fourth quarter 2020.\nHammerhead Pipeline\nThe Hammerhead pipeline is designed as a 1.2 Bcf per day gathering header pipeline that will traverse approximately 55 miles from southwestern Pennsylvania to Mobley, West Virginia, where both the MVP and the Ohio Valley Connector originate. The pipeline is estimated to cost $460 million and is expected to be placed in-service during the third quarter of 2019.\nMANAGEMENT\nOn March 14, 2018, Jerry Ashcroft was named President and Chief Executive Officer of EQM, EQGP, and Rice Midstream Partners LP. Jerry was previously senior vice president and chief operating officer for the general partner of EQM. He has more than 15 years of experience in the oil, gas, and pipeline industries – including most recently as chief executive officer of Gulf Oil L.P.\nNON-GAAP DISCLOSURES\nEQM Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nAs used in this news release, EQM adjusted EBITDA means EQM’s net income plus net interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, payments on EQM's preferred interest in EQT Energy Supply, LLC (Preferred Interest) and non-cash long-term compensation expense less equity income and AFUDC - equity. As used in this news release, distributable cash flow means EQM adjusted EBITDA less net interest expense excluding interest income on the Preferred Interest, capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements. Distributable cash flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that EQM has available for distributions from operating surplus or that EQM plans to distribute. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess:\nEQM’s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of EQM’s assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to EQM unitholders; EQM’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nEQM believes that adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide useful information to investors in assessing EQM’s results of operations and financial condition. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, EQM’s definition of adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measures. The table below reconciles adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow with net income and net cash provided by operating activities as derived from the statements of consolidated operations and cash flows to be included in EQM’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nEQM is unable to project net cash provided by operating activities or provide the related reconciliation between projected distributable cash flow and projected net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because net cash provided by operating activities includes the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Changes in operating assets and liabilities relate to the timing of EQM’s cash receipts and disbursements that may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred, and EQM is unable to project these timing differences with any reasonable degree of accuracy to a specific day, three or more months in advance. EQM is also unable to provide a reconciliation of its projected EBITDA to projected net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because EQM does not provide guidance with respect to the intra-year timing of its or the MVP JV’s capital spending, which impact AFUDC-debt and equity and equity earnings, among other items, that are reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net income. The timing of capital expenditures is volatile as it depends on weather, regulatory approvals, contractor availability, system performance and various other items. EQM provides a range for the forecasts of net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow to allow for the variability in the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, capital spending and the impact on the related reconciling items, many of which interplay with each other. Therefore, the reconciliations of projected distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA to projected net cash provided by operating activities and net income are not available without unreasonable effort.\nEarnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA)\nEBITDA means the earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of the EQT's retained midstream assets. EBITDA of these assets is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of EQM’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess the impact of the potential sale of the retained midstream assets from EQT Corporation (EQT) to EQM through one or more drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations.\nEQM believes that the projected EBITDA of the retained midstream assets provides useful information to investors in assessing the impact of the potential drop-down transactions on EQM’s future results of operations. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income. Additionally, because EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in EQM’s industry, the definition of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measure.\nEQM has not provided projected net income from the retained midstream assets, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or a reconciliation of projected EBITDA to projected net income of the assets. The retained midstream assets are operated as part of EQT’s Production business segment, and EQT does not allocate certain costs, such as interest and tax expenses, to individual assets within its business segments. Therefore, the projected net income of the retained midstream assets and a reconciliation of projected EBITDA of the assets to projected net income from those assets are not available without unreasonable effort.\nReconciliation of EQM Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended\n(Thousands)\nMarch 31, 2018\nNet income $ 177,218 Add: Net interest expense 10,833 Depreciation and amortization expense 23,179 Preferred Interest payments 2,746 Non-cash long-term compensation expense 331 Less: Equity income (8,811 ) AFUDC – equity (1,065 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 204,431 Less: Net interest expense excluding interest income on the Preferred Interest (12,500 ) Capitalized interest and AFUDC – debt (817 ) Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements (3,865 ) Distributable cash flow $ 187,249 Distributions declared (1) : Limited Partner $ 85,830 General Partner 46,491 Total $ 132,321 Coverage Ratio 1.42x Net cash provided by operating activities $ 182,402 Adjustments: Capitalized interest and AFUDC – debt (817 ) Principal payments received on the Preferred Interest 1,079 Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements (3,865 ) Other, including changes in working capital 8,450 Distributable cash flow $ 187,249 (1)\nReflects cash distribution of $1.065 per limited partner unit for the first quarter 2018 and 80,591,366 limited partner units outstanding as of March 31, 2018.
