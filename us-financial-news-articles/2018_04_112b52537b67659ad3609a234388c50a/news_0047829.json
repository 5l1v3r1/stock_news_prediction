No cause of death was given. \nThe church will have its bells play the song at noon from Monday to Friday this week, it said on its web page, adding “Rest in peace”. \nAvicii, also known for international hits like “Hey Brother” and “Waiting for love”, announced in 2016 that he was retiring from touring, but he kept making music and was nominated for a Billboard music award last week. \nThe family of the artist on Monday said they were grateful for the numerous public tributes paid, but offered no details on his unexpected death. \nSwedish prime minister Stefan Lofven called Avicii “one of Sweden’s biggest musical wonders of modern time” on Instagram. \nStockholm resident Jon Holmgren said Avicii had meant very much to him, as his son was the same age and in the same group of friends as the artist when he grew up. \n“He is a fantastic success story with a very tragic ending, unfortunately,” he said, standing outside Oscar’s Church.
