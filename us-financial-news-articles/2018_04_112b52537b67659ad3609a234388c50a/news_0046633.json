Net debt stood at $612 million at the end of last year.\n“We expect a positive market reaction to Petrofac’s announced asset disposal as it will help balance liquidity and reduce refinancing concerns around the October bond expiry,” Morgan Stanley analyst Robert Pulleyn wrote in a note.\nPulleyn said the deal reduces the amount they expect the company to refinance to about $250 million-$300 million, from about $400 million anticipated earlier.
