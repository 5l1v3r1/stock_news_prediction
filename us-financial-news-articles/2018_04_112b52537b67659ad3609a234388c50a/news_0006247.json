But in early January the company said it has received a non-binding proposal from a consortium that included affiliates of MBK Partners HK Ltd, the company’s CEO and his affiliates.\nThe consortium’s offer superseded that of Goliath’s, the China-based investment fund informed Ehi.\nThe current consortium, which is set to buy Ehi, consists of new investors, including certain affiliates of MBK Partners Fund IV LP, Baring Private Equity Asia Ltd and Redstone Capital Management (Cayman) Ltd.\nIt also included some existing shareholders of Ehi, including an affiliate of CEO Zhang.\nThe consortium will fund the deal through a combination of proceeds from a loan facility from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore and cash from some of the members of the consortium.\nEhi’s shares rose about 2 percent to $13.36 in morning trading.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T16:32:23.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
