REUTERS/Stephanie Keith \nThe bank, still smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, found inconsistencies at its auto lending and mortgage in the summer of 2017, leading to further probes by regulators. \nTo appease investors and regulators, the bank overhauled its operational structure, shook up its board and hired a new compliance officer.
