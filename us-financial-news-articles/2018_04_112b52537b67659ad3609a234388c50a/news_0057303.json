The question is under what circumstances would Iran be prepared to let this process happen. We are in close and constructive exchange within the EU-3 and the U.S.,” said the spokesman.\nReporting by Markus Wacket and Thomas Escritt; Writing by Madeline Chambers\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T19:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:59:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
