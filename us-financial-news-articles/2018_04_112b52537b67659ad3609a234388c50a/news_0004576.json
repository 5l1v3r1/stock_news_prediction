REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo \nThe final seasonally-adjusted Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the German manufacturing sector sank for the third month running, hitting 58.2, its lowest level since July 2017, and coming in below last week’s flash estimate of 58.4. \nPurchasing managers polled for the IHS Markit/BME survey reported that growing demand for input materials was increasing the prices of inputs, including of raw materials like steel, and placing suppliers under pressure to keep up. \n“In many respects, the problems are the result of their own success,” said Phil Smith, principal economist at IHS Markit. “German industry has been going upwards uninterruptedly for three and a half years ... That has placed suppliers under massive pressure.” \nExpansion remains strong, however — the manufacturing PMI has been slipping from the all-time high it hit in December. \n  below: here Reporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Catherine Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T10:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T11:23:37.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
