The Sunnyvale, California-based company neither admitted nor denied the allegations but did agree to refrain from further violations of securities laws.\nPersonal data was stolen from hundreds of millions of Yahoo users in the December 2014 breach attributed to Russian hackers. The SEC alleged that, although Yahoo senior managers and attorneys were told about the breach, the company failed to fully investigate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T00:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T06:56:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
