While there appears to be no significant technical damage done at this point, that kind of move is still quite notable for such a widely held stock.\nApple is essentially testing three support levels, as it tests its March closing lows (just above $165), its 200-day moving average ($165.73), and its trend line going back to mid-2016.\nTherefore, any further meaningful decline would be somewhat negative on a technical basis. On Tuesday, the stock fell beneath its 200-day moving average, closing just off its session lows.\nHowever, the more critical support level to watch is its February closing lows, at $155.15. A meaningful break below that level would definitely prove negative on a technical basis, but that's still another 5 percent below current levels.\nAs the market awaits the company's quarterly earnings next Tuesday after the bell, we'll be watching these levels for clues as to its next move.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
