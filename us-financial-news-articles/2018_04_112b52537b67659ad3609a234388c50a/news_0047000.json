He said then that a list of both reported and unreported cases of mistreatment of Filipino migrant workers would be prepared.\nForeign workers in many Gulf states are employed under a sponsorship system that gives employers the right to keep their passports and exercise full control over their stay.\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have long complained that Gulf states do not properly regulate working conditions for low-income domestic workers and labourers.\nThey say excessively long hours and insufficient flexibility to change contracts or return home contravene international labour laws and deprive workers of their human rights.\nReporting by Ahmed Hagagy, with additional reporting by Manuel Mogato in Manila; Writing by Aziz El Yaakoubi; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:30:36.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
