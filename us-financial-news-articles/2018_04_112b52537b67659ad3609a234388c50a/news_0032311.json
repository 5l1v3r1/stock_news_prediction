It said the sale price was 73 million euros ($90 million).\nCzech Media Invest said the assets - which include top radio stations like Evropa 2 and Frekvence 1 in the Czech Republic and Radio Zet in Poland - had consolidated revenue of 56 million euros in 2017 and would help it expand in radio.\nThe Czech media group is the publisher of the Czech Republic’s top-selling tabloid Blesk and three other daily papers, and several magazines.\nIt is 50 percent owned by Kretinsky, whose EPH energy group has become a major player in European power in recent years, buying plants in Germany, Italy and Britain from western utilities to bet that coal-fired sources will still play an important role despite the sector’s shift to renewables.\nInvestors Patrik Tkac and Roman Korbacka own the remaining shares of Czech Media Invest.\n$1 = 0.8073 euros Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Jason Hovet; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:21:38.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
