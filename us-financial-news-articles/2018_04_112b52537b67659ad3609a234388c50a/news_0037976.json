Miguel Cabrera homered on his 35th birthday and Jeimer Candelario also rapped a solo shot in the Tigers’ second straight win after five losses.\nShane Greene (1-0) blew a save opportunity in the top of the ninth, giving up a homer to Luis Sardinas, but wound up with the win.\nTigers starter Matthew Boyd allowed just one run on two hits with six strikeouts in 6 1/3 innings. Boyd became the first Tigers left-hander since at least 1908 to throw six or more innings and allow one or no runs in his first three starts of the season.\nManny Machado had two hits, a run scored and an RBI for Baltimore, while Danny Valencia added a solo homer.\nValencia put the Orioles on the board with his one-out homer in the second.\nCandelario evened the score with his homer to right to lead off the third.\nCabrera gave Detroit a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the sixth. Leading off, he jumped on a 1-1 slider and ripped a liner that just cleared the left-field wall.\nThe Orioles grabbed the lead in the eighth. Trey Mancini smacked a leadoff double and Craig Gentry followed with a bunt single. Machado’s single up the middle knocked in Mancini and Adam Jones’ sacrifice fly brought home Gentry. Chris Davis banged a single off the left-field wall, scoring Machado for a 4-2 advantage.\nDetroit regained the lead at 5-4 in the bottom of the inning on Hicks’ first homer. He jumped on the first pitch he saw from reliever Darren O’Day and drilled it over the left-field wall.\nPinch hitter Sardinas golfed a pitch over the right-field wall leading off the ninth to tie it.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:14:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
