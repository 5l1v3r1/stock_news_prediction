And new lending rules, which make it harder for some buyers to qualify for a mortgage, took effect on Jan. 1. \nThe group’s home price index, preferred by analysts because it smoothes out the composition of sales, was up 1.5 percent year-over-year, TREB said. $1 = 1.2782 Canadian dollars Reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T13:15:00.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
