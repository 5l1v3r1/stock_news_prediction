West Ham United vs Southampton - London   March 31, 2018 West Ham United's Joe Hart applauds fans after the match Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien \nThe London club go into next Monday’s home clash against Stoke City after a confidence-boosting 1-1 draw at Chelsea last weekend. \nMexican striker Javier Hernandez scored the equaliser at Stamford Bridge, after combining with fellow forward Marko Arnautovic, and Hart believes the pair can cause trouble for any opponent. \n\"We're definitely a really dangerous team,\" Hart told the club's website ( www.whufc.com ). \n“Chicha (Hernandez) is a top, top professional... he’s a goalscorer. Marko is in absolutely fantastic form after a difficult start to his West Ham career, but since then he’s been our standout player,” Hart added. \nWest Ham, who are 14th in the table with 34 points, have a potentially tough climax to the season with matches against Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United still to come, but Hart said getting a win against Stoke was the priority. \n“I feel like we have a huge, huge game next Monday,” he said. “It’s such an important match for us and for all the good that came out of (last) Sunday, we only got one point and we want three points. We’re really looking forward to Stoke.” \nHart is keen to maintain his own good form from last week and improve his chances of making England’s World Cup squad ahead of the finals in Russia this year. \nThe 30-year-old is England manager Gareth Southgate’s most experienced option but is in danger of losing his spot to Everton’s Jordan Pickford or Stoke’s Jack Butland. \n“I know who I am and what I am,” he said. “I have had medals around my neck for years and years and got England caps... I play for my team, my family and my friends and anyone else who wants to comment, that’s up to them and I don’t care.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T21:08:12.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
