Participants will discuss at an OPEC meeting in Vienna in June whether to extend the deal.\nU.S. President Donald Trump accused OPEC on Friday of “artificially” boosting oil prices.\n“Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High!
