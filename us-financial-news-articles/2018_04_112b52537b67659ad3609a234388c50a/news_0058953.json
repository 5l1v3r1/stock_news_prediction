In contrast, the region’s southern coast is peppered with Red Sea tourist resorts.\nThe project includes plans for a comprehensive network of roads, residential and industrial developments, four water desalination plants, hospitals and sewage networks, Mehleb said.\n“The Sinai development project is a project for national security,” he said.\nFinancing sources for the initiative remain unclear.\nEgyptian security forces launched a large-scale security operation in February to crush jihadists who have waged an insurgency that has killed hundreds of soldiers, police and residents over many years.\nSecurity forces have battled Islamist militants in the mainly desert region, stretching from the Suez Canal eastwards to the Gaza Strip and Israel, since 2013.\nReporting by Ali Abdelaty; Writing by Nadine Awadalla; Editing by Helen Popper\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T23:08:49.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
