An ad hoc committee created on April 17, 2018 and comprising two independent Board members will be responsible for monitoring the independent expert’s mission. The independent expert’s report will be included in Groupe aufeminin’s offer document in response that will be submitted to the AMF for approval (visa).\nAt this Board Meeting, four Board members were appointed to replace those associated with Axel Springer: Mr. Gilles Pélisson, Groupe TF1’s Chairman and CEO, Mr. Philippe Denery, its Executive VP, Finance & Procurement, Mr. Olivier Abecassis, its VP, Innovation & Digital, and Mrs. Christine Bellin, its VP, Strategy, Development & Transformation.\nMrs. Marie Pic-Pâris Allavena will continue to be an independent Board member of Groupe aufeminin, as will Mrs. Karen Heumann.\nMr. Olivier Abecassis has been appointed CEO, thus replacing Mrs. Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon, who is leaving the Group in conjunction with Axel Springer’s exit from the shareholder structure and is standing down from her position on Groupe aufeminin’s Board of Directors.\nThe Board would like to thank Mrs. Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon for the work she has accomplished during the eight years of her mandate, which has enabled Groupe aufeminin to develop an original revenue-diversification model based on its communities, and notably aufeminin, My Little Paris, Marmiton and Livingly Media and, more generally, to have, with its teams, quadrupled the Group’s consolidated revenues and EBITDA since her arrival. It now brings together numerous communities around the world (France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, United States and Japan) on its platforms and social networks.\nDr. Andreas Wiele, President Classifieds and Marketing Media, at Axel Springer SE, said: “With Marie-Laure Sauty de Chalon and her teams, aufeminin has become one of the greatest success stories of the French and European digital universe. Through its strong brands, aufeminin has positively changed the lives of millions of women around the world. The Group has thus quadrupled its audience, its revenue and its profits. I would like to wholeheartedly thank Marie-Laure, management and each and every team member for this tremendous work.”\nAbout aufeminin\nWith media brands such as aufeminin, Marmiton, My Little Paris, Merci Alfred, Onmeda, Zimbio.com , Livingly.com and Stylebistro.com , the Group is present in more than 20 countries in Europe, North Africa, North America and Latin America.\nThe Groupe’s presence is gaining momentum on all platforms such as mobile, videos and social networks and strengthens its diversification strategy through ecommerce, programmatic and brand publishing pillars.\nMy Little box : https://www.mylittlebox.fr/\nGambettes box : https://www.gambettesbox.fr/\nLoom: https://www.loom.fr/\nEdie & Watson : https://www.edie-et-watson.com/\nGretel box : https://www.gretel-box.com/\nBeautiful Box by aufeminin : https://www.beautiful-box.com/\nThe Groupe aufeminin is listed on compartment B of Euronext Paris (ISIN: FR0004042083, Ticker: FEM).
