REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \nThe industrial action at France’s flag carrier - marking the fifth day of worker stoppages over the past month and a half - has began to overlap with nationwide rolling train strikes, as rail unions protest against President Emmanuel Macron’s reforms. \nAir France had forecast that some 70 percent of flights would operate on Saturday. \nUnions representing airline staff, locked in a dispute with Air France management over their request for a six percent pay rise, last week called four more strike days in April, in addition to stoppages planned for April 10 and 11.

It’s totally ridiculous.” \nTrain strikes due to start at 1900CET (17GMT) and lasting through to the early hours of Tuesday spelled more chaos for commuters and travellers at the beginning of some mid-term school holidays in France. \nThe rolling strikes, called in protest at Macron’s bid to modernise the state-run rail company SNCF, through a reform that would end job-for-life guarantees for workers, are set to last until June. \nOn Sunday, some 35 percent of the workers needed for the network to run smoothly were expected to be absent, SNCF officials said on Saturday. That compares to a 48 percent absentee rate during strikes last Tuesday and Wednesday. \nOne in five high-speed TGV trains were set to run on Sunday, while three out of four international Eurostar and Thalys routes would be operational, the SNCF said.
