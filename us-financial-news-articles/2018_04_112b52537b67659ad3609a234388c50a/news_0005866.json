REUTERS/Chris Helgren \nThe tax department had frozen the company’s bank accounts last month for allegedly evading a dividend distribution tax of more than 25 billion rupees ($385 million) following a share buyback, according to reports in the Indian media. \nThe court asked the company to deposit 15 percent of the disputed tax, amounting to 4.9 billion rupees ($75 million) as security deposit till it decides on the case. \nThe company said the court further granted its request to address the tax department’s collection actions and scheduled a hearing later in April 2018. \nCognizant shares were up nearly 1 percent in later afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.
