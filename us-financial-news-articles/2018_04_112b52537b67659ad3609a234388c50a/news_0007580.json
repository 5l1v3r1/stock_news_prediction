Against the Swiss franc, it has fallen 1.4 percent so far in 2018. The yen and franc tend to appreciate during geopolitical and economic tension.\nThe dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 90.32 as risk appetite improved and Wall Street’s main indexes advanced, helping the U.S. currency stabilise after recent declines.\nThe euro fell 0.2 versus the dollar to $1.2232.\nThe dollar was 0.3 percent higher at 107.07 yen, having pulled higher from a low of 105.99 set the previous day.\n“It’s too early to say whether the markets have moved beyond trade conflict woes. The situation is still very fluid, and currencies, like dollar/yen, will remain hostage to each turn in equities,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo.
