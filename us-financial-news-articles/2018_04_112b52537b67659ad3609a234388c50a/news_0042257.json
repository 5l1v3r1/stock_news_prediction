The women who have come forward to tell their stories have ousted powerful executives such as Harvey Weinstein, Steve Wynn, and Michael Ferro (see Fortune ‘s feature on Ferro’s departure from Tronc ). The ensuing reckoning is forcing leaders in every industry, not just ­media and entertainment, to change their way of thinking. \nThis article is part of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders feature, our annual list of world-changing leaders in business, government, philanthropy and beyond.
