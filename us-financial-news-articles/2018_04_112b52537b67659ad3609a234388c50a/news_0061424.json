As she hosted the dinner, the streaming service rolled out the trailer for the show.\nIf she killed at the dinner, presumably the interest in her would lead to people tracking the show. Even if her performance wasn’t as strong as other comics, there would be increased interest in her. But no one could have anticipated the truly divisive reaction to her job as host.\nThat could either make the show a bigger hit that expected or tank its chances. It could be an interesting examination of the service’s political demographics.\nThe Break is described as a light-hearted comedy/variety series, though one that goes a bit further than basic cable rules will allow. Rather than airing in one block, the show will air new episodes each Sunday.\nThat discourages binge watching , but as Netflix has learned with David Letterman’s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction , fans are willing to view the streaming service as a source of appointment viewing as well.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/OP5UiXEbgJk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent"], "published": "2018-04-30T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T18:44:30.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
