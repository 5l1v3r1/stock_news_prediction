However, revenue from fixed income trading missed analysts' estimates. \nHere's what the bank reported compared to what analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting:— Revenues $10.04 billion versus expectations of $8.74 billion. — Earnings per share of $6.95 versus expectations of $5.58. \nGoldman Sachs raised its quarterly dividend to 80 cents per common share. \nShares of Goldman initially spiked more than 1 percent in premarket trading before paring gains. \nThe bank reported fixed income trading revenues of $2.07 billion, which was below the $2.13 billion consensus analyst estimate from Street Account. \n\"Solid performance across our businesses produced strong returns in the first quarter,\" Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. \"We are well positioned to serve our clients as the global economy continues to show strength and central banks unwind certain aspects of policy stimulus.\" \nLast quarter, Goldman reported earnings that topped Wall Street estimates but the bank posted a net loss when factoring in a tax hit, largely because of a one-time charge for bringing overseas profits back to the U.S. The investment banking titan also beat on revenue in the fourth quarter. \nDavid Solomon is next in line to succeed Blankfein after the firm announced Harvey Schwartz, who shares the titles of co-president and co-chief operating officer, is leaving the bank April 20. A report from The Wall Street Journal that Blankfein was likely to step down as soon as this year had accelerated discussions about who would take over. \nBlankfein has not said exactly when he will step down, and there has been speculation that he could hold off until 2019, and stay on as chairman even after departing as CEO. \nGoldman is looking to transition out of its core trading business into more profitable lines. Its investment banking arm, for example, notched $2.14 billion in net revenues last quarter and $7.37 billion for the year, its second best ever. Mergers and acquisitions continue to be a mainstay for the firm. \nGoldman follows other major U.S. banks' reporting earnings this week. Bank of America reported better-than-expected results on Monday, while J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup all beat analysts' earnings per share expectations on Friday. \nRising interest rates, increased market volatility that could also boost banks' trading activity, strong merger and acquisition activity, and easing regulatory restrictions could all be boons to banking industry, which has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date.
