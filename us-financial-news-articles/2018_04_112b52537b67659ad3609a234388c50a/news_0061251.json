As we know, these stocks are very volatile. And, you think they’ll never have a bad day. But when they have a bad day, it could be significant, and you can get all kinds of opportunities.”\nHis outlook applies to the marquee FANG stocks, which include Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google [Alphabet]. Meeks owns all of them in his portfolio — with the exception of Netflix, a stock he wished he bought before it went on a tear.\n“Within FANGs, I actually do like Facebook and Google because they’ve had their corrections — and corrections even beyond 10 percent. So, what I did recently is I try to buy them on bad news,” he said.\nOn March 9, Meeks told “Trading Nation” a correction in tech space could happen at any time. Since his last appearance, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped into correction territory, but year-to-date the index is now up 3 percent.\n“I would wait until the next controversy. Even though Facebook has posted a great quarter, maybe Google less so, but still pretty robust,” Meeks said. “They will have a bad day. They will be down a lot, and you’ll have a great opportunity yet again.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T18:19:39.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
