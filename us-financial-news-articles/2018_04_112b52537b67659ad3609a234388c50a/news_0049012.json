(“IRT”) (NYSE: IRT), a multifamily apartment REIT, today announced its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nCompleted the acquisition of the last two properties in the nine-community portfolio acquisition announced in September 2017. Completed the acquisition of two communities in Columbus, OH that align with IRT’s investment strategy. Commenced first phase of the value add initiative in all five identified communities and on target to deliver projected returns by late 2018 and early 2019. Net income allocable to common shares of $3.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $4.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Core Funds from Operations (“CFFO”) of $15.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $13.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. CFFO per share was $0.18 for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $23.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $19.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSame-Store Property Operating Results\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to First Quarter 2017 (1) Rental income 1.7% increase Total revenues 2.0% increase Property level operating expenses 2.1% increase Net operating income (“NOI”) 2.0% increase Portfolio average occupancy 50 bps increase to 94.4% Portfolio average rental rate 1.5% increase to $1,020 NOI Margin 10 bps decrease to 59.7% (1) Same store portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes 42 properties, which represent 11,677 units.\n“IRT’s first quarter performance demonstrates our continued ability to generate organic operating returns while simultaneously bolstering our presence in core markets,” said Scott Schaeffer, IRT’s Chairman and CEO. “Healthy fundamentals across our key markets, combined with a proactive approach to asset management, has supported continued accretion of same-store fundamentals. Further, our recent acquisitions fit perfectly with our investment thesis to own and operate in non-gateway markets with supply and demand imbalances, while enhancing scale. Looking ahead, we remain on track to achieve our 2018 guidance objectives. We believe our value add initiatives and focused strategy will unlock substantial value and position IRT for success over the long term.”\nProperty Acquisitions\nOn January 3, 2018, IRT completed the acquisition of two communities representing the completion of the nine-property portfolio acquisition initially announced in September 2017. In whole, the nine-community portfolio totaled 2,352 units and was acquired for a gross purchase price of $228.1 million. IRT assumed $58.5 million of property level debt in association with three of the acquired assets.\nOn January 4, 2018, IRT completed the acquisition of a 312-unit community located in Columbus, OH for approximately $36.8 million. As of March 31, 2018, the community was 93.0% occupied with average rent of $1,079.\nOn February 27, 2018, IRT completed the acquisition of a 235-unit community located in Columbus, OH for approximately $23.0 million. As of March 31, 2018, the community was 99.2% occupied with average rent of $881.\nCapital Expenditures\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, recurring capital expenditures for the total portfolio were $1.2 million, or $80 per unit.\n2018 EPS and CFFO Guidance\nIRT is reiterating its 2018 full year guidance. EPS per diluted share is projected to be in a range of $0.26 to $0.31. CFFO per diluted share is projected to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.79.

Definitions Average Effective Monthly Rent per Unit\nAverage effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, divided by the average occupancy (in units) for the period presented. We believe average effective rent is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing. This metric, when presented, reflects the average effective rent per month.\nAverage Occupancy\nAverage occupancy represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense including amortization of deferred financing costs, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before certain other non-cash or non-operating gains or losses related to items such as acquisition and integration expenses, asset sales, debt extinguishments and acquisition related debt extinguishment expenses. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are each non-GAAP measures. We consider each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it eliminates interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other non-cash or non-operating gains and losses, which permits investors to view income from operations without these non-cash or non-operating items. IRT’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA differs from the methodology used for calculating Adjusted EBITDA by certain other REITs and, accordingly, IRT’s Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA reported by other REITs.\nFunds From Operations (“FFO”) and Core Funds From Operations (“CFFO”)\nIRT believes that FFO and CFFO, each of which is a non-GAAP measure, are additional appropriate measures of the operating performance of a REIT and IRT in particular. IRT computes FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses on sales of real estate and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.\nCFFO is a computation made by analysts and investors to measure a real estate company’s operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect ongoing property operations, including stock compensation expense, depreciation and amortization of other items not included in FFO, amortization of deferred financing costs, acquisition and integration expenses, and other non-cash or non-operating gains or losses related to items such as defeasance costs we incur when we sell a property subject to secured debt, asset sales, debt extinguishments, and acquisition related debt extinguishment expenses from the determination of FFO.\nIRT’s calculation of CFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating CFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, IRT’s CFFO may not be comparable to CFFO reported by other REITs. IRT’s management utilizes FFO and CFFO as measures of IRT’s operating performance, and believes they are also useful to investors, because they facilitate an understanding of IRT’s operating performance after adjustment for certain non-cash or non-operating items that are required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately compare IRT’s operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, CFFO and other supplemental performance measures are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, IRT believes that FFO and CFFO may provide IRT and our investors with an additional useful measure to compare IRT’s financial performance to certain other REITs. Neither FFO nor CFFO is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and CFFO do not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor CFFO should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of IRT’s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of IRT’s liquidity.\nInterest Coverage\nInterest coverage is a ratio computed by dividing our Adjusted EBITDA by our interest expense.\nNet Debt\nNet debt, a non-GAAP measure, equals total debt less cash and cash equivalents. The following table provides a reconciliation of total debt to net debt (Dollars in thousands).\nAs of March 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017\nJune 30, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nTotal debt $ 903,286 $ 778,442 $ 731,625 $ 764,521 $ 765,695 Less: cash and cash equivalents (10,399 ) (9,985 ) (10,128 ) (6,271 ) (10,065 ) Total net debt $ 892,887 $ 768,457 $ 721,497 $ 758,250 $ 755,630 IRT presents net debt because management believes it is a useful measure of IRT’s credit position and progress toward reducing leverage. The calculation is limited in that IRT may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar for dollar basis.\nNet Operating Income\nIRT believes that Net Operating Income (“NOI”), a non-GAAP measure, is a useful measure of its operating performance. IRT defines NOI as total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding interest expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition expenses, property management expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. We believe that this measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate our performance on a same store and non-same store basis because NOI measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses, financing expenses, and other items not related to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. However, NOI should only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance.\nSame Store Properties and Same Store Portfolio\nIRT reviews its same store portfolio at the beginning of each calendar year. Properties are added into the same store portfolio if they were owned at the beginning of the previous year.
