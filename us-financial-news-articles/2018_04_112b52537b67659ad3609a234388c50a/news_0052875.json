Still, the S&P 500 was on track for a modest weekly decline.\n“The lack of follow-through is pretty telling, ... (showing) that volatility is not over,” said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.\n“It’s been a great earnings season but the larger issues are out there; the big elephant in the room is the Fed, especially if we see some inflation numbers next week.”\nThe Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold a two-day meeting next week, with an announcement on U.S. monetary policy expected on May 2. Traders currently see only a 6.9 percent chance of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 24,315.91, the S&P 500 gained 3.12 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,670.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.85 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,116.83.\nEuropean shares closed Friday’s session with a slight advance, lifted by results from Spanish banks and a bounce in technology shares to secure their fifth straight weekly climb.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.24 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.25 percent.\nYields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury debt fell for a second straight day after hitting a four-year high this week.\nTen-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.9624 percent, from 2.99 percent late on Thursday.\nBut the margin between U.S. shorter-dated Treasury yields and longer-dated ones shrank as a smaller-than-expected decline in U.S. economic growth in the first quarter renewed bets the Fed, the U.S. central bank, would stick to its rate-hike campaign to keep inflation in check.\nGrowth in the U.S. economy slowed in the first quarter to a 2.3 percent annual rate as consumer spending grew at its weakest pace in nearly five years, but the setback is likely temporary.\nThe dollar held steady after the data, putting it on track for its strongest week since November 2016. The solid week has lifted the currency to its highest since Jan. 11.\nThe dollar index rose 0.13 percent, with the euro up 0.02 percent to $1.2104.\nSterling slumped to its lowest since March 1 against the dollar. Data showed Britain’s economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first quarter of 2018, slashing market expectations of a Bank of England rate hike in May.\nSterling was last trading at $1.3773, down 1.01 percent on the day.\nThe South Korean won strengthened after the leaders of North and South Korea embraced on Friday and pledged to work for the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.” Last year North Korea launched intercontinental ballistic missiles on July 4 and 28 and Nov. 29.\n“There’s a long way to go and we’ve seen it coming for a while so it’s not that much new news there,” said Ghriskey.\nThe won strengthened 0.92 percent versus the greenback at 1,068.69 per dollar.\nReporting by Chuck Mikolajczak Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:24:38.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
