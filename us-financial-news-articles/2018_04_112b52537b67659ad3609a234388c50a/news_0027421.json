The right-hander struck out six and didn’t issue a walk as Boston improved its record to 10-2.\nAndrew Benintendi, Mitch Moreland and Eduardo Nunez had two hits apiece for the Red Sox, who prevailed on a night that featured heavy rain through the first five innings.\nMoreland entered after Boston first baseman Hanley Ramirez departed in the first inning when he suffered a bruised right wrist after being hit by a pitch from Yankees starter Sonny Gray. The Red Sox said X-rays were negative.\nGray (1-1) allowed six runs and seven hits in three-plus innings. He struck out three, walked two and tossed three wild pitches in addition to hitting Ramirez.\nPorcello tossed six no-hit innings before Aaron Judge slammed a double that one-hopped the wall in center to open the seventh. Giancarlo Stanton followed with an infield single before Porcello worked out of the jam.\nPorcello induced Didi Gregorius to fly to right and finished his outing by striking out Gary Sanchez and Aaron Hicks.\nSanchez ripped a three-run double to right-center in the ninth for New York’s runs. Boston closer Craig Kimbrel entered to get the final three outs for his fourth save.\nThe game was delayed by rain for 45 minutes after the fifth inning.\nPorcello threw 60 pitches and retired 15 of the 16 batters he faced prior to the rain delay. The only baserunner occurred in the fourth inning when Porcello hit Stanton with a pitch on the left elbow.\nThe Red Sox scored four runs in the second inning off Gray, with Sandy Leon driving home the first run with a single to right. Betts plated the second on a sacrifice fly, Benintendi’s fielder’s choice made it 3-0 and Moreland capped the uprising with an RBI single to left.\nNunez led off the third with a double high off the Green Monster in left, and he scored when Stanton misplayed a high pop hit to left by Jackie Bradley Jr. Stanton headed past the foul line and overran the ball and it landed in fair territory and bounced into the stands for a ground-rule double.\nBradley scored later in the inning on Betts’ fielder’s choice to make it a six-run margin.\nThere was no repeat of Wednesday’s melee that led to Red Sox right-hander Joe Kelly being suspended six games by Major League Baseball and Yankees first baseman Tyler Austin drawing a five-game ban. Both players are appealing the punishment.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T11:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:36:23.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
