REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhi/File photo Tesla will supply the 212 kilowatt (KW)/840 kilowatt hour battery at BP’s Titan 1 windfarm in South Dakota in the second half of this year. It operates 12 other windfarms in the United States.\nProviding large-scale battery power to windfarms allows them to store energy when wind is ample and make electricity available when demand is high, offering a crucial commercial advantage to an otherwise volatile energy source.\n“Lessons from the project will enable BP to make better informed decisions when evaluating and developing battery applications in the future,” BP said in a statement.\n“The project also supports BP’s broader strategy to invest half a billion dollars annually into low-carbon technologies, including projects within its established renewables portfolio as well as in new low-carbon businesses.”\nThe company logo is seen in front of a showroom of U.S. car manufacturer Tesla in Zurich, Switzerland March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Several oil firms have already invested in battery technology. Norway’s Statoil plans to use a battery system, called Batwind, with its Hywind floating wind farm off the coast of Scotland.\nVitol-owned VPI Immingham has developed a 50 megawatt, grid-connected battery portfolio in Britain.\nBP estimates renewables could account for around 10 percent of global energy demand by 2035, up from 4 percent currently.\n(This version of the story refiles to correct megawatt to kilowatt in paragraph 2.)\nReporting by Shadia Nasralla and Justin Varghese; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:00:09.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
