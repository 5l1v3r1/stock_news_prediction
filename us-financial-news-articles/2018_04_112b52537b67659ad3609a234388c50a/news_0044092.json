Questions include why the bank’s internal security controls didn’t work and why there weren’t two sets of eyes for the transaction. \nThe ECB also wants to know how Deutsche plans to prevent such an incident from happening again, the newspaper said. \nThe ECB declined to comment. $1 = 0.8137 euros Reporting by Tom Sims and Andreas Framke; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T21:23:32.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
