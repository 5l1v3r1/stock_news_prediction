Related Coverage Poland says will respect EU top court ruling on logging in ancient forest \nBack in 2016, Poland had tripled logging quotas and said spruce and pine trees that were more than 100 years old had to be felled because of a beetle infestation. The ECJ said that was not justified. \nWhile the case has since lost some of its political prominence amid the broader thaw between Warsaw and the bloc, environmental groups say damage has already been done to the delicate primeval habitat. \n“The decisions that allowed logging must be withdrawn. Then, the Polish government should also consider enlarging the national park,” said James Thornton, head of the environmental campaign group ClientEarth. \n“This is the only way to guarantee that devastation of the forest will not happen again.” Additional reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko in Warsaw, Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Kevin Liffey", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:44:50.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
