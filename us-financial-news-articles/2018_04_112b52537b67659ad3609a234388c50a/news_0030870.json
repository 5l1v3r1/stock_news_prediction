He now has four goals this postseason after he scored once in Boston’s Game 1 victory.\nDavid Krejci (2nd playoff goal), Jake DeBrusk (1), Kevan Miller (1) and Rick Nash (1) also scored goals and Tuukka Rask made 30 saves for Boston, which has outscored Toronto 12-4 in the series.\nMitchell Marner (1), Tyler Bozak (1) and James van Riemsdyk (1) scored for Toronto. Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen allowed three goals on five shots before being replaced by backup Curtis McElhinney (19 saves) with 7:47 left in the opening period.\nGame 3 of the series is Monday in Toronto.\nAfter scoring four times in the final two periods of Game 1, the Bruins picked up where they left off with first-period goals from Pastrnak (at 5:26), DeBrusk (9:46), Miller (12:13) and Nash (15:00).\nToronto replied with second-period goals from Marner (1:22) and Bozak (9:02) sandwiched around a tally from Krejci (3:46).\nPastrnak’s second goal came at 12:34 of the third and made it 6-2.\nVan Riemsdyk scored a power-play goal with 5:07 left in the game, the first man-advantage tally in eight attempts for Toronto in the series.\nPastrnak completed his hat trick with 1:36 remaining in the final period.\nToronto’s Nazem Kadri served the first game of his three-game suspension for a hit on Boston’s Tommy Wingels in Game 1. Wingels (undisclosed injury) skated Saturday morning but did not play. Riley Nash (facial laceration) also missed the game for the Bruins.\nRyan Donato made his NHL postseason debut in place of Wingels. Donato’s father, Ted, also played for the Bruins, making them the second father-son duo to make postseason appearances for Boston.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:23:33.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
