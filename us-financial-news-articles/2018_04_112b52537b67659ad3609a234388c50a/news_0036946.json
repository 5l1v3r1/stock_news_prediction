The move follows airline industry concerns over near-collisions between unmanned aircraft and commercial jets as drone usage soars. \n“We’re proposing (with) ICAO to have it together,” Meyer said on the sidelines of the IATA Safety and Flight Ops Conference in Montreal. \n“It(creating a registry) is going to be very difficult but it’s feasible.” (Reporting by Allison Lampert Editing by Paul Simao)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T19:49:40.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
