A Trump appointee and a longtime critic of the financial regulator he now heads, Mr. Mulvaney is pushing the CFPB in a different direction than his Democratic predecessor.\n“I hope we can all agree that the improper leaking of confidential information is wholly unacceptable under the bureau’s rules,” Mr. Mulvaney wrote in the April 12 memo, viewed by The Wall Street Journal.\nThe memo reflects simmering tension between Mr. Mulvaney, a Republican, and some employees of the agency, created after the financial crisis by Democrats.\nMr. Mulvaney was referring to a Reuters article regarding the status of investigations into Wells Fargo & Co. over alleged violations in auto insurance and mortgage lending.\nWells Fargo later disclosed that the CFPB and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency offered to resolve probes related to the bank’s risk management for $1 billion .\nMr. Mulvaney has declined to comment on the agency’s continuing investigations, but said many of the leaks have been false. “I can tell you there has been a track record of them being wrong. We think intentionally so,” he said last week.\nSince taking the helm of the CFPB in November, Mr. Mulvaney, a former GOP lawmaker from South Carolina with pro-business, small-government views, has implemented significant changes to CFPB policies , drawing praise from industry officials while alarming Democrats and consumer advocates. In particular, critics have focused on the CFPB’s pullback from enforcement actions.\n“I think the leakers could be patriots. They want the bureau to do a better job and they are frustrated that it has been taken over by someone who opposes the very idea of the bureau,” said Ed Mierzwinski, a senior director at U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group.\nWrite to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-fine-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-watchdog-seeks-record-fine-against-wells-fargo-for-abuses-sources-idUSKBN1HG2PO"], "published": "2018-04-19T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:56:59.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
