Been a Prime member since 2006, & an excellent customer. I have a GC credit on my account & thousands of books that I'm terrified that I'm going to lose access to. Movies, too. \nHas this happened to anyone else??\n— Jessica Libby (@JessicaLLibby) March 30, 2018 \nDay 5 of @amazon not giving an explanation why after being a loyal shopper since 2006 they just canceled my account with no notice whatsoever right after they charge me $101 for #amazonprime . That makes total sense. What happened to my response back in 2-3 days? #amazonfail \n— Amber Hale, Health Coach (@ExSoyCise) April 4, 2018 \nI did just talk on chat. My account was canceled but they can't tell me how i violated anything. I've used discount codes provided by sellers. That's it. Very sad @Amazon will charge me, then close my account 2 days later????

Others have claimed that they have no recollection of violating any of Amazon's policies. \n\"Amazon has taken action against bad actors and those who have violated our community rules, an Amazon spokesperson tells Fortune . “If any customers believe their account has been closed in error, we encourage them to contact us directly so we can review their account and take appropriate action.\"", "external_links": ["https://t.co/yq3hOqDcYu", "https://twitter.com/JessicaLLibby/status/979800330941714432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-closes-users-accounts-customers-fight-back-2018-4", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazonfail?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/markle_darla/status/980279638021758979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/ExSoyCise/status/981569523236163584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazonprime?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://twitter.com/amazon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-04-06T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T06:45:38.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
