The new company, to be known as Omni Management Group , will provide enhanced services to restructuring professionals with personal and professional consulting services, new information management tools to ease case administration, and refined networking and research resources to help uncover new business opportunities.\nBeilinson Advisory Group will provide strategic support and resources to Omni’s existing management. Marc Beilinson will remain as chairman of the parent company. He is known for serving in high-profile bankruptcy cases as a chief restructuring officer (CRO), independent director and former partner at Pachulski, Stang, Ziehl & Jones LLP.

Joining Osborne as senior vice president will be Paul H. Deutch, a former bankruptcy attorney who opened Omni’s New York office in 2009.\n“Having been involved in all facets of the bankruptcy space for 35 years, I have always wanted to improve the claims and case management process,” Beilinson stated. “I’ve known Brian for 25 years, and this transaction presented the right opportunity to join forces and make smart investments in systems, people and processes, and to create a product that is unsurpassed and easily utilized by bankruptcy professionals.” He continued: “We’re not a marketing organization. Our focus is on reinvesting in the company and delivering exceptional value with the highest level of service.”\n“Over the years, I have witnessed the growth of the claims management business,” Osborne stated. “We have always operated differently than our corporate-style competitors because we focus on providing the most efficient and cost-effective service possible.
