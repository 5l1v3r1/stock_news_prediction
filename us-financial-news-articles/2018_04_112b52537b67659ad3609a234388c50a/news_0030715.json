In 2017, it derived 59 percent of revenue from its network business and 32 percent from its consumer business.\n“If the company is not able to resolve it, they may very well be put out of business by this. Many banks and companies even outside the U.S. are not going to want to deal with them,” said Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce who was heavily involved in the case.\nThe Chinese company paid $890 million in fines and penalties after it pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\nAs part of the agreement, Shenzhen-based ZTE promised to dismiss four senior employees and discipline 35 others by either reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them, senior U.S. officials told Reuters.\nBut the Chinese company admitted in March that while it had fired the four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to the 35 others.\nFLASHPOINT SECTOR Saying ZTE was likely to miss shipments and lose orders, brokerage Jefferies downgraded its rating on the firm to ‘underperform’ from ‘buy’ and slashed its price target to HK$15.72, nearly 40 percent below the firm’s closing price prior to Tuesday’s trading halt.\nBut Jefferies also said it expected ZTE would be able to settle with U.S. authorities in three to five months.\nUnder terms of the ban, U.S. companies cannot export prohibited goods, such as chip sets, directly to ZTE or via another country, beginning immediately.\nAs U.S. concerns about safeguarding its chip technology and cutting its trade deficit grow, the tech sector has become a flashpoint in the broader battle about trade and economic policy, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Chinese firms of intellectual property theft for years.\nWashington has also deepened its scrutiny of Chinese investment in the U.S., with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocking many proposed acquisitions of U.S. assets by Chinese companies.\nPiling further pressure on ZTE, Britain’s main cyber security agency said on Monday it has written to organizations in the UK’s telecommunications sector warning about using services or equipment from ZTE.\nThe ban on supplying ZTE comes two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or Huawei, citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.\n“China does not play by our rules, and we must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security,” said Republican Representative Robert Pittenger after the Commerce announcement. Pittenger is sponsoring legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investments.\nShares of big U.S. ZTE suppliers got caught in the crossfire of the U.S. ban. Optical networking equipment maker Acacia Communications Inc, which gained 30 percent of its total 2017 revenue from ZTE, tumbled 35 percent, hitting a near two-year low. Acacia said it was suspending affected transactions and assessing the impact.\nShares of optical component companies including Lumentum Holdings Inc fell 8.9 percent and Finisar Corp dropped 4.0 percent. Oclaro Inc, which got 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, lost 14.1 percent.\nZTE has sold handset devices to U.S. mobile carriers AT&T Inc, T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp. It has relied on U.S. companies including Qualcomm Inc, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp for some components.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld in New York and Steve Stecklow in London and Sijia Jiang in Hong Kong; Additional reporting by Noel Randewich and Peter Henderson in San Francisco, Munsif Vengattil in Bangalore and Miyoung Kim in Singapore; Writing by Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Lisa Shumaker and Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T15:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:10:31.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
