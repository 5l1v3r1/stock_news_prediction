Or it might be Josh Rosen. Perhaps Josh Allen.\nThen on Thursday night the Cleveland Browns took Baker Mayfield. That made sense too.\nThe first round of this draft began with a historic spree on quarterbacks. After Mayfield went to the Browns, the New York Jets nabbed Darnold, the Buffalo Bills moved up for Allen and the Arizona Cardinals went for Rosen. It was the first time four quarterbacks had gone in the first 10 picks.\nBut this draft that highlighted the importance of quarterbacks more than any draft ever also revealed something ironic: amazingly little is known about the most important position in football.\nThe four quarterbacks could have gone in any order without any apocalyptic cries that any team did something completely blasphemous. Mayfield, just a couple months ago , seemed likeliest to go last out of this group. Darnold was long the favorite to go No. 1. At times, the rocket-armed Allen seemed like his best competitor . Rosen, to some, was the best pure passer in the draft. Then Rosen wound up being taken after the other three and falling to No. 10.\n“There were nine mistakes made ahead of me,” Rosen said. “I’ll make sure over the next decade or so that they’ll know they made the mistakes.”\nRosen could be right. And nobody would be shocked. That’s because as big as the differences were between these players in terms of style and pedigree, there was zero consensus on which one was best.\nJosh Rosen poses for photos with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell after being chosen by the Arizona Cardinals.

And the clearest way to begin to fathom just how difficult it is to project quarterbacks is by looking at the player they wound up taking.\nThey went with Mayfield, a player who was so far off the NFL radar he had to walk on at two different schools, including Oklahoma where he won last season’s Heisman Trophy. Even after he put up eye-popping statistics and win totals with the Sooners, there was a litany of questions—about his height, his demeanor, and the system he played in.\nIt starts to make sense how problematic scouting this position can be when you compare Mayfield with Allen. Two teams are betting on them to be their quarterbacks of the future. These players also effectively complete opposites with the one thing in common being a right arm that can launch footballs.\nAllen is 6 foot 5 with the build of the archetypal quarterback. He’s big, strong and quick. But he wasn’t particularly effective at Wyoming, where he struggled with his accuracy and put up middling numbers.\nMayfield is small for the position at a shade over 6 foot. He’s not cut from the mold of the classic quarterback prototype. But he tore defenses apart throughout college, including some of the best in the country.\nAnd still, these two quarterbacks with completely different resumes—one built off the physical, one based on the statistical—were in the same conversation. Which is another indicator of the uncertainty these teams face: There’s no single way to identify the best quarterbacks.\nDespite that, teams were starving for quarterbacks. The Jets had traded up to No. 3 before the draft to assure themselves of one of the top options and took Darnold from Southern California. The Bills moved to No. 7 to nab Allen, despite draft-day questions about racially insensitive tweets he sent while in high school, for which he apologized. Then the Cardinals moved up to No. 10 to get the player some thought should have been No. 1, UCLA’s Rosen.\nSam Darnold poses for photos with a Jets jersey.

Just ask the Browns and Jets—they have watched plenty of quarterbacks wind up disappointments over the years.\nBut they also made the moves knowing there’s nothing more critical for turning their franchises around than getting a potential long-term answer at the position. That’s also why some Giants fans were grabbing their torches, pitchforks and beer: They had the No. 2 pick. But they took running back Saquon Barkley instead of an heir apparent to Eli Manning, who has struggled and is 37 years old.\nJust how precarious is it projecting quarterbacks? Well, the best quarterback from this draft may prove to be none of Mayfield, Darnold, Allen or even Rosen.\nIn the last pick of the first round Thursday, the Baltimore Ravens traded up. They took a quarterback—putting at least five quarterbacks in the first round for just the third time ever. They made their move to get a Heisman-Trophy winner whose combination of passing skills and running ability hasn’t come along in years. That’s why it wouldn’t exactly stun anyone if Lamar Jackson were the steal of the entire draft.\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T05:00:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
