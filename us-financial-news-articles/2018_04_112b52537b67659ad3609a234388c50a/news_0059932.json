If you wish to serve as a lead plaintiff in this class action, you must petition the Court by June 25, 2018 .\nAbout the Lawsuit\nMacquarie and certain of its executives are charged with failing to disclose material information during the Class Period, violating federal securities laws.\nOn February 21, 2018, the Company disclosed negative Q4 results, including earnings per share well below analysts' estimates and a substantial dividend cut, attributing the dismal performance to declining demand in a specific fuel oil product, revealing for the first time the significance of that specific product to its business segment, despite prior statements touting the stability and strong performance of that segment.\nOn this news, the price of Macquarie's shares plummeted from $63.62 on February 21, 2018, to $37.41 on February 22, 2018.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
