I would also like to personally express my appreciation to him for graciously agreeing to step off the board to make room for our new board members. He has demonstrated a selfless commitment to the betterment of the Company. It has been a pleasure to work alongside him and I know he has more to contribute to the Company as an advisor.” Parry added, “I would also like to express my appreciation to Michael for continuing to demonstrate leadership for our company by offering to step off the board to make room for our new board members.”\nDIRTT and Iron Compass have entered into a customary settlement agreement and Iron Compass has withdrawn its previous meeting requisition.
