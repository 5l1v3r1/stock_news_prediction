Sharma Oli, making his first foreign visit to India after returning to power earlier this year.\nDuring his earlier tenure, Oli sealed deals with Beijing in 2016 to use Chinese roads and ports, seeking to reduce Nepal’s dependence on India for trade and transit.\nThe planned railway line from the border town of Raxaul to Kathmandu would be the mountainous nation’s most ambitious railway project. Nepal currently only has rail links on its southern plains.\n“As a first step...India would carry out preparatory survey work within one year,” a joint statement after the talks said, to finalise the details of the line.\nNepal's Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli inspects a guard of honour during his ceremonial reception at the forecourt of India's Rashtrapati Bhavan presidential palace in New Delhi, India, April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Altaf Hussain Nepali officials say they are already in talks with China over an extension of the Chinese railway network into Nepal from Tibet as part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative that Nepal joined last year.\nAnalysts said the latest Indian move was spurred by China’s expansive infrastructure projects in Nepal as both Asian giants jostle for influence.\nThe plan to develop inland waterways will give Nepali cargo additional access to sea and boost its trade, officials said.\n(This version of the story refiles to fix typo in the lead, changes to “been” from “by”).\nReporting by Gopal Sharma; Editing by Euan Rocha and Ros Russell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T17:22:05.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
