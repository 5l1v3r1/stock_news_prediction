More than 600,000 crossed the central Mediterranean to Italy in the past four years, the vast majority from Libya.\nSince last July there has been a sharp drop in crossings as Libyan authorities backed by Italy pressured local groups to stop smuggling and supported Libya’s coastguard to intercept those who do leave.\nEuropean powers have also pushed to reduce flows into Libya from the south and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) has flown back 25,000 migrants from Libya to their home countries since the start of last year.\nSome 5,330 migrants had crossed from Libya to Italy between Jan. 1 and April 20 this year, about 85 percent lower than during the same period in 2017, according to Italy’s interior ministry.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami in Tripoli, Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, and Aidan Lewis in Tunis, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T04:16:37.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
