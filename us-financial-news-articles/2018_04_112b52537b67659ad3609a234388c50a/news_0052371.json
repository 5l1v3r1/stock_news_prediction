The Trent 7000 is derived from the Trent 1000-TEN product which is used on some Dreamliners.\nWilhelm said Airbus was talking to Rolls to make sure it was focused on the A330neo project.\n“We send reminders...to the wide body engine guys (Rolls-Royce and rival engine-maker GE) to be on spot and that means in the case obviously of the A330 to be on spot for an entry to service in 2018,” he said.
