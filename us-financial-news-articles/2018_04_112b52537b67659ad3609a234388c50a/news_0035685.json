The dollar hovered at 107.01 yen, having spent all of Tuesday in a half-a-yen band.\nThe euro was stuck at $1.2370, after topping out at $1.2413 overnight, while the dollar index was a fraction lower at 89.495.\nIn commodity markets, gold was little changed at $1,346.32 an ounce.\nOil prices firmed with Brent crude futures up 17 cents to $71.75 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 33 cents to $66.85 a barrel.\nReporting by Wayne Cole Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T11:38:32.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
