The Intellectual Property consists of SheerWind's worldwide portfolio of wind-turbine Granted Patents and Patent Applications. The portfolio will be sold as one auction lot to the highest bidder, subject to Bankruptcy Court confirmation.\nThe substantial portfolio includes Granted Patents and Patent Applications from patent offices around the world including: USA, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Denmark, the European Patent Office and the World Patent Office.\nSheerWind Inc developed its patented INVELOX technology to increase wind speed to facilitate generation of clean energy in areas where there had previously been insufficient wind-speed to make traditional column-mounted wind turbines spin. The technology was designed to capture and funnel wind to increase the wind-speed and harvest energy from multiple turbines housed safely near the ground, while simultaneously reducing the danger to birds posed by the traditional column-mounted wind turbines.\nSheerWind Patent Portfolio Report SheerWind Patent Portfolio Spreadsheet\nRoss Dove, CEO of Heritage Global, \"This is a perfect example of a novel technology living on after a corporate shutdown and ideally being purchased by an entity capable of realizing the full inherent potential of this environmentally friendly wind-power generation technology.\"\nDoug Berman, Director of Heritage Global Patents & Trademarks, added, \"This is an exceptional opportunity for entrepreneurs to either add to their existing Alternative Power technologies or to jump-start their entry into Wind Energy with the benefit of bypassing the time and cost required for research and development as well as the costs of the patent process itself.\"\nFull SheerWind Auction Details\nAbout Heritage Global Inc. www.heritageglobalinc.com\nHeritage Global Inc.
