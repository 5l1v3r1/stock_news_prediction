It was anchored nearby until April 14, before loading the cargo from the terminal on April 15, the data showed.\nExxonMobil had said in early April that it had imported an LNG cargo to the project’s terminal in order ensure tanks at the PNG facilities remained cold.\nMeanwhile the 170,000-cubic metre capacity LNG tanker Papua is currently anchored near the Kumul Marine Terminal, while the 165,000-cubic metre capacity LNG tanker Bishu Maru is headed to Port Moresby, the Eikon data showed.\nReporting by Jessica Jaganathan Editing by Kenneth Maxwell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T06:24:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
