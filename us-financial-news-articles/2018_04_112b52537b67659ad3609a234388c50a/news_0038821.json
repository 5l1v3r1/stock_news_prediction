Rate expectations have come down in the euro zone and went up in the U.S. It’s not supportive for the euro’s strength.”\nThe euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.2387 after earlier hitting $1.24. The dollar slipped 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies to 89.576.\nDiverging interest rate views have driven the spread between U.S. and German 10-year government bond yields above 230 basis points, the highest since late December 2016.\nThe euro had weakened to a 14-year low the last time the yield spread was at the current width. But it has been relatively immune to the current yield spread widening. The spread has increased more than 30 basis points over the past three months, but the common currency has moved within a relatively narrow $1.2556-$1.2154 range.\nLIRA RALLY Turkey’s lira fell after rallying more than 2 percent against the dollar overnight after the country’s president Tayyip Erdogan called for elections to be held in June, more than a year earlier than planned.\nThe lira was supported as Erdogan’s call for early elections was seen as the government’s recognition for the need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.\nThe lira was last down 0.5 percent at 4.029 against the dollar, with the previous day’s surge moving it significantly away from a record low of 4.194 set last week.\nBattered by concerns over monetary policy and inflation, the lira is one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies so far this year.\nA rally in commodity prices, including large moves in oil and iron ore, helped the Australian dollar rise even after disappointing jobs data. The Aussie dollar was up 0.2 percent at $0.7799, having recovered from a low of $0.7765.\nThe Canadian dollar was another big mover, having slid 0.6 percent against the dollar after the Bank of Canada did not sound as hawkish as some had anticipated.\n“We maintain the same view held before this meeting; the BoC wants to raise rates in July and left the door wide open but we doubt that data will allow them to walk through it,” wrote strategists at Rabobank.\nThe loonie rose slightly to C$1.2614 per dollar.
