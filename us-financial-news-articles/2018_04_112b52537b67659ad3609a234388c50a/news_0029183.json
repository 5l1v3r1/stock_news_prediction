(NYSE: TXT) today reported first quarter 2018 income from continuing operations of $0.72 per share. This compares to $0.37 per share in the first quarter of 2017, or $0.46 per share of adjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release.\n“Increased revenues reflected growth at Industrial, Bell, and Textron Aviation, with lower revenues at Textron Systems, consistent with our expectations,” said Textron Chairman and CEO Scott C. Donnelly. “Operationally we achieved significant margin improvements at Textron Aviation and Textron Systems over this quarter last year and sustained margin strength at Bell, reflecting strong performance in these segments.”\nCash Flow\nNet cash used by operating activities of continuing operations of the manufacturing group for the first quarter totaled $53 million, compared to $165 million in last year’s first quarter. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions, a non-GAAP measure that is defined and reconciled to GAAP in an attachment to this release, reflected a use of cash of $158 million compared to $227 million during last year’s first quarter.\nIn the quarter, Textron returned $344 million to shareholders through share repurchases, compared to $186 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDivestiture\nToday, Textron announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to sell its Tools & Test business to Emerson, a global technology and engineering company, for approximately $810 million in cash.\nIncluded in the sale are all the Textron Tools & Test businesses and brands – Greenlee, Greenlee Communications, Greenlee Utility, HD Electric, Klauke, Sherman+Reilly, and Endura. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018. Proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to fund additional share repurchases to offset the earnings impact related to the sale.\nShare Repurchase Plan\nTextron’s Board of Directors has also authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of the company’s common stock which is sufficient for repurchases related to the Tools & Test divestiture as well as to continue the company’s practice of repurchasing shares to offset the impact of dilution from stock-based compensation and benefit plans, and for opportunistic capital management purposes. The new authorization replaces a previous one, approved in January 2017, which was nearing completion.\nOutlook\nTextron confirmed its 2018 earnings per share from continuing operations guidance of $2.95 to $3.15 and its expectation for cash flow from continuing operations of the manufacturing group before pension contributions of $700 to $800 million with planned pension contributions of about $55 million.\nThis guidance includes the expected impact of the Tools & Test divestiture on earnings per share and cash flow from continuing operations.\nDonnelly continued, “We are on track for a strong 2018 as we continue our focus on operational improvement and look to capitalize on improving end markets.”\nFirst Quarter Segment Results\nTextron Aviation\nRevenues at Textron Aviation of $1.0 billion were up 4%, primarily due to higher price and volume.\nTextron Aviation delivered 36 jets, up from 35 last year, and 29 commercial turboprops, up from 20 last year.\nSegment profit was $72 million in the first quarter, up from $36 million a year ago, due to favorable volume and mix, performance, and price.\nTextron Aviation backlog at the end of the first quarter was $1.6 billion.\nBell\nBell revenues were $752 million, up 8% on higher military volume, partially offset by lower commercial revenues due to mix of aircraft sold.\nBell delivered 46 commercial helicopters in the quarter, up from 27 last year.\nSegment profit of $87 million was up $4 million, primarily due to the higher volume.\nBell backlog at the end of the first quarter was $3.6 billion.\nTextron Systems\nRevenues at Textron Systems were $387 million, down from $416 million last year, largely on lower volume at Weapons & Sensors related to the discontinuance of SFW production in 2017.\nSegment profit was up $30 million despite the lower revenue, primarily reflecting improved performance at Marine and Land.\nTextron Systems’ backlog at the end of the first quarter was $1.4 billion.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial revenues increased $139 million largely related to favorable foreign exchange, the Arctic Cat acquisition, and higher volumes across each business line.\nSegment profit was down $12 million despite the increase in revenues from the first quarter of 2017, due to the timing of the Arctic Cat acquisition in the prior year.\nFinance\nFinance segment revenues decreased $2 million and segment profit increased $2 million.\nConference Call Information\nTextron will host its conference call today, April 18, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern) to discuss its results and outlook.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and our ongoing business performance, however, they should be used in conjunction with GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define similarly named measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in the entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. We utilize the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial measures included in this release: Adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share\nAdjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share both exclude Special charges, net of income taxes. We consider items recorded in this line item such as enterprise-wide restructuring and acquisition-related restructuring, integration and transaction costs, to be of a non-recurring nature that is not indicative of ongoing operations. Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions\nManufacturing cash flow before pension contributions adjusts net cash from operating activities of continuing operations (GAAP) for the following: • Deducts capital expenditures and includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment to arrive at the net capital investment required to support ongoing manufacturing operations;\n• Excludes dividends received from Textron Financial Corporation (TFC) and capital contributions to TFC provided under the Support Agreement and debt agreements as these cash flows are not representative of manufacturing operations;\n• Adds back pension contributions as we consider our pension obligations to be debt-like liabilities. Additionally, these contributions can fluctuate significantly from period to period and we believe that they are not representative of cash used by our manufacturing operations during the period.\nWhile we believe this measure provides a focus on cash generated from manufacturing operations, before pension contributions, and may be used as an additional relevant measure of liquidity, it does not necessarily provide the amount available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations that are not deducted from the measure.\nIncome from Continuing Operations and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation: Three Months Ended April 1, 2017\nDiluted EPS Income from continuing operations - GAAP $ 100 $ 0.37 Restructuring, net of taxes of $5 million 10 0.04 Arctic Cat restructuring and transaction costs, net of taxes of $7 million 15 0.05 Total Special charges, net of income taxes 25 0.09 Adjusted income from continuing operations - Non-GAAP $ 125 $ 0.46 Manufacturing Cash Flow Before Pension Contributions GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation and Outlook: Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 April 1, 2017 Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations - GAAP (a) $ (53 ) $ (165 ) Less: Capital Expenditures (77 ) (76 ) Dividends received from TFC (50 ) - Plus: Total pension contributions 13 14 Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment 9 - Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP (a) $ (158 ) $ (227 ) 2018 Outlook Net cash from operating activities of continuing operations - GAAP $1,211 - $ 1,311 Less: Capital Expenditures (525) Dividends received from TFC (50) Plus: Total pension contributions 55 Proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment 9 Manufacturing cash flow before pension contributions - Non-GAAP $700 - $ 800 (a) For the three months ended April 1, 2017, $22 million of net cash proceeds received from the settlement of corporate owned life insurance policies were reclassified from operating activities to investing activities as a result of the adoption of a new accounting standard at the beginning of 2018.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180418005334/en/\nTextron Inc.\nInvestor Contacts:\nEric Salander, 401-457-2288\nor\nJeffrey Trivella, 401-457-2288\nor\nMedia Contact:\nDavid Sylvestre, 401-457-2362\nSource: Textron", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180418005334/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.textron.com&esheet=51790532&newsitemid=20180418005334&lan=en-US&anchor=www.textron.com&index=3&md5=acf85415b18031713e05ffee11535d2c", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.textron.com&esheet=51790532&newsitemid=20180418005334&lan=en-US&anchor=www.textron.com&index=1&md5=782a4fd1da68819d057e73bbbf10d6f5", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.textron.com&esheet=51790532&newsitemid=20180418005334&lan=en-US&anchor=www.textron.com&index=2&md5=efb0d232b1ca89e0d856a37a8ff5066e"], "published": "2018-04-18T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:57:00.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
