(NYSE:OIS) reported a net loss for the first quarter 2018 of $3.5 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, which included pre-tax transaction-related charges of $2.6 million ($2.0 million after-tax, or $0.04 per diluted share) and $0.8 million pre-tax ($0.6 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) of severance charges. Excluding these first quarter 2018 charges, the net loss would have been $0.8 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. These results compare to a reported net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $17.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, which included pre-tax charges of $0.8 million ($0.6 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share) of severance and other downsizing charges.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company generated revenues of $253.6 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA (Note B) of $32.3 million (excluding $3.4 million of transaction-related and severance charges). These results compare to revenues of $151.5 million and Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA of $5.4 million reported in the first quarter of 2017 (excluding $0.8 million of severance and other downsizing charges).\nOil States’ President and Chief Executive Officer, Cindy B. Taylor, commented, \"We successfully executed two strategic acquisitions which closed during the first quarter, the largest being GEODynamics, now reported as our Downhole Technologies segment, and Falcon Flowback, a flowback and well testing services company that is reported within our Completion Services business. We issued $200 million of convertible senior notes, and amended and extended our credit agreement in connection with the funding of these acquisitions. The culmination of these events has dramatically enhanced Oil States' position as a technology-focused provider of premium services and consumable products for the oil and gas industry.\n\"Our improved results for the first quarter included strong partial-quarter contributions from both of our recent acquisitions. We also realized the benefit of higher completions activity across the U.S. shale plays in our legacy product and service lines as our customers focused on unconventional completions to increase their production. In addition, our Offshore/Manufactured Products segment results exceeded our previous guidance due to higher than expected sales of our short-cycle completion products and our standard connector products.\"\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n(See Segment Data Tables)\nWell Site Services\nWell Site Services generated revenues of $100.4 million and Segment EBITDA (Note A) of $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenues and Segment EBITDA of $60.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. The 67% revenue increase was due to a 46% year-over-year increase in the number of Completion Services jobs performed, coupled with a 17% year-over-year increase in revenue per Completion Services job. These increases were driven by significantly increased completion-related activity levels in the United States, a continuing trend of customers utilizing more proprietary equipment and service offerings, coupled with one month of revenue generated by Falcon Flowback Services, LLC (“Falcon”). We recorded a $1.8 million provision for a bad debt related to a customer bankruptcy, which negatively impacted Segment EBITDA and margins. Excluding the bad debt provision of $1.8 million, first quarter 2018 EBITDA margins would have been 15%. Improved utilization of the land drilling rigs, which averaged 31% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 25% in the first quarter of 2017, also positively impacted the segment’s results.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company acquired Falcon, a full service provider of flowback and well testing services for the separation and recovery of fluids, solid debris and proppant used during hydraulic fracturing operations. Falcon provides additional scale and diversity to the Company's Completion Services operations in key shale plays in the United States, with seven service locations and over 400 employees. The acquisition price was $84.2 million, net of cash acquired, which is subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments. The acquisition was funded by borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nDownhole Technologies (acquisition of GEODynamics, Inc. closed on January 12, 2018)\nIn the first quarter of 2018 (acquisition date through March 31, 2018), Downhole Technologies generated revenues of $45.8 million, Segment EBITDA of $11.9 million and a Segment EBITDA margin of 26%.\nOur Downhole Technologies segment is comprised of the GEODynamics business we acquired in January 2018. GEODynamics was founded in 2004 as a researcher, developer and manufacturer of consumable engineered products used in completion applications. This segment provides oil and gas perforation systems, downhole tools and services in support of completion, intervention, wireline and well abandonment operations.\nOffshore/Manufactured Products\nOffshore/Manufactured Products generated revenues and Segment EBITDA of $107.4 million and $18.3 million, respectively, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to revenues of $91.3 million and Segment EBITDA of $15.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues and Segment EBITDA increased 18% and 17% year-over-year, respectively. Project-driven revenues increased 26% year-over-year due to higher sales of our standard connector products and certain deck equipment sales. Short-cycle product sales (elastomer and valve products) also improved 22% year-over-year, reflecting the continued benefit of expanded U.S. land-based activity. Segment EBITDA margin was 17% in both the first quarter of 2018 and 2017. Backlog totaled $157 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $168 million at December 31, 2017 and $204 million at March 31, 2017. The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was 0.92x.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recognized an effective tax rate benefit of 26.0% in the first quarter of 2018 which compared to an effective tax rate benefit of 27.3% in the first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of March 31, 2018, $188.0 million was outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility along with an additional $20.9 million of outstanding letters of credit, while cash totaled $25.1 million. Total availability under the revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018 was $101.1 million, which is less than the full amount of the facility due to limits imposed by maintenance covenants in the amended credit agreement.\nOn January 30, 2018, the Company completed an offering of $200 million principal amount of 1.50% convertible senior notes due February 2023. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility, which were drawn in January 2018 to fund the cash portion of the GEODynamics acquisition. In conjunction with the issuance of the convertible senior notes, the Company's revolving credit facility was further amended and the maturity date was extended. Lender commitments under the amended revolving credit facility total $350 million. The amended revolving credit facility can be increased by an incremental $150 million, subject to additional lender commitments.The maturity date of the amended credit agreement was extended to January 30, 2022. The amended credit agreement contains customary financial covenants and restrictions, such as a senior secured leverage ratio, a total net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.\nConference Call Information\nThe call is scheduled for Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 am CT, and is being webcast and can be accessed from the Company’s website at www.ir.oilstatesintl.com .
