You’ve got to run a campaign to win in 2018.”\nMr. Batzel said Mr. Ryan’s departure will make it more difficult for the GOP to hold his seat, which covers parts of six counties in the state’s southeastern corner.\nAfter announcing Wednesday that he will not seek re-election, House Speaker Paul Ryan explained how he came to the decision and fielded questions on whether his retirement could signal a grim outcome for the GOP in upcoming midterm elections. Photo: AP Mr. Ryan, 48 years old, faced few competitive challengers for re-election since he was first elected in 1998, though his district wasn’t overwhelmingly Republican. President Barack Obama carried the district in the 2008 election, Republican Mitt Romney took it in 2012 and President Donald Trump won it by 10 percentage points in 2016.\nBut in recent months, Democrats have erased larger GOP margins from the 2016 election in both state and federal special elections. Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb in March won a Pennsylvania district Mr. Trump took by 20 points.\nRelated\nRyan to Leave Congress at the End of His Term Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter The nonpartisan Cook Political Report said Wednesday that Mr. Ryan’s retirement puts his district “at risk for the first time” since he first won election in 1998.\nTwo Democrats have been campaigning ahead of the state’s August primary. Randy Bryce, an ironworker and union activist who is known as “Iron Stache” for his bushy facial hair, has raised $4.75 million since starting his campaign last summer. Cathy Myers, a schoolteacher from Mr. Ryan’s hometown of Janesville, is also running. She’s raised about $750,000, according to her campaign.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently added Mr. Bryce to its “Red to Blue” list of top-tier challengers in GOP-held districts.\nDuring his campaign, Mr. Bryce has harangued Mr. Ryan for being focused on national issues rather than on his district.\n“Paul Ryan decided to quit today rather than face Randy Bryce and the voters,” said Mr. Bryce’s spokeswoman, Lauren Hitt. Mr. Ryan said he was retiring so he could spend more time with his family.\nEven before Mr. Ryan’s announcement, Wisconsin Republicans had been unsettled by a 12-point loss last week in a state Supreme Court election. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, the GOP governor who is seeking re-election, warned of a looming “blue wave” after that election.\nMr. Walker said Wednesday Mr. Ryan “leaves behind a far-reaching, reform-minded legacy and a long list of achievements in Congress.”\nNewsletter Sign-up Republicans who may run for Mr. Ryan’s seat include Robin Vos, the Wisconsin state assembly speaker; Bryan Steil, a member of the University of Wisconsin board of regents; and Dave Craig, a state senator from Waukesha County. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus also lives in the district.\nPaul Nehlen, who lost a 2016 primary to Mr. Ryan by 68 percentage points, is also seeking the GOP nomination.\nRepublicans who aim to succeed Mr. Ryan have until June 1 to file to get on the ballot to replace him. Whoever runs will be starting from a distinct fundraising disadvantage to Mr. Bryce, should he be the Democratic nominee.\nMr. Ryan is expected to help raise money for the party’s GOP nominee in the district but it remains unclear how much he will be able to raise as a lame-duck speaker.\nWrite to Reid J.
