During his ten years at Ally, Russi led Ally's auto finance business through an incredible transformation period from a captive finance provider to an innovative industry leader. He successfully navigated through industry and broader economic changes to grow the existing auto finance business and develop innovative ways to leverage Ally's technology with new consumer and mobility trends to position the company for the future.

Russi also pioneered an innovative customer loyalty program that delivered significant benefits for Ally and its dealers, and reflected his deep commitment to providing unmatched dealer and customer service.\n\"I am extremely thankful to Tim for his dedication, and for the many successes and accomplishments he achieved over the years,\" said Jeffrey Brown, chief executive officer at Ally. \"It's due in part to his hard work and leadership that Ally is in the position of strength we hold today, and I am proud that he was able to build a team of smart, dedicated professionals that will continue his track record of success.\"\nAs Timmerman moves to lead the auto finance business, Mark Manzo has been named president of Ally's insurance business. Manzo was previously senior vice president of the central region and strategic alliances for the auto finance business and successfully developed relationships with key dealers and digital providers that helped to expand and diversify the business. In his new role, Manzo will lead key business development and diversification initiatives for Ally's insurance business, with a focus on creating new relationships with dealers and digital marketplaces.\n\"I am thrilled for Doug to lead our auto finance business in its next chapter, and am confident that he will continue to grow and evolve the business in new and exciting ways, while adding value for our customers and keeping outstanding service at the forefront of everything we do,\" said Brown. \"I am similarly pleased to welcome Mark Manzo to the management team. Mark brings a unique skill set to the insurance organization, having established many important alliances for the company, and I look forward to the progress of the insurance business under his leadership.\"\nTo further enhance the auto finance organization, David Shevsky has been named chief operating officer of auto finance at Ally. In this newly-created role, Shevsky will oversee consumer risk and operations, commercial risk and credit administration, collections and loss mitigation activities, and business systems.
