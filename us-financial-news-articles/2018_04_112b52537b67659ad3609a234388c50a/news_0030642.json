Under the deal, Intesa will also sell some 10 billion euros in bad debts at around 30 percent of their book value. \nA group of banks is financing the senior notes to be issued by a vehicle that will take on Intesa’s bad debts, one source said. Co-investors could join Intrum in buying the riskier notes. \nA spokesman for Intrum referred to the company’s statement in January which first confirmed that talks with Intesa were ongoing. \nIntrum’s Managing Director for Italy Antonella Pagano said last week the negotiations had entered an “intense phase.” \nItalian banks are under regulatory pressure to shed some 285 billion euros in troubled loans still sitting on their balance sheets four years after a deep recession ended. \nSuch risky assets, which normally yield double-digit returns, are high on the radar of international investors who have also been snapping up Italian debt collection firms. \nOnly last December, Intrum acquired debt servicing company CAF from private equity fund Lone Star. \nAfter betting for years on recovering bad debts internally, Intesa has yielded to regulatory pressure to speed up the process. \nCEO Carlo Messina has said Intesa will only strike a deal if it can shed the bad debts without losing money and to speed up recoveries of unsecured loans. \nIntesa has written down its defaulted loans to 31 percent of their face value. \nUnder new rules unveiled last month, European banks in the future will have only two years to write down in full unsecured loans turning sour. \nIntrum, an industry leader following the acquisition of Norwegian rival Lindorff, specialises in unsecured debt.
