The new silos would be dispatched across the regions in northern Ukraine where the company has farmland, he said.\nAgroGeneration reported on Thursday earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 9.1 million euros in 2017 against 19.4 million the previous year.\nIt posted a net loss of 13.2 million euros against 0.9 million in 2016, which had marked an improvement from 2015.\nWinter sowings, due to be harvested in two months, were made in good conditions on 48,000 hectares and ongoing spring sowings had been secured financially and were progressing well, he said.\n“So far so good, thus we give a guidance that we should come back in 2018 to 18 million to 19 million (euros EBITDA) which was our previous track,” Danon said.\n($1 = 0.8210 euros)\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:17:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
