Cole (eight and ninth) combined to hold the Angels scoreless for the final three innings to finish it off for the Yankees, who will go for the sweep on Sunday.\nThe Yankees had only three hits in the first inning off Angels starter Garrett Richards (3-1), who had not lost in his first five starts this season. But New York took advantage of Angels miscues to score five runs.\nAn error by Cozart at shortstop and a passed ball on a third strike by catcher Martin Maldonado contributed to the Yankees’ onslaught, which included RBI doubles by Sanchez and Andujar.\nIn the second, the Yankees kept the pressure on Richards, getting an RBI double by Judge and a two-run triple by Aaron Hicks to knock the Angels right-hander out of the game after just 1 2/3 innings.\nThe Yankees scored two more runs in the inning for a 10-0 lead, nine of the runs (five earned) charged to Richards, who gave up five hits and walked three.\nLuis Valbuena had two hits for the Angels.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:22:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
