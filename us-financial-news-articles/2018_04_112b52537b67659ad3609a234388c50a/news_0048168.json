BDEW, which mainly represents power-generating utilities, said it new of 52 units being planned with a joint capacity of 22,420 megawatts (MW). But only 14 were actually under construction. Among those planned but not yet begun, there were 22 gas-fired plants and six pumped storage plants, that were being stalled by currently unfavourable market conditions for such capacities. BDEW members have cast doubts on plans for many units due to the largely unprofitable market for thermal plants and pumped storage electricity, BDEW said in a related statement. For simplicity, this table shows only projects above 200 MW. A handful of smaller offshore wind and two small gas-to-power plants at Kiel and Mainz are not listed, although they count towards the total number.
