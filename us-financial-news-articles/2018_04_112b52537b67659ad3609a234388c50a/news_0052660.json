The U.S. 10-year yield had hit a four-year high of 3.035 percent on Wednesday.\nIn the JGB market, the 10-year JGB yield rose 1.5 basis point to 0.070 percent, reaching its highest level since March 2.\nThe 20-year JGB yield rose 2 basis points to a seven-week high of 0.555 percent, and the 30-year JGB yield climbed 2.5 basis points to 0.765 percent, rising to levels last scaled on March 2.
