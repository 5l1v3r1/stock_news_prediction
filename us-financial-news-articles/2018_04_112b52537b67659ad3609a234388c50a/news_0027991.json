Rowling.\nYet this form of trafficking may be easier to tackle than others in a trade estimated to enslave 40 million people globally and raise annual profits of $150 billion, Lumos said.\n“It is definitely solvable as the demand has been created by people who are genuinely trying to do good,” said Georgette Mulheir, head of Lumos. “We just need to redirect that energy.”\nReporting By Kieran Guilbert, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
