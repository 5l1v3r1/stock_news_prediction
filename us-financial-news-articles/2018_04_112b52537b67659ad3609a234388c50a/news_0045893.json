Last month, Rial told journalists that Santander Brasil planned to accelerate loan book growth this year as credit demand was picking up.\nFee revenues also rose, as the bank’s client base grew 9.5 percent in a year to 22.2 million consumers.\nSantander Brasil posted a 2.9 percent delinquency rate in the first quarter, 0.2 percent point lower than the previous quarter, as loan-loss expenses decreased.\nBrazil is the biggest market for the Santander group, and the strong performance helped the Spanish bank post a better-than-expected 10 percent rise in first-quarter profit.\n$1 = 3.47 reais Reporting by Carolina Mandl Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T04:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T04:36:56.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
