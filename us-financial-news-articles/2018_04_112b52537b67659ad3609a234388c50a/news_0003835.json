On April 1, a newspaper reported Prumo’s subsidiary was seeking a $355 million loan from the World Bank to build a thermal plant at Açu, the company said. \nPrumo, however, did not comment on the size of the loan it was seeking. \nPrumo, owned by EIG Global Energy Partners LLC, will be de-listed by its owners after the controlling shareholder bought out two-thirds of the minority shareholders last month.
