He said earlier on Wednesday he thought the United States would soon be able to trim its trade deficit with Japan and that Tokyo planned to order large numbers of U.S. aircraft.\n“In order to benefit both Japan and the U.S., we will further expand trade and investment between the two countries,” Abe told reporters at a news conference. “President Trump and I agreed to start talks for free, fair and reciprocal trade deals.”\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:47:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
