The Siemens Gamesa logo is displayed outside the company headquarters in Zumudio, near Bilbao, Spain, November 28, 2017. REUTERS/Vincent West \nIberdrola has viewed critically Siemens’s large influence over Siemens Gamesa following last year’s merger, which left Iberdrola with an 8.1 percent stake in the combined entity, compared with Siemens’s 59 percent. \nIberdrola had been Gamesa’s top shareholder before the tie-up. \n“Iberdrola is both a very valued customer and an important shareholder of Siemens Gamesa. We’re long term partners in many ways,” Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said after meeting Iberdrola CEO Ignacio Galan earlier on Wednesday. \nKaeser said Siemens and Iberdrola had an ongoing and open dialogue on different levels, adding this would continue going forward.
