Global demand has been improving, which should encourage exports and boost fresh investments. On the whole, real GDP (gross domestic product) growth is expected to expand at 7.4 percent in 2018/19, with risks evenly balanced,” he said. \nSince November 2016, consumer price inflation has generally remained below a medium-term target of 4 percent, Patel said. \nIndia’s annual retail inflation eased for a third straight month in March to 4.28 percent, driven by smaller rises in food prices. \n“Several factors are likely to influence the inflation outlook, including a possible moderation in food prices if the monsoon turns out to be normal and is supported by effective food supply management,” Patel said. \nWholesale food prices in March fell 0.07 percent year-on-year, compared with a 0.07 percent rise a month earlier. \nBut higher oil prices could pose a risk, he cautioned. \nIndia was also “committed” to fiscal prudence, Patel said. \nWith the help of higher tax revenue and a rationalisation of subsidies, the fiscal deficit had steadily come down to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2017/18, without compromising on public investments and social sector spending, he said. \nIndia has set its fiscal deficit target for the 2018/19 fiscal year at 3.3 percent of gross domestic product.
