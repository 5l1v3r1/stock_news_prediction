The International Monetary Fund's managing director Christine Lagarde on Wednesday warned that the system governing global trade is at risk of being torn apart .\nBut Elliott said the bank has not been hit by the escalating trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world. If the situation deteriorates, some direct impact is likely, the CEO acknowledged, adding that the bigger worry is that the conflict could hurt the wider economy.\nshow chapters Australian banking could see changes in mortgage practices 12 Hours Ago | 02:55 \"I don't think businesses like any kind of conflict, trade war because it really raises the level of uncertainty and makes people really cautious,\" he said.\nElliott explained that, if the current situation escalates into a trade war, consumers and businesses would tighten their purse strings. That could affect economic growth — a scenario that's \"not good for anybody.\" That's especially true for Australia, a trade-dependent country.\n'I'm always nervous' In addition to a potential trade war, the Australian banking sector is subject to a probe by the Royal Commission — the country's most powerful type of federal inquiry — for years of misconduct that allegedly include interest rate rigging and money laundering.\nThe Royal Commission's inquiry has put the spotlight on how Australia's four largest banks — which together control about 80 percent of the home lending market — have dominated the industry and impeded competition.\nThe probe will ultimately result in positive changes in the industry, Elliott said, adding that it's been a \"real wake up call\" for banks. The scrutiny also came at a time when Australian banks face mounting pressure to grow their revenue in an ever-changing environment.\n\"We're in a much more constrained environment for a whole range of reasons,\" he explained. \"The economy's going okay but not stellar. You've got a lot of regulatory change that has just kind of put a little bit of a lid on growth.\"\n\"I'm always nervous,\" Elliott added.\n— Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T03:36:17.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
