However, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous quarter. \nThe country’s March retail sales also jumped over 10 percent, the strongest pace in four months. \nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.36 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.06 percent. \nThe euro fell slightly after rising above $1.24 to a three-week high on the Chinese data, ebbing Syria retaliation fears and overall renewed risk sentiment. \n“There’s been a general weakness in the dollar and risk sentiment seems to be reviving somewhat. That is supporting the euro but also sterling and Asian currencies,” said Alvin Tan, FX strategist at Societe Generale. \nThe dollar index rose 0.19 percent, with the euro down 0.25 percent to $1.2347. \nSterling was last at $1.4304, down 0.22 percent on the day, after hitting nearly $1.438, its highest since British voters decided in June 2016 to exit the European Union. \nU.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal drove aluminium prices to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed it all. Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil prices steadied as investors took profit on last week’s rally and amid concern over the potential for supply disruptions. \nU.S. crude fell 0.32 percent to $66.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.20, down 0.31 percent on the day.
