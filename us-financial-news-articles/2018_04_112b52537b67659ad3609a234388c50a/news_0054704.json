The annualized return on equity (ROE) stands at 11.2% or 1,049 bps above the risk-free rate [1] .\nStrong estimated solvency ratio of 222% at March 31, 2018, marginally above the optimal range of 185% - 220% defined in the \"Vision in Action\" [2] plan following robust capital generation and a favorable interest rate environment.\nNet operating cash flows stand at EUR 123 million in the first quarter of 2018, which should normalize to EUR 200 million per quarter, mainly impacted by payments from Q3 2017 cat events, while Life benefits from strong technical cash flow. Cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the successful issuance of a USD 625 million subordinated Tier 1 (\"RT1\") debt [3] .\nSCOR's financial leverage stands at 30.1% at March 31, 2018, temporarily above the range indicated in \"Vision in Action\". The adjusted financial leverage ratio would be 26.2% when allowing for the intended calls of the two debts callable in June and November 2018.\nShareholders' equity stands at EUR 6,177 million at March 31, 2018, compared to EUR 6,225 million at December 31, 2017. This translates into a book value per share of EUR 32.49 at March 31, 2018, compared to EUR 33.01 at December 31, 2017.\nSCOR will propose an attractive 2017 dividend per share of EUR 1.65 [4] at the Annual General Meeting.\nThe recent U.S. tax reform has required SCOR to implement certain changes to its operational structure. No accounting charge stemming from the U.S. tax reform is being accounted for in Q1 2018. The total non-recurring tax expense for the target operational structure is expected to be in the lower half of the USD 0 - 350 million range that was communicated in SCOR's full-year 2017 disclosure [5] . The Group expects a limited impact on the solvency ratio. SCOR anticipates booking an accounting charge in Q2 2018 and the Group expects the implementation to be substantially completed by H2 2018.\nSCOR Group Q1 2018 key financial details:\nIn EUR millions (rounded, at current exchange rates) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Variation Gross written premiums 3,771 3,739 +0.9% Group cost ratio 5.0% 5.1% -0.1 pts Annualized ROE 11.2% 8.6% +2.6 pts Net income * 166 140 +18.6% Shareholders' equity 6,177 6,840 -9.7% (*) Consolidated net income, Group share.\nDenis Kessler, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of SCOR, comments: \"SCOR is off to a strong start for 2018: successful P&C renewals, the continued expansion of the Life business in key markets, notably Asia-Pacific, and a well-received debt issuance. The Group holds firmly to its \"Vision in Action\" plan and is on track to deliver on its targets. The Group continues to pursue its attractive shareholder remuneration policy, with a dividend of EUR 1.65 per share that has been submitted for approval at the Annual General Meeting. SCOR is strategically positioned for growth across its businesses and in targeted geographies.\"\n*\n* *\nIn the first quarter of 2018, SCOR Global P&C delivers strong technical profitability with a net combined ratio of 91.8%\nSCOR Global P&C gross written premiums stand at EUR 1,480 million, up 3.9% at constant exchange rates compared to the same period last year (-5.0% at current exchange rates).

This results in a badwill of EUR 26 million under PGAAP Accounting, and gross written premiums of EUR 33 million, or 1.5% of growth, with technical margins in line with \"Vision in Action\".\nSCOR Global Investments delivers a return on invested assets of 2.3% in the first quarter of 2018\nSCOR Global Investments continues to position its investment portfolio in line with the \"Vision in Action\" target asset allocation:\nLiquidity at 5% (stable vs. Q4 2017); Corporate bonds at 47% (+1 pt vs. Q4 2017); Fixed income portfolio of very high quality, with an average rating of A+, and stable duration at 4.6 years [11] .\nSCOR Global Investments key figures:\nIn EUR millions (rounded, at current exchange rates) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Variation Total investments 27,563 27,884 -1.2% of which total invested assets 18,862 19,373 -2.6% of which total funds withheld by cedants and other deposits 8,701 8,511 +2.2% Return on investments * 2.0% 2.3% -0.3 pts Return on invested assets ** 2.3% 2.6% -0.3 pts (*) Annualized, including interest on deposits (i.e. interest on funds withheld).\n(**) Annualized, excluding interest on deposits (i.e. interest on funds withheld).\nThe investment portfolio remains liquid, with financial cash flows [12] of EUR 5.4 billion expected over the next 24 months, which is optimal in a period of rising interest rates.\nInvestment income on invested assets stands at EUR 108 million in Q1 2018, generating a return on invested assets of 2.3%.\nThe reinvestment yield stands at 2.7% at the end of Q1 2018 [13] .\nUnder current market conditions, SCOR Global Investments expects the annualized return on invested assets to be in the upper part of the \"Vision in Action\" 2.5% - 3.2% range for FY2018 and over the entire strategic plan.\nRegarding its ESG investment policy, SCOR reaffirms its commitment to helping manage climate risk. SCOR is expanding its coal divestment strategy based on the Global Coal Exit List (GCEL).
