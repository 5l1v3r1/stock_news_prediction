It then agreed to a takeover by Ion on April 20, ditching a Feb. 21 deal to sell itself to Swiss banking software firm Temenos ( TEMN.S ) in the process.\nSS&C now has until 5pm (1600 GMT) on May 4 to make firm offer for Fidessa, the Panel said. Temenos has already ruled itself out of making a new offer for the London-listed business.\nReporting by Ben Martin, editing by Louies Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:48:42.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
