World Bank President Jim Yong Kim attends the Development Committee meeting during the IMF/World Bank spring meeting in Washington, U.S., April 21, 2018. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nThe multilateral lender said the plan would allow it to lift the group’s overall lending to nearly $80 billion in fiscal 2019 from about $59 billion last year and to an average of about $100 billion annually through 2030. \n“We have more than doubled the capacity of the World Bank Group,” the institution’s president, Jim Yong Kim, told reporters during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. \n“It’s a huge vote of confidence, but the expectations are enormous.” \nThe hard-fought capital hike, initially resisted by the Trump administration, will add $7.5 billion paid-in capital for the World Bank’s main concessional lending arm, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. \nIts commercial-terms lender, the International Finance Corp, will get $5.5 billion paid-in capital, and IBRD also will get a $52.6 billion increase in callable capital. LENDING REFORMS \nThe bank agreed to change IBRD’s lending rules to charge higher rates for developing countries with higher incomes, to discourage them from excessive borrowing. \nIBRD previously had charged similar rates for all borrowers, and U.S. Treasury officials had complained that it was lending too much to China and other bigger emerging markets. \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said earlier on Saturday that he supported the capital hike due to the reforms that it included. The last World Bank capital increase came in 2010. \nThe current hike comes with cost controls and salary restrictions that will hold World Bank compensation to “a little below average” for the financial sector, Kim said. \nHe added that there was nothing specific in the agreement that targeted a China lending reduction, but he said lending to China was expected to gradually decline. \nIn 2015, China founded the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and lends heavily to developing countries through its government export banks. \nThe agreement will lift China’s shareholding in IBRD to 6.01 percent from 4.68 percent, while the U.S. share would dip slightly to 16.77 percent from 16.89 percent. Washington will still keep its veto power over IBRD and IFC decisions. \nKim said the increase was expected to become fully effective by the time the World Bank’s new fiscal year starts on July 1. Countries will have up to eight years to pay for the capital increase. \nThe U.S. contribution is subject to approval by Congress.
