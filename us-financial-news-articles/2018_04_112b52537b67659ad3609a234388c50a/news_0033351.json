In fact, there must have been a voice in his head telling him to keep his head down. \n“But, gloriously, Weber deviated from this path and acted like a human.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T04:48:26.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
