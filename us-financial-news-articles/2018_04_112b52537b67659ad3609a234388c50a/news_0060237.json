Teachers are demanding the Legislature boost their pay by 20%.\nChurches, community centers, youth clubs, food banks and community organizations are offering free and discounted services to help take care of students. School districts also are opening their doors to provide meals and allow for after-school programs to operate full day.\n“We’re providing breakfast, lunch and snacks,” said Chuck Smyers, an administrator at The Springs Church in Chandler, part of the Phoenix metropolitan area. “We’re kind of predicting that the longer this thing goes on, people are finding more of a need.”\nArizona parent Jennifer Goehring, a nurse and former teacher, said she supports the teachers but not the strike.\n“It’s holding the parents hostage because they are having to scramble to find people to watch their kids,” said Mrs. Goehring, who has alternated with her husband watching their children and several others whose families couldn’t take off work during the walkout. “It’s placing an undue hardship on families just trying to stay afloat. I don’t like the kids being used as pawns.”\nRead More\nDid Your Kid Get Placed On a College Wait List?

But the protests seen so far this year don’t legally count as strikes, since many superintendents are pre-emptively closing down schools, and other teachers are using sick days to protest.\nIn Arizona, Tempe Elementary School District Superintendent Christine Busch told parents in a letter: “I can no longer guarantee an engaging and meaningful learning experience for your child along with ensuring the safety and well-being of students and employees.” The district’s schools are closed until further notice.\nThe Goldwater Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank, criticized teachers for walking out. Matthew Simon, director of education policy at the institute, in a news release said the Arizona strike is doing “real harm” by depriving students of learning.\n“As a former teacher, I know the negative impact even one day of missed instruction can have on a student, let alone several days,” Mr. Simon said.\nArizona’s strike kicked off with teachers demanding that the Legislature boost their pay through a combination of tax increases, among other demands. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey proposed funding a pay increase through existing revenue, though he remains opposed to tax increases, and the Legislature has not taken up his proposal.\nMany parents have spoken out in support of teachers, although some acknowledge the inconvenience of having to make alternative child-care plans.\nNancy Pereschuk, who works in student services at Arizona State University, said she took vacation days on Thursday and Friday to take care of her three school-age children, and she hasn’t yet figured out child-care if the strike continues. But, she added, it’s worth the trouble.\n“It’s inconvenient for sure, but it’s like, what’s the endgame?” she said. She noted that she has seen budget challenges at her kids’ relatively affluent school in Chandler. The school has asked parents to donate a range of school supplies, from glue sticks to copier paper.\nFor decades, Arizona’s teacher pay was roughly aligned with the U.S. median tracked by the National Education Association teachers union. That changed when the state’s large construction industry retreated following the 2008 housing bust and tax revenue dried up.\nA decade later, state revenues have recovered, but school funding hasn’t. Arizona’s spending on education has fallen 10% since 2008 when adjusted for inflation, according to its annual reports. Teacher salaries are down 8% and are now seventh worst in the U.S., according to NEA data.\nIn Colorado, teachers walked out on Thursday and Friday, closing 30 school districts, but planned to return to school Monday. Some teachers there said the goal is to shine a light on low teacher pay, and they plan to continue reaching out to lawmakers.\nColorado teacher Angela Anderson said she took personal days on Thursday and Friday to go to the state capitol in Denver to talk to legislators. She prefers not to call it a walkout.\n“I’m not walking out on my kids. The state of Colorado walked out on my kids when they didn’t provide adequate funding,” said Ms. Anderson, a high-school social studies teacher in Lakewood. “I’m using my personal days to speak up for my students.”\nWrite to Tawnell D.
