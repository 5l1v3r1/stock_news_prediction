The jump was mainly fueled by a 47 percent spike in dealmaking in Brazil, the report said. In Mexico, dealmaking rose 1.5 percent last year. \nThe surge in interest in Brazil and Mexico as deal destinations comes at a tricky time for both countries, which are the two largest economies in Latin America. Both have elections scheduled for this year that could change their political and economic landscapes. \nBrazil is set to elect its next president in October. The race broke wide open earlier this month after former president President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sent to jail for corruption. \nIf Brazil elects a candidate who opposes reforming the country's pension plan, its economic recovery could be at risk. The country's current pension plan was a contributing factor in Brazil's deficit rising to 10 percent of GDP in 2015 . Current President Michel Temer pushed to reform Brazil's pension plan, but failed. \nIn Mexico, presidential elections are scheduled for July. The winner, who would not take office until January, will have to contend with negotiations on a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal if one is not reached by year-end. The front-runner in Mexico's contest is Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who has repeatedly bashed U.S. President Donald Trump. \nSources told CNBC on Wednesday that the U.S. is aiming to reach a NAFTA deal in principle with Mexico and Canada in the next three weeks. To be sure, there is no guarantee a deal will actually be reached. \nThat said, this is par for the course in Latin America, EY's Casey said. \"None of this is really new for the region,\" he said.
