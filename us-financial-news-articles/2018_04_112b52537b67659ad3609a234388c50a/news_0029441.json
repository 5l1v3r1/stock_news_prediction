It said last week that the terms and conditions of its contracts and the process for approving them were similar to those Peru signed with other oil companies last year.\nIt was unclear if Peru could block the concessions without running the risk of a lawsuit.\nCritics say the contracts should have been awarded in a public auction following consultations with environmental authorities, fishermen and coastal residents. They also say the government should have set a higher royalty rate.\nPerupetro, Peru’s state oil investment agency, has said the contracts were the fruit of months of negotiations and well within the laws of a country where open bidding rounds have been repeatedly canceled due to lack of interest.\nThe contracts grant Tullow the right to explore and drill for oil off Peru’s northern coast, including biodiverse swathes of the Pacific where whales and dolphins breed, according to environmentalists.\nThe company, which has been reviving its search for new resources, planned an initial investment of more than $200 million, according to Perupetro.\nPeru is a relatively small oil producer in a region where major players like Mexico, Brazil have cut regulations to promote investments in the sector.\nReporting By Teresa Cespdes, Writing By Mitra Taj; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:55:51.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
