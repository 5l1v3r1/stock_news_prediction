Larry McDonald, editor and founder of the Bear Traps Report, told CNBC's \" Trading Nation \" that a \"disconnect\" between the stock's massive market capitalization and the company's withering bond price is concerning. Here are his reasons why. • There is a clear disconnect between Tesla's sizable $45 billion market cap and the company's bonds, yielding around 7 percent after Moody's downgraded the credit rating late last week. • Even as the stock has seen a bit of a rebound since hitting a year-to-date low of $244.59 per share earlier this week, its debt has not made the same rebound; this is a serious disconnect, and it's likely that the stock is \"wrong\" and the bonds are \"correct.\" • The central concern for the market is Tesla's immense cash burn; Tesla last quarter reported negative free cash flow of $276.7 million, and negative $1.4 billion the previous quarter. • It is plausible Tesla could turn to convertible bonds to raise fresh capital. Such a move could pose a risk for equity shareholders. Bottom line: The disconnect between Tesla shares and the company's corporate bonds could be signaling trouble ahead.
