The right-hander walked three. He threw 96 pitches, 61 of them for strikes.\nAtlanta (9-6) tied the game in the bottom of the first inning when Freddie Freeman grounded into a double play that scored Ender Inciarte.

Minter worked 1 1/3 innings, working around a pair of walks in the eighth.\nCloser Arodys Vizcaino finished the game with a scoreless ninth. Vizcaino worked around a one-out hit, struck out one and earned his first save.\nAaron Nola (1-1) absorbed just his second career loss against Atlanta. The right-hander allowed two runs in six innings on four hits and one walk. Nola struck out two. He is now 5-2 in nine career appearances against the Braves.\nPhiladelphia (9-6) got two hits each from Herrera, who is now batting .340, and J.P. Crawford. The Phillies had only six hits and left 10 runners on base. They were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position.\nAtlanta mustered just four hits, two of them from Albies. The second baseman was 2-for-3, extending his hitting streak to five games and raising his batting average to .328.\nTeheran improved to 9-6 in his career against Philadelphia.
