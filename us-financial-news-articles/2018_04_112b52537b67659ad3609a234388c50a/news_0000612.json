REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo \nData compiler IHS Markit said its monthly final purchasing managers’ index fell to 53.7 in March from 55.9 in February. \nThat brought the index closer to the 50-point line dividing expansions in activity from contractions. It was marginally higher than a preliminary reading of 53.6. \nThe flow of new orders and backlogs of work already on order both grew at the slowest pace since February 2017, but companies only marginally slowed their hiring. \n“Weaker client demand can be at least partially attributed to poor weather conditions and a strong euro,” IHS Markit economist Alex Gill said. \n“Taken together, the data suggest a moderation from the rates of growth that we saw in much of 2017. At 53.7 in March, however, the headline PMI remains firmly in expansionary territory and consistent with a positive contribution of the sector to GDP for the first quarter,” he added. \nFrance saw unseasonably cold weather as well as snow in March, and the euro has been trading around a three-year high since the start of the year, which makes French goods more expensive to buyers from outside the euro zone. \n : here Reporting by Leigh Thomas, editing by Larry King", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T10:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T11:23:38.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
