Wind generation in Scotland increased by 34 percent, while hydro was up 9 percent. \nCommenting on the figures at the time, Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said they showed \"that Scotland's renewable energy sector is stronger than ever and has a strong pipeline of further projects still to be constructed.\" \nThe Scottish government has ambitious plans when it comes to renewable energy. By 2020, it wants renewables to produce the equivalent of 100 percent of Scotland's gross annual electricity consumption. It is also aiming for renewables to provide the equivalent of 11 percent of the country's heat demand by 2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T13:22:04.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
