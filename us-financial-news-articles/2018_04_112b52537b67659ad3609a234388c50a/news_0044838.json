The case could lead to a fine of up to 300,000 euros ($370,000).\n\"First we will seek a statement from Facebook and then hearings will begin,\" said Caspar's spokesman, Martin Schemm.\nSuch a fine, if imposed, would only be a pinprick for Facebook, which recorded revenues of more than $40 billion last year.\nBut the case marks a warning shot ahead of the introduction of tougher privacy rules across the European Union on May 25 that foresee penalties of up to four percent of worldwide revenues for serious violations.\nFacebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the probe.\nCHARM DEFENSIVE\nFacing a hostile audience, a Facebook executive earlier met German lawmakers and repeated apologies by CEO Mark Zuckerberg over the Cambridge Analytica leak.\n\"What happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a huge violation of trust, and we are deeply sorry,\" Joel Kaplan, vice president for global public policy, said according to the text of his prepared remarks.\nKaplan said Facebook would roll out a new 'view ads' feature, designed to make political advertising more transparent, in time for a regional election being held in the German state of Bavaria in October.\nSocial media experts say Germany's parliamentary election last September was less affected by the spread of 'fake news' than the U.S. vote, where Trump pulled off a stunning come-from-behind victory.\nYet the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) was able to capitalise on a wave of discontent with an active campaign on social media, winning seats in parliament for the first time as Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats polled poorly.\nThe Bavarian party closely allied to Merkel's conservatives is seeking re-election in October. Its leading figure in the federal government, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, is taking a hard line on immigration in a bid to squeeze the AfD vote.\nLawmakers came away dissatisfied from the closed-door hearing, saying Facebook executives had failed to give clarity on how widespread the illicit harvesting of data using Facebook apps had been.\n\"We just experienced another slice of Facebook's salami tactics,\" said Thomas Jarzombek, the Christian Democrats' digital policy spokesman.\nTabea Roessner of the opposition Greens said the hearing had shown Facebook was still in 'business as usual' mode. \"That disrespects those affected,\" she told the Handelsblatt daily.
