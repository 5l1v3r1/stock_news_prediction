U.S. fleet owners in the first quarter nearly doubled their orders from a year ago, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips and Jennifer Smith write, a stark sign of the strong expansion in the American economy. The orders suggest the growing financial health of U.S. carriers that have been riding higher on rising freight rates and big gains from the new tax law. The orders come as the gap between shipping capacity and freight demand appears to be widening. Spot-market load boards have been reporting more shipments than available trucks in recent weeks, and strong first-quarter growth in intermodal rail volumes suggest shippers are having trouble finding trucks. Relief from truck manufacturers may not arrive soon: ACT Research reports factory backlogs are near a three-month high.\nChina’s new threatened tariffs are raising concerns from American farms to factories , and are already prompting some companies to consider pulling back production. The prospect that one of the biggest purchasers of U.S. farm products may scale back imports has some American farmers rethinking planting and investment decisions, the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge and Jesse Newman report, among many moves that would trigger changes in U.S. supply chains. Soybean and corn prices were trading lower in the wake of China’s announcement that it would impose retaliatory tariffs on various agricultural products, adding to the pain on farms already weighed down by diminished income from crops and livestock. China is by far the largest foreign buyer of U.S. soybeans, and bought 32 million metric tons of the crop from U.S. exporters last year—more than half of all foreign sales. Analysts say the mere threat of tariffs should prompt buyers in China to cancel some unshipped orders and shop for Brazilian-grown commodities instead.\nBoeing Co. is hoping it doesn’t have to find out if its aerospace supply chain is strong enough to withstand a trade war. The aircraft manufacturer says it wants to have talks with the U.S. and China to halt a tit-for-tat trans-Pacific tariff battle that threatens to buffet the global aerospace industry. The WSJ’s Doug Cameron reports the new levies Beijing proposes on imports of Boeing jets would catch only a sliver of the company’s aircraft , hitting smaller planes including the 737 that have only modest orders in China. But Boeing is also heavily invested there, both through jet sales and parts purchasing, and an escalation could have a dramatic impact in both China and the U.S. Chinese companies supply parts on most of Boeing’s commercial programs. And Chinese carriers would have to turn to Airbus SE production lines that already are jammed if they have to turn away from Boeing.\nECONOMY & TRADE An Andersons Inc. grain trans-loading facility in Toledo, Ohio. Photo: Bloomberg News U.S. aluminum users are breathing a sigh of relief. Prices of the metal have fallen 6% from a peak in February, the WSJ’s Bob Tita writes, despite a tariff aimed at holding back imports to boost domestic production . Manufacturers of products such as beer cans and car hoods now are paying 3% less for aluminum than they were before the Trump administration announced the tariff on March 1. That’s a sign of the fast-changing impact of the trade maneuvers as buyers and suppliers adjust to changes in the markets and the administration rolls out exemptions for many top aluminum-making countries. Aluminum producer Alexin LLC says it has passed its higher prices along to industrial customers and demand has remained “fabulous.” Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd., meantime, says it expects the steel and aluminum tariffs will have only a limited impact on international shipping, noting annual U.S. steel imports amount to “just 8% of the global trade.”\n﻿\nQUOTABLE\n‘ The last three months, they’re ordering trucks and trailers like crazy. ’\n—Don Ake, FTR\nNumber of the Day 5.5% Year-over-year growth in intermodal shipments on U.S. railroads in the first quarter, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS Growth in the U.S. service economy slowed in March but remained in strong expansion territory .
