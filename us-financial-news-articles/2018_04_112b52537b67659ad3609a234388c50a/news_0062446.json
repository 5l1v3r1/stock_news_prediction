The Board and I want to do the right thing and make this goodwill payment,” Chief Executive Mark Wilson said.\nAviva, which appointed KPMG to manage the payment process, said it estimated that fewer than 2,000 individual investors sold their shares during the period and the cost should not exceed approximately 14 million pounds.\nEligible shareholders would have up to six months to make a claim from the date the goodwill payment process opened, it said.\n“It’s doing the right thing now but it’s been a costly mistake with damage to its reputation,” Panmure Gordon analyst Barrie Cornes said in a note to clients.\nWhile the preference shares currently count towards Aviva’s regulatory capital safety buffer, this is set to change from 2026 and Aviva said it would seek approval to continue to use them, or a suitable substitute, after that.\n“Preference shares remain an industry-wide issue and it is clear now that the best way forward is to seek a regulatory solution before the 2026 deadline when the shares no longer count as regulatory capital,” Wilson said.
