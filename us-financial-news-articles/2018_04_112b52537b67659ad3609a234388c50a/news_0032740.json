(“Asanko” or the “Company”) (TSX:AKG) (NYSE American:AKG) announces production results for the first quarter (“Q1”) of 2018 from the Asanko Gold Mine (“AGM”), located in Ghana, West Africa.\nCommenting on the quarter Peter Breese, President and CEO, said, “This is the second consecutive quarter that the mine has performed ahead of the optimized Life of Mine Plan, which was introduced in late Q3 2017. The mine performed exceptionally well and is ahead of plan on the key metrics of gold production, grade and mill throughput. The enlarged Nkran push back is progressing ahead of schedule and the mill delivered yet another record milling performance, both for the quarter and for the month of March, which is very encouraging. We are on track to meet our plan and guidance for H1 2018.\nI would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate the entire team for achieving our first year without any lost time injuries, this is a fantastic result and I’m pleased to see such diligent commitment by all our employees and contractors to working in a safe environment and ensuring every one of us goes home safely after each shift. ”\nHealth and Safety\nThere were no lost time injuries (“LTI”) reported during the quarter. On March 19, 2018, the mine achieved one year LTI-free with over 5,945,246 million man hours worked.\nProduction\nDuring the quarter, the AGM sourced ore from Nkran, Akwasiso, Dynamite Hill and Nkran Extension as well as on-surface stockpiles. Mining operations at Nkran continued to focus on waste removal as part of the ongoing larger Cut 2 push back, with a consequent increase in the strip ratio. Gold grades for the quarter were lower, as expected, due to the lower ore yield from Nkran, and feeding lower grade surface stockpiles to the mill. Grade and gold production is expected to be biased towards the second half of the year when Cut 2 at Nkran will start delivering steady state levels of ore production, thereby reducing the dependence on stockpiles.\nThe processing plant achieved another quarterly record milling performance of 1.27 million tonnes, processing a monthly record of 432,410 tonnes in March, which is above the recently upgraded design of 5 million tonnes per annum throughput. Metallurgical recovery was slightly ahead of plan and continued to exceed design levels despite higher mill throughput and lower feed grade.\nAGM Key Production Statistics Units Q2 2017 Q3 2017 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Total Tonnes Mined 000 t 7,506 8,519 11,494 12,743 Waste Tonnes Mined 000 t 6,458 7,339 10,692 11,976 Ore Tonnes Mined 000 t 1,048 1,180 802 767 Strip Ratio W:O 6.2:1 6.2:1 13.3:1 15.7:1 Average Gold Grade Mined g/t 1.5 1.8 1.5 1.3 Ore Treated 000 t 887 862 1,087 1,269 Gold Feed Grade g/t 1.7 1.9 1.5 1.3 Gold Recovery % 94 94 94 93 Gold Produced oz 46,017 49,293 51,550 48,229 Sales and Liquidity\nGold production for the quarter was 48,229 ounces with gold sales of 48,899 ounces at an average realized price of US$1,314 per ounce, generating gold sales revenue of US$64.2 million.
