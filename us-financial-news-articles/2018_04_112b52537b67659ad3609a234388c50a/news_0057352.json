The loan has unpaid principal of $36.9 million and is collateralized by a hotel under construction and parking lot in the southeastern United States. Based upon an independent first quarter 2018 appraisal, the loan to value is approximately 80% on an as is basis, with personal guarantees of certain of the borrower’s principals. The loan became delinquent in 2018 and the borrower, a development corporation, subsequently declared bankruptcy. The Bank is pursuing collection and we currently believe that there will be no loss of principal.\nQuarterly activity for commercial loan discontinued principal Commercial loan principal (in millions) Commercial loan discontinued principal December 31, 2017 before marks $ 225 2018 net paydowns (15 ) Commercial loan discontinued principal March 31, 2018 before marks $ 210 Marks March 31, 2018 (15 ) Net commercial loan exposure March 31, 2018 $ 195 Residential mortgages 59 Net loans $ 254 Florida mall in other real estate owned 15 Other 29 properties in other real estate owned 19 Other assets related to discontinued operations 1 Total discontinued assets at March 31, 2018 $ 289 Discontinued commercial loan composition March 31, 2018 Collateral type Unpaid principal\nbalance\nMark March 31,\n2018\nMark as % of\nportfolio\n(dollars in millions) Commercial real estate - non-owner occupied: Retail $ 11 $ 0.7 6 % Office 8 0.7 9 % Other 42 0.7 2 % Construction and land 80 1.3 2 % Commercial non-real estate and industrial 14 1.9 13 % 1 to 4 family construction 25 4.4 18 % First mortgage residential non-owner occupied 18 4.5 25 % Commercial real estate owner occupied: Retail 9 0.4 4 % Office - - - Other 1 - 0 % Residential junior mortgage 1 - 0 % Other 1 - 0 % Total $ 210 Less: mark (15 ) Net commercial loan exposure March 31, 2018 $ 195 $ 14.6 7 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006655/en/\nThe Bancorp, Inc.\nAndres Viroslav, 215-861-7990\naviroslav@thebancorp.com\nSource: The Bancorp, Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebancorp.com&esheet=51796090&newsitemid=20180426006655&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thebancorp.com&index=1&md5=cff2c6519b270306b1cd95a69baa04e0", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006655/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebancorp.com&esheet=51796090&newsitemid=20180426006655&lan=en-US&anchor=www.thebancorp.com&index=2&md5=727b1b8d3259ebbf6c9ae2fd60ad1bde"], "published": "2018-04-27T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T00:55:33.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
