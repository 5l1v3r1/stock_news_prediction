The couple divorced a year later, after which she adopted the surname Madikizela-Mandela.\nAppearing at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission set up to unearth atrocities committed by both sides in the anti-apartheid struggle, Madikizela-Mandela refused to show remorse for abductions and murders carried out in her name.\nOnly after pleading from anguished TRC chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu did she admit grudgingly that \"things went horribly wrong\".\nIn its final report, the TRC ruled that Madikizela-Mandela was \"politically and morally accountable for the gross violations of human rights committed by the MUFC\".\nFour years later, she was back in court, facing fraud and theft charges in relation to an elaborate bank loan scheme.\n\"Somewhere it seems that something went wrong,\" magistrate Peet Johnson said as he sentenced her to five years in jail, later overturned on appeal. \"You should set the example for all of us.\"\nMarried to the struggle Born on Sept. 26, 1936, in Bizana, Eastern Cape province, Madikizela-Mandela became politicized at an early age in her job as a hospital social worker.\n\"I started to realize the abject poverty under which most people were forced to live, the appalling conditions created by the inequalities of the system,\" she once said.\nStrikingly attractive and with a steely air - her given name, Nomzamo, means 'one who strives' - the 22-year-old Winnie caught the eye of Mandela at a Soweto bus-stop in 1957, starting a whirlwind romance that led to their marriage a year later.\nBut with husband and wife pouring their energies into the fight against apartheid, the relationship struggled before being torn apart after six years when Mandela was arrested and sentenced to life in prison.\nMadikizela-Mandela later described her marriage as a sham and the birth of their two daughters, Zindzi and Zenani, as \"quite coincidental\" to her one true love - the struggle against white rule.\n\"I was married to the ANC. It was the best marriage I ever had,\" she often said.\nGraca Machel, who stepped into her shoes as South Africa's first lady when she married Mandela in 1998, paid tribute to her predecessor in the years after her union.\n\"It's unfortunate that in our lives we don't interact very easily but I want to state very clearly that Winnie is my hero. Winnie is someone I respect highly,\" Machel once said.\n'I'm not sorry' As the years passed and Madikizela-Mandela's public standing plummeted, her relationship with the party she loved soured. She bore the air of a troublemaker, arriving late at rallies and haranguing comrades, including Thabo Mbeki, Mandela's successor as president.\nIn 2001, a television camera caught Mbeki brushing Madikizela-Mandela away and knocking off her hat after she arrived an hour late for a rally to commemorate a 1976 anti-apartheid uprising by Soweto schoolchildren and students.\nYears later, she clashed with the next president, Jacob Zuma , becoming a political patron of renegade ANC youth leader Julius Malema, who quit the century-old movement to found his own ultra-leftist political party.\nConfirming her support for Malema and his calls for seizure of white-owned farms and banks, Madikizela-Mandela revealed her contempt in 2010 for the deal her ex-husband struck with South Africa's white minority nearly two decades before.\nIn a London newspaper interview, she attacked Mandela, who died in December 2013, saying he had gone soft in prison and sold out the black cause.\n\"Mandela did go to prison and he went in there as a burning young revolutionary. But look what came out,\" she said. \"Mandela let us down. He agreed to a bad deal for the blacks.\"\nShe also dismissed Tutu, post-apartheid South Africa's moral fulcrum, as a \"cretin\" and rubbished his attempts at national healing as a \"religious circus\".\n\"I told him a few home truths. I told him that he and his other like-minded cretins were only sitting here because of our struggle and me - because of the things I and people like me had done to get freedom,\" she said.\n\"I am not sorry. I will never be sorry,\" she concluded. \"I would do everything I did again if I had to. Everything.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T18:11:58.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
