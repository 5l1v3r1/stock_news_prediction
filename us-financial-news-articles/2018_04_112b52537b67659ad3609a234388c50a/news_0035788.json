The estimated 100% cash selling price is subject to minor changes once final assaying results are agreed to by the Company and Trafigura at which time the final approximate 10% is paid.\nJosé Antonio Berlanga, CEO and Director, states: \"As we near the end of the El Largo Zone development phase in preparation of initiating bulk mining methods within the next few weeks, we have been improving efficiencies at the mill resulting in successfully increasing zinc concentrate grades to an average of 43.54% zinc and lead concentrate grades to an average of 34.88% lead during the first two weeks of April 2018. During this same two-week period, we have achieved improved zinc metal recoveries averaging 72.7% zinc into the zinc concentrates. As soon as we initiate the bulk mining methods, within the next several weeks, the mine will be able to deliver a more consistent mineralized mill feed, without excess dilution of mining development material from various areas within the large El Largo Zone. Processing mineralized mill feed of more consistent grade and quality, containing less dilution, should allow us to further improve concentrate grades and recoveries. In addition, bulk mining methods will allow us to ramp up pre-production towards the 2,500 t/d capacity of the mill and further reduce direct site costs of approximately US $48.5 per tonne. These current direct site costs are approximately 33% lower than the estimated direct site costs of US $72.26 per tonne used for the same categories in our recently published independent Preliminary Economic Assessment.”\nThe above referenced Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") dated March 31, 2018 was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and has been published on SEDAR or is also available on the Company’s web site, www.telsonmining.com .\nNon-IFRS (international financial reporting standards) performance measures - This news release refers to total direct site costs, which are non-IFRS performance measures. The Company believes that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable with other issuers.\nFor accounting purposes, any sale proceeds from preproduction prior to the Company declaring commercial production at the Campo Morado Mine are considered directly attributable toward advancing the asset to the condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, therefore these are recorded as a reductions of development expenses.\nDirect site costs - Telson is reporting direct site costs on per tonne of mineral processed. Sale proceeds reported are from preproduction during the mines commissioning period. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate operating earnings and cash flow from its mining operations. Management also uses this metric as an important tool to monitor operating performance. Direct site costs are calculated using costs such as costs incurred in mining, processing and site administration divided by total tonnages processed. Costs are exclusive of depreciation and other non-cash items. Other companies may calculate this measure differently.\nJanuary 1 - March 31, 2018 AVERAGE METALLURGICAL BALANCE 1ST QUARTER Feed Grade (From Mass Balance) Tonnes Grade Zn% Cu% Pb% Au g/t Ag g/t Ore Tonnes 148,676 3.65 0.41 0.9 1.14 108 Recovery WMT % Zn% Cu% Pb% Au% Ag% Zn Concentrate 5.5% 68.2% 17.0% 11.9% 10.1% 22.2% Cu Concentrate 0.1% 0.1% 1.3% 0.6% 0.6% 0.9% Pb Concentrate 0.9% 2.1% 4.7% 25.4% 7.2% 5.2% Tonnes Grade Zn% Cu% Pb% Au g/t Ag g/t Zn Concentrate 8,206.22 45.16 1.26 1.94 2.08 436 Cu Concentrate 82.22 5.76 9.87 10.54 11.88 1,753 Pb Concentrate 1,365.66 8.29 2.11 24.94 8.92 616 Content Zn, t Cu, t Pb, t Au, Kg Ag, Kg Zn Concentrate 3,705.92 103.58 159.44 17.04 3,579.24 Cu Concentrate 4.74 8.11 8.66 0.98 144.10 Pb Concentrate 113.16 28.77 340.57 12.18 841.76 Following table presents average metal recoveries obtained during March 2018\nAverage Recovery - March 1 - 31, 2018 WMT % Zn% Cu% Pb% Au% Ag% Zn Concentrate 6.3% 70.5% 16.9% 14.1% 10.1% 23.3% Pb Concentrate 1.1% 2.5% 4.0% 28.3% 7.5% 6.0% Grant of Options\nThe Company has granted a total of 400,000 stock options to a Director and a service provider under the terms of the Company’s stock option plan.

At the Campo Morado Mine in Guerrero, Mexico, Telson has re-commenced mining and processing operations with pre-production from mine development on a trial basis that commenced at an average 1,400 tonnes per day and is currently processing approximately 2,000 tonnes of mineralized development material per day during the recommissioning stage and intends to advance towards commercial production during 2018, increasing towards full capacity of approximately 2,500 tonnes per day. Telson's Tahuehueto Project, located in north-western Durango State, Mexico is currently in pre-production at approximately 135 tonnes per day utilizing a toll mill for processing and has entered a construction phase with a timeline to be producing on site in its own mineral processing plant capable of milling at least 1,000 tonnes per day in Q1, 2019. Regular metal concentrate delivery and sales are underway from both projects.\nVisit: www.telsonmining.com\nOn behalf of the board of directors\n(signed) “Ralph Shearing”\nRalph Shearing, P.Geol, President and Director\nQualified Persons\nThis press release was prepared under the supervision and review of Ralph Shearing, P.Geol., President and Director of Telson Mining Corporation, a Professional Geologist registered in Alberta as a member of the professional association APEGA, and a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Data verification by Mr. Shearing includes personal inspection of the Campo Morado mine site, reviewing mining facilities, drill core, underground development and discussing work programs and results with geology and mining personnel.\nCautionary Note Regarding Production Decisions and Forward-Looking Statements\nIt should be noted that Telson has commenced pre-production mining at Campo Morado without the benefit of pre-feasibility or feasibility studies that outline mineral reserves. Furthermore, it is likely that Telson will declare commercial production at Campo Morado prior to completing a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. Accordingly, readers should be cautioned that Telson’s production decision will likely be made without a comprehensive feasibility study of established reserves such that there is greater risk and uncertainty as to future economic results from the Campo Morado mine and a higher technical risk of failure than would be the case if a feasibility study was completed and relied upon to make a production decision. Telson has completed a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) mining study on the Campo Morado mine that provides a conceptual life of mine plan and a preliminary economic analysis based on the previously identified mineral resources (see News Release dated November 8, 2017 and April 4,2018). This will soon be replaced by a pre-feasibility study (“PFS”) that will allow the application of modifying factors to the mineral resources to allow a portion of them to be converted to mineral reserves; and will support the pre-production activities to bring the Campo Morado mine into commercial production.\nStatements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are “forward-looking information” or “forward-looking statements” (collectively, “Forward-Looking Information”) within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws. Forward Looking Information includes, but is not limited to, disclosure regarding possible events, conditions or financial performance that is based on assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action; the timing and costs of future activities on the Company’s properties, such as production rates and increases; success of exploration, development and bulk sample processing activities; timing for the restart of continuous mining operations at the Campo Morado Mine, and timing for processing at its own mineral processing facility on the Tahuehueto project site. In certain cases, Forward-Looking Information can be identified by the use of words and phrases such as “plans”, “expects”, “scheduled”, “estimates”, “forecasts”, “intends”, “anticipates” or variations of such words and phrases.
