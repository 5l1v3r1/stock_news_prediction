With the future of inter-Korean relations at stake and the U.S. pushing for the North to give up its nuclear weapons, here are key themes to watch in the discussions.\n1. Will the two Koreas make a statement on a peace agreement?\nBoth sides have long talked about replacing the armistice that ended hostilities in the Korean War with a peace treaty . Experts say that any more-permanent peace deal would need to involve the signatories of the 1953 armistice: North Korea, China and the United Nations, led by the U.S. during the war. Some analysts say the two Koreas might even talk about confederation—a loose political arrangement that would move toward unification while preserving the different systems on either side of the demilitarized zone.\n2. How will the U.S. figure in Friday’s talks?\nThe U.S. isn’t a party to the inter-Korean summit. But the U.S. presence on the Korean Peninsula—most notably the 28,500 troops it has stationed in the South —is likely to be on both sides’ minds. Many in Washington fear that talk of a peace treaty could be used as a pretext to call for a withdrawal of U.S. troops. The U.S. has been far more insistent than South Korea on the importance of persuading Pyongyang to give up its nuclear arsenal, rather than manage a nuclear-armed North.\n3. How much will North Korea’s nuclear arsenal feature in discussions?\nWhile the two Koreas have had advanced discussions on a more-permanent peace agreement and improving cross-border ties, South Korea’s presidential chief of staff declined Thursday to say how much progress the countries were expected to make on the question of the North’s nuclear program. Look for less of a definitive agreement between the two sides and more of a statement of principles that could set the tone for Mr. Kim’s planned meeting with Mr. Trump in the coming weeks.\n4. What topics other than North Korea’s nuclear weapons could be discussed?\nThe leaders may discuss resuming South Korean investment in North Korea. The two sides ran a joint industrial complex using South Korean capital and cheap North Korean labor until 2016, while North Korea operated a mountain resort that was open to South Korean tourists until 2008. Both were closed during periods of heightened tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear program. U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang would make renewing such economic cooperation difficult, but Messrs. Moon and Kim may discuss how Seoul’s capital can flow across the border without violating sanctions. The North is likely to seek cash from the South’s investments, while the South is likely to seek to reduce tensions, although critics say such programs would undermine global sanctions levied against the North.\n5. What about the body language between the two leaders?\nThis inter-Korean summit will be heavy on what political pundits call “optics.” Almost everything around the meeting, from the dinner menu to the diameter of the negotiating table, has been tailored to maximize the symbolic value. That puts a spotlight on how Messrs. Moon and Kim gel interpersonally. Mr. Kim, the third-generation ruler of North Korea , is roughly half the age of the 65-year-old Mr. Moon.\nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com and Andrew Jeong at andrew.jeong@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:21:21.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
