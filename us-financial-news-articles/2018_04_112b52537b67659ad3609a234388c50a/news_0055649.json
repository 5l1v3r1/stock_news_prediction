Therefore, attempts are being made to ease the pressure on both sides,” he added.\nRussian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov met U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week, the ministry said.\nRussia has a history of imposing quick bans on Western imports when it needs to send a strong response in conflicts with other countries. However, in this case the reaction is unusually slow in coming.\nRussian lawmakers drafted legislation in response to the U.S. sanctions that would give the authorities the power to ban or restrict imports of U.S. goods and services to Russia on April 13. The first reading is planned on May 15.\nRussia is not in a hurry to approve this law also because it cannot allow itself a tough response ahead of the World Cup it is hosting this summer and because restrictions on U.S. imports could hit its domestic industries, said a source familiar with the discussions of the draft.\n“But this (law) in any case is a gun which will be hanging on the wall and can shoot someday,” the source said.\nUNPOPULAR IDEA OF NATIONALISATION Washington said on Monday it would consider lifting the sanctions if Deripaska, who along with the company was included on a U.S. sanctions list on April 6, ceded control of Rusal.\nHowever, Deripaska wants to keep his assets, the source at the finance ministry said, adding that nobody in government likes the idea of nationalisation.\nThe Kremlin is unlikely to favour a scenario whereby Washington tells it who must own what in Russia, said a source who knows Deripaska.\n“Plus, the situation is not easy for Deripaska, no one likes it when someone is talking to him from a position of strength,” the source added.\nRussian industry minister Denis Manturov said on Tuesday that he would not rule out the possibility of the state buying a stake in Rusal from Deripaska, but there had been no detailed discussion on the subject yet.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that neither Macron nor Merkel had discussed their efforts to secure an easing of sanctions with Putin.\nHowever, “it is known that many business structures and legal entities, including from Europe, are actively raising this subject with the governments of their countries,” he added.\nThe coordinated European effort to alleviate the impact the sanctions could have on their own companies includes France, Germany, Italy and Ireland, French sources said on Monday, adding that American officials had offered a sympathetic ear.\nEU aluminium consumers are concerned because Europe is Rusal’s largest market with 42 percent of the company’s products sold there in 2017. The sanctions also damaged Rusal’s overseas supply chain, smelters and refineries, partly based in Europe.\nRESCUE PACKAGE If Rusal is allowed to keep its European market, Russia’s retaliatory measures on U.S. companies are likely to be modest and the government would be able to focus on restructuring the company’s loans, the source at the finance ministry said.\nHelp with loans is likely to be needed because while the United States on Monday extended the license allowing continued business relations with Rusal from June 5 to Oct. 23, another license restricting financing operations was unaltered and will expire on May 7.\nRussian companies hit by U.S. sanctions have asked for 100 billion roubles ($1.6 billion) in liquidity support from the government, Siluanov said last week.\nThe current plan is to use Promsvyazbank, a lender earmarked by the government to provide credit to sanctioned entities so that other lenders can offload the risk, to solve the short-term liquidity problems for Rusal, the finance ministry source said.\nIn the longer term, the rescue package may include the creation of offshore zones in the Russian cities of Kaliningrad and Vladivostok which would provide sanctions-hit companies registered there with corporate confidentiality, the source added.\nIn a sign that support from state banks was being prepared, Russia’s central bank on Monday decided to permit Russian banks not to raise risk levels when assessing the creditworthiness of companies sanctioned by foreign countries.\nRusal’s foreign creditors were not on the government’s agenda for now because Moscow was focused on securing aluminium supplies to Europe, the source added.
