But the day after we announced the boycott, KAIST gave assurances very publicly and very clearly,” he said.\nRepresentatives from more than 120 U.N. countries are meeting in Geneva on Monday to debate the challenges posed by lethal autonomous weapons, dubbed “killer robots” by critics.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T14:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:17:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
