Up 3-0, down 3-0 you know what the Spurs are going to do.”\nAldridge’s critical 3-pointer came after the Warriors had rallied within 88-86 on a Durant 3-pointer with 5:57 to play.\nAfter Ginobili hit a pair of free throws to increase the San Antonio lead to four, Aldridge was able to connect on his unconventional 25-footer from straight away despite tight defense from Green for a 93-86 advantage.\nThe Warriors, who had swept the Spurs in the Western Conference finals last season, were never closer than five the rest of the way.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:24:46.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
