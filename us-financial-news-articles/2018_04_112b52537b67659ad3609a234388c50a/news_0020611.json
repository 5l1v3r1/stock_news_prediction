Poindexter & Co., Inc. (the 'Company'), today announced that it intends to offer $300 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the '2026 Notes') in a private offering.

The Company issued a conditional notice of redemption (the 'Conditional Notice') to redeem the 2022 Notes on April 12, 2018 (as it may be delayed from time to time in accordance with the Conditional Notice, the \"Redemption Date\"). On April 11, 2018, the Company announced that the conditions of the redemption of the 2022 Notes would not be satisfied or waived by the Company on or prior to the initial Redemption Date.
