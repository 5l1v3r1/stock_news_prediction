REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach The STOXX 600 held near one-month highs, ending the day up 0.1 percent.\nGermany's DAX .GDAXI , highly sensitive to trade and China, gained 0.2 percent after U.S. President Trump made comments indicating he would want to avoid a Sino-U.S. trade war and rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact.\n“Markets have given cautious welcome to this news. Welcome, because avoiding a trade war is a clear economic positive. Cautious, because market trust in U.S. presidential announcements is, perhaps, a little limited,” said UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan.\nEuropean shares sealed their third straight week of gains, their longest winning streak since January.\nInvestors have begun to shrug off geopolitical concerns to focus instead on a results season expected to support equity markets.\nMuch-anticipated results from JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) disappointed, however, sending U.S. stocks lower and weighing on European markets.
