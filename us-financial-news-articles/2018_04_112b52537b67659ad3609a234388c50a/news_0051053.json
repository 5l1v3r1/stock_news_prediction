(NASDAQ:MMSI), a leading manufacturer and marketer of proprietary disposable devices used in interventional, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, particularly in cardiology, radiology, oncology, critical care and endoscopy, today announced revenue of $203.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 18.7% over revenue of $171.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On a comparable, constant currency basis, revenue for the first quarter of 2018 would have been up 15.7% over revenue for the comparable quarter of 2017.\nMerit’s GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.3 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to $14.8 million, or $0.32 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2017 included a preliminary bargain purchase gain of approximately $12.2 million, or $0.27 per share pre-tax, which Merit recognized as a result of its acquisition of the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc. Furthermore, Merit's average diluted common shares outstanding increased by approximately six million shares (or 13%) from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018, largely due to Merit's equity offering completed during March 2017. Merit’s non-GAAP net income* for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $15.9 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to $12.7 million, or $0.28 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nMerit’s revenue by category for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the corresponding quarter in 2017, was as follows:\nThree Months Ended March 31, % Change 2018 2017 Cardiovascular Stand-alone devices 30.8 % $ 83,246 $ 63,653 Custom kits and procedure trays 15.2 % 33,272 28,874 Inflation devices 21.1 % 22,419 18,507 Catheters 12.2 % 33,865 30,176 Embolization devices 0.5 % 12,587 12,527 CRM/EP (5.0 )% 10,466 11,017 Total 18.9 % 195,855 164,754 Endoscopy Endoscopy devices 13.7 % 7,180 6,315 Grand Total 18.7 % $ 203,035 $ 171,069 Note: Certain revenue categories for 2017 have been adjusted from prior disclosures to reflect changes in product classifications to be consistent with updates in Merit's management of its product portfolios during 2018.\n\"The first quarter of 2018 was an extraordinarily active quarter in all aspects of our business,” said Fred P. Lampropoulos, Merit’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We closed the BD transaction and initiated order to cash activities in the U.S., Latin America and Canada. The production transition is on schedule. Merit teams of transition specialists activated customer uploads, inventory and logistical transfer and are planning for future production transfers.”\n“Cleanrooms in our Tijuana facility are nearing completion, and equipment acquisition and training activities have commenced,” Lampropoulos said.\n“In addition to all the activities involving the BD transaction, sales were robust in the first quarter,” Lampropoulos said. “The products we acquired from Laurane Medical last year have been transferred for production to our Galway, Ireland facility and are scheduled to launch in the second quarter,” Lampropoulos continued. “Because of restrained capacity, new sales activities had been controlled to meet existing demand. New capacity is now on line, and stock is being prepared for full release.”\n“During the first quarter, Merit received 510(k) clearances for the Prelude IDeal™ Hydrophilic Sheath Introducer and PreludeSYNC™ Distal Access Device (\"Snuff Box\") as well as the Merit Pursue™ Microcatheter,” Lampropoulos said. “Recently we entered into a long-term agreement with NinePoint Medical to become the exclusive worldwide distributor for the NvisionVLE® Imaging System with Real-time Targeting™ using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). We believe this product line will enhance the product offerings of our Endotek Division and will be another step to adding therapy and disease-state products to our accessories. Although the products have both 510(k) and CE mark clearances, sales have been limited to the United States due to resource limitations. Merit plans to launch these globally on a measured basis, which we anticipate will strengthen our global Endotek expansion.”\n“We are off to a good start with a full pipeline of new products and opportunities as well as continued focus on the goals and objectives we have committed to our shareholders,” Lampropoulos said.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nMerit will hold its investor conference call (conference ID 8799557) today, Wednesday, April 25, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (4:00 p.m. Central, 3:00 p.m. Mountain, and 2:00 p.m. Pacific).

Non-GAAP financial measures used in this release include:\nconstant currency revenue; core revenue; core revenue on a constant currency basis; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP net income; and non-GAAP earnings per share.\nMerit’s management team uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Merit’s profitability and efficiency, to compare operating results to prior periods, to evaluate changes in the operating results of its operating segments, and to measure and allocate financial resources internally. However, Merit’s management does not consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nReaders should consider non-GAAP measures used in this release in addition to, not as a substitute for, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures generally exclude some, but not all, items that may affect Merit's net income. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which items are excluded. Merit believes it is useful to exclude such items in the calculation of non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP net income (in each case, as further illustrated in the reconciliation table below) because such amounts in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of Merit’s business operations and can vary significantly between periods as a result of factors such as new acquisitions, non-cash expenses related to amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, unusual compensation expenses or expenses resulting from litigation, governmental proceedings or changes in tax regulations. Merit may incur similar types of expenses in the future, and the non-GAAP financial information included in this release should not be viewed as a statement or indication that these types of expenses will not recur. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release may not be comparable with similarly titled measures of other companies. Merit urges investors and potential investors to review the reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Merit’s business or results of operations.\nConstant Currency Revenue\nMerit’s revenue on a constant currency basis is prepared by translating the current-period reported revenue of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar at the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect during the comparable prior-year period. The constant currency revenue adjustment of $(5.2) million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nCore Revenue and Core Revenue on a Constant Currency Basis\nMerit’s core revenue is defined as reported revenue excluding revenues from the acquisitions of the assets of Catheter Connections, Inc. in January 2017 (excluded January 2018 only), the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc. in January 2017 (excluded January 2018 only), Osseon LLC in July 2017, Laurane Medical S.A.S. in August 2017, ITL Healthcare Pty. Ltd. in October 2017 and certain divested assets of Becton, Dickinson and Company in February 2018. Core revenue on a constant currency basis is defined as core revenue (as described in the preceding sentence) plus the foreign exchange impact related to those core sales, using the applicable foreign exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior-year periods presented.\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nNon-GAAP gross margin is calculated by reducing GAAP cost of sales by amounts recorded for amortization of intangible assets and inventory mark-up related to acquisitions.\nNon-GAAP Net Income\nNon-GAAP net income is calculated by adjusting GAAP net income for certain items which are deemed by Merit’s management to be outside of core operations and vary in amount and frequency among periods, such as expenses related to new acquisitions, non-cash expenses related to amortization of previously acquired tangible and intangible assets, unusual compensation expenses or expenses resulting from litigation, governmental proceedings or changes in tax regulations, as well as other items set forth in the table below.\nNon-GAAP EPS\nNon-GAAP EPS is defined as non-GAAP net income divided by the diluted shares outstanding for the corresponding period.\nOther Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliation\nThe following table sets forth supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP earnings per share to Merit’s net income and earnings per share prepared in accordance with GAAP for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. The non-GAAP income adjustments referenced in the following table do not reflect stock-based compensation expense of approximately $1.3 million and $0.6 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (Unaudited, in thousands except per share amounts) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income $ 6,359 $ (1,090 ) $ 5,269 $ 0.10 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 6,463 (1,606 ) 4,857 0.10 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 1,873 (481 ) 1,392 0.03 Operating Expenses Acquisition-related (b) 1,970 (506 ) 1,464 0.03 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) 40 (10 ) 30 — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 56 (14 ) 42 — Amortization of intangibles 2,000 (532 ) 1,468 0.03 Special legal expense (e) 1,691 (435 ) 1,256 0.02 Other (Income) Expense Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 201 (52 ) 149 — Non-GAAP net income $ 20,653 $ (4,726 ) $ 15,927 $ 0.31 Diluted shares 51,910 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Pre-Tax Tax Impact (a) After-Tax Per Share Impact GAAP net income 15,493 (690 ) 14,803 0.32 Non-GAAP adjustments: Cost of Sales Amortization of intangibles 4,826 (1,805 ) 3,021 0.07 Inventory mark-up related to acquisitions 1,893 (736 ) 1,157 0.03 Operating Expenses Severance 1,216 (473 ) 743 0.02 Acquisition-related (b) 1,552 (282 ) 1,270 0.03 Fair value adjustment to contingent consideration (c) 37 (15 ) 22 — Long-term asset impairment charge (d) 18 (7 ) 11 — Amortization of intangibles 1,343 (518 ) 825 0.02 Special legal expense (e) 4,840 (1,883 ) 2,957 0.06 Other (Income) Expense Gain on bargain purchase (f) (12,243 ) — (12,243 ) (0.27 ) Amortization of long-term debt issuance costs 172 (67 ) 105 — Non-GAAP net income 19,147 (6,476 ) 12,671 0.28 Diluted shares 45,820 (a) Reflects the tax effect associated with pre-tax income and the non-GAAP adjustments.\n(b) Represents transaction costs related to acquisitions.\n(c) Represents changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and contingent receivables as a result of acquisitions.\n(d) Represents abandoned patents.\n(e) Costs incurred in responding to an inquiry from the U.S. Department of Justice.\n(f) Represents the gain on bargain purchase realized from the acquisition of the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc.\nReconciliation of Reported Revenue to Core Revenue (Non-GAAP), Constant Currency Revenue (Non-GAAP), and Core Revenue on a Constant Currency Basis (Non-GAAP) (Unaudited, in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, % Change 2018 2017 Reported Revenue 18.7 % $ 203,035 $ 171,069 Add: Impact of foreign exchange (a) (5,154 ) — Constant Currency Revenue 15.7 % $ 197,881 $ 171,069 Three Months Ended March 31, % Change 2018 2017 Reported Revenue 18.7 % $ 203,035 $ 171,069 Less: Revenue from certain acquisitions (b) (14,635 ) — Core Revenue 10.1 % $ 188,400 $ 171,069 Add: Impact of foreign exchange on core revenue (a) (5,154 ) — Core Revenue on a Constant Currency Basis 7.1 % $ 183,246 $ 171,069 (a) The constant currency revenue adjustment of $(5.2) million to reported revenue and to core revenue, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was calculated using the applicable average foreign exchange rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n(b) Represents revenue from the acquisitions of the assets of Catheter Connections, Inc. in January 2017 (excluded January 2018 only); the critical care division of Argon Medical Devices, Inc. in January 2017 (excluded January 2018 only); Osseon LLC in July 2017; Laurane Medical S.A.S. in August 2017; ITL Healthcare Pty.
