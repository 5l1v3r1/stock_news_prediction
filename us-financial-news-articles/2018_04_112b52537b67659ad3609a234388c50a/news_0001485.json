He has said he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter.\n“It is clear that our father was not endorsing alternatives to demolition,” the siblings said in a joint statement on Facebook. “The Committee’s statement does not accurately represent Lee Kuan Yew’s wishes.”\nThe feud over the home gripped Singapore for at least a month last year, and included accusations by the prime minister’s siblings that he was prepared to use the organs of the state against them. The accusations were denied by the prime minister.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku Writing by John Geddie Edited by Martin Howell\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:19:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
