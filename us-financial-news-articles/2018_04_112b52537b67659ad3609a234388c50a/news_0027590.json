The operations were coordinated between the Interior Ministry, prosecutors and CICIG investigators.\nOne person involved in the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Interior Ministry and police were the focus of a probe into the leaks.\nOne prosecutor said there is evidence that the information may have been leaked through an electronic system that holds the arrest warrants.\nInterior Minister Enrique Degenhart said he had ordered an investigation into the incident.\n(This version of the story corrects second paragraph to say that CICIG has helped send dozens to jail since 2015, not that since CICIG began working in the country in 2015, Guatemala has sent dozens to prison)\nReporting by Sofia Menchu; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T06:31:44.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
