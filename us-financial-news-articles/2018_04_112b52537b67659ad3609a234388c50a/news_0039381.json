I would agree with that as an initial assessment of the initial loss of jobs in wholesale banking and I would also concur with Sam in that a loss of jobs may be wrong,” Jones said.\n“They may be new jobs created in continental Europe, without necessarily displacing jobs here. But banks need to efficient and the idea of duplication is unlikely to be sustainable. So I fear eventually we are talking about a loss of jobs,” Jones added.\nFRAMEWORK Britain and the EU have secured a “standstill” transition deal lasting from Brexit Day to the end of 2020, but is not due to be ratified until at October as part of a broader divorce settlement, meaning it has no legal certainty until then.\nAndrew Bailey, Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the committee it does not provide the necessary certainty to “reset” the planning assumption that all Brexit related changes by banks must be done by next March.\nMeanwhile, there was a need to start work on technical solutions for issues like ensuring that derivatives and insurance contracts are still enforceable during the transition period, and not lose time by waiting until transition is ratified, Bailey said.\n“What that requires is for the EU authorities to engage. We are ready to go. We have done a lot of work on this,” Bailey said.\n“My strong preference would be we start now to put together the agreed ways of tackling these issues,” Bailey added.\nA framework on future relations in financial services could be agreed this year, Bailey said. It would need a mechanism to resolve disputes over financial rules.\nReporting by Huw Jones and Andrew MacAskill Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:11:21.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
