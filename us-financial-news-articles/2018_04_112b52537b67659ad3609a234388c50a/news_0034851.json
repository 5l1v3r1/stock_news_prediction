But access to long-term funds in local currency has been a major hurdle. \nLong-term naira financing is scarce in Nigeria. In 2013, when the country was seen as an attractive investment prospect, several firms took out dollar loans to expand. \nThe new Nigerian bank - modelled on Germany’s KfW - will lend to local commercial banks and micro-finance institutions that will in turn make loans to small firms, helping to boost economic growth and jobs. \nDBN, headed by a former Ecobank executive, plans to grant loans with up to 12 years’ maturity, longer than usual for the West African country, to enable the financing of new projects that would not be viable with short-term funds and in dollars. \nThe Nigerian bank estimates that only five percent of 37 million entrepreneurs and small firms in Nigeria have access to credit from the traditional financial system, despite the sector contributing half of the country’s output. \nIt said other institutions such as the World Bank, Germany’s KfW and the French development agency would also support the Nigerian bank alongside the government.
