Its distinctive hairdo is actually algae that grow on its head. \nAcademic research was hampered in 1974 when traders refused to reveal the habitat of what were then known as “Penny Turtles” after Australia outlawed the practice of keeping them as pets. \nNearly 20 years later, John Cann, a Sydney-based turtle enthusiast, rediscovered the turtle in the Mary River in Queensland. It was classified as a new species. \nThe turtle’s habitat is not fully protected, Cann said, and the introduction of new fish species to the waterway also threatened juvenile turtles. \n“They survived in good numbers for millions of years,” Cann said. “Then along came the pigs and foxes, and on top of the native predators and people - that’s what has made them endangered.” Reporting by Colin Packham; Editing by Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T11:43:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
