At the hearing, she said vendors remain in a \"dire\" situation even after laying off employees and closing stores.\nMore than a dozen executives, specialists and lawyers have told Reuters that many small vendors are at risk of bankruptcy due to the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us in the United States.\nIn a court filing late Monday, Morabito said that absent a more comprehensive settlement, the group's members and other vendors will likely pursue litigation \"against the persons or entities responsible for the severe losses suffered.\"\nBoth Morabito's group and an official committee of unsecured creditors are pushing for reserve funds to be paid on a pro rata basis.\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Keith Phillips approved the proposed wind-down budget at the hearing.\nPhillips also authorized the sale of Toys 'R' Canada to Toronto-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd for $237 million. The company has said it is in talks over the sale of its Asian and Central European businesses.
