Benchmark Brent crude futures trade at around $74 a barrel.\nTullow is still considering how to divvy up that money between paying down its $3.4 billion debt pile, investing in assets or shareholder returns.\n“We’re considering ... whether we’d use any of that oil incremental free cash flow to accelerate drilling in Ghana. We’ve not come to a conclusion on that,” Wood said. “That would really be accelerating production and cash flow particularly in 2019, more so than 2018.” (Reporting by Shadia Nasralla, editing by Louise Heavens)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:13:43.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
