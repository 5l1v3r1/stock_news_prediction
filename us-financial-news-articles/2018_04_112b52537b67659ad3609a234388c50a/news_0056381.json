By using these technologies, Kingo is creating the largest clean energy user base in history, empowering 500 million people by 2035.\nAbout Kingo:\nKingo was founded in Guatemala in 2013 by Juan Fermín Rodriguez, Matias de Tezanos (CEO of PeopleFund ), Alvaro Rodriguez, and Peter Kasprowicz, four entrepreneurs looking to improve human lives by providing clean, safe, off-grid electricity at a lower cost than existing alternatives. The Company's executive team includes experts in mass consumer markets, telecommunications, software, and energy.\nSince its founding, Kingo has raised $25.0 Million in several equity and debt rounds lead by prominent investors and institutions including the global pioneer in value added investments ( PeopleFund ), the largest utility in Europe ( ENGIE Rassembleurs d'Energies ), and the innovation fund of one of the largest utilities in Latin America ( FCP , from EPM). Kingo has also raised funds from the Dutch Development Bank ( FMO ), the French Development Bank ( Proparco ) and the Inter-American Development Bank ( IDB ); all of whom are looking to provide significant funding over the next years for Kingo's global expansion and technology developments. Other key partners include Leonardo DiCaprio , who has joined the Company as an investor and advisor. Kingo has also partnered with award-winning agency network Ogilvy & Mather , through its Colombia & Guatemala offices, to launch Kingo's traction and vision to the world.\nKingo delivers its prepaid energy service using robust and intelligent proprietary technology.
