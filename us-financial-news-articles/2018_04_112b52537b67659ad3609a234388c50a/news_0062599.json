Altuve’s squeeze bunt capped a two-run third inning that put Houston on top 2-1.\nCahill allowed four runs (three earned) and four hits in six-plus innings. He walked one and struck out five.\nLucroy doubled home Oakland’s first run in the third inning, scored the second run on a Jed Lowrie single in the fifth and tied the game at 3-3 with a single that scored Stephen Piscotty in the seventh. He finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs.\nGerrit Cole worked 6 2/3 innings, allowing three runs and six hits. He struck out 12 and did not walk a batter. The 12 strikeouts were two shy of the career-best 14 he had earlier this month against Texas.\nSpringer and Gonzalez had two hits apiece for the Astros, who won for the ninth time in their last 12 games. Springer and Altuve drove in two runs apiece.\nChad Pinder, who earlier had doubled and scored on Lucroy’s third-inning double, completed the scoring with a two-out, solo homer, his third of the season, in the ninth.\n—Field Level Media", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:21:59.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
