(NYSE: CMG) today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOverview for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017:\nRevenue increased 7.4% to $1.1 billion Comparable restaurant sales increased 2.2% (net of 50 basis points related to Chiptopia revenue deferral from 2017) Restaurant level operating margin increased to 19.5% from 17.7% Net income was $59.4 million, an increase from $46.1 million Diluted earnings per share was $2.13, a 33.1% increase from $1.60 Opened 35 new restaurants and closed 2 restaurants\n\"Chipotle is a purpose driven brand with loyal customers, passionate employees, industry-leading economic potential, along with incredible brand equity, and craveable food with integrity, all built over the last 25 years,\" said Brian Niccol, chief executive officer. \"While the company made notable progress during the quarter, I firmly believe we can accelerate that progress in the future. We are in the process of forming a path to greater performance in sales, transactions, margins and new restaurants. This path to performance will be grounded in a strategy of executing the fundamentals while introducing consumer-meaningful innovation across the business. It will also require a structure and organization built for creativity, action and accountability. Finally, Chipotle will have a culture that is centered on running great restaurants, putting the customer first, innovating for today and tomorrow, supporting each other, and delivering on commitments. The future will be meaningful at Chipotle.\"\nResults for the three months ended March 31, 2018\nRevenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 7.4% from the first quarter of 2017. The increase in revenue was driven by new restaurant openings and to a lesser extent from an increase in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales increases were attributable to an increase in average check, including a 4.9% benefit from menu price increases that have been taken in almost all our restaurants over the past twelve months, partially offset by fewer transactions in our restaurants. We opened 35 new restaurants during the quarter, and closed two restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 2,441.\nFood costs were 32.4% of revenue, a decrease of 140 basis points as compared to the first quarter of 2017. The benefit from menu price increases and decreased paper cost and usage were partially offset by higher costs associated with preservative-free tortillas.\nRestaurant level operating margin was 19.5% in the first quarter of 2018, a 180 basis point improvement from 17.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement was driven by lower marketing and promotional expense, and comparable restaurant sales increases, partially offset by wage inflation at the crew and manager level.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were 6.7% of revenue for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 20 basis points over the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to increased headcount and higher bonus expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures of stock during the quarter and making our annual stock grant later in the quarter than we did in the first quarter of 2017.\nOur effective tax rate was 36.9% for the first quarter of 2018, which includes 810 basis points related to discrete items in the first quarter, including 700 basis points for the write-off of deferred tax assets related to prior years' equity grants, which either expired without vesting, or vested at a lower value.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $59.4 million, or $2.13 per diluted share, compared to net income of $46.1 million, or $1.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. ï»¿\nOur Board of Directors has also approved the investment of up to an additional $100 million, exclusive of commissions, to repurchase shares of our common stock. This repurchase authorization, in addition to up to approximately $50.2 million available as of March 31, 2018 for repurchases under a previously announced repurchase authorization, may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, management expects:\nComparable restaurant sales increases in the low-single digits 130 to 150 new restaurant openings An estimated effective full year tax rate of approximately 32.5% - 33.5%, with quarterly tax rates of around 29% in the second and third quarters and up to as high as 38.5% in the fourth quarter as a result of an additional anticipated write-off of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation awards.\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\nComparable restaurant sales, or sales comps, represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants in operation for at least 13 full calendar months.\nRestaurant level operating margin represents total revenue less restaurant operating costs, expressed as a percent of total revenue.\nConference Call\nChipotle will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results on Wednesday, April 25, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern time.\nThe conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing 1-877-451-6152 or for international callers by dialing 1-201-389-0879. The call will be webcast live from the company's website at chipotle.com under the investor relations section. An archived webcast will be available approximately one hour after the end of the call.\nAbout Chipotle\nSteve Ells, founder and executive chairman, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get exactly what they want. Chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, the land, and the people who produce them. Chipotle prepares its food using real, wholesome ingredients and without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in Denver in 1993 and as of March 31, 2018, operated more than 2,400 restaurants.
