(NYSE: SXCP) today reported results for the first quarter 2018, which reflect solid operating results across SXCP's coke and logistics businesses.\n\"We continue to execute against our objectives and our solid first quarter performance was a testament to that focus. We remain on pace to achieve our full-year Adjusted EBITDA guidance,\" said Mike Rippey, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P.\nAdditionally, SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. today announced its first quarter distribution of $0.40 per unit, which was a reduction from the $0.5940 per unit fourth quarter distribution.\nRippey continued, \"Maintaining the distribution at this reduced level will allow us to further pay down debt and reach our stated leverage target of at or below 3.5x debt to EBITDA by the end of 2019. It will provide the desired cushion for our revolving credit facility's leverage covenant, which steps-down to 4.0x in June 2020, while also increasing SXCP's financial flexibility and driving long-term unitholder value.\"\nFIRST QUARTER RESULTS\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nRevenues\n$\n214.8\n$\n195.6\n$\n19.2\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n49.5\n$\n51.7\n$\n(2.2)\nNet income (loss) attributable to SXCP\n$\n12.2\n$\n(129.3)\n$\n141.5\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\nRevenues in first quarter 2018 increased $19.2 million from the prior year period, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter decreased $2.2 million, as a result the timing of planned outage and maintenance costs in our Domestic Coke segment.\nNet income attributable to SXCP in the first quarter 2018 was $12.2 million, up $141.5 million versus the same prior year period. The improvement was driven by the absence of the $145.6 million of deferred tax expense attributable to SXCP recorded in the prior year period related to the change in the qualifying income regulations finalized by the internal revenue service. This favorable impact was partially offset by lower operating results discussed above as well as higher interest expense as a result of the 2017 debt refinancing activities.\nFIRST QUARTER SEGMENT INFORMATION\nDomestic Coke\nDomestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Haverhill, Middletown and Granite City cokemaking facilities, located in Franklin Furnace and Middletown, Ohio, and Granite City, Illinois, respectively.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nRevenues\n$\n190.0\n$\n173.2\n$\n16.8\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n40.3\n$\n42.5\n$\n(2.2)\nSales Volume (thousands of tons)\n568\n564\n4\nAdjusted EBITDA per ton (2)\n$\n70.95\n$\n75.35\n$\n(4.40)\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects Domestic Coke Adjusted EBITDA divided by Domestic Coke sales volumes.\nRevenues increased $16.8 million, primarily reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices. Adjusted EBITDA decreased $2.2 million, driven by timing of planned outage and maintenance costs as well as higher coal moisture from adverse weather and logistics conditions resulting in lower production and energy revenue at our Granite City facility.\nLogistics\nLogistics consists of the handling and mixing services of coal and other aggregates operated by SXCP at our Convent Marine Terminal (\"CMT\"), Lake Terminal and Kanawha River Terminals (\"KRT\").\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(Dollars in millions, except per ton amounts)\n2018\n2017\nIncrease/\n(Decrease)\nRevenues\n$\n24.8\n$\n22.4\n$\n2.4\nIntersegment sales\n$\n1.7\n$\n1.8\n$\n(0.1)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n13.4\n$\n13.0\n$\n0.4\nTons handled (thousands of tons) (2)\n5,531\n5,449\n82\nCMT take-or-pay shortfall tons (thousands of tons) (3)\n172\n544\n(372)\n(1)\nSee definition of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation elsewhere in this release.\n(2)\nReflects inbound tons handled during the period.\n(3)\nReflects tons billed under take-or-pay contracts where services have not yet been performed.\nRevenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively, driven primarily by record sales volumes at CMT as well as an increase in rate on CMT take-or-pay tons in the current year period. This benefit was mostly offset by increased costs at CMT and loss of business at KRT resulting from near historic water levels during the first quarter 2018.\nCorporate and Other\nCorporate and other expenses increased by $0.4 million to $4.2 million, driven primarily by unfavorable period-over-period mark-to-market adjustments in deferred compensation caused by changes in the Partnership's unit price.\n2018 OUTLOOK\nOur 2018 guidance is as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP is expected to be between $215 to $225 million Distributable Cash Flow expect to be between $122 to $132 million Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $61 million, including approximately $35 million related to our Granite City gas sharing project\nRELATED COMMUNICATIONS\nWe will host our quarterly earnings call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time) today.

(NYSE: SXCP) is a publicly traded master limited partnership that manufactures high-quality coke used in the blast furnace production of steel and provides export and domestic material handling services to coke, coal, steel, power and other bulk and liquids customers. In our cokemaking business, we utilize an innovative heat-recovery technology that captures excess heat for steam or electrical power generation and have long-term, take-or-pay coke contracts that pass through commodity and certain operating costs. Our logistics terminals have the collective capacity to mix and transload more than 40 million tons of material each year and are strategically located to reach Gulf Coast, East Coast, Great Lakes and international ports. SXCP's General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE: SXC), which has approximately 55 years of cokemaking experience serving the integrated steel industry. To learn more about SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., visit our website at www.suncoke.com .\nDEFINITIONS\nAdjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), adjusted for any loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt and/or changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered an alternative to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Partnership's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXCP equals Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. Distributable Cash Flow equals Adjusted EBITDA plus sponsor support and Logistics deferred revenue, less net cash paid for interest expense, ongoing capital expenditures, accruals for replacement capital expenditures, and cash distributions to noncontrolling interests; plus amounts received under the Omnibus Agreement and acquisition expenses deemed to be Expansion Capital under our Partnership Agreement. Distributable Cash Flow is a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that management and external users of SXCP's financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies use to assess: SXCP's operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to historical cost basis; the ability of SXCP's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to SXCP's unitholders; SXCP's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that Distributable Cash Flow provides useful information to investors in assessing SXCP's financial condition and results of operations. Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Distributable Cash Flow has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and used in investing activities. Additionally, because Distributable Cash Flow may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, our definition of Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nDistributable Cash Flow Coverage Ratio equals Distributable Cash Flow divided by estimated distributions to the limited and general partners. Operating Cash Flow Coverage Ratio equals net cash provided by operating activities divided by total estimated distributions to the limited and general partners. Operating cash flow is generally expected to be higher than Distributable Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow is further reduced by certain cash reserves including capital expenditures, an investing cash flow item. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow represents only the Partnership's share of available cash by excluding Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interest, while operating cash flow is reported on a consolidated basis. Ongoing capital expenditures (\"capex\") are capital expenditures made to maintain the existing operating capacity of our assets and/or to extend their useful lives. Ongoing capex also includes new equipment that improves the efficiency, reliability or effectiveness of existing assets. Ongoing capex does not include normal repairs and maintenance, which are expensed as incurred, or significant capital expenditures. For purposes of calculating distributable cash flow, the portion of ongoing capex attributable to SXCP is used. Replacement capital expenditures (\"capex\") represents an annual accrual necessary to fund SXCP's share of the estimated costs to replace or rebuild our facilities at the end of their working lives. This accrual is estimated based on the average quarterly anticipated replacement capital that we expect to incur over the long term to replace our major capital assets at the end of their working lives. The replacement capex accrual estimate will be subject to review and prospective change by SXCP's general partner at least annually and whenever an event occurs that causes a material adjustment of replacement capex, provided such change is approved by our conflicts committee.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nSome of the statements included in this press release constitute \" \" Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of such words as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should\" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.
