Police spokesman John Bulalacao said he would not respond until he had received a copy of the court order.\nThe move comes just a few months after the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced it had started a preliminary examination of a complaint filed by a Philippine lawyer accusing Duterte and top officials of crimes against humanity.\nDuterte has since withdrawn the Philippines’ membership of the court in protest, even though it has no impact on the ICC’s jurisdiction, which applies for the period in which a country was a member.\nAbout 4,100 people have been killed by police and several thousand more by unknown gunmen whom the authorities have described as vigilantes, or rival gang members.\nPolice deny allegations they have murdered people involved in drugs and say those killed were all dealers who violently resisted arrest.\nSupreme Court acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio told Calida to submit names, addresses and gender of those killed in police operations, and other drug-related deaths.\nCarpio demanded details of each deadly anti-drug operation, the police and witnesses involved and copies of warrants against suspects who were killed.\nThe order covers drug-related deaths from July 2016 until November 2017, when two complainants, including a group of Manila slum dwellers, petitioned the court to make the details publicly available.\nHuman rights lawyer Edre Olalia said the government must comply with the court order and follow the law.\n“It’s about time the government should take responsibility and, if so proven, liability for playing God in the snuffing of lives,” he said.\nReporting by Manuel Mogato; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:41:02.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
