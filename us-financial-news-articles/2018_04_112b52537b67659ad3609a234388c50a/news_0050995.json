I am putting things right.”\nPester also said the bank’s customers would not be charged any overdraft fees for the month of April.\n“I’m very aware that many customers may have used their overdraft in April more than they would have expected to. There will be no overdraft fees or any overdraft charges for any of our customers through April,” he said.\nThe bank had been running on an IT system effectively rented from former parent Lloyds Banking Group, costing TSB hundreds of millions of pounds a year since its takeover by Spain’s Banco Sabadell in 2015.\nTSB on Thursday reported a 2.3 percent rise in first-quarter operating costs to 207.5 million pounds ($289.32 million), primarily due to an increase in these fees.\nProfit before tax fell 39.3 percent to 19.3 million pounds, which it said was due to temporary movements in hedging arrangements.\n$1 = 0.7172 pounds Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Kate Holton and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T10:56:48.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
