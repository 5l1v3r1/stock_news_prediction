VietJet added 17 new aircraft last year to boost its fleet to 51 planes.\nVietJet said on Thursday it expected pre-tax profit to rise to 5.8 trillion dong this year, up 9.4 percent from 2017. It also targeted a 20.5 percent rise in revenue to 50.97 trillion dong from a year earlier.\nIts state-owned rival, Vietnam Airlines, said on Thursday its pre-tax profit jumped 71 percent in the first quarter as growth on domestic and international routes exceeded its forecasts.\nPre-tax profit during the January-March quarter rose to 1.46 trillion dong ($64.13 million), the airline said in a statement, up from 854 billion dong in the same period a year earlier.\nVietnam Airlines said it carried five million passengers in the quarter, up five percent from the same period last year.\n“Demand remains high in Northeast Asian markets (Japan, South Korea), together with the implementation of market-driven solutions in the condition of high fuel prices,” the airline said, adding it will take delivery of its 12th Airbus A350 in the second quarter.\nVietnam Airlines could launch non-stop flights to the United States in 2019, Chief Executive Officer Duong Tri Thanh said in February, but it would struggle to be profitable on U.S. routes due to the lack of business travellers.
