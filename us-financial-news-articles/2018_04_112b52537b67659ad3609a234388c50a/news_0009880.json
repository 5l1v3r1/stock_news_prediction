REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin \nNajib is under pressure to deliver an emphatic win for the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, as he struggles to appease Malaysians unhappy with rising costs and a multi-billion dollar scandal at a state fund he founded. \nThe 64-year-old leader is expected to retain power due to a rift in opposition ranks between Mahathir’s bloc and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party. \nBut analysts predict a tough fight from Mahathir, who transformed Malaysia into an industrial nation from a rural backwater during his iron-fisted 22-year rule until 2003. \nThe opposition says the election will be unfair. \nIn recent days, parliament approved plans to redraw electoral boundaries and passed a contentious anti-fake news bill, changes critics say will favour Najib. \nThe government rejects the accusations.

The Election Commission is expected to meet in days to announce a date for the approximately 14 million eligible voters to cast their ballots. \nHigh living costs and corruption are issues that have resonated with voters but overall, Najib’s standing is likely to be bolstered by a robust economy. \n“We don’t choose parties, we choose leaders,” said 27-year-old Amir Mukris Bakeri, a travel agent in Kuala Lumpur. \n“If the leader can provide for people’s welfare, that’s who we’d pick.” Malaysia's former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaks during a Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia briefing in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in this still image taken from social media video, April 6, 2018.

Slideshow (2 Images) \nNajib has denied any wrongdoing in connection with 1MDB, but the scandal created a rift between Najib and Mahathir, who has become the prime minister’s harshest critic. \nWith the common goal of taking down Najib, Mahathir has joined hands with his former deputy and jailed opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, ending a feud that had shaped the country’s political narrative over two decades. ‘UNPREDICTABLE’ \nNajib’s United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) party heads the ruling coalition that has held power since Malaysia’s independence in 1957. \nThe coalition lost the popular vote in the last election, in 2013, but Najib held on to power with a smaller majority in parliament. \nMalaysia has a first-past-the-post election system, which is based on the number of seats won, not the popular vote. \nEven if Najib’s coalition retains power, a weak victory could lead to an internal leadership challenge against him. \nHis predecessor, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, had to step down after the coalition lost its two-thirds majority in the 222-seat parliament for the first time in 2008. \n“He wants not only to win, but to win big,” said Yang Razali Kassim, Senior Fellow at S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \nThe election could be a very close call, he said. \n“This will in fact be the most unpredictable general election in Malaysian politics,” he said.
