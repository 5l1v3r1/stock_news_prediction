The SNB... therefore must remain alert,” Moser said. “We analyse the events very closely and are ready to influence developments if necessary.”\nThe SNB has deployed negative interest rates and currency market interventions over the last three years to check the rise of the franc whose strength weighs on the export-reliant Swiss economy.\nThe strategy has begun to bear fruit, with the currency losing ground versus the euro this year.
