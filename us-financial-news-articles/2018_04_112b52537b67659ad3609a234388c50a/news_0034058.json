arm on the local stock exchange, sources with knowledge of the matter said. \n** France’s Imerys is selling its roof tiles business as it streamlines its portfolio, people close to the matter said, expecting the asset to be valued at around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), with private equity most likely to clinch the deal. \n** Cash-strapped Fortis Healthcare Ltd said Fosun International Ltd has
