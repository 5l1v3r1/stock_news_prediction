REUTERS/David Gray \nPeaty swam well within his capabilities to clock 58.84 seconds to beat fast-finishing compatriot James Wilby and South Africa’s Cameron van der Burgh and defend the Commonwealth Games title he won in Glasgow four years ago. \nHe has been unbeaten in the event since then. \n“It’s a gold medal. It’s four years undefeated,” Peaty said. “(But) I’m not happy with that performance because it’s not the best version of me.” \nPeaty had swum a Commonwealth Games record 58.59 on Friday but said he felt he was nowhere near enough to his best to challenge his own world record of 57.13 from the 2016 Rio Olympics.

REUTERS/David Gray \n“I went the first 50m as fast as possible but couldn’t hold on,” Peaty said. \n“It was the first time ever where I felt not in control of my race and I let the event get to me too much, thinking about the end result instead of the process.” \nThe 23-year-old Peaty said that while it was still early in his long-course season, he would need to work with coach Mel Marshall on how to get back to where they wanted to be heading into the European Championships in Scotland in August. \n“My stroke feels nowhere near what it should feel like,” he added. \n“I think we’ve got to go back to the drawing board now and see what worked from September to December and move that to April, July and August.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly and Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T14:17:50.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
