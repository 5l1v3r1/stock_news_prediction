SCHOOL BUSES \nFirstGroup’s U.S. business runs yellow school buses as well as Greyhound coaches and accounts for over half of the company’s revenues. In Britain, it operates buses, and three rail franchises on routes to western and southern England. \nIts headquarters are in the northern Scottish city of Aberdeen. \nFirstGroup’s shares have slumped since the middle of last year and were hit again by a profit warning which saw them drop to 77 pence in March. That was a low point since the company first listed in 1995, leaving it more vulnerable to a bid. \nA long-term underperformer — the stock has lost 40 percent of its value over the last five years compared to a 40 percent rise in Britain’s midcap index, of which it is a constituent — the company has also not paid a dividend since 2013. \nAt that time it was forced to raise 615 million pounds in a rights issue to pay down debt, after it lost a deal to run Britain’s West Coast rail franchise linking London and Glasgow. \nLiberum analyst Gerald Khoo said that without any other offer, news of the approach should force management to act. \n“The approach ought to act as a catalyst for more urgent action by the board,” he said. \nFirstGroup declined to comment on measures management could take. \nAny takeover deal for FirstGroup in its entirety or break up would not be straightforward, the analysts said, given that the British government would need to approve a change in control of rail franchises and the company’s pension deficit. \nShares in FirstGroup traded up 6 percent at 107.5 pence by 1445 GMT.
