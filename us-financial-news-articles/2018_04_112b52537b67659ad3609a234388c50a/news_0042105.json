A statement by the Sunni extremist group’s Amaq news agency said the man had targeted an election gathering of Shiites, whom it referred to pejoratively as “polytheists.” \nSunday’s attack was at least the fourth such assault on a voter-registration site since the enrollment drive for the elections began eight days ago. It underscores the daunting challenge the Afghan government faces in staging a credible, fraud-free vote, which U.S. and other Western governments view as a crucial chance for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to show the Afghan public that a Western-leaning government and democratic practices can make a difference their lives.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T14:59:50.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
