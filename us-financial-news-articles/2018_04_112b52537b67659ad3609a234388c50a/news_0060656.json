REUTERS/Gleb Garanich More than two weeks of anti-government protests forced the resignation of Republican Party veteran Serzh Sarksyan as prime minister and the party has said it will not put forward one of its own members to replace him, in a bid to calm tensions.\nPashinyan, a former journalist turned lawmaker, has said parliament must elect him prime minister on May 1.\nHe is so far the only person to put himself forward and, as of Sunday, had received the support of all opposition parties in parliament that hold 47 seats of the 105-seat legislature where the Republicans have a majority.\nSlideshow (8 Images) After talks with Pashinyan on Sunday, the parliamentary leader of the Republican Party, Vahram Baghdasaryan, said the party would not “impede the election of the people’s candidate” if all three opposition factions in parliament supported him.\nThe announcement coincided with the resumption of protests in the capital Yerevan after a two-day moratorium during which demonstrations against the Republican Party and official corruption were held in smaller cities.\nAddressing demonstrators on Yerevan’s Republic Square, Pashinyan said he would meet with lawmakers on Monday and called for his supporters to refrain from acts of civil disobedience.\nAlthough demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilize Armenia, a close ally of Russia in a volatile region riven by a decades-long, low-level conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; Writing by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T19:22:42.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
