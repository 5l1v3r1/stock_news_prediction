At U.S. burger joint, it's an option Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nDURHAM, N.C. (Reuters) - Kristin Barnaby, a self-described arachnophobe, found a way to overcome what she dreads at a North Carolina burger joint.

REUTERS/Jim Urquhart \nThe tarantula burger is not for everyone. Gross gets only 15 of the farmed, organically raised creatures each year, so diners need to be lucky, as well as daring, to get a taste. \n“You come in, you fill in a lottery ticket,” he said. “If we draw your name, you come and get to eat one.” \nThe lucky winners have up to 48 hours to claim their prize and Gross said none have yet backed out.
