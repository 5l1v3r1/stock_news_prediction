Hecla will acquire Klondex for consideration of US$462 million comprised of cash and shares of Hecla common stock. Klondex shareholders will receive US$2.47 per share in cash or shares of Hecla which represents a 59% premium to Klondex's 30-day volume-weighted average price at March 16, 2018 and a premium of approximately 72% based on the closing price on March 16, 2018. Klondex's Canadian assets will be spun out to its existing shareholders. Klondex shareholders will receive, for each Klondex share, 0.125 of a common share of a newly formed company which will own Klondex's Canadian assets.\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Additional details regarding the transaction will be available in the preliminary proxy statement that is expected to be filed with regulatory agencies in May. Pending receipt of all required approvals, the Company anticipates that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nNevada Operations:\nThe Company mined and produced a total of 47,499 and 41,415 GEOs, respectively, at its Nevada operations during the first quarter of 2018.
