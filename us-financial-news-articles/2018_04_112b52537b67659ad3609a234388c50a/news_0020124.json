MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.06 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.49 percent.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve is worried about trade tensions with China, but minutes from the most recent Fed meeting suggest those concerns have not translated into worry about the overall economy - or a more complacent monetary policy.\n\"The minutes were modestly negative,\" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. \"People had been speculating that due to all the turbulence in the market because of geopolitical uncertainties that the Fed might consider pausing or slowing down the interest rate increases.\"\nOil prices hit their highest in more than three years despite a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories as investors fretted over conflict escalation in the Middle East.\n\"A bearish inventory report was quickly negated on word of intercepted rockets over Riyadh, which just adds to the recent spike in geopolitical tensions,\" said Anthony Headrick, energy market analyst and commodities futures broker at CHS Hedging LLC.\nU.S. crude rose 1.89 percent to $66.75 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.89, up 1.2 percent on the day.\nOil prices began to climb on Trump's warning over Syria, then rallied further on a report that Saudi Arabia's air defense forces intercepted a missile over Riyadh, the capital.\nThe dollar fell against the yen as escalating geopolitical concerns added to lingering worries over U.S. trade policy and domestic scandals swirling around Trump.\n\"It's a risk-off kind of day,\" said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California, referring to increased geopolitical tensions.\n\"The yen typically is a flight to safety,\" Trang noted.\nThe dollar index fell 0.07 percent, with the euro up 0.1 percent to $1.2366.\nThe Japanese yen strengthened 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 106.80 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4177, up 0.04 percent on the day.\nThe Russian ruble slumped as much as 3.2 percent against the dollar before rising 1.0 percent after two days of steep losses.\nIn metals, aluminum prices extended their rally to a sixth straight session, hitting an 11-week peak amid persistent worry about shortages after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia's Rusal.\nSpot gold added 1.1 percent to $1,353.16 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.80 percent to $1,356.70 an ounce as safe-haven demand sharpened.\nU.S. Treasury yields edged lower with bond prices higher on the escalating geopolitical tensions.
