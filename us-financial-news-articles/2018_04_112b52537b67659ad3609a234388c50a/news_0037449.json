It was produced with Scrinium, a Venetian publishing house. \n“The last ‘diplomatic transcription’ of the will is 150 years old,” said Stefano Della Zana, Scrinium’s cultural director, referring to the term used by experts who study ancient letters and handwriting to produce modern interpretations. \n“This was done with the latest scientific techniques and scholarly standards of philology, so previous errors have been corrected,” he said. \nIn one case, a scribbled Latin word that had previously been believed to refer to fabric was corrected to mean a residence. An exact replica of Marco Polo's 700-year-old last will and testament, is seen in Rome, Italy, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi \nOne of the causes of the misunderstanding, according to Professor Attilio Bartoli Langeli, was because the notary’s handwriting was “decidedly bad cursive script, awkward and careless”. \nPolo left money to Church institutions in Venice, forgave outstanding debts, and freed his indentured servant, a Tatar he had named Peter, “so that God may absolve my soul from all guilt and sin”. \nIn the late 20th century a few historians argued that Polo never made it to China but picked up stories of the Mongol Empire from Persian merchants he met on the Black Sea. \nMost historians have rejected this view and Della Zana said the fact that Polo’s servant was a Tatar, who were a Mongol people, supports evidence that he did get to China. \nFurther evidence lies in an inventory of Polo’s possessions that surfaced after his death and listed items from the far east, such as expensive musk. \nApart from the money bequeathed to the Church, Polo left nearly everything else to his wife and three daughters. Della Zana said this was uncommon because it was then customary for men without sons to leave their assets to male members of the extended family.
