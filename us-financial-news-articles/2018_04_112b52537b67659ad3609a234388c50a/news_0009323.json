REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo \nThe report by a Michigan House of Representatives committee specifically blames the university for a poor investigation into a complaint filed by victim Amanda Thomashow against Nassar in 2014, which erroneously found no wrongdoing by the disgraced physician. \nThe committee also proposed a series of reforms and legislation meant to ensure that a doctor in Nassar’s position could not carry out such abuse in the future. \n“Though not all of us necessarily agree with each and every proposal, we all agree that a broad review of potential solutions is necessary to protect our children from predators like Larry Nassar and fix the problems revealed by his horrific crimes,” committee members wrote in the report. \nMichigan State spokeswoman Emily Guerrant said in an email that the university would be working with the House on its legislation and “shares the joint concern of lawmakers who want to make sure the horrendous abuse that Larry Nassar executed cannot happen again.” \nNassar, a former faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic at Michigan State University and a doctor for USA Gymnastics, was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.
