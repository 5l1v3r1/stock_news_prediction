Top executives and political leaders, including Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital, Corey Lewandowski from the Trump campaign and White House and David Davis, the minister leading the Brexit negotiations for the U.K., gather to explore the tectonic shifts taking place in tech, society and geopolitics. We will be live-streaming selected sessions on Thursday.\nBut, back to today:\nMr. Zuckerberg Goes to Washington Lawmakers gave Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg a mostly gentle grilling over the company’s handling of user privacy while signaling they are considering embarking on a new era of regulation for big tech companies. During several hours of questioning , Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged missteps in a recent series of scandals in which the privacy of millions of users was violated, saying the social-media giant needs “to now take a more active view in policing the ecosystem.” But he avoided committing to major changes in how the platform functions or sells advertising. Investors reacted positively to Mr. Zuckerberg’s performance—the first of two days on Capitol Hill—sending Facebook shares up 4.5%. While the senators showed little consensus on how to force the protection of user data, Tuesday’s unusual joint hearing probably marked the beginning of a long deliberation on regulating the tech industry.\nBreaking: Plane Crash in Algeria More than 250 people were killed when a Soviet-designed military-transport plane crashed soon after takeoff in a farm field in northern Algeria, officials said.\nFinger on the Trigger The White House said President Trump believes he has the authority to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, as lawmakers from both parties warned against it. The administration’s assertion, which it said followed consultations with legal experts—including at the Justice Department—came a day after the FBI raided properties tied to the president’s private lawyer. It represents a departure from the more-measured responses to past questions about firing Mr. Mueller, who has been examining Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election and whether associates of Mr. Trump colluded with Moscow. Both the president and Russian officials have denied it. While the circumstances around a dismissal remain highly uncertain, we offer some answers on how the process could unfold . The president is also said to be considering firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, to whom Mr. Mueller reports and who signed off on the Feds’ move against Mr. Trump’s lawyer. It promises to be another lively few days at the White House.\nCoalition of the Willing Meanwhile, the Trump administration worked to rally international support for a possible military strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for last weekend’s alleged chemical-weapons attack. France, the U.K. and Saudi Arabia all vowed a forceful response, and the U.S. and France positioned warships armed with cruise missiles within firing range of Syria. As the administration decides how to respond, the president canceled plans to travel Friday to South America. The expanding support for unified action suggests the U.S. and other nations could carry out strikes more extensive than last year’s isolated attack by the U.S. on a Syrian airfield. Possible options included salvos aimed at crippling Mr. Assad’s chemical-weapons capabilities, while not seeking to push him from power.\nBest of the Lot In May, Christie’s will auction the vast collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller , which runs the gamut from 18th-century porcelain to Picasso paintings. It is expected to break a barrier that no auction has ever crossed: $1 billion. Proceeds are set to go to charity. Besides the Picassos, standouts include masterworks by Claude Monet, Edward Hopper, Georges Seurat and Georgia O’Keeffe. Some curios carry an estimate as low as $100 (a set of Harvard cuff links), while other pieces top $70 million (a Henri Matisse that hung in the Westchester living room). While the auction is expected to draw bidders from around the globe, one battle has already taken place behind the scenes: Christie’s fought hard to secure the sale, taking steps from doubling its guarantee to securing an outside line of credit. As for Rockefeller’s heirs, each of his children was permitted to pick out $1 million of art and objects before the collection headed to the block.\nToday’s Video Update Profile What exactly is Facebook?

As trade tensions escalate, the U.S. is accusing Chinese companies of routing goods through other countries to disguise their origin and evade tariffs.

Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Cynthia Lin\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on the FBI’s raiding the home and office of President Trump’s private lawyer, Shari Reed of New Mexico weighed in: “Special Counsel Mueller is leading us to facts that many people don’t want to accept. The raid on Cohen was authorized because of probable cause concerning criminal activity.” Stewart Cumming of Quote: : “The FBI’s raid runs headlong into the confidentiality surrounding a lawyer’s ability to communicate, counsel and develop the trust necessary to effectively represent a client.” Richard Spaulding of New Jersey shared: “I think the ‘follow the money’ approach to investigating wrongdoing has brought the FBI to Cohen’s door.…I fear that Mueller’s firing is inevitable, and many lawsuits will be filed by Trump attorneys, in an effort to draw out investigations in court so he has time to do his damage to our nation and finish his term.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What's News” digest of top stories.
