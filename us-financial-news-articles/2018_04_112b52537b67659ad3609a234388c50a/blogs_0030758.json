They requested anonymity because negotiations are private. \nThe total value of the three towers, when completed, is expected to reach 1.2 billion reais, one of the sources added. \nMuch of the value in the project, located in an affluent business district, comes from the land, permits and certificates known as CEPACs whereby the city waives zoning laws in certain situations. The towers are part of an 80,000-square-meter complex called Parque da Cidade. \nThe real estate deal would be the latest in a string of asset sales by Odebrecht in recent years to reduce debt after its involvement in a massive graft scandal that stretched across Latin America. \nFormer Odebrecht executives said in plea bargain testimony last year that the company paid the son of a city official $1.8 million to speed up the approval process for Parque da Cidade. \nOne of the sources said bidders would start discussing legal risks in the deal during the due diligence process, which has not yet begun. \nOdebrecht Realizações declined to comment. Parent company Odebrecht SA said it had recognized the error of its prior corrupt practices and paid fines as part of a leniency deal with Brazilian authorities. \nRepresentatives for Eztec and HSI did not respond to requests for comment. \nSeveral commercial real estate companies in Brazil have been hunting attractive acquisitions in recent years, as struggling developers have been forced to sell at a discount to cut hefty debt loads after a recent downturn. \nThe recent recession led to significantly overbuilt office space in affluent parts of southwest Sao Paulo, where Parque da Cidade is located. \nEztec, a mid-market to high-end developer operating mainly in metropolitan Sao Paulo, has said it saw merger and acquisition opportunities in the short-term, as have rivals such as BR Properties SA. \nIn 2016, HSI acquired a different tower in Parque da Cidade, which it later sold to Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd. \n($1 = 3.42 reais) (Reporting by Gram Slattery and Carolina Mandl; Editing by Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T08:14:25.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
