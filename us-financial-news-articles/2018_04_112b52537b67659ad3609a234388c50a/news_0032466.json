The hydrotreater restarted over the weekend.\nThe Borger refinery is a 50-50 joint venture between Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy. Phillips 66 is the managing partner.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T05:09:12.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
