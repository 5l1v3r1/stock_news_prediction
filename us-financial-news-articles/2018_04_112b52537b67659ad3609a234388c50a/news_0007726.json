They were building the device as an experiment, with no intent to cause harm, Campbell County Sheriff Scott Matheny told the newspaper.\n“They were in over their heads, trying to do something they shouldn’t have been doing,” Matheny added.\nThe teenager packed gun or fireworks powder too tightly into a 2-inch (5 cm) steel pipe and a projectile inside became stuck, resulting in the fatal explosion, Sheriff’s Office Lieutenant Kevin Theis told the News Record.\nRepresentatives from the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office could not be reached for comment.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T06:23:13.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
