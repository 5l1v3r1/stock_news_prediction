I wish them every success going forward as I move on to future projects,” Hammond said. \nWest Brom also sacked chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodman in February following the club’s dismal performances this campaign. \nThe club also said that an announcement regarding their restructuring plans will be made shortly.
