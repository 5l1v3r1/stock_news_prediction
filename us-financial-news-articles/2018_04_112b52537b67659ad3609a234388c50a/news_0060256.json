REUTERS/Yuri Gripas Now the oak sapling is gone - at least temporarily.\nWhite House photographers noticed the tree was gone days after it had been planted. Mystery ensued.\nIn fact, the tree, from Belleau Wood in France where almost 2,000 American soldiers died in a World War One battle, had been dug up not long after it was planted. It was put in quarantine, according to U.S. and French officials. The problem: Parasites on the tree could spread to others on the White House property.\n“It was actually a special favor from Trump to France to be able to plant the tree the day of the president’s visit,” an official from Macron’s office said.\n“Since then, it has returned to quarantine and will soon be replanted in the White House gardens,” the official said, adding: “Don’t worry, the tree is doing very well.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Reporting by Yuri Gipas and Mike Stone in Washington and Michel Rose in Paris; Writing by Jeff Mason; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T00:42:38.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
