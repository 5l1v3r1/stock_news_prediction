The S&P 500 gained 25.55 points, or 0.97 percent, to 2,670.24 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.37 points, or 0.93 percent, to 7,107.48.\nSigns the United States is looking to resolve a trade dispute with China lifted the dollar but limited an advance in oil prices as crude is dollar-priced and a stronger greenback makes oil purchases in other currencies more expensive.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he expects the United States and China to work out differences and trade barriers likely “will come down on both sides.”\nThe dollar index rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.46 percent to $1.2221. The Japanese yen weakened 0.63 percent versus the greenback at 107.45 per dollar.\nJoe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solution in Washington, said the dollar was boosted by a view that “Washington and Beijing might broker a trade deal that doesn’t torpedo global commerce or damage the world economy.”\nU.S. crude rose 43 cents to $63.80 per barrel and Brent gained 51 cents to $68.53.\nGold prices fell as the apparent willingness to resolve a trade dispute reduced demand for bullion as a place to park money. A stronger dollar also crimped gold as it’s more expensive for users of other currencies.\nU.S. gold futures fell $11.70 to $1,328.50 an ounce.\nMany suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. Threats to such exports are a powerful weapon for Beijing to wield given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Trump in the presidential election.\nU.S. soybeans and corn regained ground, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day.\nReporting by Kit Rees; Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T22:39:13.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
