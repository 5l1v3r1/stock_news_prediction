(NASDAQ:ASMB), a clinical-stage biotechnology company advancing a new class of oral therapeutics for the treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and novel oral live biotherapeutics for disorders associated with the microbiome, today announced a further expansion of its leadership team with the appointment of Jackie Papkoff, PhD, as Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer Microbiome.\n“Dr. Papkoff has deep expertise in cell biology and molecular mechanisms of disease which she has applied to a broad range of therapeutic areas, including diseases influenced by the microbiome,” said Derek Small, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Her expertise will drive our microbiome pipeline strategy and platform – from strain selection to targeted drug delivery through our Gemicel ® delivery technology. We are progressing our microbiome research programs with Allergan in inflammatory bowel diseases and are evaluating future proprietary opportunities in additional therapeutic areas.”\nDr. Papkoff has worked in both pharma and biotech for over 20 years and has broad scientific strategy, executive leadership and business experience. Most recently, Dr. Papkoff was Senior Vice President, Research and led the preclinical scientific team developing microbial therapeutics for oncology indications at Evelo Biosciences. Prior to Evelo, Dr. Papkoff was a founding member of the J&J California Innovation Center where she served as Vice President Immunology Scientific Innovation for the Janssen Immunology Therapeutic Area. In this role, she led collaborative R&D programs in inflammation and autoimmunity, including microbiome research activities. Previously, she was Chief Scientific Officer of CFD Therapeutics, a cancer-immunology focused antibody therapeutics company she co-founded, and held R&D leadership positions at diaDexus, Inc. and Aventis Pharma. Dr. Papkoff earned her bachelor’s degree in biology from University of California Santa Cruz and a PhD in biology from University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute. She was a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford and University of California San Francisco.\nIn connection with Dr. Papkoff’s appointment, the Company made a grant on April 2, 2018 of non-qualified stock options to purchase 106,200 shares of the Company’s common stock with an exercise price of $46.75 per share, the closing price on April 2, 2018.
