REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo “If it’s true, I would welcome it,” he told reporters after a cabinet meeting.\nAso said he expected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Trump to discuss the TPP at their summit meeting next week.\nBut he added that needed to verify facts carefully.\nTrump “is a person who could change temperamentally, so he may say something different the next day”, he added.\nTrump had asked his trade advisers to look at rejoining TPP, a multinational trade pact he withdrew the United States from last year, White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said.\nThe United States took part in TPP negotiations under Trump’s predecessor but the president withdrew the United States from it early last year under his “America First” policy, raising fears of trade protectionism.\n“After the U.S. withdrawal, Japan, recognizing the significance of free trade, has led the initiative in pulling together the TPP 11,” Aso said, referring to the other members of the pact.\n“Our efforts have borne fruit if the United States judged it would be better to rejoin,” he said.\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chris Gallagher, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T08:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T10:57:31.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
