(OTC Pink: APTY), a publicly traded and fully reporting company, is pleased to confirm this week that its subsidiary, Snapt Games, has acquired a relatively new iOS app with established positive cash flow. It has been a long held goal of Snapt’s management to not only build but also actively acquire games and novelty apps for its portfolio. We anticipate our third in-house game will be released in May.\nAccording to statistics presented by AppAnnie, Q4 in 2017 saw the largest gains for in-app purchases to date, noting over $12 billion spent on the iOS App Store and over $5 billion spent on Google Play. The two stores also saw over 175 billion downloads globally. The significance of these increases in consumer spending proves the mobile application marketplace continues to be a valuable industry. The App Store is poised to reach $139 billion in consumer spending by 2020. With the recent acquisition of its live wallpaper app, Snapt Games has the ability to jumpstart its entrance into one of the largest categories on the App Stores.\n“We are going to spend the next two weeks adding to the app’s offerings and restructuring the marketing plan because we believe it will substantially increase the current monthly revenues of $12,950. We are excited to relaunch this app with a new look around May 1st,\" advised Glenda Dowie, CEO.\nThis transaction further emphasizes Management’s continued effort to grow the potential of its subsidiary companies and move all areas of the operation into positive revenue streams. Our other games, Chick Chick Boom and Hogg Wild continue to enjoy good ratings and we are expanding them to include an option for download revenues, in addition to the income generated from ads.
