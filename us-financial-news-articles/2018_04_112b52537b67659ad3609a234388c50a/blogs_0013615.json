So they're reading it not as a negotiation, but as a trade war.\" \n\"That's what's spooking them,\" he said. \"Their interpretation is that this is the new-brand America and they don't like it. It's been confusing for people, obviously nations.\" \nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday unveiled a list of Chinese imports he plans to target with his tariffs, in what he has said is an attempt to correct unfair trading practices. The list includes products from sectors such as robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace. \nOn Wednesday, China responded with plans to impose tariffs of its own on 106 U.S. products. The Chinese levies would hit soybeans, cars, aerospace and defense products. \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told CNBC's Steve Liesman on Friday that the administration's \" objective is still not to be in a trade war \" with China, but acknowledged that \"there is a potential of a trade war.\" \nWhile Odland said he thinks the U.S. is getting a bum rap for other countries' deeds, he acknowledges that public perceptions do matter. \n\"This is hurting America,\" he said. \"People are misunderstanding what the administration is trying to do. They're trying to get China to follow WTO rules, stop dumping and stop stealing IP.\" \n\"The way the administration has been conducting negotiations is not working, so they're trying something new,\" he said.
