Concerns over increased U.S. federal borrowing in the wake of a tax overhaul, as well as expectations of accelerating inflation, have driven a selloff in U.S. debt that dampened demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market assets. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries edged above 3 percent this week, paving the path for it to visit levels not seen since July 2011. The Brazilian real weakened past 3.50 to the dollar for the first time in almost two years, tracking wider weakness across Latin America. \"The trading range for the Brazilian real has definitely changed but it is still too soon to tell what it will be,\" said Mario Battistel, the head of currency trading at Fair brokerage. The Mexican peso slipped 1.4 percent, while the Colombian peso fell 1.3 percent. Stock indexes were mostly lower, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index down 0.7 percent. Shares in state-controlled oil company Petr√≥leo Brasileiro SA were among the biggest decliners following local media reports that the auction of the so-called transfer of rights area may be delayed to 2019. Representatives for Petrobras, as the company is known, and the government did not respond to requests for comment.
