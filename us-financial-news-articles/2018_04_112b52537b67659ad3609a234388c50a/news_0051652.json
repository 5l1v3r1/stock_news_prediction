He’s not scared of taking his pants off, so he said get in there.”\nRose and Stenson combined to shoot seven-under 65 in the first round of the team event on Thursday.\nRose was more adventurous than American Talor Gooch, who found three alligators nearby after his ball found a bunker at the 18th hole.\nTwo of the reptiles responded to a nudge from a rake and returned to the adjacent pond, but the third would not budge, which led to a ruling.\nGooch was allowed a free drop in the bunker, but his ball plugged.\nHe considered that a reasonable outcome under the circumstances.\n“I chose life over a good lie in that situation,” he told Golf Channel.
