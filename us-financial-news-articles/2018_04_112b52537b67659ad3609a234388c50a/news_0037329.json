( here ) \nBlack Elk struggled financially after a November 2012 explosion on a Gulf of Mexico rig killed three workers and caused an oil spill. It went bankrupt in 2015. \nCogan said Shulse plans to argue that the other three defendants in the Black Elk scheme hid their fraud, and that he went to authorities immediately upon learning what happened. \nNordlicht pleaded not guilty to involvement in both schemes. \nThe charges were announced six months after the arrests of Platinum executive Murray Huberfeld and Norman Seabrook, the former chief of New York City’s correction officers union, in a separate corruption case in Manhattan. \nThat case ended with a hung jury in November. \nThe case is U.S. v. Nordlicht et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 16-cr-00640.
