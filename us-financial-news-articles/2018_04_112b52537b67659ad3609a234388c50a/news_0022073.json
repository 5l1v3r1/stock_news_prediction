REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett \nThe FTSE 100 .FTSE was down 0.1 percent, though it remained near the six-week high it reached on Tuesday after several days of gains. \n“Western military action against Syria seems imminent - and that is obviously going to lead to lots of worse things than yield curves being flattened/levelled entirely if it happens,” Rabobank analysts said in a note. \nEnergy stocks tumbled as crude prices dipped, though escalating tension in the Middle East kept Brent above $70 a barrel. \nThe silver lining was Britain’s biggest retailer Tesco ( TSCO.L ), which topped the FTSE 100, jumping 5.6 percent to a two-year high after it beat its profit forecast.
