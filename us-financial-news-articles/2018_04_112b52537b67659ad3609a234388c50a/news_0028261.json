Almost all Rio’s aluminium output comes from a joint venture with Rusal in Australia. \n* U.S. ALUMINIUM STOCKS: Almost all the aluminium in the United States was removed from Comex warehouses this week. Stocks tumbled by about 44,000 tonnes to 11,168 tonnes. AL-TTLTTDY-STX \n* SPREADS: The rush for stocks was reflected in time spreads on the LME, with the premium on the cash aluminium contract rising to $56 a tonne over the three-month future CMAL0-3, its highest in at least a decade. \n* COPPER: LME copper ended the day up 0.1 percent at $6,830 a tonne. The base metals were broadly benefiting from sharper appetite for cyclical assets on Friday, reflected by strength in equities. \n* OTHER METALS: LME zinc finished up 0.7 percent at $3,117 a tonne, while lead closed down 1.3 percent at $2,303. Tin ended up 0.7 percent at $21,050, and nickel finished the day 1.6 percent higher at $13,940 a tonne.
