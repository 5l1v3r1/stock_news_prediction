Invitees will be determined by awarding spots to winners of other recognised championships and using the Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking. \nThe first two rounds will take place at Champions Retreat Golf Club in Augusta. After a cut to the low 30 scores, the final competitive round will take place at Augusta National on Saturday, April 6, when an amateur champion will be crowned for the first time ever at the home of the Masters. \nRidley said he expected the tournament to be televised and will be distributed on digital platforms around the world.
