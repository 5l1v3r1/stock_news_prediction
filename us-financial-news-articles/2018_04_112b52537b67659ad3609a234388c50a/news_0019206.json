WS&A will be acquired from Gartner with the financial support of technology-focused private equity firm ParkerGale Capital.\n“This is an exciting combination of two great companies. One with strong, modern technology and one with decades of expertise and intellectual property. WS&A is the recognized industry leader working with some of the largest companies in the world and we are excited to join forces,” said CultureIQ CEO Greg Besner, who will be the CEO of the combined business.\nCultureIQ was founded by Mr. Besner in 2013 as a software-as-a-service disrupter in the traditional employee culture and engagement survey industry. WS&A came together through Corporate Executive Board’s acquisitions of Valtera and Genesee Surveys. ParkerGale, having used CultureIQ’s products across its portfolio companies for several years, brought the idea of merging the companies earlier this year and financed the transaction along with CultureIQ’s existing investors.\n“We think this is exactly what the market is looking for – a high tech and high touch approach to employee engagement,” commented Devin Mathews, Partner at ParkerGale. “From our industry research, we know there is a huge market without a clear leader. Companies are updating the old ways of surveying employees for feedback and are now listening deeply to their employees using technology and fostering engagement through action plans built on decades of benchmarking and best practices. The combination of CultureIQ and WS&A creates the clear leader the industry has been seeking.”\nThe new company will operate under the CultureIQ brand and will be the premiere provider of culture and engagement solutions for companies of all sizes. With strong talent, shared values, and a customer-focused approach, the focus will be to invest in areas of growth, while preserving the best of both organizations.\n“Combining WS&A’s nearly 50 years of deep expertise in the survey and talent analytics space with CultureIQ’s innovative platform is an exciting proposition for our team and will allow us to bring even greater value to our clients,” added Karen Barbera, Head of Delivery at WS&A.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the first half of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions.\nAbout CultureIQ\nCultureIQ helps you leverage employee feedback to measure, understand, and strengthen your culture.
