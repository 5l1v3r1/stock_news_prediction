Now, I’m just so happy and this is the best day of my life.”\nAndrew Cotton might be forgiven a few bad dreams after his spectacular wipeout at Nazaré on the same day as Koxa nailed his big ride.\nThe Englishman, who was left nursing 12 broken vertebrae in his back and is only now almost ready to get back into the water, was awarded the “Wipeout of the Year” at the ceremony in Santa Monica, California.
