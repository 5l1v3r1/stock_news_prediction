Presidential Palace Handout via REUTERS U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Summit of the Americas in the Peruvian capital that immediate action was needed as Venezuela gears up for presidential elections on May 20 that have been condemned by many regional leaders as a farce to legitimize Maduro’s rule.\nFor the first time, the United States backed a statement by heads of state from the Lima Group of nations - established last year to seek a peaceful end to Venezuela’s political turmoil - which called on Maduro to release political prisoners and hold free elections.\nDespite an economic collapse that has driven an estimated 3 million people to flee his once-prosperous OPEC nation, Maduro is expected to win next month’s poll.\nVenezuela’s two most popular opposition leaders are banned from competing and electoral authorities are stacked with government supporters.\n“The United States of America will not stand idly by as Venezuela crumbles,” Pence said in a speech. “Every free nation gathered here must take stronger action to isolate the Maduro regime. We must all stand with our brothers and sisters suffering in Venezuela.”\nThe statement by the Lima Group voiced alarm at an exodus of migrants from Venezuela and urged governments to intensify actions aimed at restoring democracy.\nWashington has already targeted senior members of Maduro’s administration with sanctions due to accusations of corruption and rights abuses.\nFormer U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the prospect in February that this could be broadened to restrict Venezuela’s exports of crude oil and its imports of U.S. refined products.\nNeighboring countries’ frustration with Maduro’s socialist government has been stoked by the arrival of thousands of hungry migrants across the border into Colombia and Brazil every day.\nCALL FOR HUMANITARIAN AID The joint statement called on international organizations to offer support to neighboring countries to cope with the arrivals and for Maduro to allow access for humanitarian aid to his nation of 30 million people - something he has refused to do, denying there is a crisis.\nPeru's President Martin Vizcarra meets U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Acting U.S. Secretary of State John Sullivan and White House senior advisor Jared Kushner during a bilateral meeting at the VIII Summit of the Americas in Lima, Peru April 14, 2018.
