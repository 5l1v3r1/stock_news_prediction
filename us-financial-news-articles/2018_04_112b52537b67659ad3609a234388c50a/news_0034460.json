REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nKillen said the highway locations will primarily provide chargers for trips between U.S. cities but also cross-country journeys along Interstate 10 between Santa Monica, California and Jacksonville, Florida, plus Interstate 80 that runs from San Francisco and Teaneck, New Jersey. \nMajor automakers including General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) have announced plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on families of electric vehicles over the next few years, in a direct challenge to money-losing Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ). \nBut a lack of infrastructure for U.S. consumers to recharge their vehicles is seen is as a major barrier to the mass adoption of electric vehicles as consumers remain concerned over their limited range. \n“These charging stations will go a long way toward convincing folks that there are a lot of chargers out there,” Electrify America’s Killen said. \nClusters of four to 10 chargers will be installed at the Walmart charging stations. \nVW has agreed to spend $800 million in California and a total of $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of its agreement after admitting to diesel emissions cheating. \nElectrify America said on Tuesday it has selected several suppliers, including Switzerland’s ABB Ltd ( ABBN.S ) and South Korea’s Signet EV Inc 260870.KN, to install more than 2,000 high-speed electric vehicle chargers by the end of 2019. \nMany of the chargers will be able to provide a high-speed recharge for electric vehicles.
