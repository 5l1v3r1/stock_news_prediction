This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ... We are going to hopefully make a deal.”\nStill, Trump told reporters, he would maintain pressure on North Korea and “not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.”\nSpeaking on Saturday at a televised news conference in Sydney, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Trump’s negotiations on North Korea and said he helped bring the two Korean leaders together.\n“I have given him that credit because Donald Trump has taken a very, very strong, hard line on the denuclearisation issue and he has been able to bring in the support of the global community and, in particular, China,” Turnbull said. “North Korea’s economic relationship is overwhelmingly with China. And so China’s preparedness to impose those sanctions has been the critical change that has put the economic pressure on North Korea.”\nTurnbull said the pressure from China and the U.S. had brought Kim to the point of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\n“What we’ve now got to do is not relent on the economic pressure until that goal is achieved,” he said.\nAustralia will send a military aircraft to monitor North Korean vessels suspected of transferring illicit goods in defiance of U.N. sanctions, he said.\nAn editorial in the official China Daily on Saturday said denuclearisation could end hostilities between the two sides and “usher in a new era of development” on the peninsula, but noted Friday’s declaration lacked a plan for achieving the goal.\n“The denuclearisation of the peninsula, written into the Panmunjom Declaration, is only a prospect with no specific plan. That is because such specifics can be reached only between the US and North Korea, and South Korea has only limited authority to bargain,” it said.
