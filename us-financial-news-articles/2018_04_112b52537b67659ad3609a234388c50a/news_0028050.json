The United States and the United Nations have described the situation as ethnic cleansing.\nMyanmar has denied nearly all allegations, saying it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. The government has said the army crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August.\nThe UN refugee agency has said conditions in Myanmar were not ready for the Rohingya refugees to return.\nMyanmar has said it is ready to receive the refugees, with one of its ministers this week telling refugees in Bangladesh to set aside the past and prepare to “go back to your own residences”.\nSome refugees have said they fear going back due to persecution.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya fled Myanmar by sea following an outbreak of sectarian violence in Rakhine in 2012. That exodus peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people fled across the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, many drowning in unsafe and overloaded boats.\nReporting by A.
