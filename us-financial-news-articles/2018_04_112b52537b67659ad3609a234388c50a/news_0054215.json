But they have pushed back this worst case scenario to next year and only if winter rains fail to sufficiently boost dam levels.\n“There has been a lot of flooding in urban areas across the metro and a lot of roadways have been affected,” said Charlotte Powell, spokeswoman for Cape Town’s disaster management center.\n“Flooding is a known risk to the city,” Powell said.\nHowever, no emergency shelters or evacuations were necessary, she said of a perennial challenge when heavy rains during winter affects thousands who live in shanty towns.\nThe South African Weather Service said around 34 millimeters (1.3 inches) of rain fell at Cape Town international airport from 8 a.m. on Wednesday to 8 a.m. on Thursday due to a severe weather front.\nForecaster Thabisile Ntleko said a few showers were expected later on Thursday before clearing ahead of a weak cold front on Friday evening and more rain.\n“That will go into Saturday morning before clearing. We don’t see too much rain,” she said adding that up to 5 millimeters was expected.\nThe city is encouraging its residents to continue saving water amid drought restrictions that limits daily consumption per person to 50 liters a day.\nReporting by Wendell Roelf; Editing by James Macharia and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:19:50.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
