I am now committed to training hard, resuming my career and getting back to where I was, although appreciate this will take time.” \nEvans was handed a wildcard by the LTA after he passed the “agreed checks” over the last six weeks. \n“(Dan) has begun to support the development of the LTA’s anti-doping education materials to help emerging young players avoid similar mistakes,” LTA performance director Simon Timson said.
