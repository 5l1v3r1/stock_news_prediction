The San Francisco-based firm offers a number of products as an alternative to ordinary cigarettes, including e-cigarettes and vaporizers.\nThe company said it would also be investing in research and development to evaluate technologies to help prevent youth from gaining access to and using Juul products.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T21:00:24.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
