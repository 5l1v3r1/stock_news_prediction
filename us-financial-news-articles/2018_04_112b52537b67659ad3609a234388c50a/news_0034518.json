REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis \nThe 24-hour strike was organized by Greece’s seamen federation (PNO), which said the leftist-led government was preparing a reform allowing non-European flagged transport ships to sail in Greece, leading to job losses for Greek crews. \nThe reform is coming on top of pension cuts, rising unregistered labor and work without any insurance, PNO said. \n“The planned dismantling and the annihilation of our legal rights, and the continuing effort to ruin Greek seamen, cannot and will not stay unanswered,” PNO said, promising to escalate labor action.

Traffic has been picking up as the summer, the top tourism season for the Mediterranean country, approaches. \nMarine unions have strongly resisted reforms liberalizing the shipping sector, which along with tourism is a pivotal industry for Greece, a country of proud seafarers and shipowners. \nSince its worst debt crisis in decades broke out in 2010, Greece has sold management rights and majority stakes at its two largest ports, as demanded by its foreign lenders, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. \nThe Greek state is considering concession deals for the development of about 850 small ports and marinas.
