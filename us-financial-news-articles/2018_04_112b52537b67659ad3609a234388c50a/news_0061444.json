FILE PHOTO: Cricket Australia Chief Executive Officer (CEO) James Sutherland reacts as he talks during a media conference at the WACA Ground in Perth, Australia, November 4, 2016. REUTERS/David Gray\nCricket Australia (CA) said it was continuing discussions with the BCCI with a view to playing their first day-night test in Adelaide from Dec. 6-10.\n“It is our preference that we play India in a day-night test match in Adelaide, but we are still working through this detail and hope to have an answer on this in the coming weeks,” CA CEO James Sutherland said in a media release.\nAustralia has hosted New Zealand, South Africa and England in day-night tests at Adelaide Oval, winning all three of the pink ball matches. India have never played a floodlit match.\nSouth Africa were initially reluctant to play their 2016 test under lights at Adelaide, fearing the hosts would have an unfair advantage.\nThe Proteas lost by seven wickets.\nAustralia and India play their second test at the new Perth Stadium in Burswood, across the Swan river from the city’s traditional test venue, the WACA.\nThe series continues with the Boxing Day test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec. 26 and wraps up in the New Year at the Sydney Cricket Ground (Jan. 3-7).\nThe Gabba in Brisbane, which usually hosts the first test of the Australian summer, has been relegated to the Jan. 24-28 series-opener against Sri Lanka, who will tour the country for the first time in six years.\nCanberra’s Manuka Oval will then host its first test match from Feb. 1 when the home side meet Sri Lanka in their second and final fixture.\nIndia’s tour will kick off with a three-match Twenty20 international series in November after Australia start the home summer with four limited overs matches against South Africa.\nThe hosts will also play India in three ODIs in January.\nThe schedule, which will see test cricket played in February for the first time in over 20 years, has been structured to avoid clashing with the domestic ‘Big Bash’ T20 competition, which has proved a bigger drawcard for local fans than some test matches in recent seasons.\n“This will be a win for fans, with reduced overlap with the Big Bash,” Sutherland said.\nFixtures:\nNov. 4 - Australia v South Africa, Perth Stadium, ODI\nNov. 9 - Australia v South Africa, Adelaide Oval, ODI\nNov. 11 - Australia v South Africa, Bellerive Oval, Hobart, ODI\nNov. 17 - Australia v South Africa, Carrara Stadium, Gold Coast, T20I.\nNov. 21 - Australia v India, The Gabba, T20I\nNov. 23 - Australia v India, MCG, T20I\nNov. 25 - Australia v India, SCG, T20I\nDec. 6-10 - Australia v India, Adelaide Oval, first test\nDec. 14-18 - Australia v India, Perth Stadium, second test\nDec. 26-30 - Australia v India, MCG, third test\nJan. 3-7 - Australia v India, SCG, fourth test\nJan. 12 - Australia v India, SCG, ODI\nJan. 15 - Australia v India, Adelaide Oval, ODI\nJan. 18 - Australia v India, MCG, ODI\nJan. 24-28 - Australia v Sri Lanka, Gabba, first test\nFeb. 1-5 - Australia v Sri Lanka, Manuka Oval, Canberra, second test Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T05:05:46.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
