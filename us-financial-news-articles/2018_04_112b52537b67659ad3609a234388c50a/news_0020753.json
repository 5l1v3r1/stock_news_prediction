REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nUnited Nations officials investigating a possible genocide in Myanmar said last month that Facebook had been a source of anti-Rohingya propaganda. \nMarzuki Darusman, chairman of the U.N. Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, said in March that social media had played a “determining role” in Myanmar. \n“It has ... substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension and conflict ... within the public. Hate speech is certainly of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned, social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media,” he said. \nZuckerberg said Facebook was hiring dozens more Burmese-language speakers to remove threatening content. \n“It’s hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically,” he said, adding that Facebook was also asking civil society groups to help it identify figures who should be banned from the network. \nHe said a Facebook team would also make undisclosed product changes in Myanmar and other countries where ethnic violence was a problem.

Bernstein \nBut Jes Petersen, chief executive of Yangon-based Phandeeyar, which helped Facebook translate its Burmese-language community standards, said Zuckerberg’s commitment would not be enough for a country with nearly 30 million users. \n“It is not even close. It will be interesting to see how Facebook meet their 24-hour commitment here - but a mammoth expansion of Burmese-speaking staff is going to be needed.” Reporting by Andy Sullivan and Yimou Lee; Edited by Damon Darlin and Clarence Fernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T03:55:06.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
