Facebook says more than 70 million of the affected users are in the U.S., though there are over a million each in the Philippines, Indonesia and the U.K.\nThe notifications began appearing hours before Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was scheduled to address the privacy scandal in a congressional hearing Tuesday.\nDarrell West said he wasn't too surprised to receive the notification, since he has about 5,000 Facebook friends and it would have taken just one of them to take the personality quiz.\nBut it still bothered West, who directs the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm affiliated with Donald Trump's successful presidential campaign, obtained users' data through an app that was purportedly a research tool.\n\"It disturbs me that some of my information may have helped Donald Trump become president, even if I was only one of 87 million,\" West said. \"I do think it mattered, just because it was information that was so detailed. It was providing a gold mine for the candidates who use it. It allowed them to target their advertising very effectively and really hone their message.\"\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie previously estimated that more than 50 million people were compromised by the personality quiz that collected data from users and their friends. In an interview aired Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Wylie said the true number could be even larger than 87 million.\nThat Facebook app was created in 2014 by an academic researcher named Aleksander Kogan, who paid about 270,000 people to take it. The app vacuumed up not just the data of the people who took it, but also — thanks to Facebook's loose restrictions — data from their friends, including details that they hadn't intended to share publicly.\nFacebook later limited the data apps can access, but it was too late in this case.\nZuckerberg has said Facebook came up with the 87 million figure by calculating the maximum number of friends that users could have had while Kogan's app was collecting data. The company doesn't have logs going back that far, he said, so it can't know exactly how many people may have been affected.\nFacebook users who didn't get the notice can check the platform's help page to confirm that they weren't affected.\nAP Technology Writer Barbara Ortutay contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:32:32.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
