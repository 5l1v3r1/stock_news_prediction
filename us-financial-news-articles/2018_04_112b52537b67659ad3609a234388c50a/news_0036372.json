[nL3N1RT4S1] \n“The action was well-received ... and that’s giving a chance for investors to focus on macro news and earnings,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. \nHealthcare shares .SPXHC also rose after positive updates on a cancer drug from Merck ( MRK.N ), whose shares were up 2.4 percent. \nHopes that the strike against Syria would not escalate further also spurred investors to shed the U.S. dollar. \nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.4 percent, with the euro EUR= rose 0.41 percent to $1.2379. \nEuropean shares eased, adding to a mixed picture from lower Asian stock markets and suggesting that a degree of caution prevails. \nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.46 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.49 percent, though emerging market stocks dipped 0.50 percent.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \nThe yields on German DE10YT=RR and 10-year U.S. government bonds, among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were the highest in nearly two weeks and four weeks, respectively. \nThat was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week. \nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR were last down 2/32 in price to yield 2.834 percent, compared with 2.828 percent late on Friday. \nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR was higher, however, rising 2/32 in price to yield 3.0327 percent, from 3.036 percent. \nSome other traditional safe-haven bets held firmer, with gold XAU= and Japan's yen JPY= edging higher. \nDealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012. \nMeanwhile, oil prices were lower. Brent crude LCOcv1 was last at $71.39, down 1.64 percent on the day, with a rise in U.S. drilling for new production dragging on prices. \nU.S. crude oil futures CLcv1 settled at $66.22 per barrel, down 1.74 percent, or $1.17. \nFor Reuters’ Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar.
