While the government says it will remain 100 percent state-owned, unions fear that opens the door to privatisation, as happened after similar changes at France Telecom, now called Orange.\nMacron has hatched a plethora of reforms he says are needed to modernise France. He has loosened protective labour legislation by executive order and is looking to scale back the civil service and revamp the pension system.\nThe SNCF bill will now go to the Senate and the process of parliamentary approval is expected to conclude by early July.\nMacron, days away from completing his first year in office, resolutely defended his broader reform push on a meet-the-people sortie in the eastern town of Saint-Die-des-Vosges, where he was mobbed by well-wishers, protesters and TV cameras.\nThe 40-year-old president said he would not change course and decried what he called “activists ... people who decide to be against everything”.\nAn Ifop poll released on Wednesday showed far more voters find him faithful to his election pledges than predecessors: 57 percent said he was doing as promised, versus 24 percent for Francois Hollande before him and 35 percent for Nicolas Sarkozy.\nFILE PHOTO: An employee of French state-owned railway company SNCF advises a passenger at the Gare Lille Flandres railway station during a nationwide strike by French SNCF railway workers, in Lille, France, April 8, 2018.
