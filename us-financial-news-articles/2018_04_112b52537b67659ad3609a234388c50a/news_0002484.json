REUTERS/Adriana Loureiro \nThere was no immediate comment from Carabobo state police. \nVenezuela’s opposition blames the tragedy on Maduro’s inability to reform Venezuela’s lawless jails, where inmates strut around with weapons and orchestrate crimes from cells. \n“The situation in detention centres and police jail cells in Venezuela is unacceptable!” said opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro.

Maduro’s administration only issued a statement late on Friday night expressing its condolences to relatives and the president has yet to publicly speak about the deaths. \nA former bus driver and union leader who has grown widely unpopular, Maduro is running for re-election in a May election largely boycotted by the opposition. \nWith heavy use of state resources and a compliant electoral council, he is expected to win a six-year term despite salary-destroying hyperinflation, a fifth straight year of recession, and rampant crime. \nState television focussed on showing images of Venezuelans on the beach during the Easter holiday, while Maduro’s ministers also largely remained mum on the Valencia disaster. \nBut Delcy Rodriguez, the president of the pro-government legislative superbody known as the constituent assembly, struck back at criticism of the government’s handling of the jail fire. \n“We repudiate the use of Venezuelans’ pain as a political tool,” tweeted Rodriguez.
