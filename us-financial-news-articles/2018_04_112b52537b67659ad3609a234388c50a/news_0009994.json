He struck out three and walked one and departed after 96 pitches.\nRight-hander Yoshihisa Hirano pitched a perfect eighth inning and left-hander T.J. McFarland worked a flawless ninth, striking out Matt Kemp to end the contest.\nKershaw (0-2) struck out six in six innings and allowed two runs, four hits and one walk. He has allowed three runs in his two starts this season, all on solo homers.\nPeralta and Murphy each had two hits for Arizona, which had eight overall.\nDescalso smacked a one-out solo homer well over the fence in right-center field to get the Diamondbacks on the board in the second inning.\nThe Dodgers tied the score in the third as Austin Barnes hit a leadoff double to left and moved around on two fly balls with Chris Taylor’s drive to center bringing in the run.\nPeralta lined a one-out shot over the fence in right in the third to give Arizona a 2-1 lead.\nThe Diamondbacks loaded the bases with no out in the seventh against Los Angeles left-hander Scott Alexander. After Peralta struck out, Ketel Marte coaxed a walk in a 10-pitch at-bat to force in Deven Marrero and make it 3-1.\nRight-hander Pedro Baez entered and walked Paul Goldschmidt and A.J. Pollock to force in two more runs.\nMurphy added a solo blast in the eighth when he sent an offering from right-hander Zach Neal over the fence in left.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:17:21.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
