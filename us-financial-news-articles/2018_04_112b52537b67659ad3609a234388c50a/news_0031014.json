The way we see it the Microsoft workloads should go to the Microsoft cloud, the Amazon-type workloads ... should go to Amazon, the Oracle should go to the Oracle cloud.” \nCatz said Trump was very confident the Pentagon would have a fair review, adding, “I’m sure that they will”. \nEarlier this month, Trump said he would take a serious look at policies to address what he says are the unfair business advantages of online retailer Amazon.
