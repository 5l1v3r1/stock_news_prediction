We need penalties in the hundreds of millions,” he told state broadcaster the ABC.\n“The key bit of the penalty is 10 percent of the turnover - that’s the change we’ve got to make in Australia in relation to not only competition but also consumer penalties so that company boards really sit up and take notice ... and don’t just treat it as a cost of doing business.”\nHis comments came after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull admitted he had been wrong to oppose the establishment of the independent judicial inquiry into the scandal-ridden financial sector, whose daily revelations of wrongdoing have shocked the country in recent weeks.\n“Politically, all of the commentators are right when they say we would have been right to establish one earlier,” Turnbull said during a visit to Germany, according to the ABC.\nThe first three weeks of public hearings at the inquiry have been a political embarrassment for the government and a publicity disaster for Australia’s major lenders and AMP Ltd , the country’s largest listed wealth manager.\nIt has heard of strategies to deceive regulators and cases of people suffering financial distress due to poor financial advice, being charged fees for a decade after they had died and deliberately charged fees for no service.\nSims backed the government’s promise last week to double prison terms for corporate crimes to 10 years, dramatically increase financial penalties from A$10 million ($7.7 million) to up to A$210 million or 10 percent revenue, and ramp up the investigative powers of the corporate regulator.\n“I think the banks think of themselves as a protected species,” Sims said.\nAustralia’s major lenders - Commonwealth Bank of Australia , Westpac Banking Corp, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, and National Australia Bank - control 80 percent of the lending market and along with AMP, also have the lion’s share of the financial adviser market.\nBut they now face the almost certain prospect of greater regulation, stricter oversight, higher penalties and possible criminal charges.\n“It is now clear to me that the Royal Commission is necessary and justified,” NAB’s CEO Andrew Thorburn said in a statement on Monday morning, ahead of the bank’s own appearance at the inquiry.
