The company also did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nZhonghong said earlier this month it swung to a net loss of 2.5 billion yuan last year and expects to also post a net loss in the first quarter.\nThe company is undergoing a restructuring after all the shares held by its controlling shareholder, accounting for 26.55 percent of the company’s total, were frozen by a Chinese court earlier this year.\nChina HKBridge Holdings said in February it would set up a private equity fund to raise about 13 billion yuan to participate in the debt, asset and shareholding restructuring of Zhonghong, the parent company of Zhonghong Holding.
