But we are happy because we knew how to suffer without the ball.”\nBayern defender Joshua Kimmich gave the home side the lead with the help of unconvincing goalkeeping from Madrid’s Keylor Navas and Franck Ribery missed a chance to double the lead before Marcelo equalised just before halftime.\nSubstitute Marco Asensio pulled Madrid in front early in the second half by starting and finishing a sweeping counterattack.\n“The game had the circumstances that we went behind and unconsciously we sat back a bit and suffered a little and they obviously wanted to go all out and try to win the game,” Real captain Sergio Ramos said.\nSoccer Football - Champions League Semi Final First Leg - Bayern Munich vs Real Madrid - Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany - April 25, 2018 Real Madrid's Marcelo celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Michaela Rehle “We took advantage of that, we got the equaliser, we defended very well and then we killed them on a counterattack. We need to remember nights like this and learn because that’s what makes this team great.”\nSpanish newspaper AS called the result “a victory through suffering” and said Madrid “survived Bayern’s siege”.\nBarcelona-based daily Mundo Deportivo praised through gritted teeth Madrid’s knack of winning games without being at their best.\n“Just like always,” was their headline, claiming “Madrid rode their luck against an imprecise Bayern”.\nAs well as benefiting from Bayern’s profligacy, Madrid also showed their versatility when winger Lucas Vazquez switched to right back to cover for Dani Carvajal who was forced off injured. Asensio also came on to replace injured Isco.\n“Independently of how well the team played you have to hand it to Lucas Vazquez who played with all his spirit,” Ramos added.\nSlideshow (5 Images) “He held his own against Ribery, who is one of the best players in the world. It is moments like that which make this team even greater.”\nRamos was not concerned by the manner of Real’s victory and wore it as a badge of pride in a post on Instagram, posting a picture of himself clenching his fist with the message: “Know how to suffer. Know how to win. Know how to be Real Madrid.”\nReporting by Richard Martin; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T13:31:47.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
