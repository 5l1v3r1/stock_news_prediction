(2) Includes stock-based compensation expense of $0.13 for both Q2F18 results and Q3F18 guidance. (3) Refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information in Tables 1 and 2 for non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to GAAP. Adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2018, exclude the impact of the one-time, non-executive employee bonus. Fiscal Second Quarter 2018 Information\nWon 41 manufacturing programs during the quarter representing approximately $255 million in annualized revenue when fully ramped into production Trailing four quarter manufacturing wins total approximately $847 million in annualized revenue when fully ramped into production Purchased $31.6 million of our shares at an average price of $61.63 per share under our existing share repurchase program\nTodd Kelsey, President and CEO, commented, “We finished our fiscal second quarter with record revenue of $699 million as our Industrial/Commercial market sector strengthened during the quarter and our Healthcare/Life Sciences and Aerospace/Defense market sectors achieved solid sequential growth. The result was near the high-end of our guidance range and up approximately 16% from the comparable quarter last year. Our manufacturing wins were at the highest quarterly level in nearly four years at $255 million, positioning us well for continued future growth.”\nPatrick Jermain, Senior Vice President and CFO, commented, “As a result of U.S. Tax Reform enabling us to more efficiently access offshore cash, on February 20, 2018, we announced a revised capital allocation strategy intended to fund growth investments and enhance shareholder value. During the fiscal second quarter, we successfully repatriated approximately $280 million from our APAC region. We deployed the cash, as intended, by funding working capital investments, accelerating our share repurchase program, rewarding our non-executive employees through a one-time bonus and reducing borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We anticipate repatriating an additional $150 million during the fiscal third quarter while continuing to execute our revised capital allocation strategy.”\nMr. Kelsey concluded, “We are establishing revenue guidance of $700 to $740 million for the fiscal third quarter as we anticipate another quarter of record revenue. The mid-point of this guidance suggests we will achieve approximately 3% sequential quarterly revenue growth and more than 15% revenue growth from the comparable quarter last year. Further, our success ramping new programs, coupled with improving end markets, provides us increasing optimism that we will achieve revenue growth in line with our 12% target in fiscal 2018. We continue to anticipate that our operating margin will return to our target range of 4.7% to 5.0% for the remainder of fiscal 2018. Consistent with these expectations, we are guiding fiscal third quarter 2018 GAAP diluted EPS of $0.76 to $0.86.”\nQuarterly Comparison Three Months Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 30, 2017 Apr 1, 2017 (in thousands, except EPS) Q2F18 Q1F18 Q2F17 Revenue $ 698,651 $ 677,294 $ 604,349 Gross profit 52,952 63,523 63,800 Operating income 17,315 31,557 32,571 Net income (loss) 12,290 (98,493 ) 29,295 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 0.36 $ (2.93 ) $ 0.84 Adjusted net income (1) 25,466 26,019 29,295 Adjusted diluted EPS (1) $ 0.74 $ 0.75 $ 0.84 Gross margin 7.6 % 9.4 % 10.6 % Adjusted gross margin (1) 9.4 % 9.4 % 10.6 % Operating margin 2.5 % 4.7 % 5.4 % Adjusted operating margin (1) 4.4 % 4.7 % 5.4 % ROIC 15.6 % 16.2 % 16.8 % Economic Return 6.1 % 6.7 % 6.3 %\n(1) Refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information in Tables 1 and 2 for non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this release, such as adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted diluted EPS, ROIC and Economic Return, and a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP. Business Segment and Market Sector Revenue\nThe Company measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis. Plexus also reports revenue based on the market sector breakout set forth in the table below, which reflects the Company’s global market sector focused business development strategy. Top 10 customers comprised 58% of revenue during the quarter, consistent with the fiscal first quarter of 2018.\nBusiness Segments ($ in millions) Three Months Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 30, 2017 Apr 1, 2017 Q2F18 Q1F18 Q2F17 Americas $ 302 299 $ 272 Asia-Pacific 350 346 310 Europe, Middle East, and Africa 74 64 44 Elimination of inter-segment sales (27 ) (32 ) (22 ) Total Revenue $ 699 $ 677 $ 604\nMarket Sectors ($ in millions) Three Months Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 30, 2017 Apr 1, 2017 Q2F18 Q1F18 Q2F17 Healthcare/Life Sciences $ 248 35 % $ 237 35 % $ 205 34 % Industrial/Commercial 242 35 % 207 30 % 192 32 % Communications 99 14 % 133 20 % 108 18 % Aerospace/Defense 110 16 % 100 15 % 99 16 % Total Revenue $ 699 $ 677 $ 604 Non-GAAP Supplemental Information\nPlexus provides non-GAAP supplemental information, such as ROIC, Economic Return, and free cash flow, because such measures are used for internal management goals and decision making, and because they provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In addition, management uses these and other non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted diluted EPS, to provide a better understanding of core performance for purposes of period-to-period comparisons. Plexus believes that these measures are also useful to investors because they provide further insight by eliminating the effect of items, such as the one-time, non-executive employee bonus and the transitional effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”), that are not reflective of continuing operations. For a full reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures, please refer to Non-GAAP Supplemental Information and the attached Non-GAAP Supplemental Information Tables.\nROIC and Economic Return\nROIC for the fiscal second quarter of 2018 was 15.6%. The Company defines ROIC as tax-effected annualized adjusted operating income divided by average invested capital over a three-quarter period for the second quarter. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt, less cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s weighted average cost of capital for fiscal 2018 is 9.5%. ROIC for the quarter less the Company’s weighted average cost of capital resulted in an economic return of 6.1%.\nFree Cash Flow Calculation\nThe Company defines free cash flow as cash flows provided by operations less capital expenditures. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, cash flows used in operations was $66.3 million, less capital expenditures of $12.4 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $78.7 million. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, cash flows provided by operations was $2.8 million, less capital expenditures of $29.1 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $26.3 million.\nCash Cycle Days Three Months Ended Mar 31, 2018 Dec 30, 2017 Apr 1, 2017 Q2F18 Q1F18 Q2F17 Days in Accounts Receivable 52 45 48 Days in Inventory 100 100 103 Days in Accounts Payable (61) (63) (64) Days in Cash Deposits (15) (15) (14) Annualized Cash Cycle* 76 67 73 * We calculate cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in cash deposits.
