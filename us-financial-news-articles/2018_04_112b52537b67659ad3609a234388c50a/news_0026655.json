Another $1.2 billion of refunding bonds have term maturities in 2033 and 2038.\nPart of the proceeds will advance refund some of the state’s outstanding tax-exempt GO bonds. Federal tax legislation signed into law in December by President Donald Trump ended the ability of muni issuers to refund outstanding bonds beyond 90 days of their call date on a tax-exempt basis.\nThe bonds, which are rated AA-minus by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings and Aa3 by Moody’s Investors Service, are scheduled to be priced through J.P. Morgan Securities on Tuesday.\nOverall, $7.66 billion of bonds and notes are expected to hit the muni market next week, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.\nCalifornia’s Sacramento County will sell $588 million of airport system senior revenue refunding bonds through Morgan Stanley on Thursday. The deal includes about $277 million of bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax.\nTopping the week’s competitive calendar is a nearly $315 million Memphis, Tennessee, general improvement bond sale on Tuesday. The bonds carry serial maturities in 2019 through 2048, according to the POS.\nThe state of Tennessee is selling a two-part $191 million GO bond issue on Wednesday.\nFlows into municipal bond funds were negative for a second-straight week, according to Lipper. Funds reported $244.7 million in net outflows for the week ended April 11, slightly lower than the $247.1 million in outflows during the previous week.\nApril outflows are typically attributed to investors cashing in muni investments to pay their taxes.\nReporting By Karen Pierog; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:26:08.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
