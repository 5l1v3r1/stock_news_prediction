They have a total capacity of 588,000 bpd.\nRefining volumes for export markets were not released.\nThe four group refineries are: Showa Shell’s 255,000-bpd Yokkaichi plant, unit Toa Oil’s 70,000-bpd Keihin plant, affiliate Seibu Oil’s 120,000-bpd Yamaguchi refinery and a 143,000-bpd Sodegaura refinery operated by Fuji Oil in which Showa Shell has a 6.6 percent stake.\nThere will be no group refinery maintenance during the three months, a Showa Shell spokeswoman said.\nIdemitsu Kosan Co has completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, but its goals for full integration have been delayed indefinitely after opposition from Idemitsu’s founding family.
