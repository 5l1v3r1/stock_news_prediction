We must be moving in that direction like many (national oil companies) have done... Maybe not in the following years. But yes, we have talked about it.” (Reporting by Shadia Nasralla; editing by Jason Neely)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:53:32.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
