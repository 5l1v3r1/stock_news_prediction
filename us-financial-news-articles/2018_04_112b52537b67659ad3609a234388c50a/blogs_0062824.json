It brought in an estimated $258 million in domestic receipts.\n\"This is why people go to the movies. They're going to keep going this summer. This is going to be a really strong summer,\" Dergarabedian said on \" Power Lunch .\" Source: Walt Disney Studios. Avengers: Infinity War.\n\"Infinity War\" unites the Avengers and the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" on screen for the first time, and further weaves in new characters, like \"Doctor Strange\" and \"Spider-Man\" into the Marvel Universe. It also features supervillain Thanos, who has lurked in the shadows of brief post-credit scenes and cameos for the last six years.\nDergarabedian said the run-up to \"Infinity War\" was \"incredible, with movies like \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\" \"Spider-Man Homecoming,\" \"Thor: Ragnarok\" and the record-breaking \"Black Panther\" all doing well at the box office and with critics.\nAnd the movie itself has a lot of staying power, he said. The next big release is not expected for a few weeks when \"Deadpool 2\" opens, followed by \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\"\n\"We could be looking a record-breaking month of May at the box office,\" Dergarabedian said.\nIt all goes to show that movie-going isn't dead.\n\"It's really based on the product. If the movies are good, people love going to the movie theater,\" he said.\nâ€” CNBC's Tom DiChristopher and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T22:18:21.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
