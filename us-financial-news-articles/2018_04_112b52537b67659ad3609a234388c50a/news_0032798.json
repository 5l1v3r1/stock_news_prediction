Manulife Financial jumped 1.9 percent, while TD Bank gained 0.5 percent.\n* The energy sector rose 2.9 percent, as oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on a decline in U.S. crude inventories and after sources signaled top exporter Saudi Arabia wants to see prices closer to $100 a barrel.\n* Shares of Suncor Energy rose 2 percent and oil and gas producer Canadian Natural Resources ticked 2.5 percent higher.\n* Canadian Pacific Railway gained 0.94 percent and rival Canadian National Railway was up 1.76 percent, rising with U.S. railroad companies after CSX Corp's strong results.\n** CP Rail's gains were likely curbed after Teamsters Canada said the railroad's workers will go on strike on April 21 following a stalemate in talks between the two parties.\n* The TSX posted 14 new 52-week highs and two new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 22 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows.\n* The biggest percentage gainer on the TSX was Hudbay Minerals, which rose 8.5 percent, while the largest decliner was Alaris Royalty, down 6.0 percent.\n* Among the most active stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc , Bombardier and Athabasca Oil Co.\n* Volume on the TSX index was 91.57 million shares, While the total volume on Wednesday was 155.44 million shares.
