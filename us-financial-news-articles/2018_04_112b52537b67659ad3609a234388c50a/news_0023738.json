A proof-of-life photograph released immediately after their kidnapping showed them chained and padlocked by the neck.\nMore than a thousand FARC fighters refused to demobilize under the accord with Santos and continue drug trafficking across the nation.\nThose operating in Colombia’s southern jungles have attacked Ecuadorean security forces along the border.\nThe FARC, which battled for more than a half century, attacked military targets and civilian towns, but generally allowed journalists to work freely, unless they went against the rebels’ interests.\nReporting by Alexandra Valencia in Quito,; Writing by Helen Murphy in Bogota; Editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T08:52:16.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
