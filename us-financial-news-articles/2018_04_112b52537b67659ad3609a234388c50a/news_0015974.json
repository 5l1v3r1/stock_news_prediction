They did not detain any suspects.\nThe investigators believe the suspects are members of the Reichsbuerger (Citizens of the Reich) group, who do not recognize modern-day Germany as a legitimate state and insist the former, far larger “Deutsche Reich” is still alive despite Nazi Germany’s defeat in World War Two.\nThe domestic intelligence service estimates that the Reichsbuerger have several thousand members.\nOne of them shot dead a police officer in Bavaria in October 2016 as a police team was about to enter his home to seize his hunting and sports guns, which the authorities deemed he was not fit to hold as a member of the group.\nSunday’s raids were not linked to the incident in Muenster on Saturday, when a man drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant, killing two of them before shooting himself dead, the prosecutor’s office said.\nWriting by Paul Carrel, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:16:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
