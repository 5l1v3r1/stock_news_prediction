Next year, the world’s fourth most populous country is going to have parliamentary and presidential elections. \nIndonesians have to contend with high levels of graft in many areas of their life and money politics during elections is often rife despite efforts by the country’s independent anti-corruption eradication agency. \nIndonesia placed 96th out of 180 countries in Transparency annual corruption perceptions index last year, on par with Colombia and Thailand. \nIndonesia’s central bank, which was involved in drafting the bill, thinks the proposed limit could improve law enforcement, Bank Indonesia governor Agus Martowardojo said. \n“For us who is in charge of payment system, cash transaction is fine, but non cash is more efficient,” Martowardojo said, adding that the plan also supports BI’s campaign of getting more people to transact electronically. $1 = 13,773.0000 rupiah Reporting by Maikel JefriandoWriting by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Ed Davies and Kim Coghill", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T14:08:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
