Mnuchin, who declined to comment on the timing of the visit, said he is “cautiously optimistic” about reaching an agreement with Beijing that could defuse the bilateral trade conflict that has rattled world markets in recent weeks. Mnuchin told reporters Saturday that he met with Yi Gang, China’s central-bank governor, at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Yi passed along Mnuchin’s message about his interest in going to Beijing, according to people familiar with the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T14:59:51.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
