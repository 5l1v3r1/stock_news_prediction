Ernesto Mastrascusa/Pool via Reuters Diaz-Canel, 58, was sworn in on Thursday as president to succeed his mentor Raul Castro, 86, in a transition designed to continue rather than change the one-party socialist system, one of the last in the world.\nMaduro flew to Havana the following day to congratulate him and map out further cooperation between the two countries that became strategic allies in 2000 with the rise to power in Venezuela of socialist leader Hugo Chavez.\n“We come to renew hope, to renew dreams and ... above all, to visualize the 10 years ahead,” Maduro told Cuban state-run media shortly before meeting with Diaz-Canel in the Palace of the Revolution.\nVenezuela, which holds the world’s largest oil reserves, exchanges oil for Cuban medical and other technical services, although deliveries have dropped over the past few years, hurting Cuba’s already struggling economy.\nIn a change from official events during the nearly 60 years that the Castro brothers led Cuba, Diaz-Canel’s wife Lis Cuesta attended the welcome ceremony at the Palace of the Revolution as first lady.\nAn honour guard arrives for a wreath-laying ceremony with Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (not pictured) at the Jose Marti monument in Havana, Cuba April 21, 2018.
