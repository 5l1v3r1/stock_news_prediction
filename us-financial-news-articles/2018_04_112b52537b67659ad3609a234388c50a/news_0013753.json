On Friday, the value of a Bitcoin was around $6,600, down from its all-time high of $20,000 in late 2017. \nDuring the first three months of this year, cryptocurrency funds , which invest directly in a range of cryptocurrencies, have shed an average of 52% in value, according to Hedge Fund Research. Meanwhile, hedge funds, which generally invest in stocks, gained an average of 0.4% over the same period. \nIn recent months, regulators across the globe have started paying closer attention to cryptocurrencies, which has scared off investors. Interest in Bitcoin also appears to have waned, with the number of searches in the asset—which has generally followed its price—also falling since the start of the year. \nStill, despite the declines in cryptocurrency prices this year, funds that started investing in cryptocurrency at the start of 2017 have reaped huge profits. Since then, the average return is 2,908%, according to Hedge Fund Research, compared with a 9% gain for hedge funds over the same period. \nSome 167 cryptocurrency-related funds opened in 2017, according to Autonomous Research, while 20 have opened this year.
