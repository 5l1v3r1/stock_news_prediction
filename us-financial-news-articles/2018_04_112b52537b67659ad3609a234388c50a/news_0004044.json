Air Industries will delay the filing of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to complications in financial reporting resulting from the recently announced sale of Welding Metallurgy, Inc. (WMI).\nAir Industries’ results continue to reflect new management’s ongoing realignment of the business with a focus on meeting customer needs and profitability, culminating in the execution on March 21 st of an agreement to sell WMI and 1st quarter 2018 modest positive EBITDA from operations absent the results of WMI.\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $63.0 million vs $66.7 million in 2016. However, absent the revenues from WMI and AMK which was sold in January 2017, pro forma revenue for fiscal 2017 was $49.5 million vs $46.8 million for fiscal 2016. Sales in the 4th quarter of 2017 were negatively impacted as management realigned production to more accurately reflect customers’ long term product needs. Gross Profit exclusive of the results of WMI and AMK for fiscal 2017 was $4.7 million vs $4.1 million for fiscal 2016.\nPreliminary first quarter 2018 revenues continue to reflect the Company’s focus on improvements on a quarterly basis. Revenue absent that of WMI was $12.4 million in the 1st quarter 2018 vs revenue absent that of WMI and AMK of $12.3 million in the comparable period of 2017. First quarter sales exclusive of WMI also compare favorably to the 4th quarter 2017’s revenue exclusive of WMI of $9.6 million.\nThe previously announced sale of WMI will improve the Company’s cash position and balance sheet. The closing is anticipated in May 2018.\nMr. Lou Melluzzo, who became Chief Executive Officer of Air Industries on September 11, 2017 commented:\n“In the 4th quarter of 2017, I recognized the need to more appropriately align our production schedules to meet the needs of our customers. As we made these changes the Company took a significant revenue hit which obviously impacted the fourth quarter. However, I am confident that we are now positioned to better execute on our existing backlog of orders in a timely fashion as well as take on additional commitments, as partly demonstrated by our first quarter 2018 revenue absent that of WMI of over $12 million. This is a significant increase from the fourth quarter of 2017. In addition, we continued to focus on implementing operating efficiencies; since I joined the Company we reduced our expenses by an annualized rate of about $4 million.\nOur previously announced sale of Welding Metallurgy, has us focused on complex machined products for aircraft landing gear and jet turbine applications, a focus that I personally feel very comfortable with and one which leaves us plenty of opportunities beyond executing on shipping out the already strong 18 month backlog of $106 million. Shareholders should expect sequential improvement quarterly.”\nThe Company will announce the timing of its conference call to discuss fiscal 2017 results at the time the 10-K is filed.\nABOUT AIR INDUSTRIES GROUP\nAir Industries Group (AIRI) is an integrated manufacturer of precision equipment assemblies and components for leading aerospace and defense prime contractors.\nCertain matters discussed in this press release are 'forward-looking statements' intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
