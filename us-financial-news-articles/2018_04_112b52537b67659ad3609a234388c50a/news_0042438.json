Due to the previously announced asset sale to Silicon Labs (NASDAQ:SLAB) the Company will not hold an earnings conference call.\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $26.5 million. This compares with net revenue of $33.9 million reported in the previous quarter, and net revenue of $42.7 million in the same period in fiscal 2017.\nGAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 42.1%. This compares with GAAP gross margin of 50.5% in the previous quarter, and GAAP gross margin of 50.1% for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 38.0%. This compares with non-GAAP gross margin of 54.7% in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP gross margin of 50.6% for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nGAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $80.0 million, which includes impairment charges of $40.8 million and restructuring charges of $6.8 million. This compares with GAAP operating expenses of $36.0 million in the previous quarter, and GAAP operating expenses of $28.6 million for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $28.3 million. This compares with non-GAAP operating expenses of $27.8 million in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP operating expenses of $26.0 million for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nGAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was ($73.4) million, or ($1.88) per share. This compares with a GAAP net loss of ($19.1) million, or ($0.49) per share, in the previous quarter, and a GAAP net loss of ($8.7) million, or ($0.23) per share, for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was ($21.6) million, or ($0.55) per share. This compares with a non-GAAP net loss of ($9.6) million, or ($0.25) per share, in the previous quarter, and a non-GAAP net loss of ($5.9) million, or ($0.16) per diluted share, for the same period in fiscal 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $40.6 million.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Results\nNet revenue in fiscal 2018 was $139.5 million, compared with $220.5 million in the previous fiscal year, prior to Assets held for sale adjustments of ($73.6 million) in fiscal 2018 and ($86.1 million) in fiscal 2017. The Assets held for sale adjustments consist of the financial results of Sigma’s Z-Wave business and Media Connectivity business, each of which were deemed to be held for sale as of February 3, 2018.\nGAAP gross margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was 47.1%, compared with 48.1% in fiscal 2017, prior to Assets held for sale adjustments.\nNon-GAAP gross margin from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was 37.4%, compared with 41.5% in fiscal 2017, which is after adjusting for Assets held for sale.\nGAAP operating expenses from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 were $179.0 million, compared with $117.3 million in fiscal 2017, prior to Assets held for sale adjustments of $37.2 million in fiscal 2018 and $34.7 million in fiscal 2017.\nIncluded in the fiscal 2018 results were impairment charges of $50.4 million and restructuring charges of $9.3 million.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 were $73.1 million, compared with $74.9 million in fiscal 2017, which is after adjusting for Assets held for sale.\nGAAP net loss from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 was ($120.0) million, or net loss of ($3.12) per basic share, which is the same result after adjusting for Assets held for sale. This compares with a GAAP net loss of ($18.3) million, or a net loss of ($0.49) per diluted share, in fiscal 2017, which is the same result after adjusting for Assets held for sale.\nNon-GAAP net loss in fiscal 2018 was ($51.3) million, or net loss of ($1.31) per share, after adjusting for Assets held for sale. This compares with a non-GAAP net loss of ($9.5) million, or a net loss of ($0.66) per share, in fiscal 2017, after adjusting for Assets held for sale.\nThe reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial results for all referenced periods is provided in a table immediately following the GAAP financial tables below.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), Sigma also reports non-GAAP financial measures, as Sigma believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, but should be considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financials measures. The Company presents non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate its operating results in a manner that focuses on what management believes to be its core, ongoing business operations. Furthermore, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may not be the same non-GAAP financial measures as those utilized by other companies; specifically, non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently than other companies. Investors should, therefore, exercise caution when comparing non-GAAP financial measures used by Sigma to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies.\nSigma’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude amortization of acquired intangibles, stock-based compensation, one-time legal and other professional fee expenses, net gain on the sale of and impairment of privately-held investments, impairment of purchased IP, mask sets used in production and one-time restructuring charges. The tax amounts included in Sigma’s non-GAAP results approximate its operating cash tax expense, similar to the liability reported on Sigma’s tax returns. In the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation at the end of this press release, we have disclosed the impact of these income tax adjustments in our calculation of our non-GAAP financial results.\nSigma believes that its non-GAAP measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. Sigma also believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information for investors to evaluate Sigma’s operating results in the same manner as the research analysts that follow Sigma’s progress, all of whom present non-GAAP projections in their published reports.\nSigma uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate and assess its performance and operating results on a consistent basis, and to measure and compare its performance with the financial projections published by analysts as well as its direct competitors in the industry, many of whom report financial results on a non-GAAP basis. The economic substance behind its decision to use non-GAAP measures is that such measures approximate its controllable operating performance more closely than the most directly comparable GAAP financial results. For example, Sigma’s management has no control over certain variables that have a major influence in the determination of stock-based compensation. These variables include the volatility of its stock price and changing interest rates. Sigma believes that all of these excluded expenses in its non-GAAP financial measures may not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing operations for the period in which they are incurred, even though some of these excluded items may be incurred and reflected in Sigma’s GAAP financial results in the foreseeable future. Sigma believes that the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures provides consistency and comparability with past reports and provides a better understanding of the overall performance of the business and its ability to perform in subsequent periods.\nSigma Designs is a registered trademark of Sigma Designs, Inc. in the United States and other countries.\nAbout Sigma Designs, Inc.\nSigma Designs, Inc. ® (NASDAQ:SIGM) is developing technology for use in the mobile Internet of Things (IoT) market.
