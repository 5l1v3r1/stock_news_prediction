A report this year found missing spare parts and quality defects mean less than half of Germany’s submarines, warplanes and some other key weapons are ready for use.\nThe newspaper report, citing a list of purchases the ministry wants to make, said the budget and defense committees were due to approve 18 contracts each worth more than 25 million euros.\nThe ministry was not immediately available for comment on the report.\nHandelsblatt said orders include procuring Israeli Heron TP drones, which Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and their junior coalition partner, the Social Democrats (SPD), agreed in their coalition deal earlier this year.\nGermany’s armed forces are also due to get seven rescue helicopters, the newspaper said. It said the Defense Ministry wanted to extend the contract for the deployment of Ukrainian Antonov transport aircraft for the period 2019 to 2021.\nThe ministry also wants to procure six of Lockheed Martin Corp’s C-130J Hercules transport aircraft, the newspaper said.\nIt said the list included several improvements for Puma armored personnel carriers, a maintenance contract for NH90 helicopters, radar technology for the Eurofighter, telecommunication facilities for frigates and new uniforms and protective equipment.\nIt said officials had described the list as “preliminary” and would depend on the 2018 budget.\nReporting by Michelle Martin, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T19:49:50.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
