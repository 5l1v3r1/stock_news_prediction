(NASDAQ:MBII) (MBI or the “Company”), a leading provider of bio-based pest management and plant health products for the agriculture, turf and ornamental and water treatment markets, announced today the closing of its previously announced underwritten public offering of registered shares of its common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million. A total of 7,275,000 shares were sold in the offering at a price to the public of $1.65 per share. The net proceeds are expected to be approximately $11.0 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts, commissions, and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.\nIn connection with the offering, the Company has also granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,091,250 shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any, which if exercised in full would increase the gross proceeds of the offering to $13.8 million, and anticipated net proceeds to $12.7 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily for general corporate purposes.\n”We have been steadfast in shoring up our balance sheet over the last 13 months. With the closing of this transaction, we would like to message to our stakeholders and stockholders that we are on solid footing to execute upon our commercial strategies,” said Dr. Pam Marrone, CEO and Founder of Marrone Bio Innovations.\n“I have been in the agrichemical industry for many decades, and I am truly excited by the strong market momentum I have seen developing for biologicals over the past year and the global potential of MBI’s products, both in specialty and large acre crops, particularly MBI’s recent success in penetrating the seed treatment segment. With this transaction, MBI is now well positioned both financially and technologically for accelerating growth,” said Bob Woods, MBI’s new elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nNational Securities Corporation (“NSC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of National Holdings Corporation (Nasdaq:NHLD), acted as sole book-running manager for the offering.\nThis closing follows two previous capital raising events also managed by NSC. Most recently, NSC acted as exclusive placement agent and financial advisor in connection with a transformative financing in February 2018 involving a $30.0 million private placement to new strategic agricultural institutional investors and the conversion into equity of $45.0 million of the debt held by the Company’s senior secured creditors. Last week, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to register the shares of common stock, including shares of common stock underlying warrants, issued in connection with those transactions, as required under related agreements. The shares may not be sold under the registration statement, however, until the registration statement has been declared effective and until a lock-up agreement expires on August 4, 2018. In addition, NSC acted as sole book-running manager for the Company’s $9.2 million public offering of its common stock in April 2017. These transactions, when combined with the Company’s April 2018 offering, represent an aggregate of $96.2 million in new equity of the Company.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Marrone Bio Innovations, Inc., and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any security in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nThe securities described in the first and second paragraph above were offered by the Company pursuant to a “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-215024), including a base prospectus, previously filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 6, 2017.
