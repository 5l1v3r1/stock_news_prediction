The U.S. Postal Service’s board has been empty since December 2016, leaving Postmaster General Megan Brennan and her deputy to run the largest civilian employer in the country after Walmart Inc. WMT 0.20% The empty seats have left the USPS with a leadership shortage, the WSJ’s Heidi Vogt writes, as it comes under a critical spotlight, with President Donald Trump aiming barbs at the Postal Service over its dealings with a major customer, Amazon.com Inc. But other big shipping customers like catalog mailers say the vacuum at the top is “a huge problem,” with agreements set to expire and Board approval needed to renew the discounts in their deals. Mr. Trump has three nominees before Congress, but there’s no push at the White House or in Congress to get them delivered.\nThe new leadership at Seaspan Corp. SSW 2.39% is filling out the management team as the container shipping charter giant prepares for potential consolidation. Seaspan named Ryan Cameron Courson as chief financial officer, bucking maritime-world tradition by naming a 29-year-old who’s spent his carrier outside the shipping business to a key executive post. Seaspan is on the rebound from a shipping-industry downturn, and Mr. Courson tells the WSJ’s Ezequiel Minaya the company expects container ship lessors “will consolidate and we believe that we will drive that consolidation.” It’s unusual for companies of Seaspan’s scale to hire such a young CFO, but Mr. Courson says his focus on industrial companies at previous posts has prepared him for the position. That background includes time analyzing investments in infrastructure and transportation, as well as work with Seaspan Chairman David Sokol at another company accustomed to acquisitions— Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\nTrepidation over trade is starting to overshadow joy over job growth in the factory sector. Manufacturing has added nearly 300,000 positions since the November 2016 election in one of the strongest such stretches in decades, but the WSJ’s Andrew Tangel and Harriet Torry report factory owners warn their strong run could be undercut if the escalating rhetoric flowing between the U.S. and China leads to higher levies . Companies like Wisconsin generator maker Generac Holdings Inc. say tariffs could raise the costs of its parts and materials, endangering demand and jobs. Companies say retaliatory tariffs targeting American agricultural producers could also echo across supply chains, driving down commodity prices and undercutting demand for farm equipment. President Trump acknowledges the potential harm to the farm sector , the WSJ’s Michael C. Bender writes, and wants options from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help farmers, promising “we’ll make it up to them.”\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES Photo: Bloomberg News Apple Inc. is turning its sustainability efforts to its supply chain now that the company has reached a critical goal in its own operations. The electronics giant says its world-wide facilities now are powered exclusively by renewable energy, the WSJ’s Tripp Mickle and Timothy Puko report, including its retail stores, offices, data centers and partner data centers, as well as its new headquarters in California . More than 100 companies around the world, including Apple, IKEA, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA and Starbucks Corp. , pledged in 2014 to shift to 100% renewable energy. By the end of 2016, 25 had already met the pledge, according to the collaborative, named RE100. Many of those companies are now trying to accelerate efforts to get suppliers on board. Apple has a famously far-flung supply chain, and the bigger challenge will be making the manufacturers of the more than 200 million iPhones and 43 million iPads it sells annually wholly dependent on renewable energy.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We’re not going to stop until our supply chain is 100% renewable. ’\n—Lisa Jackson, Apple vice president of environment.\nNumber of the Day 2.7% Year-over-year decline in lumber and wood products shipments on U.S. railroads in March, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS The U.S. dollar has already fallen 2.3% against a basket of currencies this year.
