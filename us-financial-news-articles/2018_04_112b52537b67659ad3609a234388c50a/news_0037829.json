Still, analysts expect moderate price appreciation in China’s vast number of smaller centres where regulations are less restrictive.\nChina’s construction and manufacturing accounted for 39 percent of gross domestic product in the first quarter, in line with its 41 percent share in the previous quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on the statistics bureau data.\nThe services sector continued to be the biggest contributor to GDP, accounting for 57 percent of China’s economic output in the first quarter.\nServices grew 7.5 percent from a year earlier, slowing from 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter, while agriculture expanded 3.2 percent in January-March, easing from the 4.4 pace in the previous three months.\nReal estate grew 4.9 percent in the first quarter, marginally faster than the 4.8 percent pace in the previous quarter.\nAccommodation and catering expanded 7.0 percent, little changed from 7.1 percent growth in October-December.\nThe retail and wholesale sector slowed slightly to 6.8 percent growth from 6.9 percent in the previous quarter.\nThe tech sector sustained its double-digit growth in the first quarter, though its pace slowed slightly to 29.2 percent from 33.8 percent in October-December.
