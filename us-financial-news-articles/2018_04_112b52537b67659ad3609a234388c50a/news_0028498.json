Koolman faces up to 20 years in prison, according to court papers.\nU.S. officials have expressed growing concern in recent years about foreign officials using American banks to stow the proceeds of corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime for U.S.-tied companies to bribe overseas officials to win business.\nIn connection with the scheme, an American, Lawrence Parker, pleaded guilty in December to paying bribes for 10 years to win mobile phone sales with SETAR. Parker and Koolman are awaiting sentencing scheduled for later this year.\nReporting by Joel Schectman; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:25:50.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
