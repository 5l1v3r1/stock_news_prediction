An Australian newspaper had reported that conglomerate Wesfarmers had acquired a 3 percent to 4 percent stake in the builder. Fletcher’s CEO said that was not the case in his market update on Tuesday.\n$1 = 1.3759 New Zealand dollars Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield; Editing by Peter Cooney and Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T03:15:39.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
