Whitbread shares got an initial boost after announcing the spin-off of Costa Coffee - a move long sought by activist investors - but then retreated and were last 1.5 percent down on the day.\nBritain’s Lloyds Banking Group lost 0.7 percent after slightly missing expectations for pre-tax profits but Jefferies analysts said the earnings figures were unlikely to change the overall picture.\n“We do not see consensus estimates moving either way post today’s release”, they wrote.\nLloyd also said it would not cancel its preference shares following investor complaints about the possibility after insurer Aviva AV.L abandoned its plans to scrap the high-yielding shares.
