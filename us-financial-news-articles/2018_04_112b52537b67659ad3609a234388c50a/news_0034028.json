He told May in a bilateral meeting that Brexit offered opportunities to increase trade ties between Britain and India, the statement added.\nBritain is due to leave the EU in March 2019 but has negotiated a conditional transition or implementation period to last until January 2021.\n“May said the implementation period agreed in March gives Indian companies and investors the confidence that market access will continue on current terms until the end of 2020,” the statement said.\n“She reiterated that the UK will remain committed to global free trade and investment and that the UK will remain a leading hub for global finance,” it added.
