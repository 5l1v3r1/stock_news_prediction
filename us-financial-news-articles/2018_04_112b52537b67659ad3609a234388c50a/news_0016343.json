Lantuh brings extensive cybersecurity experience and business success, most recently having served as Executive Chairman of eSentire, where he provided both strategic and operational leadership to support the company’s growth and market expansion, culminating in the sale of eSentire to Warburg Pincus.\n“Enterprises are challenged by the complexity of managing many disparate security tools – which ultimately means threats aren’t detected early enough, putting sensitive data at risk,” said Lantuh. “The continued growth potential of Fidelis is extremely high as the company protects data for many of the world’s largest brands and government organizations by automating detection and response across networks, endpoints and cloud environments.”\nLantuh will succeed interim President and CEO, John McCormack, who will return to the Chairman of the Board role at Fidelis.\n“We are thrilled to have the caliber and expertise of Nick join Fidelis to lead the company in this phase of our growth,” said McCormack. “Nick’s track record of success in driving growth through customer success and disruptive innovation speaks for itself and I’m confident that with Nick’s leadership Fidelis will accelerate the success of our unique Elevate platform deployed in a quarter of the Fortune 100 as well as the most sensitive government networks in the world.”\nPrior to eSentire, Lantuh was the founder and President of NetWitness (acquired by EMC in 2011),where he raised funding, built the management team and ran day-to-day operations from inception through sale. Lantuh’s leadership resulted in a #21 overall ranking on the 2010 Inc. 500 List of Fastest Growing Private Companies in the U.S. and a #1 ranking as the Inc. 500 Fastest Growing Software Company in the U.S.\nLantuh holds a BS from Cornell University, and an MBA from the University of Rochester’s Simon Graduate School of Business.\nAbout Fidelis Cybersecurity®\nFidelis is the leader in automated detection and response.
