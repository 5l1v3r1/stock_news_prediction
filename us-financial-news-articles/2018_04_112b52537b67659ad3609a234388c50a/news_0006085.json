Up until Wednesday’s close, the stock had lost about half its value in the past year despite a rise in crude oil prices CLc1.\nNew York-based Kimmeridge now owns or controls about 8.1 percent of Carrizo’s float, roughly 6.6 million shares, according to a regulatory filing. The firm, which is now the company’s fourth-largest shareholder, previously held about 4.9 percent of shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nCarrizo should sell its Eagle Ford shale acreage in East Texas to cull debt and focus entirely on its operations in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, Kimmeridge said.\n“If management wanted us to run the company, we’d be happy to do that, too,” Dell said, noting Kimmeridge has held Permian acreage in the past and is comfortable operating oil assets.\n“We are not your classical New York activist hedge fund with a short duration model.”\nKimmeridge said Carrizo should also consider a stock buyback or a merger with a Permian rival. Concho Resources Inc ( CXO.N ) last week said it would combine with Permian rival RSP Permian Inc ( RSPP.N ) in an $8 billion all-stock deal.\nKimmeridge said in the filing that it was concerned about Carrizo’s debt, up 80 percent in the past five years at $1.63 billion, more than the company’s market valuation.\nCarrizo lost $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 even as its production jumped 13 percent to 62,417 barrels of oil equivalent.\nAdditional reporting by David French in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:15:52.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
