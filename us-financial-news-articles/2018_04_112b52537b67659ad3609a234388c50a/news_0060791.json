The addition of the PWS product suite gives SentryOne the most robust and comprehensive offering available for the Microsoft data professional, both on premises and in the cloud.\nThrough this acquisition, SentryOne will offer significantly broader coverage of database systems—from the beginning of the development cycle through production deployment and monitoring—and will provide scale to meet the demands of enterprise environments. SentryOne solutions now include powerful development capabilities for Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), such as data and schema comparison and synchronization, package and report comparison, best practices analysis, and integration with Visual Studio and SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). Unique features for data lineage tracking and unit testing round out the portfolio, enabling advanced scenarios for DevOps as well as GDPR.\n\"To date, SentryOne solutions have focused primarily on optimizing production assets already deployed to the data center or cloud,\" said Greg Gonzalez, SentryOne founder and Chief Technology Officer. \"However, good design and performance start on the developer's desktop. PWS solutions shift us far to the left in the development lifecycle, enabling SentryOne to deliver an unrivaled end-to-end capability for DBAs, developers, DevOps, BI professionals, and compliance managers alike.\"\nSentryOne immediately will allow partners to sell and refer all products and will soon release joint bundles with solutions from both companies.\n\"SentryOne has been growing at a rate of more than 45%,\" said Bob Potter, Chief Executive Officer of SentryOne. \"This high growth mode will continue to accelerate both organically and through the acquisition of really great companies like Pragmatic Works Software.\"\n\"I have long admired the leadership at SentryOne,\" said Brian Knight, owner and founder of Pragmatic Works. \"The decision to spin off our software business to focus on consulting and training was made easier knowing that our engineers and developers would be joining the leader in highly scalable enterprise database performance monitoring.\" Knight and Tim Moolic, Pragmatic Works Chief Operating Officer, will consult for SentryOne throughout the integration. Brian Knight will join the SentryOne Advisory Board. John Welch, President of PWS, will join SentryOne as Vice President of Engineering.\nFinancial terms were not disclosed.
