Existing investors include U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.\nSenseTime said its latest funding set a world record for the amount raised in a single round by an AI firm, and that it was now the world’s most valuable AI company. It did not provide its current valuation.\nBloomberg reported that the round valued SenseTime at over $3 billion. A SenseTime spokeswoman said that figure did not reflect the current valuation as the firm has moved into the C+ round of fundraising.\nShe declined to disclose SenseTime’s current valuation due to ongoing fundraising.\nAlibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joe Tsai said in a statement, “We are especially impressed by their R&D capabilities in deep learning and visual computing. Our business at Alibaba is already seeing tangible benefits from our investments in AI and we are committed to further investment.”\nSenseTime in July raised $410 million in series-B funding led by China’s CDH Investments and state-backed fund Sailing Capital, which valued it at over $1.5 billion.
