REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nFinancial institutions are actively boosting lending at low interest rates to “middle risk companies” in the face of heated competition among lenders, as the central bank continues with its low-rate policy even as the economy recovers. \nMany of these so-called middle risk companies have less internal funds than blue chip firms and tend to rely on borrowing particularly when low interest rates are offered, the central bank noted in a twice-yearly financial system report. \nThe warning comes at a time when the rising cost of prolonged easing such as the hit to bank profits from ultra-low rates has prompted lawmakers and analysts to urge the BOJ to explain how it plans to unwind its ultra-loose monetary policy. \nWith inflation remaining distant from its 2 percent target despite more than five years of massive money printing, however, the central bank is in no mood to rush to exit from its ultra-loose monetary policy. \nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said that debating an exit strategy openly now would cause confusion to markets. \nThe financial system report said less profitable financial institutions were prone to offering loans to middle risk firms in order to boost lending and profits. \nThe report urged financial institutions to improve credit risk management by setting lending rates at appropriate levels reflecting the risks of borrowers and by verifying provisioning. \nProvisioning against debt risk by banks is relatively low now in Japan. \n“However, if the economy suffers negative shocks in such cases as economic downturn and rises in interest rates ... there could be a sudden rise in credit costs,” the report warned.
