Our teams have made good progress since then,\" Schrage and Ginsberg said. \"By working with the academic community, we can help people better understand the broader impact of social media on democracy — as well as improve our work to protect the integrity of elections.\"\nFacebook is not funding the study, nor will it have approval over the research topics or findings. Instead an independent group of scholars will solicit research proposals and grant access to privacy-protected datasets from Facebook.\n\"Fundamental to this entire effort is ensuring that people's information is secure and kept private. Facebook and our funding partners recognize the threat presented by the recent misuse of Facebook data, including by an academic associated with Cambridge Analytica,\" Schrage and Ginsberg said. \"At the same time, we believe strongly that the public interest is best served when independent researchers have access to information.\" \nThe initiative is funded by the John and Laura Arnold Foundation, Democracy Fund, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the John S. and James L.
