Those delays have grown in recent years, and the government did not make any payments incurred last year.\nAccording to the resolution outlined in the government’s official gazette, state-owned oil company YPF SA is owed $792 million under a formula that takes into account exchange rate movements. Last month, YPF told investors it was owed $780 million in unpaid subsidies corresponding to 2017.\nOthers eligible for payments include BP Plc’s Pan American Energy, which is owed $163 million, France’s Total SA, which is owed $160 million, Germany’s Wintershall [WINT.UL], which is owed $120 million and Argentina’s Pampa Energia SA, which is owed $91 million.\nEnergy Minister Juan Jose Aranguren had outlined the government’s repayment plan last month, but had not clarified the exchange rate that would be used to calculate the payments, a source of concern for oil companies given that the peso currency has depreciated substantially since last year.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:24:17.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
