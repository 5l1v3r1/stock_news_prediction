REUTERS/Vahram Baghdasaryan/Photolure \nSarksyan’s ally, Armen Sarkissian, was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament in March. \nOpposition activists marched through the capital Yerevan on Saturday, waving national flags and chanting: “Make a stand, say no to Serzh.” \nThey blocked several streets in the center and staged sit-ins. Police had detained about 200 activists on Friday. \nThe Defense Ministry called on demonstrators to unblock streets around the ministry and to stop preventing movement of cars with the ministry’s number plates. \n“Any such attempt will be strictly prevented,” the ministry said in a statement. \nArmenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning.
