Knauf KG (\"Knauf\") today issued a letter to all USG Corporation (NYSE: USG) shareholders urging them to vote against all four director nominees up for election to the USG Board of Directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (\"Annual Meeting\") scheduled for May 9, 2018. Knauf also announced that it has filed preliminary proxy materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") in connection with the USG Annual Meeting. The full text of the letter is as follows:\nKNAUF'S ALL-CASH OFFER REPRESENTS\nSUBSTANTIAL IMMEDIATE CASH-CERTAIN VALUE\nSEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE USG BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ENGAGE\nIMMEDIATELY IN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE WITH KNAUF\nVOTE AGAINST ALL FOUR OF USG'S DIRECTOR NOMINEES TODAY\nDear Fellow USG Shareholders,\nKnauf has presented the USG Board of Directors with an offer to acquire USG in an all-cash transaction valued at $42.00 per share. We believe that $42.00 presents you with immediate, substantial and cash-certain value for your investment. The USG Board of Directors formally rejected our offer without engaging in meaningful discussions beyond reiterating the points made at USG's Investor Day and in previous communications.\nUSG's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, scheduled for May 9, 2018, is an opportunity to influence the USG Board. Today, Knauf filed its preliminary proxy materials as it is initiating a \"WITHHOLD\" campaign seeking fellow shareholder support at the Annual Meeting as a means of sending a clear message to the Board to engage immediately in discussions with Knauf regarding our outstanding offer. Our $42.00 offer price represents:\nan attractive multiple of 11.2x USG's 2017 fully adjusted and actually realized EBITDA, which we believe is compelling relative to precedent transactions in the building products industry;\na 25% premium to the $33.51 closing price on March 23, 2018, the last trading day prior to the public announcement of our offer;\na 30% premium to USG's 12-month average closing share price;\nvalue in excess of USG's highest closing share price over the last decade and since the global financial crisis; and\nbased on public information, full and fair value relative to intrinsic long-term value through the cycle.\nDo not let the USG Board's refusal to meaningfully engage with us prevent your voice from being heard about your investment. Send a clear message: Vote AGAINST ALL four director nominees.\nKNAUF'S OFFER ACCOUNTS FOR THE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM VALUE OF THE\nBUSINESS IN A CYCLICAL INDUSTRY\nAs we have stated in our communications, $42.00 per share reflects what we believe to be the full and fair value relative to intrinsic long-term sustainable value through the cycle. Our offer gives USG shareholders substantial value for their investment now, and de-risks any future business plan execution and cyclicality.\nThe inherent execution risk of any business plan within a cyclical industry is clearly demonstrated by USG's historical financial results. These results have been unpredictable, with EBITDA fluctuating dramatically through cyclical peaks and troughs. Cyclical demand volatility is exacerbated by a number of factors. These include industry overcapacity and strong competition; significant input cost volatility and inflation; and the seasonal nature of the business coupled with the repeated impact of bad weather. We also believe that, after years of underinvestment, USG will require significant capital investment to remain competitive.\nOver the last decade, USG's share price has dramatically and consistently underperformed the market, trading below $42.00 per share. It only approached this share price recently and only for a brief period of time. After USG announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings, trading immediately normalized due to continued cost pressures and the realization that USG's increased performance was primarily the result of prebuys in advance of its wallboard price increase, and therefore an anomaly.\nKnauf has been invested in USG since 2000. We have been considering our options regarding a combination for a long time and have devoted significant resources to this idea. Our focus on intrinsic value, not daily share price, is evident in the timing of our proposal. We first approached USG in November 2017 when the stock was nearing its decade-highs compared to the years or even months prior when the stock was significantly lower.\nBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY, USG'S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER,\nHAS PUBLICLY VALIDATED THE VALUE OF OUR OFFER\nBerkshire Hathaway, Inc., USG's largest shareholder and beneficial owner of approximately 31% of USG's outstanding shares, first invested in USG in 2000. On March 26, 2018, Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its proposal to grant Knauf an option to purchase all of the shares of USG held by Berkshire Hathaway and its affiliates in connection with the consummation of the purchase by Knauf of all of the outstanding shares of USG at a price of $42.00 per share. This could not be a clearer indication that Berkshire Hathaway views our $42.00 offer price as fair, and that it would be a willing seller at this price.\nMARKET RESPONSE TO KNAUF'S OFFER INDICATES\nBROAD SUPPORT FROM USG SHAREHOLDERS\nWhen management introduced its current strategy at USG's Investor Day on March 8, 2018, the share price declined almost 3%. In contrast, when Knauf's offer was publicly disclosed on March 26, 2018, USG's share price increased almost 20% from the previous unaffected closing price of $33.51. This is a clear indication that USG shareholders favor the substantial, immediate and certain cash value of our offer over the uncertain value and potential risk inherent in the Company's business plan.\nDO NOT LET EXTENSIVE STRUCTURAL DEFENSE POLICIES PREVENT YOU FROM\nMAKING YOUR VOICE HEARD\nUSG says it is highly confident its standalone strategy will deliver substantially more value than our offer, and reference their strategic plan as an explanation. We have expressed our willingness to enter into a customary non-disclosure agreement to facilitate receipt of further information regarding the value of this strategy, but USG refuses to engage in meaningful discussions. We can only conclude that USG is unable to present substantive evidence to support its claims that the Company is worth more.\nUSG's refusal to enter into discussions with us is protected by the Company's extensive structural defense policies. These include:\nA \"poison pill\"; A classified board; No ability for shareholders to call a special meeting; and Restrictions on actions by written consent.\nTherefore, we intend to vote our shares, representing 10.53% of USG's outstanding shares, AGAINST ALL four USG director nominees and urge all other USG shareholders who support a transaction to do the same.\nSEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO YOUR BOARD â€“ VOTE AGAINST ALL FOUR USG\nDIRECTOR NOMINEES TODAY\nWe are unwavering in our focus to bring this transaction to fruition and have a strong ability to consummate a transaction, including financing certainty and a clear pathway to all required approvals. Furthermore, we believe we will be a good strategic and cultural fit for the business with a thoughtful approach to integration, employment opportunities and preserving the USG heritage.\nWhether or not you plan to attend the 2018 Annual Meeting, we strongly urge you to make your voice heard and to vote AGAINST ALL four of USG's director nominees to the USG Board today. By voting AGAINST ALL of USG's director nominees, you are sending a clear message that you want the USG Board to engage immediately in a constructive dialogue with Knauf in order to provide you with the opportunity to realize substantial and cash-certain value for your shares.\nSincerely,\n/s/ Alexander Knauf\n/s/ Manfred Grundke\nAlexander Knauf\nManfred Grundke\nGeneral Partner\nGeneral Partner\nGebr.
