Formula One F1 - Australian Grand Prix - Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit, Melbourne, Australia - March 25, 2018 Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel celebrates his win on the podium with Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton REUTERS/Brandon Malone \nThe 33-year-old Mercedes driver has won the race on the outskirts of Shanghai an unprecedented five times, with the Briton’s most recent triumph coming as recently as last year. \nHamilton will be desperately hoping the Shanghai International Circuit delivers a sixth as he bids to claw back some of the 17-point deficit to championship leader Vettel in the overall standings. \n“It’s always been a good track for me,” said Hamilton, who finished third in Bahrain on Sunday after starting ninth due to a gearbox penalty. \n“So I really hope that I’m able to climb the ladder and get back to where we’ve been working towards being in the last two races.” \nWins in the Australian season-opener and Bahrain means the momentum for the moment is with Vettel, the first Ferrari driver since Michael Schumacher in 2004 to start the year with successive wins. \nThe last time a driver failed to win the championship after winning the opening two races was in 1982, when Alain Prost started strongly but lost out to Keke Rosberg. \nHamilton can still take comfort from last year, when he clinched his fourth championship despite Vettel also winning in Australia and Bahrain, which was the third race of that season. \nHe can also draw encouragement from the speed and reliability of his Mercedes, with the Briton poised to set a Formula One record on Sunday of 28 successive races in the points.
