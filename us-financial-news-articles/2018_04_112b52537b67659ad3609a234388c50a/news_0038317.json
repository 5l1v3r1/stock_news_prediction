The industries named in the draft law include software, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, tobacco and alcohol.\nEarlier this week, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said Russia should also look at goods produced in Russia by U.S. companies, although Friday’s draft legislation mentioned only imports.\nRussia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.\nFor a Factbox on Russia’s list of U.S. imports that could be banned, see:\nPublicly listed U.S. companies generated more than $90 billion in revenue from Russia in 2017, according to the Thomson Reuters Country of Risk model, which estimates companies’ financial exposure to different countries.
