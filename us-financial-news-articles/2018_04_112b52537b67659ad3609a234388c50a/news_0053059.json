Peer-to peer lending had not yet been formally authorized in the country. The practice involves lending between individuals through online services.\nFintechs welcomed the regulation, saying it would increase competition with Brazil’s large banks. Fintechs’ annual loan disbursement is still low in the country, about 2 billion reais a year, according to the industry group ABCD, which represents credit fintechs.\nBruno Poljkan, head of ABCD and director of credit fintech Just, said volumes were expected to rise and the new regulation may allow larger financing rounds with investors.\n“Once we have clear rules, investors feel safer,” Poljkan said. Just has received investment from Swedish fund Vostok Emerging Finance. Sandro Reiss, founder of credit fintech Geru, said regulation would allow Brazilian fintechs to grow.
