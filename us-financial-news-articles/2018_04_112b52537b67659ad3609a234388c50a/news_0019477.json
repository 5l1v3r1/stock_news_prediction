Iran backs Syria in its fight against America and the Zionist Regime (Israel),” Ali Akbar Velayati told state TV during his visit to eastern Ghouta in Syria.\nSeven Iranian military personnel were killed in a Sunday air strike on a Syrian air base, Iranian media reported. Iran has blamed Israel for carrying out the attack on Tyias or T4, near Homs. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied launching the attack. Velayati, upon his arrival in Syria on Tuesday, said the strike would “not remain without response”, Iranian media reported.\nShi’ite-dominated Iran is Assad’s main regional ally and has provided military and economic support for his conflict with a range of Sunni Muslim rebel and militant groups.\n“Syria’s enemies are angry because of its military advances against terrorist groups,” Velayati said.\nTehran denies having any conventional armed forces in Syria, but has acknowledged military advisers and volunteers from the evolutionary Guards Corps are there to help Assad’s forces.
