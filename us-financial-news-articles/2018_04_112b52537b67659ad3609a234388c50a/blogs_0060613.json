But when it comes to leveraging advances in digital information technology and data collection to improve connectivity, efficiency and the environment — key aims of smart cities — many judge it as lagging.\nThe local government in December promised a remedy, vowing to make Hong Kong a \"world-class smart city\" with aims of increasing quality of life and attractiveness for global business and investment.\nForeign businesses and investors support the smart city idea, but many say specifics are often lacking.\n\"Of course we cannot disagree with all this, it's great,\" Tom Uiterwaal, CEO of Hong Kong-based Reconergy and chairman of the Environment & Energy Business Council of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, said Wednesday in a presentation on the environmental aspects of the plan.\n\"But it's not very concrete,\" said Uiterwaal. \"It's very vague.\" show chapters 5:05 AM ET Thu, 12 April 2018 | 02:52\nIn a sign of the challenges Hong Kong faces in its ambitions, Sweden-based EasyPark ranked it 68th out of the top 100 cities surveyed in its 2017 Smart Cities Index, far behind No. 2 Singapore and No. 6 Tokyo.

Wi-Fi too slow\nHong Kong long served as a gateway to mainland China, but that role became less important as Beijing authorities pursued reforms and investment that propelled their country to become the world's second-largest economy.\nA semi-autonomous region of China since British colonial rule ended in 1997, Hong Kong is now seeking a new edge.\n\"We have no time to waste,\" Chief Executive Carrie Lam said in a February speech on the smart city plan.\nHong Kong is not without advantages. Broadband penetration rates are high and the city's transportation and health care systems have been praised. But a lack of affordable housing and congestion are well-known problems.\nAlso, Hong Kong's Audit Commission this week said that download speeds at more than one-third of free public Wi-Fi hotspots at government locations were below official targets, while usage of the service was also low. show chapters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T07:26:40.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
