In 2015, 64 percent of undergraduate students hailing from the Granite State had federal student loans. \nFrom California? You're more likely to be debt-free. Just 1 in 5 students from the Golden State had federal student loans that year. \nA new tool from the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., lets people dig into student loan information on a state — and even county — level. You can check the median student loan debt of residents in Albany County, Wyoming ($19,542), for example, or the share of student loan debt in collections in Ada Country, Idaho (3 percent). \nOutstanding student loan debt in the U.S. has swelled to more than $1.3 trillion. But researchers haven't put much time into understanding the geographic distribution of this burden, said Caroline Ratcliffe, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, and a researcher on the map project. \nUntil now. \nThe Midwest and the Northeast are the regions most heavily saturated in student debt, according to The Urban Institute's calculations, with the worst states being New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Maine. Meanwhile, residents in New Mexico, Wyoming and California carry the least education debt. \nUnsurprisingly, students from states where college is more expensive tend to borrow more. \nThe findings also assessed factors that make someone more likely to be burdened by education debt. \n\"The people who struggle the most to pay back student loan debt tend to be people with lower amounts of student loans who haven't completed their degree,\" Ratcliffe said. \"So now they have the debt but no degree.\" \nMore from College Game Plan: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T20:26:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
