The cryptocurrency suddenly shot 17 percent higher Thursday morning. Many traders attributed the spike to investors covering their shorts, or buying back into the market after betting against bitcoin.\n\nFundstrat Global Research's Tom Lee, the only major Wall Street strategist to issue bitcoin price targets, expects the cryptocurrency will reach $20,000 by the middle of the year and $25,000 by the end of 2018.\nDraper is the founding partner of Draper Associates and DFJ, an early investor in Skype and Chinese search giant Baidu . He bought nearly 30,000 bitcoins in a 2014 U.S. Marshals Service auction, all of which he told CNBC in December he was still holding. If that is still the case, Draper's bitcoin investment is worth $243 million at Friday's prices.\nHe said on CNBC's \" Fast Money \" in early March that in five years bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be the primary means of payment. \nshow chapters Silicon Valley legend on the future of bitcoin and blockchain      8:24 PM ET Tue, 6 March 2018 | 09:48", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T22:50:01.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
