REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/Illustration \nWashington and London issued a joint alert, saying the widespread, global campaign began in 2015 and could be escalated to launch offensive attacks. \nThe alert comes two months after the United States and Britain accused Russia of carrying out the damaging “NotPetya” cyber attack in 2017 that unleashed a virus that crippled parts of Ukraine’s infrastructure and damaged computers across the globe. \nAmerican and British officials said the attacks affected a wide range of organizations including internet service providers, private businesses and critical infrastructure providers. They did not identify any victims or provide details on the impact of the attacks. \n“When we see malicious cyber activity, whether it be from the Kremlin or other malicious nation-state actors, we are going to push back,” said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator. \nThe Kremlin did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Monday. Moscow has denied previous accusations that it carried out cyber attacks on the United States and other countries. \nU.S. intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election with a hacking and propaganda campaign supporting Donald Trump’s campaign for president. Last month the Trump administration blamed Russia for a campaign of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid. \nBritain and the United States said they issued the alert to help targets protect themselves and persuade victims to share information with government investigators so they can better understand the threat.

Monday’s announcement appears to reflect a desire to publicize a threat quickly and widely even before officials completely understand its breadth. \nA senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been a steady increase in Russian cyber attacks in recent years. \n“It’s harder to track, attribute and respond immediately to a cyber attack ... than it is to know who fired a missile,” the official said.
