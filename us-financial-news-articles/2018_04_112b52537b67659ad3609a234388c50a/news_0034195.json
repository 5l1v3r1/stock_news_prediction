He is already serving a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2015 to separate charges of conspiring to kill a federal drug agent and an informant. \nSamia, 43, and Stillwell, 50, are scheduled to be sentenced by Abrams on Sep. 14. Samia is a self-described “personal protection/security industry” professional trained in tactics and weapons, while Stillwell’s resume says he worked at a North Carolina firm that provides firearms training, according to court filings. \nProsecutors said Samia and Stillwell travelled to the Philippines and murdered a woman there in February 2012, and were each paid $35,000 by Hunter. The woman was shot multiple times in the face and left on a pile of garbage, prosecutors said. \nThe first charges against Hunter stemmed from a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sting operation that followed the arrest in Liberia in 2012 of Hunter’s boss, Paul Le Roux, the Zimbabwe-born head of a multinational criminal organization. \nLe Roux subsequently agreed to cooperate with authorities. He admitted to shipping drugs and weapons around the world and to having ordered various murders, and ordered a fake murder-for-hire operation to help authorities catch Hunter, according to court records.
