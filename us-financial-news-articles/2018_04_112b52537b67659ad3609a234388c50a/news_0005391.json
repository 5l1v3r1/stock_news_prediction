So it’s pretty much impossible to get a quote,” said one London-based emerging debt trader. \n“I’m not sure if Euroclear has already stopped clearing but the strong suggestions in the market is that they have to stop clearing Rusal bonds by the end of the month.” \nThere were no Tradeweb prices displayed on other Rusal bonds. One market player said the 2022 issue had been bid at 50 cents at one point while the offer was at 79 cents. \nWhile U.S.-based investors have until May 7 to divest from sanctioned names — Rusal, EN+ and GAZ Group — a U.S. Treasury statement sub-section specifies the deadline also applies to entities “facilitating, clearing and settling transactions”. ‘UNCHARTED TERRITORY’ \nBelgium-based Euroclear said it was taking steps to ensure it remained compliant with the U.S. sanctions which it was assessing. It declined to comment on specific companies. \nA spokeswoman for Clearstream said it had adapted its sanctions compliance programme accordingly, and that a detailed statement was due later. \nInvestment bank Barclays has suspended “ratings and estimates of United Company Rusal PLC following sanctions being placed on this entity”, according to a research note sent on Friday and seen by Reuters. Barclays declined to comment. \nInvestors also scrambled to dump other Russian corporate debt. \nPolyus, not under sanctions but controlled by Kerimov’s family, saw its 2023 Eurobond down 16.2 cents to a record low 85 cents, according to Tradeweb. \nBonds from Norilsk Nickel, part-owned by Deripaska, also tumbled, with issues maturing 2024 and 2023 down 3 cents and 2 cents respectively . \nBonds from Gazprom, also not sanctioned, tumbled as much as 4-5 cents. \nMarket players saw the latest sanctions round doing far more damage than past ones as they target existing securities of major corporations instead than prohibiting investors from buying new ones. \n“This is uncharted territory. In the past the Treasury was very careful in two things - one, not to hurt U.S. investors, and second, they didn’t want to hit commodity markets. This time the sanctions are affecting (both),” a person at a U.S. asset management firm said. \nThe person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the naming of Deripaska prominently in the sanctions was significant, given his alleged ties with Trump’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and the global nature of his business. \n“It’s a message to Russian oligarchs: ‘Ukraine is one thing but if you meddle in our elections the consequences will be severe.” \nMeanwhile, Rusal’s troubles sent aluminium prices to four-week highs.
