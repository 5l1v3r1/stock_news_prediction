The other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe pension funds, which said in the complaint that they had purchased tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Mexican government bonds, allege that they overpaid as a result of the banks’ pricing scheme.\nThe pension funds allege that prices for the bonds rose significantly after Cofece announced its investigation, suggesting the banks had been colluding previously.\nVincent Briganti, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to comment further on the case.\nReporting by Julia Love and Joseph Ax; additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T16:32:15.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
