The car was traced back to Germash, who confirmed that it belonged to him. \nAuthorities proceeded to search his personal property, and found about 10,000 pieces of mail in his car, 6,000 pieces in his apartment and 1,000 in his work locker, some dating as far back as 2005, according to the complaint. \nGermash was charged Thursday with violating a federal law related to mail delivery and released on $25,000 bond, according to CNN. \nIn 2014, another Brooklyn postal worker was arrested for hoarding 40,000 pieces of mail, but charges were later dropped .
