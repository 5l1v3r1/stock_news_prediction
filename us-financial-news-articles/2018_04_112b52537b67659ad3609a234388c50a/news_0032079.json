The gains in Chinese futures followed another rally in London prices to their highest since 2011 on Monday. London aluminium futures have surged more than 18 percent this month. SHANGHAI ALUMINIUM: The most-traded June aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange rose as far as 14,985 yuan ($2,388) a tonne, its highest since Jan. 29. It was up nearly 2 percent at 14,840 yuan by 0143 GMT. LME ALUMINIUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange slipped 0.9 percent to $2,378.50 a tonne. It peaked at $2,403 on Monday, its strongest level since September, 2011. SUPPLY SHORTAGE: The global aluminium market could face supply shortages because of U.S. sanctions on Russia and Norsk Hydro's production cuts in Brazil, Hydro's chief executive told Reuters. RIO TINTO: Apart from saying it would declare force majeure on certain customer contracts, Rio Tinto also said last week it was reviewing Rusal's 20 percent stake in the Queensland Alumina refinery, Rusal's supply and offtake arrangements, bauxite sales to Rusal's refinery in Ireland and offtake contracts for alumina. GLENCORE: Also last week, a source told Reuters that Swiss trader Glencore will declare force majeure on some aluminium supply. ALUMINIUM STOCKS: Total stocks of aluminium at LME warehouses rose 15,100 tonnes to 1.4 million tonnes. Total stocks are up 9 percent since the start of the Rusal sanctions on April 6. MAL-STOCKS CHINA GDP: Investors are awaiting the release of China's first-quarter gross domestic product this morning. The world's second-biggest economy was expected to have expanded by 6.7 percent in the first three months of 2018, after growing 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter. COPPER: London copper eased 0.3 percent to $6,893 a tonne and its Shanghai counterpart rose 0.9 percent to 50,840 yuan. MARKETS: Asia stocks edged higher, tracking Wall Street gains as the focus shifted to corporate earnings and looming economic data from China amid signs Western-led strikes on Syria weren't likely to escalate. The dollar steadied.
