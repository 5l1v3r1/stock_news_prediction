He suffered a setback on the par-four seventh when he carded a five, but hit back immediately with a birdie on the next hole. \nConservative play on the back nine kept him in front of a chasing pack that failed to supply sufficient pressure on a course where scoring had been difficult all week. \nThe Ryder Cup will be played at Le Golf National in Paris in September and Levy has kept himself in the frame to be part of the European side, but he knows he probably needs one or two more wins to push for a place on the team. \n“I need to improve my game,” he admitted. “I work a lot and have done that the last two days to win this trophy. That has helped me but it is step by step. \n“I need to go back to work. We have a lot of good players in Europe, so I need to work hard to make it.” Reporting By Nick Said; Editing by Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T20:00:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
