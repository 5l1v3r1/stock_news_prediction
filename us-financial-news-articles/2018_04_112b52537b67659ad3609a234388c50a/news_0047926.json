Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $96.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to net loss available to common stockholders of $35.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the linked quarter ended December 31, 2017, and net income available to common stockholders of $39.1 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nResults were impacted by a loss on sale of securities of $5.4 million as the Company continued its earning asset repositioning strategy and generated liquidity for the acquisition of Advantage Funding Management Co., Inc. (“Advantage Funding”), which closed on April 2, 2018. Please refer to the section below “Reconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Results (non-GAAP)” for additional information.\nPresident’s Comments\nJack Kopnisky, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We had strong performance across all key metrics with record adjusted net income available to common stockholders of over $100.0 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share available to common stockholders of $0.45, which represents growth of 143.3% and 45.2%, respectively, over the first quarter of 2017. Our adjusted return on average tangible assets was 1.45% and our adjusted return on average tangible common equity was 17.24%. As of March 31, 2018, our total assets were $30.5 billion, gross portfolio loans were $19.9 billion and total deposits were $20.6 billion.\n“The transition of our earning assets and balance sheet to a more optimal mix is well underway. The average balance of commercial loans increased by $320.1 million in the first quarter, while the average balance of residential mortgage loans decreased by $191.4 million. We will continue to replace lower yielding assets that we acquired in the merger with Astoria Financial Corporation (“Astoria”) with higher yielding, more diversified commercial loans that we originate through our teams or purchase in opportunistic situations, such as the acquisition of Advantage Funding. We anticipate this strategy will allow us to maintain and increase our tax equivalent net interest margin, which was 3.15% excluding the impact of accretion income on acquired loans.\n“We are ahead of plan on our acquisition of Astoria, and to date we have made significant progress on the integration of personnel, systems, facilities and all other areas of Astoria’s operations. Excluding the amortization of intangibles, operating expenses were $105.7 million in the first quarter, which represented a decrease of $3.9 million relative to the linked quarter and an annual run-rate of $428.7 million. Our adjusted operating efficiency ratio reached a record low of 40.3%. Comparing this quarter’s performance to the same quarter a year ago, our operating leverage ratio, which we define as growth in operating revenues divided by growth in operating expenses, was 2.7x. We still have much work to do to fully capture the benefits of our acquisition of Astoria, but we are confident in our ability to continue building a larger, more diversified and more profitable company.\n“Our tangible common equity ratio was 8.38% and our estimated Tier 1 Leverage ratio was 9.39% at March 31, 2018; we have ample capital to support our strategy. Our tangible book value per common share was $10.68, which represented an increase of 28.4% over a year ago.\n“We welcome all of our new colleagues that have joined upon the completion of the Advantage Funding acquisition. Advantage Funding is a leading provider of commercial vehicle and transportation financing services based in Lake Success, NY. Advantage Funding will be integrated into our equipment finance business, which when combined with our existing business, will have over $1.0 billion in loans and leases outstanding. We anticipate the acquisition should add approximately five basis points to tax equivalent net interest margin in 2018 and will accelerate the transition of our loan portfolio to a more diversified loan mix.\n“We would like to thank our clients, colleagues and shareholders for your support and look forward to working with all of our partners as we continue to build a great company.\n“Lastly, we have declared a dividend on our common stock of $0.07 per share payable on May 21, 2018 to holders of record as of May 7, 2018.”\nReconciliation of GAAP Results to Adjusted Results (non-GAAP)\nThe Company’s GAAP net income available to common stockholders of $96.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, , included the following items:\na pre-tax net loss on sale of securities of $5.4 million; and\n2\nthe pre-tax amortization of non-compete agreements and acquired customer list intangible assets of $295 thousand.\nExcluding the impact of these items, adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $100.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP financial measures include references to the terms “adjusted” or “excluding”. See the reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures beginning on page 17.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % / bps 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Interest and dividend income $ 126,000 $ 276,495 $ 281,346 123.3 % 1.8 % Interest expense 17,210 42,471 46,976 173.0 10.6 Net interest income $ 108,790 $ 234,024 $ 234,370 115.4 0.1 Accretion income on acquired loans $ 3,482 $ 33,726 $ 30,340 771.3 % (10.0 )% Yield on loans 4.57 % 4.77 % 4.85 % 28 8 Tax equivalent yield on investment securities 2.97 3.03 2.85 (12 ) (18 ) Tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets 4.09 4.32 4.31 22 (1 ) Cost of total deposits 0.38 0.43 0.47 9 4 Cost of interest bearing deposits 0.55 0.54 0.59 4 5 Cost of borrowings 1.74 1.94 2.01 27 7 Tax equivalent net interest margin 5 3.55 3.67 3.60 5 (7 ) Average loans, including loans held for sale $ 9,281,516 $ 19,518,485 $ 19,635,900 111.6 % 0.6 % Average investment securities 3,273,658 5,926,824 6,602,175 101.7 11.4 Average total interest earning assets 12,889,578 26,043,748 26,833,922 108.2 3.0 Average deposits and mortgage escrow 10,186,615 20,483,857 20,688,147 103.1 1.0 5 Tax equivalent net interest margin is equal to net interest income plus the tax equivalent adjustment for tax exempt securities divided by average interest earning assets. The tax equivalent adjustment is assumed at a 35% federal tax rate in 2017 and 21% in 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 compared with first quarter 2017\nNet interest income was $234.4 million, an increase of $125.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to an increase in average loans outstanding between the periods as a result of the merger with Astoria (the “Astoria Merger”) and loans originated through our commercial banking teams. Other key components of the changes in net interest income and net interest margin were the following:\nThe yield on loans was 4.85% compared to 4.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in yield on loans was mainly due to an increase in accretion income on acquired loans, which was $30.3 million compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Average commercial loans were $14.3 billion compared to $8.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $6.0 billion or 72.3%. The tax equivalent yield on investment securities decreased 12 basis points to 2.85%. This was mainly due to the change in the federal income tax rate as the tax equivalent adjustment assumed a 35% federal tax rate in 2017 compared to a 21% federal tax rate in 2018, resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Average tax exempt securities balances grew to $2.6 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Average investment securities were $6.6 billion, or 24.6%, of average earning assets compared to $3.3 billion, or 25.4%, of average earning assets for the first quarter of 2017. The tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets increased 22 basis points between the periods to 4.31%, mainly due to higher accretion income on acquired loans, as described above. The cost of total deposits was 47 basis points and the cost of borrowings was 2.01%, compared to 38 basis points and 1.74%, respectively, for the same period a year ago.\n3\nThe total cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 10 basis points to 0.89% compared to 0.79% for first quarter of 2017. This increase was mainly due to an increase in market interest rates, which increased the cost of wholesale, brokered and certificates of deposit between the periods.\nThe tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% compared to 3.55% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in tax equivalent net interest margin was mainly due to the increase in accretion income on acquired loans. Excluding accretion income, tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.15% compared to 3.44% in the first quarter of 2017. The decline in tax equivalent net interest margin excluding accretion income is mainly due to multi-family and residential mortgage loans acquired in the Astoria Merger, which generally have lower yields than the Company’s other loan assets, and to the change in tax equivalent adjustment rate due to the decrease in the federal income tax rate.\nFirst quarter 2018 compared with linked quarter ended December 31, 2017\nNet interest income increased $346 thousand compared to the linked quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income was mainly due to higher average balances of commercial loans and investment securities outstanding, which was substantially offset by a $3.4 million decline in accretion income on acquired loans and two fewer days in first quarter of 2018. Key components of the changes in net interest income in the linked quarter were the following:\nThe yield on loans was 4.85% compared to 4.77% for the linked quarter, an increase of eight basis points, which was mainly due to the increase in market rates of interest. Accretion income on acquired loans was $30.3 million compared to $33.7 million in the linked quarter. The average balance of portfolio loans increased $117.4 million and the average balance of commercial loans increased $320.1 million compared to the linked quarter. The tax equivalent yield on investment securities decreased 18 basis points to 2.85% , which was due to the change in the federal income tax rate. The average balance of investment securities increased $675.4 million compared to the linked quarter. The tax equivalent yield on interest earning assets decreased one basis point to 4.31% compared to 4.32% in the linked quarter. This was mainly due to $3.4 million of lower accretion income on acquired loans, and a $3.1 million decrease in the tax equivalent adjustment due to the change in the tax rates. The cost of total deposits increased four basis points to 47 basis points in the quarter. The total cost of borrowings increased to 2.01% compared to 1.94% in the linked quarter. Average interest bearing deposits increased by $276.4 million and average borrowings increased $476.3 million relative to the linked quarter. Total interest expense increased by $4.5 million over the linked quarter.\nThe tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.60% compared to 3.67% in the linked quarter. Excluding accretion income on acquired loans, tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.16% in the linked quarter compared to 3.15% . The decline in tax equivalent net interest margin excluding accretion income between the current quarter and the linked quarter was mainly due to the change in the federal income tax rate. The composition of the Company’s earning assets continued to shift , as the average balance of residential mortgage loans decreased by $191.4 million and represented 24.5% of total portfolio loans compared to 25.3% at December 31, 2017. We anticipate that over time we will continue to replace the run-off of residential mortgages and other loans acquired in the Astoria Merger with higher yielding commercial loans.\nNon-interest Income\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Total non-interest income $ 12,836 $ 23,762 $ 18,707 45.7 % (21.3 )% Net (loss) on sale of securities (23 ) (70 ) (5,421 ) NM NM Adjusted non-interest income $ 12,859 $ 23,832 $ 24,128 87.6 1.2 First quarter 2018 compared with first quarter 2017\nExcluding net (loss) on sale of securities, adjusted non-interest income increased $11.3 million to $24.1 million compared to $12.9 million in the same quarter last year. The change was mainly due to the Astoria Merger as deposit fees and service charges increased by $3.7 million; bank owned life insurance income increased by $2.2 million; investment management fees increased by $1.6 million; and safe deposit box rental income increased $602 thousand, which is included in other non-interest income. In addition, fee income generated on payroll finance loans increased $1.2 million (which represents the majority of the increase in accounts receivable management / factoring commissions and other related fees) and other loan fees including letters of credit and loan swaps increased $433 thousand over the year ago period.\n4\nFirst quarter 2018 compared with linked quarter ended December 31, 2017\nExcluding net (loss) on sale of securities, adjusted non-interest income increased approximately $296 thousand from $23.8 million in the linked quarter to $24.1 million . Increases in accounts receivables commissions / factoring commissions and other related fees and other commissions and loan fees were substantially offset by decreases in deposit fees and service charges and wealth management fees.\nNon-interest Expense\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % / bps 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Compensation and benefits 7 $ 31,187 $ 56,086 $ 54,680 75.3 % (2.5 )% Stock-based compensation plans 1,736 2,508 2,854 64.4 13.8 Occupancy and office operations 8,134 18,100 17,460 114.7 (3.5 ) Information technology 2,469 11,984 11,718 374.6 (2.2 ) Amortization of intangible assets 2,229 6,426 6,052 171.5 (5.8 ) FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments 1,888 5,737 5,347 183.2 (6.8 ) Other real estate owned, net (“OREO”) 1,676 742 364 (78.3 ) (50.9 ) Merger-related expenses 3,127 30,230 — NM NM Charge for asset write-downs, systems integration, retention and severance — 104,506 — NM NM Other expenses 7,904 14,427 13,274 67.9 (8.0 ) Total non-interest expense $ 60,350 $ 250,746 $ 111,749 85.2 (55.4 ) Full time equivalent employees (“FTEs”) at period end 978 2,076 2,016 106.1 (2.9 ) Financial centers at period end 42 128 127 202.4 (0.8 ) Operating efficiency ratio, as reported 49.6 % 97.3 % 44.2 % 540 5,310 Operating efficiency ratio, as adjusted 6 43.7 41.4 40.3 340 110 6 See a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure beginning on page 17.\n7 In the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted a new retirement plan accounting standard. To conform to the current presentation, the Company reclassified $99 and $416 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively, from compensation and benefits expense to other non-interest expense. The adoption of this new standard did not impact the aggregate amount of total non-interest expense or net income.\nFirst quarter 2018 compared with first quarter 2017\nTotal non-interest expense increased $51.4 million relative to the first quarter of 2017. Key components of the change in non-interest expense were the following:\nCompensation and benefits increased $23.5 million between the periods. Total FTEs increased to 2,016 from 978, which was mainly due to the Astoria Merger. In addition, we continued to execute our growth strategy and hired commercial bankers and risk management personnel. Occupancy and office operations increased $9.3 million mainly due to the financial centers and other locations acquired in the Astoria Merger. Information technology expense increased $9.2 million between the periods. The increase is mainly due to the Astoria Merger. We anticipate this expense will decrease upon completion of the full systems conversion. Amortization of intangible assets increased $3.8 million. The increase is mainly due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible asset that was recorded in the Astoria Merger. FDIC insurance and regulatory assessments increased $3.5 million to $5.3 million , compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to growth in our total assets. OREO expense declined $1.3 million to $364 thousand , compared to $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. This was mainly due to write-downs on the value of properties based on updated appraisals in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, gain on sale of OREO was $472 thousand, which substantially offset OREO write-downs and maintenance expense.\n5\nOther expenses increased $13.3 million mainly due to the Astoria Merger and included a $1.3 million increase in professional fees, $979 thousand increase in communications expense, $992 thousand increase in advertising and promotion expense and a $739 thousand increase in operational losses.\nFirst quarter 2018 compared with linked quarter ended December 31, 2017\nTotal non-interest expense decreased $139.0 million from $250.7 million in the linked quarter to $111.7 million . Key components of the change in non-interest expense were the following:\nCompensation and benefits declined $1.4 million and was $54.7 million compared to $56.1 million in the linked quarter. This was mainly due to the continued integration of Astoria’s operations, which has been partially offset by the hiring of additional relationship managers and risk management personnel. Occupancy and office operations declined $640 thousand mainly as we continue to execute our strategy of reducing our real estate footprint. OREO expense declined $378 thousand compared to the linked quarter. There was no merger-related expense compared to $30.2 million in the linked quarter. There were no charges for asset write-downs, systems integration, retention and severance compared to $104.5 million in the linked quarter. Other expense decreased $1.2 million and was $13.3 million compared to $14.4 million in the linked quarter.\nTaxes\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company earned pre-tax income of $128.3 million. We recorded income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of 23.25%. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $379 thousand as a discrete item related to stock-based compensation that vested . In the year ago period, we recorded income tax expense at 32.50% of pre-tax income, and recorded a tax benefit of $742 thousand as a discrete item related to stock-based compensation that vested in the first quarter of 2017. In the linked quarter, we incurred a pre-tax loss mainly due to charges incurred in connection with the Astoria Merger; however, we recorded income tax expense of $28.3 million which included a charge of $40.3 million to write-down our net deferred tax assets to their estimated value due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nKey Balance Sheet Highlights as of March 31, 2018\n($ in thousands) As of Change % / bps 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Total assets $ 14,659,337 $ 30,359,541 $ 30,468,780 107.8 % 0.4 % Total portfolio loans, gross 9,763,967 20,008,983 19,939,245 104.2 (0.3 ) Commercial & industrial (“C&I”) loans 4,181,818 5,306,821 5,341,548 27.7 0.7 Commercial real estate loans 4,376,645 8,998,419 9,099,606 107.9 1.1 Acquisition, development and construction loans 238,966 282,792 262,591 9.9 (7.1 ) Total commercial loans 8,797,429 14,588,032 14,703,745 67.1 0.8 Residential mortgage loans 695,398 5,054,732 4,883,452 602.3 (3.4 ) Total deposits 10,251,725 20,538,204 20,623,233 101.2 0.4 Core deposits 8 9,426,612 19,388,254 19,538,410 107.3 0.8 Investment securities 3,416,395 6,474,561 6,635,286 94.2 2.5 Total borrowings 2,328,576 4,991,210 4,927,594 111.6 (1.3 ) Loans to deposits 95.2 % 97.4 % 96.7 % 150 (70 ) Core deposits to total deposits 92.0 94.4 94.7 270 30 Investment securities to total assets 23.3 21.3 21.8 (150 ) 50 8 Given the Company’s greater proportion of certificates of deposit after completion of the Astoria Merger, the Company modified its definition of core deposits to also include certificates of deposit beginning . Core deposits include retail, commercial and municipal transaction, money market and savings accounts and certificates of deposit accounts and exclude brokered and wholesale deposits, except for reciprocal Certificate of Deposit Account Registry balances.\n6\nHighlights in balance sheet items as of March 31, 2018 were the following:\nC&I loans (which include traditional C&I, asset-based lending, payroll finance, warehouse lending, factored receivables, equipment financing and public sector finance loans) represented 26.8%, commercial real estate loans (which include multi-family loans) represented 45.6%, consumer and residential mortgage loans combined represented 26.3%, and acquisition, development and construction loans represented 1.3% of the total loan portfolio. Loan growth in the year-over-year period was mainly a result of the Astoria Merger and originations by our commercial banking teams. Linked quarter comparisons are discussed below. C&I loans grew $34.7 million compared to the linked quarter. Excluding loans acquired in the Astoria Merger, C&I loans increased $1.1 billion in the past twelve months. Total commercial loans, which include all C&I loans, commercial real estate (including multi-family) and acquisition, development and construction loans, increased by $115.7 million in the linked quarter. Excluding loans acquired in the Astoria Merger, in the past twelve months commercial loans increased by $1.4 billion. Residential mortgage loans were $4.9 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $5.1 billion at December 31, 2017. The decline was mainly due to repayments of loans acquired from Astoria. Aggregate exposure to taxi medallion relationships was $43.6 million, which represented 0.22% of total loans as of March 31, 2018, a decline of $2.4 million from $46.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The decline was mainly due to a charge-off of $2.1 million and repayments. Total deposits at March 31, 2018 increased $85.0 million compared to December 31, 2017, and increased $10.4 billion over March 31, 2017. We assumed $9.0 billion of deposits in the Astoria Merger. The remaining increase in deposits was mainly due to growth in commercial deposits and certificates of deposit. Core deposits at March 31, 2018 increased $150.2 million compared to December 31, 2017. Core deposits increased $10.1 billion over March 31, 2017. Municipal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.8 billion and increased by $190.4 million relative to the linked quarter. Municipal deposits typically experience seasonal inflows in the first quarter. Investment securities increased by $160.7 million relative to the linked quarter, and represented 21.8% of total assets at March 31, 2018.\nCredit Quality\n($ in thousands) For the three months ended Change % / bps 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Linked Qtr Provision for loan losses $ 4,500 $ 12,000 $ 13,000 188.9 % 8.3 % Net charge-offs 1,183 6,221 8,815 645.1 41.7 Allowance for loan losses 66,939 77,907 82,092 22.6 5.4 Non-performing loans 72,924 187,213 182,046 149.6 (2.8 ) Annualized net charge-offs to average loans 0.05 % 0.13 % 0.18 % 13 5 Allowance for loan losses to total loans 0.69 0.39 0.41 (28 ) 2 Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 91.8 41.6 45.1 (4,670 ) 350 Provision for loan losses was $13.0 million compared to $12.0 million in the linked quarter and $4.5 million in the same period a year ago. In the first quarter of 2018, provision for loan losses was $4.2 million in excess of net charge-offs of $8.8 million. Allowance coverage ratios were 0.41% of total loans and 45.1% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2018. Due to the Astoria Merger, a significant portion of the Company’s loan portfolio does not carry an allowance for loan losses, as the acquired loans are recorded at their estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Non-performing loans declined by $5.2 million to $182.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared to the linked quarter. The decline in non-performing loans was mainly due to net charge-offs and repayments, partially offset by loans that became non-performing during quarter.\n7\nCapital\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data) As of Change % / bps 3/31/2017 12/31/2017 3/31/2018 Y-o-Y Three\nmonths Total stockholders’ equity $ 1,888,613 $ 4,240,178 $ 4,273,755 126.3 % 0.8 % Preferred stock — 139,220 139,025 NM NM Goodwill and intangible assets 760,698 1,733,082 1,727,030 127.0 (0.3 ) Tangible common stockholders’ equity $ 1,127,915 $ 2,367,876 $ 2,407,700 113.5 1.7 Common shares outstanding 135,604,435 224,782,694 225,466,266 66.3 0.3 Book value per common share $ 13.93 $ 18.24 $ 18.34 31.7 0.5 Tangible book value per common share 9 8.32 10.53 10.68 28.4 1.4 Tangible common equity to tangible assets 9 8.12 % 8.27 % 8.38 % 26 11 Estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio - Company 8.89 9.39 9.39 50 — Estimated Tier 1 leverage ratio - Bank 8.99 10.10 10.01 102 (9 ) 9 See a reconciliation of non-GAAP as adjusted financial measures beginning on page 17.\nThe increase in total stockholders’ equity of $33.6 million to $4.3 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 was mainly due to earnings. The increase from net income available to common stockholders of $96.9 million was partially offset by common dividends of $15.7 million, preferred dividends of $2.2 million and a decrease in the fair value of our available for sale investment securities of $52.9 million.\nTotal goodwill and other intangible assets were $1.7 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.1 million compared to December 31, 2017, which was due to amortization of intangibles for the period.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding increased to 224.7 million and 225.3 million, respectively, compared to 223.5 million and 224.1 million, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The increase in the diluted weighted average shares was mainly due to stock-based compensation granted in connection with our performance for 2017. Total common shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 were approximately 225.5 million.\nTangible book value per share was $10.68 at March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of 28.4% over a year ago and an increase of 1.4% over December 31, 2017.\nConference Call Information\nSterling Bancorp will host a teleconference and webcast on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 10:30 AM Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s results.

These non-GAAP/adjusted financial measures complement our GAAP reporting and are presented above to provide investors, analysts, regulators and others information that we use to manage and evaluate our performance each period. This information supplements our GAAP reported results, and should not be viewed in isolation from, or as a substitute for, our GAAP results. When non-GAAP/adjusted measures are impacted by income tax expense, we present the pre-tax amount for the income and expense items that result in the non-GAAP adjustments and present the income tax expense impact at the effective tax rate in effect for the period presented.\n1 Stockholders’ equity as a percentage of total assets, book value per common share, tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets and tangible book common value per share provides information to help assess our capital position and financial strength. We believe tangible book measures improve comparability to other banking organizations that have not engaged in acquisitions that have resulted in the accumulation of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n2 Reported return on average tangible common equity and adjusted return on average tangible common equity measures provide information to evaluate the use of our tangible common equity.\n3 Reported return on average tangible assets and adjusted return on average tangible assets measures provide information to help assess our profitability.\n4 The reported operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing our GAAP non-interest expense by the sum of our GAAP net interest income plus GAAP non-interest income. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing non-interest expense adjusted for intangible asset amortization and certain expenses generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans by the sum of net interest income plus non-interest income plus the tax equivalent adjustment on securities income and elimination of the impact of gain or loss on sale of securities. The adjusted operating efficiency ratio is a measure we use to assess our operating performance.\n5 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share present a summary of our earnings which includes adjustments to exclude certain revenues and expenses (generally associated with discrete merger transactions and non-recurring strategic plans) to help in assessing our profitability.\nSTERLING BANCORP CONTACT:\nLuis Massiani, SEVP & Chief Financial Officer\n845.369.8040\nhttp://www.sterlingbancorp.com\n19\nSource:Sterling Bancorp", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=sMKUinijHcEGkINF-aldiu4hsKhPL9UF8_QCQNZSDj5ZA6UfmsgDPb6g3Zcka4gakuG6iWLB2qUMpnP72mL0ahAHFCxyq4BLdt0k-xvSCDPYky2Q_LZgA-m2sEVHu3l7", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d666a965-7d86-4ae4-9c4d-2063ba094cf6"], "published": "2018-04-25T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T01:03:56.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
