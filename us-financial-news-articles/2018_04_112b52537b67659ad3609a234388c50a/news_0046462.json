Former premier Horst Seehofer, now federal interior minister, made waves on assuming his new office by stating that Islam “does not belong to Germany.” \nBut the AfD, which campaigns against Muslim immigration, dismissed the cross proposal as “the usual gesture politics”. \n“The Christian Cross is being turned into an election accessory, while the conservatives refuse to protect our basic values with real actions,” the AfD’s co-leader Alice Weidel said in a statement on Wednesday. \nEven clerics were critical of the plan. “Many see as a provocation and a hypocrisy the way you speak about Christianity,” wrote Burkhard Hose, a priest who ministers to the students of Wuerzburg University, in an open letter to Soeder. \n“Stop this misuse of Christianity and its symbols as a supposed bulwark against Islam,” he added.
