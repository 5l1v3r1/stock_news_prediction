His family watched his debut from the PNC Park stands.\nThe win was the Pirates’ fifth in a row and gave them a three-game series sweep of the Cardinals.\nSt. Louis starter Luke Weaver (2-2) allowed four runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings, with six strikeouts and two walks.\nThe Pirates broke open a scoreless game in the sixth with four runs.\nStarling Marte, Josh Bell and Corey Dickerson each reached with one out to load the bases, and Elias Diaz followed with a base hit to bring in Marte and Bell for a 2-0 lead, chasing Weaver.\nColin Moran greeted reliever Jordan Hicks with an RBI single.\nAfter Diaz was out at home on a fielder’s choice, Kingham walked to load the bases. Hicks hit Adam Frazier, forcing in a run to make it 4-0.\nDavid Freese added a pinch-hit RBI single in the eighth off reliever Greg Holland for a 5-0 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:18:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
