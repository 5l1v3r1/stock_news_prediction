The woman’s name has not been made public and the source declined to disclose it.\n“She alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period. We have not spoken since that time,” Broidy said in the statement.\nBroidy said Cohen contacted him after being contacted by the woman’s attorney, Keith Davidson. Broidy said he retained Cohen because Cohen had a prior relationship with Davidson.\nCohen and Davidson did not immediate respond to requests for comment.\nA source familiar with the situation said Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel has accepted Broidy’s resignation.\nReporting by Karen Freifeld, Nathan Layne and Steve Holland in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:34:43.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
