The army has said its crackdown was provoked by the attacks of Rohingya militants on more than two dozen police posts and an army base last August.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain \nReuters has covered the plight of the Rohingya since 2012, but in 2017 it became clear that the scale of this exodus was far larger than previous migrations. \nFor the next several months, a team of photographers, including Sagolj, Cathal McNaughton, Danish Siddiqui, Soe Zeya Tun, Adnan Abidi, Mohammad Ponir Hossain, and Hannah McKay, working under the direction of Asia Pictures Editor Ahmad Masood, documented the journeys of refugees by sea on rickety fishing boats and over land through barbed wire and along other routes. \nThey also visited refugee camps to tell the stories of the new lives the Rohingya built and the scars they brought with them. \nWhile the size of camps expanded, one thing that never changed was the stories the refugees brought with them. \n“The same horror stories of killings and rape and massacres that we were hearing when the first refugees started crossing in August and September, the exact same – if not worse – stories were being told three months after that,” Sagolj said. Slideshow (6 Images) \nEven as the team captured images of the refugees at their most vulnerable – mourning mothers, scarred children, survivors of violent attacks – the journalists found that the refugees were surprisingly open. The photographers experienced almost no resistance from refugees as they photographed the refugees and asked about their experiences. \n“I had the impression that these people want everybody to know what happens to them,” Sagolj said. “They all really wanted their story to be told.” Reporting by Andrea Januta, Editing by Leela de Kretser and William Maclean", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T22:19:54.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
