But it quickly becomes apparent in the glib repartee between the two cooks that they are clueless about Southern cooking, which becomes the cue for the announcement that what Mike and Mary are all about is not Southern.\nWhat is Southern, as the videos insist, is the cooking at Cracker Barrel, which includes the new Southern Bowls and other dishes.\nFans of the Food Network in particular will appreciate in the Epsilon work how easy it is to spoof the usually dead serious nature of the fare on that channel and the hosts who front the various cooking programs. For an audience of millennials who may not be keyed into Cracker Barrel and its more Middle American mindset, the Mike and Mary stuff may help lower any barriers that have kept millennials from trying Cracker Barrel.\nMeanwhile, as Mike and Mary-themed advertising plays out in the digital space, a much more traditional TV spot from Havas Chicago has just debuted introducing the Southern Bowls to the mainstream Cracker Barrel audience.\nThe Havas spot is a remarkably ordinary piece of work from a shop that has done much better for Cracker Barrel and other clients. Whether the powers-that-be at the restaurant chain told Havas to tone it down or this is what the agency thought would work best to sell the bowls, the new commercial does not incite much excitement about Cracker Barrel's new menu item.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T22:07:13.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
