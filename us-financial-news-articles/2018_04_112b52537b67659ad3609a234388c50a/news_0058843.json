Adjusted EBITDA does not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows Route1 to compare its operating performance over time on a consistent basis.\nRoute1 used cash in operating activities of approximately $0.4 million during Q4 2017 compared with cash used in operating activities of $0.7 million in Q4 2016.\nBalance Sheet Extracts\nIn 000s of CAD dollars Dec 31\n2017 Sep 30\n2017 Jun 30\n2017 Mar 31\n2017 Dec 31\n2016 Sep 30\n2016 Cash 1,037 1,408 2,080 704 1,946 2,898 Total current assets 2,035 2,856 2,924 1,890 2,910 3,938 Total current liabilities 1,829 2,534 2,396 1,113 2,500 3,555 Net working capital 206 322 528 777 410 383 Total assets 3,171 4,081 4,213 3,114 4,190 5,230 Bank debt 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total shareholders’ equity 1,236 1,432 1,720 1,904 1,600 1,574 Route1’s cash position historically has been at its highest level during the second quarter of the fiscal year as a direct result of the timing of annual enterprise user subscription renewal payments. With the closing of the Group Mobile Int’l, LLC (“Group Mobile”) acquisition in March 2018, this likely will change and the highest level of cash on Route1’s balance sheet will be tied to the timing of payments of larger hardware based sales.\nFiscal Year 2017\nThe Company’s operating results in fiscal year 2017 with comparatives are as follows:\nIn 000s of CAD dollars FY\n2017 FY\n2016 FY\n2015 FY\n2014 FY\n2013 Revenue Device 321 363 156 536 447 Services 5,698 7,080 6,218 5,470 4,948 Other 51 4 23 71 38 Total Revenue 6,070 7,447 6,397 6,077 5,433 Cost of revenue 1,325 1,475 1,164 1,145 1,137 Gross profit 4,745 5,972 5,233 4,932 4,296 Operating expenses 4,736 5,230 4,515 4,398 4,485 Operating profit 5 9 742 718 534 (189 ) Patent litigation 270 56 0 0 0 Total other expenses 349 356 (10 ) (103 ) 154 Comprehensive net income (610 ) 330 728 637 (343 ) 5 Before stock-based compensation\nGroup Mobile\nRoute1 acquired Group Mobile on March 22, 2018. The company is based in Chattanooga, TN and Chandler, AZ. Under the terms of the Agreement, Route1 issued to the seller 25 million common shares, and 30 million, three-year common share purchase warrants with an exercise price of CAD 5 cents per common share. Further details of the acquisition can be found at www.route1.com/route1-closes-the-acquisition-of-group-mobile/ .\nGroup Mobile supplies rugged mobile technology solutions to leading automotive manufacturing companies and suppliers, other leading manufacturing and distribution companies, as well as local and state governments in the southeastern and southwestern United States.\n“Based on historical results we expect Group Mobile to generate quarterly revenue of USD $3.4 million to USD $4.5 million and positive EBITDA”, said Tony Busseri, CEO of Route1 Inc. “During our first month of owning Group Mobile we have invoiced approximately USD $1.1 million, we have orders in hand that haven’t yet been fulfilled of approximately USD $2.5 million, and we have a strong pipeline of quality opportunities in excess of USD $10 million. This pipeline reflects traditional Group Mobile products and services, and does not factor in the various technology and sales crossover opportunities for ActionPLAN and MobiKEY, which we identified during our recent company-wide internal sales strategy meetings held on April 12 and 13. These opportunities are now being initiated with existing and prospective customers; this is truly an exciting time at Route1.”\nAirWatch Update\nOn April 19, 2018 AirWatch filed a Request for a Rehearing of its original IPR petition (which was denied) with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB). The PTAB will make a decision on the Request for the Hearing on no fixed timetable but historical statistics suggest that a low percentage of Rehearing Requests are granted, when responded to by PTAB.\nThe litigation process continues to run in parallel to IPR process. A calendar of upcoming milestones can be found at www.route1.com/investors/patent-litigation/ .\nBusiness Update\nOn March 26, 2018, Route1 held an investor call and webcast to discuss the recently announced acquisition of Group Mobile and the status of the AirWatch litigation. A copy of the presentation can be found on Route1’s website: www.route1.com/company-presentations/ .\nRoute1 expects to announce its Q1 2018 results in late May 2018. At that time, Route1 will hold a further shareholder conference call and webcast.\nAbout Route1 Inc.\nRoute1 Inc. is a world-leader in secure data protection technologies and user authentication for government and enterprise.
