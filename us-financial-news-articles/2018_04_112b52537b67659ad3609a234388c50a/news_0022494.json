They have attracted large cheering crowds in public appearances since their engagement was announced last November. \nThe comic, “The Royals: Prince Harry & Meghan Markle,” is available online in three versions: a traditional 26-page comic book, a hardback 40-page graphic novel and a wedding edition with a special cover by artist Joey Mason. \nMason’s credits include “My Little Pony: The Movie,”“Green Lantern: The Animated Series” and Scooby-Doo projects. \nThe comic book about Harry and Markle is published by U.S.-based TidalWave Productions, which has produced comics about other British royals, including Harry’s older brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton before their wedding. \n“Fans of the royal couple will love this issue for portraying Harry and Meghan as two well-rounded and grounded individuals,” publisher Darren Davis said in a statement. “But it also has enough pomp and spectacle to match the excitement surrounding the event.” Britain's Prince Harry, and his fiancee Meghan Markle, leave after a visit to the Titanic tourist attraction in Belfast, Northern Ireland March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Darren Staples \nThe comic details Harry’s life, including his military career, and Markle’s biracial background, her previous divorce and her acting career. It also includes the death of Harry’s mother, Princess Diana. \nOne panel of the comic reads: “The public couldn’t help but wonder when the young prince would settle down and assume duties of the state. The pressure was on for Harry to leave the bachelor life behind when his brother, Prince William, married Kate Middleton.” \nThe book describes how Harry and Markle met in 2016 through a mutual friend who set them up and how they travelled together to Botswana. It also discusses the couple’s engagement and how Markle’s ring includes Diana’s diamonds. \nThe couple has invited 600 guests to their wedding and requested charitable donations in lieu of gifts.
