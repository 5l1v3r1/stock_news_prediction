We’ll take it,” a relieved Landry said in a greenside interview. \nThe victory came three months after he lost a playoff to Spaniard Jon Rahm at the CareerBuilder Challenge in California. \nLandry, 30, burst onto the scene at the 2016 U.S. Open, when he led after the first round. He finished 15th after playing the final round with eventual winner Dustin Johnson. \nOn Sunday, Landry had to work hard to stave off Mullinax, whose hopes diminished when he chunked a pitch shot at the 17th, failing to clear a bunker between his ball and the cup. \nThe resulting bogey gave Landry the gift of a two-shot lead heading to the par-five 18th, where there was still some suspense, after Landry’s long birdie putt trundled eight feet beyond the hole. \nThat gave Mullinax hope of forcing a playoff, but he allowed for too much break with his nine-foot birdie attempt and had to settle for par. Landry had the luxury of knowing he could miss his par putt but sank it anyway. \nHe said his goal of qualifying for the season-ending Tour Championship, restricted to the top 30 players, had not changed. \n“We still have a lot of work to do but this definitely helps,” he said.
