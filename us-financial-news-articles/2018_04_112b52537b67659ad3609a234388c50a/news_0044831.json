China has ramped up military exercises around the island over the past year.\nThe Chinese maneuvers come at a time of heightened tension between Beijing and Taipei and follow strong warnings by Chinese President Xi Jinping last month against Taiwan separatism.\nXi presided over the navy’s largest-ever military display this month in the South China Sea, which involved 76 fighter jets and a flotilla of 48 warships and submarines.\nChina’s military activities and growing assertiveness has worried its neighbors as well as the United States, whose Pacific command called China a “disruptive force” in January.\nReporting by Adam Jourdan\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
