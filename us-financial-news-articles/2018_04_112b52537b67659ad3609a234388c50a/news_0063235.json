He has said that the referendum result in 2016 meant that \"in some ways, we're all Brexiteers now.\"\nMany in May's Conservative Party, welcomed the appointment, with Liz Truss, a treasury minister, writing on Twitter that Javid \"is effective, no-nonsense and brave.\"\nOthers were less complimentary, with one senior Conservative source saying on condition of anonymity that his words to The Sunday Telegraph newspaper describing his response to the scandal as an obvious bid for the job.\n\"Careful what you wish for,\" the source said.\nJavid's appointment happened just hours after Rudd was forced to resign after she admitted in a letter to May that she had \"inadvertently misled\" a parliamentary committee last Wednesday by denying the government had targets for the deportation of illegal migrants.\nMay accepted her resignation, a blow to the prime minister as Rudd was one of her closest allies. It was also a blow to those lawmakers in the governing Conservative Party who want to retain the closest possible ties with the EU after Brexit.\nBut Rudd now might join forces with other pro-EU Conservative lawmakers, further reducing May's strength in parliament, where she lost her party's majority at an ill-judged election last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T12:43:38.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
