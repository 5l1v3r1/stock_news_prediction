She said the pills, which she believes were quaaludes, caused her to pass out before Mr. Cosby raped her.\n“At the time, I thought, ‘Well, if Bill Cosby says it’s OK, it must be OK to take these,’ ” Ms. Baker-Kinney testified. “Even though I didn’t know him, I trusted him.”\nRelated\nAt Cosby Retrial, Prosecutors, Defense Clash Over Accusations (April 10) Cosby Retrial Opens With Prosecutors Alleging a Predatory Pattern (April 9) Judge Declares Mistrial in Bill Cosby Sexual-Assault Case (June 2017) Mr. Cosby is standing trial for allegedly assaulting a former Temple University employee named Andrea Constand in his home in 2004.\nJudge Steven O’Neill is allowing prosecutors to call five women as witnesses for the narrow purpose of allowing prosecutors to try to make the case that Mr. Cosby followed a pattern when he allegedly assaulted Ms. Constand. At Mr. Cosby’s first trial, the judge allowed just one additional woman testify.\nDefense attorneys tried to undermine the credibility of the three women, by pointing to discrepancies in their prior statements, or by suggesting that they stand to gain fame and possibly money through their participation in the high-profile case.\nJudge O’Neill denied two separate motions for a mistrial made by defense attorneys Wednesday after one woman addressed Mr. Cosby directly and another called him a “serial rapist.”\nThe judge told jurors not to consider the statements as evidence related to Mr. Cosby’s guilt or innocence as it relates to the charges involving Ms. Constand.\nIn one instance, Chelan Lasha turned to Mr. Cosby sitting at the defense counsel table, and asked, “You remember, don’t you, Mr. Cosby?”\nMs. Lasha, who began crying as soon as she entered the courtroom, testified that she met Mr. Cosby in 1986 when she was 17 years old and the star promised to help her with her modeling career. She said that in the Elvis Presley Suite at the Las Vegas Hilton, Mr. Cosby gave her a blue pill after she told him she had a cold.\nShe said she lost control of her body and Mr. Cosby led her to a bed where she was aware of him touching her breasts and grunting. She said she couldn’t move and wondered, “You said you are going to help me. What are you doing to me?”\nShe said she woke up hours later to Mr. Cosby clapping his hands and saying, “Daddy said wake up!” Her shorts and shirt were off and folded neatly on a table, she testified.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Heidi Thomas, a music teacher from Castle Rock, Colo., referred to Mr. Cosby as a “serial rapist.” She testified that she was assaulted by Mr. Cosby when she was an aspiring actress in 1984 after he gave her a glass of wine that incapacitated her.\nDuring a heated exchange, defense attorney Kathleen Bliss asked a series of questions about Ms. Thomas’s motivation for testifying. “Ms. Thomas, you’ve made it very clear that you want to help Andrea Constand, haven’t you?”\n“I want to see a serial rapist convicted,” Ms. Thomas replied.\nJudge O’Neill denied a motion for a mistrial following the statement and reminded the jury that Ms. Thomas’s testimony was “not to be used to infer guilt or anything about the defendant’s character.”\nMr. Cosby has said he had a consensual sexual relationship with Ms. Constand, and he has denied the allegations made by other women.\nMr. Cosby’s retrial on sexual-assault charges involving Ms. Constand comes roughly 10 months after his first trial here ended in a hung jury and mistrial. It is playing out today in a very different atmosphere, following a wave of sexual-misconduct allegations made against powerful men over the past six months.\nCosby attorney Thomas Mesereau has said Ms. Constand made up her account when she had financial troubles and a faltering career in an effort to make a “big score” in a civil settlement. Mr. Cosby paid her $3.38 million to settle that lawsuit.\nWrite to Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T05:18:28.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
