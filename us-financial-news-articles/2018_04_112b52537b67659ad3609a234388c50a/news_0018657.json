REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha \nBond, who started roughly midway through the field of racers leaving at one-minute intervals, clocked an impressive 48 minutes, 45.45 seconds over the 38.5-kilometre course. \nAustralia’s Cameron Meyer, a team time trial world bronze medalist, took gold in 48:13.04 with England’s Harry Tanfield claiming silver in 48:43.30. \n“I’m really happy with the race,” Bond told reporters. “It has probably been my most complete race to date. I executed the race perfectly. I couldn’t have given any more.” Cycling - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Men's Individual Time Trial - Currumbin Beachfront - Gold Coast, Australia - April 10, 2018.

REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha \nThe 32-year-old Bond was previously part of one of the most dominant rowing combinations in history along with Eric Murray, going unbeaten for eight years in the men’s pair and winning Olympic golds at London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. \nThe duo, however, split after Rio with Murray choosing to retire and Bond, already a keen cyclist, eyeing a possible entry at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics on a bike.

I was lucky that I’d done this before. \n“Even though it was less than ideal, you just have to roll with the punches.” Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T08:54:25.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
