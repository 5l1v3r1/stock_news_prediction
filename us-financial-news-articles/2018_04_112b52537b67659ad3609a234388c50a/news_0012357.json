Under the takeover code, Takeda has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid.\nTakeda investors have been sceptical about the merits of a Shire deal, given the size of the potential purchase and the likely need for a large share issue, which could be highly dilutive.\nBut Shire shareholders are impatient with their company’s recent disappointing performance, following the widely criticised acquisition of Baxalta for $32 billion in 2016, which has added to pressure on CEO Flemming Ornskov.\n“The market does not like what Shire is doing, what it did with Baxalta, the fact it’s heavily geared and the strategy of the CEO,” said one top-30 investor. “A lot of shareholders would probably think if you get a credible bid for the business then ‘thank God’, and we can move on.”\nU.S. drugmaker AbbVie in 2014 walked away from a planned $55 billion purchase of Shire after changes to U.S. tax rules that would have allowed it to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates overseas.\nThe AbbVie offer had valued Shire at more than 50 pounds a share, against a current share price of 37.50.
