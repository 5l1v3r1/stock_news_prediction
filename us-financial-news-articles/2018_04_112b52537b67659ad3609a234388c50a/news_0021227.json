But you also know that this is a job that does not last forever.” \nAsked how much Trump and his conduct in office influenced his decision not to seek re-election for his seat representing a district in southeastern Wisconsin, Ryan told reporters, “Not at all.” \nRyan’s announcement marked the latest upheaval in Washington in the second year of Trump’s presidency, following the firings and resignations of a series of senior White House officials and Cabinet members. \nIn 2016, Trump slammed Ryan as a “very weak and ineffective leader.” But on Wednesday, Trump wrote on Twitter: “Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!” \nRyan was scheduled to dine with Trump on Wednesday evening with other Republican congressional leaders.

His retirement has stoked speculation he could be eyeing a presidential campaign in 2020 or beyond, potentially putting him in competition with Trump or Vice President Mike Pence. \nThe House speaker is second in the line of presidential succession, after the vice president. \nRyan, 48, cited as his biggest accomplishment the Republican tax overhaul passed by Congress and signed by Trump without any Democratic support. While Ryan cultivated a reputation as a fiscal conservative, the tax law and federal spending deals he negotiated will help rack up $11.7 trillion in federal deficits over the next decade, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. \nRyan became speaker in 2015 after fellow Republican John Boehner quit following clashes with right-wing lawmakers in the divided party. \nAmong names circulating as a possible Ryan replacement were House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was wounded by a gunman last year. Those two are expected to wage a furious effort to raise campaign funds for fellow House Republicans to shore up support for their potential leadership aspirations. \nMark Meadows, who heads the conservative House Freedom Caucus that helped prompt Boehner’s departure, told reporters the top House Republican job was not on his list of goals.

Bernstein \nIf Republicans lose control of the House in the November elections they would not be picking a new speaker but rather a minority leader. TRUMP AND RYAN \nRyan was criticized by Democrats for what they saw as his failure to stand up to Trump and firmly confront the president on matters such as Trump’s frequent attacks on U.S. law enforcement and his alienation of U.S. allies. \nIn 2016, Ryan hesitated to endorse Trump after it became clear the wealthy New York real estate developer would become the party’s presidential nominee, but eventually did so. \nRyan also voiced unease at candidate Trump’s call for banning Muslims from entering the United States and his criticism of a Mexican-American U.S. judge. A month before the 2016 election, Ryan said he was “sickened” by Trump’s remarks about groping women captured on a 2005 audio tape. \nAfter Trump won in November 2016, Ryan’s words softened as he expressed annoyance at being asked to respond to the president’s incendiary Twitter messages but rarely offered direct criticism. \nEarly in his congressional career, Ryan was part of a group of self-styled “young guns,” conservatives who sought fiscal discipline, earning a reputation as a fiscal policy expert who advocated less government spending and cuts to popular benefit programs. \nRyan said he regretted not being able to scale back spending on social safety net programs such as the Social Security retirement programme and the Medicare and Medicare programs providing health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled.

Bernstein \nIn stepping down, Ryan may have boosted Democratic prospects in November, as some political analysts see a competitive race for his seat. \nDemocrats need to pick up at least 23 seats in the 435-member House to regain the majority. Another congressman, Dennis Ross of Florida, announced on Friday he will not seek re-election. Forty-five House Republicans now have either resigned or announced plans not to seek re-election, compared to 20 Democrats.
