Today is this year's visit and USOC spokesperson says he's never seen so many athletes turn down their invites. The resistance is real. https://t.co/6mKJGicWDS\n— Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) April 26, 2018\nAs the first openly gay members of the U.S. Winter Olympics team, Kenworthy and Rippon have used their platforms to protest, and publicly feuded with Vice President Mike Pence prior to the games.\n“I would definitely decline my White House visit and when we were at our team processing, where everyone gets fitted for an Olympic ring they said: ‘Hey, you can pick this up at the White House visit’ and I said, ‘I’m not going to that’ and they were like ‘yeah, most of the athletes aren’t’,” Kenworthy said in February.\nHe made history when his celebratory kiss with his boyfriend was broadcast on live television.\n“I will not stand with people who discriminate against those that they perceive as different. In lieu of going to DC, I have donated to a few of my favorite causes,” Rippon tweeted Friday .\nHe is preparing to compete on Dancing with the Stars and make a lot of money .\nAdam Rippon tells @CNBC he’s not picky and doesn’t have an ideal sponsor: “I love money.” pic.twitter.com/y5IT6s5ym4\n— Kayla Tausche (@kaylatausche) February 20, 2018\nOther U.S. athletes from PyeongChang are expected to miss the visit to the White House, including Olympic champions Chloe Kim, Shaun White and opening ceremony flag bearer Erin Hamlin. It’s unclear whether their decisions are politically motivated.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/6mKJGicWDS", "https://t.co/y5IT6s5ym4", "https://twitter.com/CNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/Adaripp/status/989879760544321537", "https://twitter.com/guskenworthy/status/989570637386670080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/27/sport/us-winter-olympics-white-house-no-show-lindsey-vonn-gus-kenworthy/index.html?sr=twCNN042718us-winter-olympics-white-house-no-show-lindsey-vonn-gus-kenworthy1021AMStory", "https://twitter.com/kaylatausche/status/965971267823300609", "https://twitter.com/kaylatausche/status/965971267823300609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"], "published": "2018-04-28T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:50:14.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
