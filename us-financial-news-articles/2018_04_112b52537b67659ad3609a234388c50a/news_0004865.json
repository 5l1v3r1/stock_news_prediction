Smith & Nephew has a market value of around $16 billion. \nNawana will take over from Bohuon, who said in October he would leave before the end of 2018, on May 7. His base salary will be $1.54 million a year. \nNawana is a veteran of the medical devices industry, having previously spent more than 15 years at Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). In 2011, he was appointed worldwide president of J&J’s DePuy Synthes Spine unit, where he oversaw integration of Synthes following its acquisition in 2012. \nHe joined Alere as chief operating officer in December 2012, before being promoted to CEO.
