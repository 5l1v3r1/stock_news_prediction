The judge is not expected to decide on the matter during the hearing but will deposit her decision in writing by Monday, the people added.\nThe decision is a key element in an increasingly fierce battle between Elliott and TIM’s top shareholder Vivendi .\nThe activist fund has built up a stake of 9 percent in TIM in a bid to shake-up the way Vivendi has been running Italy’s biggest phone group. The two investors were meant to face off for the first time at the April shareholder meeting.\nPaul Singer’s fund had called for six Vivendi-nominated board members, including TIM Chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, to be replaced with well-known Italian business leaders in a bid to improve governance and strategy.\nBut following Elliott’s move, eight board members nominated by Vivendi resigned, triggering a vote on a full board renewal at a separate shareholder meeting called for May 4.\nDespite the mass resignations, TIM’s statutory auditors included Elliott’s proposal in the agenda for the April meeting - a decision TIM’s board is now challenging in court.\nReporting by Manuela D'Alessandro, writing by Agnieszka Flak\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:59:21.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
