Installed base of XTRAC systems in the U.S. was 753 systems at year end, down 3% from 775 at the end of 2016, as a result of the Company’s strategy to redeploy underperforming XTRAC systems in more productive accounts. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA increased by 67% to $4.8 million in 2017 versus $2.9 million in 2016 Revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 will be in the range of approximately $6.3 million to $6.6 million, down 7 to 11% over first quarter 2017 revenues.\n“We made several important strategic decisions in 2017 that position STRATA for the long term,” stated Frank McCaney, President and Chief Executive Officer of STRATA. “These include the simplification of our balance sheet with the exchange of convertible debt for convertible preferred stock, which provides us with greater financial flexibility.”\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $31.4 million, an increase of 2.4% compared with revenues of $30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.8 million or ($2.85) per diluted common share and ($1,061.25) per diluted Series C share (the significant loss reflects in part the conversion of debt to shares), which included other expense, net of $16.3 million, consisting of $4.6 million in interest expense, net, $0.1 million for the reduction in fair value of warrant liability, and loss on extinguishment of debentures of $11.8 million. This compares with a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $3.3 million or ($3.77) per diluted share, which included other income, net of $0.5 million, consisting of $4.9 in interest expense, net, $5.4 million for the reduction in fair value of warrant liability, and no loss on the extinguishment of debentures.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $8.6 million, an increase of 3.2% compared with revenues of $8.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nNet loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.7 million or ($0.10) per diluted common share and ($36.36) per diluted Series C share, which included other expense, net of $0.3 million, consisting primarily of $0.3 million in interest expense, net. This compares with a net loss for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 of $0.9 million or ($0.41) per diluted share, which included other expense, net of $1.2 million, consisting primarily of $1.3 million of interest expense, net.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.1 million, compared with $3.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company provides certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company’s reference to these non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared under current accounting standards, but are not a substitute for, nor superior to, GAAP results. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and to provide further information for comparative purposes.\nSpecifically, the Company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by isolating certain expenses, gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating results and business outlook. In addition, the Company believes non-GAAP measures enhance the comparability of results against prior periods. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands)\n(Unaudited) (in thousands)\n(Unaudited) Net loss as reported ($ 1,720 ) ($ 887 ) ($18,831 ) ($3,335 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization expense * 1,525 1,522 6,336 6,366 Interest expense, net 304 623 2,056 2,226 Non-cash interest expense 44 706 2,556 2,674 Income taxes (52 ) 64 129 255 EBITDA 101 2,028 (7,754 ) 8,186 Stock-based compensation expense 50 (288 ) 186 113 Change in fair value of warrants (25 ) (80 ) (102 ) (5,396 ) Impairment of lasers placed –in-service 196 - 196 - Impairment of intangible assets 523 - 523 - Loss on extinguishment of debentures - - 11,799 - Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA $845 $1,660 $4,848 $2,903 * Includes depreciation on lasers placed-in-service of $4,247 and $4,410 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nConference Call Details: Date: Monday, April 2 Time: 8:30 am Eastern Time Toll Free: 888-394-8218 International: 323-794-2149 Passcode: 6380302 Webcast: www.strataskinsciences.com About STRATA Skin Sciences, Inc.
