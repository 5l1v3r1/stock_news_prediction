S&P 500 e-minis were up 6.25 points, or 0.24 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 41 points, or 0.63 percent.\nOf the 154 S&P 500 companies that reported first-quarter earnings as of Wednesday, 81.2 percent topped profit estimates. Analysts now expect earnings growth of 22 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nShares of the No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford jumped 1.5 percent after it outlined a plan to cut costs and boost profit margins at a faster pace than previously announced.\nGeneral Motors fell about 2 percent after the company reported a lower quarterly profit as it began the changeover to a redesigned family of high-margin pickup trucks that resulted in lower production.\nSome of the companies reporting after the market close include Amazon, Microsoft and Intel.
