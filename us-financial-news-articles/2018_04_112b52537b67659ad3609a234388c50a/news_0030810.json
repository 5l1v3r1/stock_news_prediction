It could turn into a constitutional crisis, derail Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s energy strategy and dent business confidence. [L1N1RQ1DW] \nAlberta’s legislation, slated for Monday afternoon, could make gasoline more expensive in British Columbia and comes a day after an emergency summit to unlock the stalemate failed. On Sunday, Trudeau pledged financial aid to the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project, reiterating Ottawa has jurisdiction over it and it will be built. \nBut shortly after the summit ended, B.C. Premier John Horgan tweeted: “I will continue to fight to defend B.C. jobs, our economy and environment – now, and for future generations.” \nHorgan campaigned on a pledge to block the expansion, which would nearly triple capacity on the existing pipeline from Alberta to B.C.’s coast. \nTrudeau said his government would draft legislation, which is unlikely to come for several weeks, to reaffirm federal jurisdiction over the issue. \nThe legislation and financial aid have the same aim “of making sure that one, that this pipeline will be built and two, that all of the investors involved know that we take this seriously and they can be confident it will go through,” said a source close to the government. \nKinder Morgan Canada’s shares rose in early trading and then dipped to C$17.17 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 8 Canadian cents. The energy sector as a whole was also slightly down as oil prices slipped.
