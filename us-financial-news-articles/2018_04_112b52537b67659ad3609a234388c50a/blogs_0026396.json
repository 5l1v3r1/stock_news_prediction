REUTERS/Soren Larson Reuters and other news outlets have obtained copies of Comey’s book before its formal release this week. In it, Comey wrote that Trump, in a private meeting, pressed the then-FBI director for his loyalty.\nThe FBI has long tried to operate as an independent law enforcement agency.\n“I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His “memos” are self serving and FAKE!” Trump said on Twitter.\nSlideshow (2 Images) U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, interviewed on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” expressed qualified support for Comey. Ryan, asked whether Comey was a man of integrity, said, “As far as I know” but added that he did not know him well.\nAsked about Trump’s use of the words last week “slime ball” to describe Comey, Ryan said, “I don’t use words like that.”\nReporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T18:53:00.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
