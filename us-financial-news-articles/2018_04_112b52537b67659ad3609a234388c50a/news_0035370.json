The Allergan logo is seen in this photo illustration November 23, 2015. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo \nIt is not clear whether Allergan has submitted an offer, and there is no certainty of a bid, the sources said. Shire on Thursday said it had rejected an offer worth around $61 billion from Takeda. \nThe sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Allergan declined to comment, while Shire and Allergan did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
