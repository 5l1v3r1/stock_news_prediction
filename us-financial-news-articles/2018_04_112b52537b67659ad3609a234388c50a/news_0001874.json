The two teams play again Wednesday night in Boston.\nDeRozan’s floater off the glass with 0.7 seconds left in the third quarter put the Raptors up 84-82 entering the fourth.\nA running layup by DeRozan knotted the score at 94 with 5:26 remaining in the final period, but Horford’s reverse layup and ensuing free throw with 5:05 on the clock put Boston up two and sparked a game-clinching run for the Celtics.\nMorris knocked down a 3-pointer with 4:18 left and Tatum’s finger roll at 3:19 put Boston ahead 104-94. Kyle Lowry’s three with 3:04 to play gave the Raptors life, but Boston iced the game at the free-throw line in the final minute.\nToronto led 55-53 after a first half in which neither side led by more than five points. The Raptors were also up 33-31 after 12 minutes.\nBoston is at Milwaukee on Tuesday, while the Raptors visit the Cavaliers before Wednesday’s rematch in Boston.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:32:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
