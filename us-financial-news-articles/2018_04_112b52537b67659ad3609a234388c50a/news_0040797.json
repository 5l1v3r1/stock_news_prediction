Both parties are hostile to EU budget rules and the anti-immigration League also wants to leave the euro zone as soon as it is politically feasible.\n“One driver for the spread tightening could be that investors are skeptical that those parties can come together as well as an overall good spread environment,” said DZ strategist Daniel Lenk.\n“Italy was a little bit lagging behind Spain and they are catching up now.”\nThe yield on Germany’s 10-year bond, the benchmark for the bloc, was up 1 basis points on the day, trading at 0.542 percent.
