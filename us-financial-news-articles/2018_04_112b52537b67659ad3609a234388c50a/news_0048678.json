It left its benchmark repo rate at 8 percent.\nTen of thirteen economists in a Reuters poll had forecast an increase in the late liquidity window rate, with four predicting a rise of 50 basis points. Three economists each had foreseen hikes of 25 and 75 basis points. Another three had predicted the bank would leave the rate untouched.\nErdogan last week announced presidential and parliamentary elections on June 24, pulling the polls ahead by more than a year, saying Turkey needed to switch quickly to a new executive presidency system due to economic challenges and developments in Syria.\nThe central bank’s efforts to rein in double-digit inflation have been complicated by a sharp sell-off in the lira currency, which has hit a series of record lows this year. Investors have dumped the lira on widening concern about Erdogan’s drive for lower rates.\nA self-described “enemy of interest rates”, Erdogan has repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs, heightening the perception that policy is not independent.\nThe bank also kept the overnight lending rate at 9.25 percent and the overnight borrowing rate at 7.25 percent.
