It’s something I can tell the grandkids. \n“My mum and dad were definitely like, ‘Oops, she’s just flashed the Prince!” she added. \n“There’s no point having a cry about it. You’ve got to have a laugh.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T11:59:13.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
