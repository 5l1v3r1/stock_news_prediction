Still, the metal is on track for a weekly rise of around 7.6 percent, having climbed 11.9 percent last week in the wake of the Rusal sanctions, its biggest weekly jump since 1988. FUNDAMENTALS * LME ALUMINUM: Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange was down 1.1 percent at $2,458.50 a tonne by 0207 GMT, after closing down 2.1 percent in the previous session. Earlier on Thursday, it hit a near seven-year high of $2,718. * SHFE ALUMINIUM: The most-traded June aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was down 2.1 percent at 14,965 yuan ($2,382) a tonne. * NICKEL: LME nickel, which ended down 1.3 percent on Thursday after hitting a three-year high earlier in the session on fears the sanctions could be broadened to Nornickel , was up 0.7 percent at $15,170 a tonne. It is on track for a weekly gain of 8.8 percent, the most since November. * ALUMINIUM: Russian aluminium giant Rusal is stockpiling large quantities of aluminium at one of its plants in Siberia because U.S. sanctions imposed this month have prevented it from selling the metal to customers, five sources close to the company said. * ALUMINA: Kazakhstan is looking to open up new markets for its alumina exports, concerned that U.S. sanctions on Russian aluminium giant Rusal RUAL.MM could hit business and jobs. * BANKS: Lenders to Rusal are exploring how to get rid of their exposure before a May deadline set by the United States, as the fallout from fresh sanctions pulls Russian loan pricing lower in Europe's secondary market.
