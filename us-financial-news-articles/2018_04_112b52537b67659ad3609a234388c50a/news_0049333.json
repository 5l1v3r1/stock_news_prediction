Local newspaper El Nuevo Diario said he was broadcasting live on Facebook.\nThe shot ended his commentary, sending Gahona tumbling down the steps in front of the building. He then lay prone as people screamed his name and rushed to help, the footage showed.\nNeither authorities in Managua, nor Lissett Guido, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Nicaragua, were immediately able to independently confirm details of the incident, which quickly spread onto national, international and social media.\nNicaraguan media said Gahona, who was described as a journalist from the area, died from his injuries.\nIt was not clear who had fired the shot. Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa Quote: d another journalist as saying only police and groups fighting the protesters were armed there.\nBefore the incident, the Red Cross said at least six people had died since protests began on Wednesday against government plans to increase worker contributions and lower pensions, causing a crisis for President Daniel Ortega.\nLocal human rights groups reported that as many as 25 people had died by Saturday. Guido of the Red Cross could not confirm any new total, saying only that she was aware of more deaths.
