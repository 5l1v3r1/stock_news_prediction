After a slow start, the computer maker and later smartphone giant will become the leader in digital album and song downloads by the end of the decade. 2003 \nThe Myspace social network launches and explodes in popularity as a way for music artists to connect with fans across the United States and around the world. Its heyday is around 2005 but it is quickly eclipsed by the rise of Facebook. 2006 \nSpotify is founded as a peer-to-peer file sharing service by serial Swedish entrepreneurs Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. Ek’s original idea morphs into offering a legal service that is “better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry”, the Spotify co-founder told The Telegraph in 2010. 2008 \nThe Stockholm company publicly launches its Spotify service, offering listeners access to a vast library of recordings rather than making users pay for CDs or downloads of albums or tracks. \nThe music industry, then suffering from devastating consumer spending declines, resists Spotify’s promise of “unlimited access” to music in favour of the then current fashion of selling digital downloads based on the Apple iTunes model. 2011 \nSpotify signs its first U.S. licensing deals with major record labels, which had previously restricted contracts to experiments in overseas markets. 2014 \nSpotify pushes forward with a two-sided business model by offering a free, advertising-supported service to attract new users in order to eventually convince them to upgrade to a paid monthly, ad-free subscription service. In 2014, it attracts 10 million paying members from among its 40 million active users. \nPopular artist Taylor Swift pulls her music off Spotify and other streaming services for three years, blaming them for the rapid decline in sales of CDs and other recording formats. Spotify and Swift reconcile in 2017 after Spotify strikes new licensing deals with record labels. \nGlobal recorded music industry revenues hit rock bottom in 2014 after a 15-year free fall, having declined by 40 percent to $14.3 billion from $23.8 billion in 1999. \n2015-2018 \nThe music business returns to growth in 2015 driven by streaming service revenues, which now account for 60 percent of recorded music sales, according to market estimates, and Spotify claims to be a key factor in the revival as the market leader. \nGlobal sales rose 3 percent in 2015, then another 6 percent to reach $15.7 billion in 2016, according to industry reports. \nJune 2015 - Spotify crosses 20 million subscribers. \n2016 - 30 million paying subscribers. \nSeptember 2016 - 40 million paying subscribers. \nMarch 2017 - 50 million subscribers. \nJanuary 2018 - Spotify says has 70 million paid-up subs. \nIn its first 10 years, Spotify claims to have paid out $8 billion in royalties to music artists, publishers and labels. \nSOURCES: Company reports, Reuters, BTIG analyst Research Richard Greenfield Reporting by Eric Auchard in London, editing by Louise Heavens", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:55:56.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
