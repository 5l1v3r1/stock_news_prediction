REUTERS/Brendan McDermid “It has been a very erratic day, it’s a bit crazy,” said Rabobank metals sector economist Casper Burgering. “Nickel went up by almost 10 pct and aluminium by almost 8 percent and now are coming right back down.” Expect more volatility, he said.\nThe Thomson Reuters CoreCommodity total return index .TRCCRBTR opened on Thursday near its highest since mid-2015, before giving back all its gains.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 116.23 points, or 0.47 percent, to 24,631.84, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 18.31 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,690.33 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 57.58 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,237.66.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.02 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS shed 0.47 percent.\nThe bullish sentiment in markets comes amid wider optimism about economic growth. The global economy is expected to expand this year at its fastest pace since 2010, the latest Reuters polls of over 500 economists worldwide suggest, but trade protectionism could quickly slow it down.\nInvestors were also relieved that no new U.S. demands on trade came out of a summit between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 14/32 in price to yield 2.9173 percent, its highest since Feb. 21.\nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR fell 1-7/32 in price to yield 3.1097 percent, from 3.046 percent late on Wednesday.\nThe dollar .DXY rose 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies as the higher yields and expectations of more Federal Reserve rate increases offset concerns about a trade war and a ballooning U.S. budget deficit.\nAdditional reporting by Maytaal Angel in London, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru, Richard Leong and David Gaffen in New York; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T04:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T04:24:35.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
