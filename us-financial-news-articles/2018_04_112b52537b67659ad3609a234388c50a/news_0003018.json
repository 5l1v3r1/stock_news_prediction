Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump's tweet on Tuesday, and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.\n(Reporting by Steve Holland Additional reporting by Makini Brice and Lisa Lambert Writing by Susan Heavey Editing by Bill Rigby and Chris Reese)\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T21:26:36.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
