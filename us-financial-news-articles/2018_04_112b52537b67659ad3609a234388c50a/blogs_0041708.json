Skyworks Solutions , Qualcomm , Cirrus Logic , Qorvo and Analog Devices shares all declined more than 3 percent. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T19:23:56.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
