REUTERS/Evrard Ngendakumana Nkurunziza’s office said in a statement late on Thursday that Ezéchiel Nibigira, former chief of the ruling CNDD-FDD party youth wing, known as Imbonerakure, will take over the foreign affairs docket from Alain-Aimé Nyamitwe, who was appointed to the post in 2015.\nThe move was part of a broader cabinet reshuffle that brings in five new faces, including former senator Evelyne Butoyi who becomes the new minister of youth and information technology. She was a top CNDD FDD party official in the past in charge of communication.\nBurundi was plunged into a crisis in 2015 which has killed hundreds and left the economy moribund after Nkurunziza said he planned to run for a third term, a move the opposition said was unconstitutional and violated a peace deal that had ended the country’s civil war in 2005.\nNkurunziza was re-elected, but some of his opponents took up arms against him. Rights groups say an estimated 400,000 people have sought refuge from the violence in neighboring countries.\nWriting by Omar Mohammed; Editing by George Obulutsa and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T12:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T12:49:46.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
