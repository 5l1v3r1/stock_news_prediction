The pilots are permitted to strike after a 21-day cooling-off period that begins after that date, right before a busy summer travel season, the union said.\nALPA, which represents more than 60,000 pilots at 34 airlines in the United States and Canada, said it aimed to avoid a possible May 19 strike, but were prepared for all outcomes.\n“A strike authorization vote is a common step by unions in context of the overall labor negotiation process,” WestJet said in a statement.\n“We remain focused on successfully negotiating an agreement that will benefit our pilots and WestJet,” it said.\nEarlier this month, WestJet Chief Executive Ed Sims said he aimed to reach a first agreement with unionized pilots this year, in a break with the carrier’s former CEO Gregg Saretsky, who said he did not expect a first contract before 2019.\nIn February, ALPA had filed a labor complaint against the Calgary-based commercial airline for bypassing the union during hiring at the airline’s new ultra low-cost carrier (ULCC) Swoop, among other issues.\nALPA said the pilots who work for the new no-frills carrier should earn the same rates as the men and women who fly WestJet planes.
