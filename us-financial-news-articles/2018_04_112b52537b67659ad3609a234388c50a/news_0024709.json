REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/Files India last week issued a request for information for 110 combat jets for the air force, marking the first step toward a long-delayed deal that could be worth more than $15 billion.\nThe planes have to be built locally as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Make-in-India drive to build a domestic industrial base.\nBoeing said it stood ready to build an aerospace manufacturing system in India along with its partners that will help India’s own aircraft manufacturing programmes.\n“The Super Hornet Make in India proposal is to build an entirely new and state-of-the-art production facility that can be utilized for other programs like India’s Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA) program,” Boeing said in a statement during an Indian defence exhibition in the southern city of Chennai.\nThe logo of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) is seen on the facade of the company's heritage centre in Bengaluru, March 28, 2018.

Sweden’s Saab has said it will build the planes in collaboration with the Adani Group, a resources conglomerate.\nThe air force tender will be open for makers of both single engine and twin-engined combat jets, in a widening of the field. The Eurofighter Typhoon and Russian aircraft are also potential contenders under the new requirements.\nThe logo of Mahindra and Mahindra is seen at a showroom in Mumbai, India, August 30, 2016.
