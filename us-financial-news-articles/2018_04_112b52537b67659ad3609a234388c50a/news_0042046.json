Lawmakers enacted a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Governor Bruce Rauner’s vetoes in July.\nLegislators have since begun work on a budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.\nThe state was the fourth-biggest issuer of debt in the muni market last year, according to Thomson Reuters data. It sold $6 billion of GO bonds in October to pay overdue bills and $750 million of GO bonds in November to fund capital projects.\nIncluding Illinois, there is a total of $7.78 billion of bonds and $262.3 million of notes scheduled to hit the market next week.\nMassachusetts has a $500 million GO bond issue scheduled for competitive sale in two parts on Tuesday. Series C bonds carry maturities from 2029 through 2034 and series D bonds are due in 2035 through 2048, according to the preliminary official statement.\nThe bonds are rated AA-plus by Fitch Ratings, which said the high rating reflects Massachusetts’ “considerable economic resources, strong budget controls and a record of careful financial management.”\nU.S. municipal bond funds reported $515.2 million of net outflows in the week ended April 18, marking a third-straight week of negative flows, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper division.\nApril outflows are typically attributed to investors cashing in muni investments to pay their taxes.\nReporting by Laila Kearney in New York and Karen Pierog in Chicago; Editing by Daniel Bases and Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/", "http://reut.rs/2JXIf0B"], "published": "2018-04-21T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T21:59:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
