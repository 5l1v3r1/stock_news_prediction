That was slightly better than the average 8.9 billion baht estimate of four analysts in a Reuters survey and was its fastest growth since the second quarter of 2017. \nBangkok Bank attributed the profit rise to a 32 percent jump in non-interest income driven by mutual funds and loan-related services. \nThailand’s economy, Southeast Asia’s second-largest, has benefitted from higher tourist arrivals and stronger exports, with the central bank raising in March its forecasts for economic growth and exports this year. \nBut Thai lenders are facing rising competition from the likes of payments firms and fintech companies, whose growth is being encouraged by the government through the provision of initiatives. That is leading to an increase in costs. \nSiam Commercial Bank, the second-largest bank, reported on Thursday a 4.6 percent dip in first-quarter net profit, partly due to costs associated with investments in digital banking. \nThai banks announced in March they are waiving fees for digital transactions, a major source of their fee income, in a bid to retain customers. \nSubsequently, Kasikornbank warned earlier this month that its non-interest income for 2018 would fall by 6 percent to 8 percent.
