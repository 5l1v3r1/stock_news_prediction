That influx has affected housing, health and education services in Brazil’s poorest state capital.\nThe U.N. center’s opening follows Wednesday’s announcement by the federal government that it would build five shelters to house 2,000 refugees in Boa Vista, doubling current capacity, and a shelter for 500 people in the border town of Pacaraima.\nThat came after Roraima’s governor controversially asked the Supreme Court on April 13 to shut the border crossing until orderly immigration procedures could be put in place, and for the federal government to step up assistance to the state.\nIn response, President Michel Temer said closing the border was “unthinkable”.\nMany migrants have been sleeping in the city’s squares, but with the rainy season looming, the authorities have taken action to avoid a “collapse”, said Teresa Surita, Boa Vista’s mayor.\n“We are closing the squares in order to move these people to shelters,” Surita said.\n“The federal government arrived late, but arrived,” she said, referring to a provisional measure that saw $56 million allocated as assistance for Venezuelans, along with troops to patrol the border.\nFederal citizen’s rights prosecutor Joao Akira said the battle between local, state and federal authorities over the largest influx of Venezuelan refugees in Brazil’s history had worsened matters.\n“This situation came this far because of the blame game between governments,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.\n“The migration of Venezuelans to Brazil did not start today. But nobody was willing to take responsibility.”\nVenezuelans have also fled to Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Panama, Argentina and Peru, while others have sought refugee status in the United States, Spain, Mexico and Costa Rica, according to the UNHCR.\nReporting by Karla Mendes, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
