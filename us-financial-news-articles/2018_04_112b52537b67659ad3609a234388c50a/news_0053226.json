Since then, the Nervion side have gone nine games without a win, with five defeats,” said a statement on Sevilla’s official website.\nCaparros has had a long coaching career in Spain and took charge of Sevilla between 2000 and 2005, winning promotion back to the top flight in 2001.\n“The coach (Caparros) will lead the team in the 2017/18 run-in and will then stay linked with the club in a role which had already been determined once Sevilla’s sporting structure had been reorganised,” Sevilla said in a separate statement.\n“After a call from president Jose Castro, the experienced coach did not hesitate to accepting control of the first team squad as the team pushes to qualify for European football in the season’s four remaining games.” Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T19:49:40.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
