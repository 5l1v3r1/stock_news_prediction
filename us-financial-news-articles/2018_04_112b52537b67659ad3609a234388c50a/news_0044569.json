Obviously being down is never fun. I played much better in the tie-breaker and got a lot of confidence from that. \n“I was fighting to stay in the match and play some good tennis. My first Fed Cup win in two years feels awesome.” \nThe reverse singles are scheduled on Sunday, followed by a doubles match between the French pair of Mladenovic and Amandine Hesse and Americans Madison Keys and Bethanie Mattek-Sands. \nThe Americans hold an 11-2 winning record over the French.
