Literally, it was built before there were automobiles. It was built for people,” de Blasio said. \nMore than 42 million visitors a year are drawn to Central Park, which encompasses more than 800 acres (325 hectares) in the borough of Manhattan. The park, which includes a zoo, reservoir, boating lakes and event spaces, has been designated as a National Historic Landmark since 1962. \nMotorists have been banned since 2015 from the loop drives in the northern part of the park, de Blasio said. The new ban will cover the whole park, except for four transverse roadways that were built into the park’s original design to accommodate traffic. \n“There’s gonna be a kind of peace and sense of security that wasn’t there before,” de Blasio said.
