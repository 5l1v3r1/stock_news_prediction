The distribution rate should not be considered the yield or total return on an investment in the Fund.\nIn compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice will be provided to shareholders for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. A portion of each distribution may be treated as paid from sources other than net investment income, including but not limited to short-term capital gain, long-term capital gain or return of capital.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2017 will be made after year-end.

Investors should consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing.\nThe investment return, price, yields, market value and net asset value (“NAV”) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to their NAV, which may increase an investor’s risk of loss. There is no assurance that the Fund will meet its investment objective. The Fund’s distribution rate may be affected by numerous factors, including changes in realized and projected market returns, Fund performance, and other factors. There can be no assurance that a change in market conditions or other factors will not result in a change in a Fund distribution rate at a future time.\nAn investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle. Investors should carefully review and consider the Fund’s investment objective, risk, charges and expenses before investing.\nInvestment return and principal value will fluctuate, and it is possible to lose money by investing in the Fund. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

The Fund’s primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current income with a secondary objective of capital appreciation. The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in first- and second-lien secured loans, unsecured loans and high yield corporate debt instruments. It expects to employ a dynamic strategy of investing in a targeted portfolio of loans and fixed-income instruments of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers and implementing hedging strategies in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nAbout KKR Credit\nLaunched by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (“KKR”) in 2004, KKR Credit invests on behalf of its managed funds, clients and accounts across the corporate credit spectrum, including secured credit, bank loans and high yield securities and alternative assets such as mezzanine financing, special situations investing and structured finance.

Such investments may be secured, partially secured or unsecured and may be unrated, and whether or not rated, may have speculative characteristics. The market price of the Fund’s investments will change in response to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, when interest rates rise, the values of fixed‐income instruments fall, and vice versa.\nUse of leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and return for Common Shareholders but, at the same time, creates risks, including the likelihood of greater volatility in the NAV and market price of, and distributions on, the Common Shares. In particular, leverage may magnify interest rate risk, which is the risk that the prices of portfolio securities will fall (or rise) if market interest rates for those types of securities rise (or fall). As a result, leverage may cause greater changes in the Fund’s NAV, which will be borne entirely by the Fund’s Common Shareholders.\nDerivative investments have risks, including the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets of the Fund. The risk of loss from a short sale is unlimited because the Fund must purchase the shorted security at a higher price to complete the transaction and there is no upper limit for the security price. The use of options, swaps, and derivatives by the Fund has the potential to significantly increase the Fund’s volatility. In addition to the normal risks associated with investing, international investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values, from differences in generally accepted accounting principles or from social, economic or political instability in other nations. The Fund’s investments in securities or other instruments of non‐U.S. issuers or borrowers may be traded in undeveloped, inefficient and less liquid markets and may experience greater price volatility and changes in value.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409006462/en/\nFor KKR Income Opportunities Fund\nKristi Huller, 212-230-9722\nKristi.Huller@kkr.com\nSource: KKR Income Opportunities Fund", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409006462/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kkrfunds.com%2Fkio&esheet=51785822&newsitemid=20180409006462&lan=en-US&anchor=www.kkrfunds.com%2Fkio&index=1&md5=0d6c85a9630b7b9e7345729616213ca9"], "published": "2018-04-10T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T03:08:20.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
