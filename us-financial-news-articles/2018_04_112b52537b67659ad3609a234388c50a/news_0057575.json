The poor showing was partly offset by growth in Femsa’s Oxxo stores, pharmacies and gas stations.\nOxxo’s same-store sales increased 7.5 percent on average, benefiting from pre-Easter shopping in late March that lifted sales across the sector, including at Wal-Mart de Mexico and El Puerto de Liverpool.\nMexico’s retailers association ANTAD expects same-store sales in the sector to grow 5.8 percent this year as inflation cools and higher public spending ahead of the July 1 presidential election trickles down to consumers, analysts said.\nFemsa Chief Executive Officer Eduardo Padilla cheered signs of a drop in Mexican inflation, saying the company’s quarterly results were slightly better than expected. He added that the election environment along with demand during the upcoming World Cup soccer tournament in Russia should benefit Oxxo in the second quarter.\nPadilla, however, added that consumer confidence had yet to fully recover from the impact of inflation. “I’m not fully confident the consumer is back,” he said on the analyst call.\n$1 = 18.303 pesos per dollar at end of first quarter Reporting by Noe Torres, Gabriel Stargardter and Daina Beth Solomon in Mexico City and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T21:37:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
