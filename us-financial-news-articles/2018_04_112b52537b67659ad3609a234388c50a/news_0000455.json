Prosecutors say she died either by strangulation or by having her throat cut. Madsen faces up to life in prison if convicted . \nHe denies murdering Wall, although he admits he cut up her body so he could get it out of the 17-metre (56-foot) submarine. He intended to dispose of the body parts at sea to restore a “normal” condition on board, he said, adding that he was not thinking rationally at the time.
