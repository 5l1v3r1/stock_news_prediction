Wade Davis closed it and earned his seventh save.\nBoth starters came away with no-decisions. Stephen Strasburg allowed four runs in six innings. Tyler Anderson of the Rockies lasted 4 2/3 innings and gave up three runs on only two hits and struck out six but walked six.\nBryce Harper hit his seventh homer of the season in the first inning and gave Washington (7-9) a 1-0 lead.\nThe Rockies tied it on a Charlie Blackmon homer in the fourth before the Nationals took a 3-1 lead with two in the fifth.\nWith the bases loaded and two outs, Antonio Senzatela relieved Anderson and threw a high pitch to Ryan Zimmerman that glanced off the glove of catcher Chris Iannetta and went toward the backstop. Michael A. Taylor scored and then Trea Turner came in when Iannetta made a high throw to Senzatela covering the plate.\nBut Blackmon tied it in the sixth with a two-run double to right with two outs. Carlos Gonzalez followed with a single off Strasburg that gave the Rockies a 4-3 lead.\nWashington tied it in the bottom of the inning when Matt Wieters hit a solo homer, making it 4-4.\nDJ LeMahieu hit a solo homer in the top of the eighth inning which gave Colorado a 5-4 lead before Taylor doubled with two outs, stole third and tied it on an Ottavino wild pitch in the bottom half.\nAnthony Rendon (sore big toe) was out of the Washington lineup for the second consecutive game. He is still considered day-to-day, and Daniel Murphy (knee surgery) will be doing extended spring training in Florida starting this week.\nâ€” Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:33:16.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
