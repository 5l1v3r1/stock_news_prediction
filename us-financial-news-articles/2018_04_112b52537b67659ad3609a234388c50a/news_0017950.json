But the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods a week later sent the price to a two-week low.\nOil markets have been supported by healthy demand and supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nHowever, soaring U.S. crude production, which has jumped by a quarter since mid-2016, threatens to undermine OPEC's efforts.\nThe American Petroleum Institute will publish storage data later on Tuesday while the U.S. Energy Information Administration releases its monthly report on U.S. production.\n\"Todays monthly report from the EIA is likely to confirm that the supply situation is set to ease, primarily on the back of growing non-OPEC production,\" Commerzbank said in a note.\n\"It is doubtful whether this will pressure the price, however, as the most recent price drivers were for the most part not fundamental in nature.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T04:19:25.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
