Distribution of an estimated 1,108 units were sold directly to 22 retailers in Utah, two in Massachusetts and one in each of Arizona, Georgia, Minnesota and California. The lot number can be found on the bottom of each bottle.\nOne illness has been reported to date to the Food and Drug Administration.\nThe recall was initiated after NGB Corp. was notified of positive Salmonella test results by the Food and Drug Administration. NGB Corp. has identified the supplier and source of contaminated product and has ceased the production and distribution of the product.\nConsumers who may be in possession of potentially contaminated products are advised not to consume products labeled NxtGen Botanicals Maeng Da Kratom.
