But the series, along with Carter’s performance, have given “Wonder Woman” a long legacy as a feminist symbol. \nAt times choking with emotion, Carter thanked her friends and family for their support as well as a nod to the men who helped stand behind women’s stories. \n“From all of the wonder women out there, we love our men who stand with us and champion our causes and our voices,” Carter said.
