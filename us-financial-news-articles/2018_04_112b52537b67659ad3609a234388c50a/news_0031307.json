It is also changing the rate used to calculate how much insurers should pay for personal injuries. \n“There are a number of hurdles that will need to be cleared before a new discount rate comes into effect ... the possibility of further increases in Insurance Premium Tax, continued uncertainty caused by the Brexit negotiations and ongoing pressures on repair costs,” Stephen Jones, lead, UK P&C pricing practice at Willis Towers Watson, said. \nCompanies such as Admiral ( ADML.L ), Direct Line ( DLGD.L ) and esure ( ESUR.L ) and Hastings ( HSTG.L ) provide motor insurance in Britain’s insurance sector. \n($1 = 0.7005 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T03:38:42.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
