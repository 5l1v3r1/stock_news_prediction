REUTERS/Randall Campos It could also reflect the mood elsewhere in Latin America, where elections are being held this year in several countries that have backed same sex unions, provoking a conservative reaction.\nAlvarado Quesada, until recently a minister in the outgoing government, will be the youngest president in the modern history of Costa Rica when he takes office in May.\nAlso known for his student prog-rock band, he used the campaign to appeal to his country’s centrist streak. His vice presidential candidate, Epsy Campbell, will be the country’s first Afro-Costa Rican to serve in that role.\nOpponent Alvarado Munoz had vowed to restore what he called traditional values by preventing gay marriage and restricting women’s access to abortions.\nThe two men took opposing positions on a January decision by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, an influential regional body based in San Jose.\nSlideshow (9 Images) Fabricio, as supporters refer to Alvarado Munoz, called the ruling an affront to sovereignty. Threatening to remove the country from the court’s jurisdiction, he shot from the margins to win the first round of voting in February.\nQuesada, by contrast, backed the court’s ruling. In the campaign’s final debate, he called his opponent’s comments homophobic.\nReporting by David Alire Garcia and Enrique Andres Pretel; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T07:27:18.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
