Three of Lada models, Vesta, Granta and Largus entered the top-10 list bestsellers in Russia, Avtovaz said.\n“Significant forex fluctuations in the beginning of April 2018 might negatively impact the Russian automotive market and Avtovaz financial results later this year”, Avtovaz president Nicolas Maure said.\nRussian markets were hit hard in early April as investors reacted to a new round of U.S. sanctions targeting some of the country’s biggest tycoons.
