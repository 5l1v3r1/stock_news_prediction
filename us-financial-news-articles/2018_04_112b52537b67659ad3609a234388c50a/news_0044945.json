Netback is determined by deducting royalties, net operating expenses and transportation expenses from petroleum and natural gas revenue. The Company commenced operations July 1, 2016.\nFourth Quarter Summary\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Point Loma was negatively impacted by the combination of low natural gas prices as well as having to incur considerable workover expenses, resulting in lower netback than anticipated, despite increased production. It is expected in 2018 that a combination of reduced operating costs, more stabilized commodity prices, together with increased production volumes will help to improve overall netback.\nExit rate production for the 2017 year was approximately 630 boe/d was realized, consisting of approximately 130 boe/d of crude oil and liquids and 3.0 mmcf/d of natural gas.\nOutlook\nIn March 2018, Point Loma announced the entering of a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain oil and gas properties in Alberta for cash consideration of $1.3 million. The acquisition is expected to provide incremental production of 315 boe/d, consisting of 120 boe/d of crude oil and liquids and 1,170 mcf/d of natural gas.\nIn addition, Point Loma raised $0.7 million through a private placement with Evenergy in the first quarter of 2018, and may seek to raise incremental funds through further private placements, joint operating agreements or other transactions beneficial to the Corporation to further develop its large asset base.\nPoint Loma will reactivate several formerly producing wells through pipeline re-connection to Point Loma owned and operated processing facilities in Thornbury. Point Loma also intends to increase liquids production with the recent processing agreement signed to re-direct gas to a deep cut facility in the Paddle River area. In total, the Corporation’s production is expected to exceed 1,000 boe/d during the second quarter of 2018.\nAdditional Information\nPoint Loma has filed its annual audited financial statements, Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31, 2017 with Canadian securities regulators.

Although Point Loma believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements and information are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements and information because Point Loma cannot give assurance that they will prove to be correct.\nSince forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates; the inability of Point Loma to bring additional production on stream or in the anticipated quantities disclosed herein; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, resources, production, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental risks; competition; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions; ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties and environmental regulations, actual production from the acquired assets may be greater or less than estimates. Management has included the above summary of assumptions and risks related to forward-looking information provided in this press release in order to provide security holders with a more complete perspective on Point Loma’s future operations and such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nThe forward-looking statements and information contained in this press release are made as of the date hereof and Point Loma does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.\nOil and Gas Information\n“BOEs” may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 Mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\nSource: Point Loma Resources Ltd", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nZyufqUReLMwlkUuBtawWAQ3f6XD0Ios0cXv58CirfXm8udlTy0jLnjHNsvXF_HT417DXk2mNe9_JKKUqZd6_qDTGteZRokcgZmpJ_EJqUY=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=R5dDEIa9sBYocrmI1i2GXh8nVeRys-j1kD9osNPmjEYxAgtsfGmeNm8dv0RnlFAIVZl6ftV3sxIVz56iePM8Bg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bka-e7WkDpsn08-egMKkIoLRZp1FIDEL2Bl8Mqpa6g1OPceqvl0Vm3XNjZBO7CkLy2j2hdmnt4sSb4pdFpbLWg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=PfKsfK9ROBnT9ttf621vICus9LoqkTkxIKG6KgF9_m33aCYi6svbBHgOk_pnUuSo-m-_lhK1MKhTVEL0lM2ATLa48CuUta2WvlC2wpWzDeE=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5ArT7cLWC_S6Ty6XvpC-r96fcn5IACK0Tgl2ErzGkxo_AFJOLitkQeA5zFwuGuM6l-sZIQWvGBvPKF8oC2PXKlauSOydTkONyWa4-hxIB4Q="], "published": "2018-04-20T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T17:46:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
