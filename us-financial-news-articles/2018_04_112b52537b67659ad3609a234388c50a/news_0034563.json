The same is true of asset managers.” \nLGIM said it wanted to see companies report in line with guidance from the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, which was set up by the G20. \n“We also expect you to outline the potential impact on your business, where material, of a rise in world temperatures above the two degrees Celsius target set in the Paris climate accord,” it said, referring to the 2015 deal on global warming. \nCompanies should also relate their strategy to the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, where relevant, it said, referring to a plan to tackle a range of issues including poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease by 2030. DIVERSITY DEMAND \nWhile there had been some shift towards diversity, LGIM said company boards should consider creating an advisory committee of external experts to help challenge consensus views. \nLGIM said it expected British companies to disclose the gender breakdown and pay-gap of board directors, managers and employees as well as their plan to close any gap, adding it would begin voting against the chair of any board in the FTSE 350 if women did not make up at least 25 percent of the board. \nCompanies should also make greater efforts to demonstrate their long-term strategy was sound by showing how sustainability was reflected in their operations, through an analysis of risks and opportunities, target setting and public disclosures. \nAs more companies look to list with reduced shareholder rights, such as U.S. tech firm Snap ( SNAP.N ), LGIM said it was “increasingly concerned” and would work with regulators and others to “strengthen the integrity of the market”.
