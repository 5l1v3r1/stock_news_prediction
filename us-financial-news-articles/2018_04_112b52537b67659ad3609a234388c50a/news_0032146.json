Sales of $2.8 billion increased 9 percent versus $2.5 billion in the first quarter of 2017. There were 64 selling days in the 2018 first quarter, the same as the 2017 first quarter. Net earnings for the quarter of $232 million were up 32 percent versus $175 million in 2017. Earnings per share of $4.07 increased 39 percent versus $2.93 in 2017.\n\"Results for the quarter were strong, led by increased volume in our U.S. business with both large and medium customers, supported by a strong demand environment. Performance in Canada has improved although we are still in the early stages of the turnaround. Our single channel and international businesses also contributed to the strong performance,\" said DG Macpherson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We remain confident that the strategic actions we are executing in the United States and Canada are helping us create a stronger business. Based on the encouraging results we're seeing,\" Macpherson concluded, \"we are increasing our sales and EPS guidance for the year.\"\nAs a result, the company raised its 2018 sales and earnings per share guidance for the year and now expects sales growth of 5 to 8 percent and earnings per share of $14.30 to $15.30. The company's previous 2018 guidance, communicated on Jan. 24, 2018, was sales growth of 3 to 7 percent and earnings per share of $12.95 to $14.15.\nCompany\nSales increased 9 percent in the 2018 first quarter versus the prior year, driven by an 8 percentage point increase from volume, 2 percentage points from foreign exchange and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from the divestiture of a specialty business.\nCompany operating earnings of $335 million for the 2018 first quarter increased 14 percent versus $293 million in the 2017 quarter. The increase was driven by higher sales and strong expense leverage.\nThe first quarter contained the following restructuring items:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nDiluted earnings per share reported\n$ 4.07\n$ 2.93\n39%\nPretax adjustments:\nRestructuring (United States)\n0.05\n0.05\nBranch gains (United States)\n(0.13)\n(0.16)\nRestructuring (Canada)\n0.19\n0.02\nRestructuring (Other Businesses)\n0.02\n—\nRestructuring (Unallocated expense)\n0.01\n—\nTotal pretax adjustments\n0.14\n(0.09)\nTax effect (1)\n(0.03)\n0.04\nTotal, net of tax\n0.11\n(0.05)\nDiluted earnings per share adjusted\n$ 4.18\n$ 2.88\n45%\n(1) The tax impact of adjustments is calculated based on the income tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction, subject to deductibility limitations and the company's ability to realize the associated tax benefits.\nThe company has two reportable business segments, the United States and Canada, which represented approximately 79 percent of company sales for the quarter. The remaining operating businesses are located in Europe, Asia and Latin America. The single channel online businesses are included in Other Businesses and are not reportable segments.\nUnited States\nSales for the U.S. segment increased 8 percent versus the 2017 first quarter. The increase was driven by 9 percentage points from volume growth, 1 percentage point from intercompany sales and 1 percentage point from higher sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from the divestiture of a specialty business. Sales to customers in the Retail and Contractors end markets led the sales performance in the quarter.\nOperating earnings for the U.S. segment increased 15 percent in the quarter driven by higher sales and improved expense management. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 1.0 percentage point driven by the company's strategic price initiatives, partially offset by positive customer mix. The lower gross profit margin includes a 0.6 percentage point decline from implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's new revenue recognition standard that primarily reclassifies certain costs related to KeepStock services from operating expenses to cost of goods sold. In the 2018 first quarter, operating expenses were down 1 percent.\nCanada\nFirst quarter 2018 sales for Canada decreased 2 percent in U.S. dollars and 6 percent in local currency. The 6 percent decrease consisted of a 13 percentage point decline in volume, partially offset by 7 percentage points from higher price.\nThe business in Canada posted a $20 million operating loss in the 2018 first quarter versus a $17 million operating loss in the prior year, primarily driven by higher restructuring expenses. The gross profit margin in Canada increased 3.3 percentage points versus the prior year largely due to price increases that began in late 2017. Operating expenses increased 12 percent, driven by costs related to the business model reset. Reported results include $10.9 million of restructuring costs. Excluding those charges, operating expenses were down 3 percent and the operating loss was $9 million.\nOther Businesses\nSales for the Other Businesses increased 18 percent versus the prior year, consisting of 12 percentage points of growth from volume and price and 6 percentage points from foreign exchange. The performance was driven by 24 percent sales growth for the single channel online businesses.\nOperating earnings for the Other Businesses were $36 million in the 2018 first quarter versus $32 million in the prior year. This performance included strong results from MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States and improved performance from the international businesses.\nOther\nOther income and expense was a net expense of $28 million in the 2018 first quarter versus a net expense of $22 million in the 2017 first quarter. This increase was primarily due to interest expense from the $400 million in additional long-term debt the company issued in 2017. For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2018 was 21.6 percent versus 32.4 percent in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the 2017 tax legislation. The company is currently projecting an effective tax rate of 23 to 26 percent for the year 2018. The first quarter tax rate was below the full year range primarily due to the benefit from stock-based awards. Future tax benefits from stock-based awards are not estimated in the full year projection.\nCash Flow\nOperating cash flow was $147 million in the 2018 first quarter versus $181 million in the 2017 first quarter. The company used the cash generated during the quarter to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures in the 2018 first quarter were $49 million. In the quarter, Grainger returned $245 million to shareholders through $72 million in dividends and $173 million to buy back 668,000 shares of stock.\nWebcast\nGrainger will conduct a live conference call and webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 19, 2018, to discuss the first quarter. The webcast will be hosted by DG Macpherson and can be accessed at www.grainger.com/investor .

ROIC is calculated using operating earnings divided by net working assets (a 2-point average for the year-to-date). Net working assets are working assets minus working liabilities defined as follows: working assets equal total assets less cash equivalents (2-point average of $103.2 million), deferred taxes, and investments in unconsolidated entities, plus the LIFO reserve (2-point average of $382.4 million). Working liabilities are the sum of trade payables, accrued compensation and benefits, accrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans, and accrued expenses.\n(1) Unallocated expense includes a) the redemption of a $4 million intercompany loan for tax efficiency purposes that is offset in Other Businesses, with no impact to total company operating earnings, and b) executive retirement related costs.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (Unaudited)\nPreliminary\n(In thousands of dollars)\nAssets\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n302,015\n$\n326,876\nAccounts receivable – net\n1,428,233\n1,325,186\nInventories\n1,434,609\n1,429,199\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n142,305\n124,728\nTotal current assets\n3,307,162\n3,205,989\nProperty, buildings and equipment – net\n1,370,071\n1,391,967\nDeferred income taxes\n33,300\n22,362\nGoodwill\n549,418\n543,903\nIntangibles - net\n570,134\n569,115\nOther assets\n72,726\n70,918\nTotal assets\n$\n5,902,811\n$\n5,804,254\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nShort-term debt (1)\n$\n137,643\n$\n55,603\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n30,279\n38,709\nTrade accounts payable\n748,372\n731,582\nAccrued compensation and benefits\n181,055\n254,560\nAccrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans (2)\n29,890\n92,682\nAccrued expenses\n324,319\n313,766\nIncome taxes payable\n52,774\n19,759\nTotal current liabilities\n1,504,332\n1,506,661\nLong-term debt\n2,244,406\n2,248,036\nDeferred income taxes and tax uncertainties\n121,767\n111,710\nEmployment-related and other non-current liabilities\n106,400\n110,114\nShareholders' equity (3)\n1,925,906\n1,827,733\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$\n5,902,811\n$\n5,804,254\n(1)\nShort-term debt increased $82 million primarily due to an increase in commercial paper of $90 million.\n(2)\nAccrued contributions to employees' profit sharing plans decreased $63 million primarily due to the annual cash contributions to the profit sharing plan.\n(3)\nCommon stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018 was 56,017,200 compared with 56,328,863 shares at December 31, 2017, primarily due to share repurchases.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS (Unaudited)\nPreliminary\n(In thousands of dollars)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet earnings\n$\n240,785\n$\n182,853\nProvision for losses on accounts receivable\n3,552\n3,918\nDeferred income taxes and tax uncertainties\n(1,660)\n(7,632)\nDepreciation and amortization\n63,931\n62,249\nGains from sales of assets, net of write-offs\n(5,714)\n(10,966)\nStock-based compensation\n11,652\n6,757\nLosses from equity method investment\n11,497\n8,374\nChange in operating assets and liabilities:\nAccounts receivable\n(94,221)\n(95,419)\nInventories\n3,136\n27,826\nPrepaid expenses and other assets\n(32,951)\n(27,457)\nTrade accounts payable\n13,244\n18,051\nOther current liabilities\n(102,664)\n(64,171)\nCurrent income taxes payable, net\n43,844\n74,741\nAccrued employment-related benefits cost\n(6,950)\n1,520\nOther – net\n(596)\n302\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n146,885\n180,946\nCash flows from investing activities:\nAdditions to property, buildings and equipment\n(49,149)\n(78,768)\nProceeds from sales of assets\n25,987\n48,306\nEquity method investment\n(8,115)\n(7,067)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(31,277)\n(37,529)\nCash flows from financing activities:\nNet increase in commercial paper\n89,904\n34,946\nBorrowings under lines of credit\n10,185\n9,883\nPayments against lines of credit\n(19,923)\n(9,167)\nNet payments of long-term debt\n(25,185)\n(2,318)\nProceeds from stock options exercised\n59,003\n26,345\nPayments for employee taxes withheld from stock awards\n(14,878)\n(11,625)\nPurchase of treasury stock\n(172,917)\n(159,146)\nCash dividends paid\n(72,254)\n(72,118)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(146,065)\n(183,200)\nExchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents\n5,596\n4,438\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(24,861)\n(35,345)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n326,876\n274,146\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n$\n302,015\n$\n238,801\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of dollars)\nThe company supplemented the reporting of financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, which the company refers to as \"adjusted\" measures, including adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted measures exclude items that may not be indicative of core operating results. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results and assessing prospects for future performance. Management believes adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share are important indicators of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review company financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe reconciliations provided below reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted operating earnings, adjusted segment operating earnings, adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share with GAAP financial measures:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nOperating earnings reported\n$\n334,830\n$\n292,501\n14\n%\nRestructuring (United States)\n3,101\n3,066\nBranch gains (United States)\n(7,528)\n(9,388)\nRestructuring (Canada)\n10,920\n1,087\nRestructuring (Other Businesses)\n1,175\n—\nRestructuring (Unallocated expense)\n370\n—\nSubtotal\n8,038\n(5,235)\nOperating earnings adjusted\n$\n342,868\n$\n287,266\n19\n%\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION - CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)\n(In thousands of dollars)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nSegment operating earnings adjusted\nUnited States\n352,077\n303,320\nCanada\n(9,237)\n(15,642)\nOther Businesses\n37,597\n31,507\nUnallocated expense\n(37,569)\n(31,919)\nSegment operating earnings adjusted\n$\n342,868\n$\n287,266\n19\n%\nCompany operating margin adjusted\n12.4\n%\n11.3\n%\nROIC* for Company\n28.9\n%\n24.0\n%\nROIC* for United States\n46.8\n%\n38.8\n%\nROIC* for Canada\n(7.3)\n%\n(11.5)\n%\n*Adjusted ROIC is calculated as defined on page 7, excluding the items adjusting operating earnings as noted above.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n%\nNet earnings reported\n$\n231,535\n$\n174,744\n32\n%\nRestructuring (United States)\n2,365\n1,919\nBranch gains (United States)\n(5,741)\n(5,878)\nRestructuring (Canada)\n8,330\n803\nRestructuring (Other Businesses)\n950\n—\nRestructuring (Unallocated expense)\n282\n—\nSubtotal\n6,186\n(3,156)\nNet earnings adjusted\n$\n237,721\n$\n171,588\n39\n%\nDiluted earnings per share reported\n$\n4.07\n$\n2.93\n39\n%\nPretax adjustments:\nRestructuring (United Sates)\n0.05\n0.05\nBranch gains (United States)\n(0.13)\n(0.16)\nRestructuring (Canada)\n0.19\n0.02\nRestructuring (Other Businesses)\n0.02\n—\nRestructuring (Unallocated expense)\n0.01\n—\nTotal pretax adjustments\n0.14\n(0.09)\nTax effect (1)\n(0.03)\n0.04\nTotal, net of tax\n0.11\n(0.05)\nDiluted earnings per share adjusted\n$\n4.18\n$\n2.88\n45\n%\n(1) The tax impact of adjustments is calculated based on the income tax rate in each applicable jurisdiction, subject to deductibility limitations and the company's ability to realize the associated tax benefits.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/grainger-reports-results-for-the-2018-first-quarter-300632615.html\nSOURCE W.W.
