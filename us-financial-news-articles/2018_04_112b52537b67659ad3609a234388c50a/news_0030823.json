Program expected to commence in June with two drilling rigs on NW Sitra.\n• The 2018 Canadian drilling plan is targeting to commence drilling up to 8 (6 net) Cardium wells in July. This program could include a two-mile horizontal well to evaluate extended reach horizontals in the Harmattan area.\n• Sold ~236 thousand barrels of crude oil to EGPC during Q1.\n• Confirmed with EGPC four crude oil cargo liftings in 2018.\nThe first cargo was scheduled to begin lifting in late March, but due to bad weather it was slightly delayed. On April 7 th a total of ~452 thousand barrels were lifted and will be booked as a Q2 sale.\nProduction\nTotal Company production for the first quarter was on plan, averaging approximately 14,366 Boepd, comprised of 11,776 Bopd in Egypt (100% oil) and 2,590 Boepd in Canada (57% light oil and liquids).\nTotal Company production averaged 14,248 Boepd in March, comprised of 11,739 Bopd in Egypt (100% oil) and 2,509 Boepd in Canada (60% light oil and liquids).\nOperations Update\nIn the Eastern Desert the K-46 development well drilled in March was initially completed in the Asl B zone to obtain a production rate prior to perforating the main Asl A formation. The Asl B produced approximately 45 Bopd from an internally estimated 15 feet of net oil pay overlying a water zone. The Asl A formations (A1, A2 and A3), which encountered an internally estimated 96 feet of net oil pay are scheduled for completion later this month.\nThe Company is currently drilling the second South K-field development well at K-45 targeting the main Asl A sand in the crestal position on the South K field. The Asl B sand is also expected to be encountered in K-45.\nFollowing K-45, the drilling rig is scheduled to move to West Gharib and NW Gharib to drill Arta 54 and NWG 38A-3 respectively. Arta 54 is targeting the Nukhul/Red bed formation at the northern edge of the main Arta pool. The NWG 38A-3 well is planned as a water injection well to provide reservoir pressure support and enhanced recovery in the NWG 38 Red Bed pool. The first three wells drilled in the NWG 38 pool did not encounter a water leg and are currently producing at a combined, reduced rate of approximately 920 bopd. It is expected that the current production rates will be optimized upon completion of the water injection scheme and stabilized reservoir pressures.\nFollowing NWG 38A-3, the rig will return to the West Bakr concession and drill up to three development wells including two wells inside the recently negotiated reduced buffer zone targeting the M-field Asl A formation.\nConcurrently, the Company will be stimulating and completing two drilled and uncompleted wells (DUC’s) the NWG 1 and NWG 5 Development Areas (discovered in 2014), in addition to the West Gharib Arta 48 well currently awaiting stimulation. These NWG 1 and 5 wells encountered a tight Red Bed conglomerate sequence which requires stimulation to produce and are expected to produce at similar rates to TransGlobe's Arta Nukhul wells which typically have an initial 30 day production rate (IP 30) of 150-180 Bopd with ultimate recoveries of 120 -150 MBbls per well on primary production.\nThe Company also has an active recompletion campaign scheduled throughout the year, targeting low risk behind pipe opportunities in addition to water-flood optimization opportunities. The majority of these opportunities reside in the West Bakr K-field where the Company anticipates completion of Phase 2 and 3 of the K-field facility expansion to double/triple the current fluid handling capacity respectively. Concurrent with the K-field facility expansions the drilling rig was used to re-enter and deepen a legacy well (K-5) for water disposal. The K-5 water disposal well is scheduled for completion in late April/early May to handle additional planned water production from the expanded facilities. The expansion will allow for accelerated fluid withdrawal rates supporting incremental production volumes and additional reserves from both West Bakr K and M fields.\nIn the Western Desert the Company is preparing for the 2018 exploration drilling program expected to commence in the NW Sitra concession utilizing two drilling rigs in June. The larger (2,000 HP) drilling rig will drill NWS 12 targeting a stacked Cretaceous/Jurassic prospect. Subject to additional approvals, the larger rig can be moved to South Alamein to drill a Jurassic prospect following NWS 12. The smaller (~1,000 HP) drilling rig will drill NWS 9 targeting a stacked Cretaceous prospect. Following NWS 9, the rig will be moved to the South Ghazalat Concession to drill two independent stacked Cretaceous structures. The four, basin opening wells in NWS and S. Ghazalat could de-risk 13 of the 21 additional prospects currently mapped on 3-D seismic. No production is currently budgeted from the Western Desert exploration assets in 2018.\nIn Canada, the Company is preparing for a 3 to 4 week turnaround/maintenance program at the Company’s central oil processing battery and main natural gas compressor site. The work has been scheduled to coincide with a planned turnaround at the main natural gas processing plant in the Harmattan area which is operated by a third party. It is expected that the majority of the Canadian production will be shut-in during May due to this planned outage. The 2018 production guidance numbers include the planned turnaround.\nIn addition, the Company is finalizing the 2018 Cardium drilling program scheduled to commence in July. The 2018 Cardium development program of up to eight gross (six net) horizontal wells will be drilling from a common pad to improve efficiencies and reduce costs. The Company is planning to drill one two-mile extended reach horizontal (“ERH”) well to evaluate the performance of ERH wells in the Harmattan area. The remainder of the 2018 program will be one-mile horizontal wells.\nAIM Listing\nBeginning in early 2017, the Company undertook an extensive review of its existing stock market listings and its current and potential common share investors. The Company determined that its traditional North American investor base and liquidity has diminished significantly over the past six years, beginning with the Egyptian revolution in January of 2011 and continuing through the recent and prolonged downturn in oil prices from 2014 to 2017. Although oil prices have shown tangible and structural improvement over the past six to nine months the Company’s share price and liquidity have not responded to that improvement despite significant increases in profitability and funds flow. The Company concluded that a listing on the London Stock Exchange’s AIM market will provide access to a significant pool of specialist investors who currently do not have adequate access to TransGlobe’s common shares due to time-zone challenges and European market investment requirements. The Company also believes that a listing on the AIM market may eventually improve its profile by placing TransGlobe alongside many of its international E&P peers. This may attract European analyst coverage focused on international companies similar to TransGlobe.\nTransGlobe has retained Canaccord Genuity as its nominated advisor (“NOMAD”) and preparations are at an advanced stage for an AIM Admission filing.\nIn further support of the listing on the AIM market, the Company intends to establish an executive office in London by September 2018.\nPending Board of Directors Changes\nAs part of TransGlobe’s succession plan, the Company is pleased to announce that Randy Neely will stand for election to the Board of Directors at the upcoming Annual and Special Meetings of Shareholders. Mr. Neely was recently promoted to President on January 8, 2018 after serving as the Company’s VP Finance and CFO since joining the Company in 2012. In order to make room for Mr. Neely, Mr. Lloyd Herrick, VP and COO will not stand for re-election this year. Mr. Herrick has served on the Board as a non-independent director since joining the Company in 1999 and will remain with the Company as VP and COO.\nAnnual and Special Meeting of the Shareholders\nDate: Thursday May 10, 2018\nTime: 3 PM MST\nLocation: 3rd floor, Centennial Place West, Bow River Room, 250 - 5th Street S.W., Calgary, Alberta Canada\nAbout TransGlobe\nTransGlobe Energy Corporation is a Calgary-based, growth-oriented oil and gas exploration and development company whose current activities are concentrated in the Arab Republic of Egypt and Canada. TransGlobe’s common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol TGL and on the NASDAQ Exchange under the symbol TGA.\nAdvisory on Forward-Looking Information and Statements\nCertain statements included in this news release constitute forward-looking statements or forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation.

The forward-looking statements or information contained in this news release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nOil and Gas Advisories\nBOEs may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent (6 mcf: 1 bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value.\nReferences in this press release to production test rates, are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery. While encouraging, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on such rates in calculating the aggregate production for TransGlobe. A pressure transient analysis or well-test interpretation has not been carried out in respect of all wells. Accordingly, the Company cautions that the production test results should be considered to be preliminary.\nCertain type curve information included to in this news release, including IP30, represents estimates of the production decline and ultimate volumes expected to be recovered from wells over the life of the well. This information is based on management-generated type curves based on a combination of historical performance of older wells and management's expectation of what might be achieved from future wells. The information represents what management thinks an average well will achieve. Individual wells may be higher or lower but over a larger number of wells management expects the average to come out to the type curve. Over time type curves can and will change based on achieving more production history on older wells or more recent completion information on newer wells.\nReferences in this press release to production test rates, are useful in confirming the presence of hydrocarbons, however such rates are not determinative of the rates at which such wells will commence production and decline thereafter and are not indicative of long term performance or of ultimate recovery.
