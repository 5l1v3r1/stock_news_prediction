In an interview broadcast Sunday, newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the Trump administration was heading into negotiations with “eyes wide open” and emphasized “irreversible” denuclearization as a main target of upcoming talks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T08:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T08:07:31.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
