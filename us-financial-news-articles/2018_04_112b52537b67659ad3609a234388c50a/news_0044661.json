Mussallem said on a call with analysts.\nThe increasingly competitive market for transcatheter valves is expected to expand from $3 billion currently to $5 billion in 2021 as more types of patients get treated with the valves.\nThe company’s closest rival is Medtronic and analysts expect the entry of Boston Scientific’s ( BSX.N ) valve into the market by late 2018 to further heat up the competition.\nEdwards Lifesciences said its global sales of the heart valves rose 2.3 percent to $551.5 million in the quarter. However, analysts were expecting a sales of $579.64 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company’s net profit fell to $206.6 million, or 96 cents a share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a $230.2 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, the company earned $1.22 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.11 per share. Net sales rose 1.3 percent to $894.8 million in the quarter.\nHowever, the company’s forecast for current quarter adjusted profit of $1.05 to $1.15 per share missed estimates. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.17 per share.\nThe company raised its full-year earnings per share forecast range to $4.50-$4.70 from $4.43-$4.63.\nShares of the company were trading lower at $123.58 after the bell.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-24T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T01:25:48.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
