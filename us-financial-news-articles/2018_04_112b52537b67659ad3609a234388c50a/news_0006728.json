The median forecast of a Reuters poll put the benchmark at 3 percent at end-2018. \nIsarescu said the bank estimated inflation would peak at around 5 percent before it falls back to the upper target range. \nThe Romanian leu was flat to the euro at 1300 GMT. \nIsarescu said while Wednesday’s decision could put softening pressure on the leu, the rate differential was favourable for the currency. \nIn late March, Isarescu said policymakers were caught between those who argued rate tightening was too slow and those who thought it will choke economic growth, adding the government’s fiscal loosening needed to be curbed. \nThe bank has said it expected inflation to exceed its target range in the first part of 2018, as the statistical base effect of a 2017 value-added tax cut fades, before falling back to within target by year-end. \nNew inflation forecasts will be released in May. \nAnalysts at BCR, who correctly predicted the bank would hold its main interest rate, said in a preview note that from an inflation and demand perspective further hikes were “completely justified”. \n“But we see stronger chances of a hike at the May policy meeting,” they added. “Overall we maintain the view that the key rate will reach 2.75 percent at end-2018.” \nRomania is the second of the EU’s central and eastern members to have started tightening from record low levels, after the Czech central bank.
