Hermitage was not directly involved in the forfeiture case, but claimed the firm might use confidential information it had obtained from Hermitage in Prevezon’s defense.\nAfter the trial court denied two motions to disqualify BakerHostetler, Hermitage appealed to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe case presented a novel question for the 2nd Circuit: Can a law firm be disqualified for a potential conflict of interest involving a former client that is neither a party nor a witness?\nThe appeals court sided with Hermitage, holding that BakerHostetler had an ongoing duty to its former client.\nHermitage’s lawyers at Susman Godfrey then moved for sanctions from BakerHostetler, asking Judge Pauley to award the bank its costs in pressing the disqualification case.\nJudge Pauley concluded that if BakerHostetler managed to convince a trial judge on two occasions that it deserved to stay in the case – and then presented the 2nd Circuit with a tough question of first impression – it should not have to pay a penalty for refusing to step aside.\nJudge Pauley said it was “indecorous” for lawyers to discredit a former client to serve the interests of a new one. But to be sanctioned, he said, a firm has to be egregiously conflicted. Considering that it took Hermitage three tries and a million bucks to bounce BakerHostetler, the judge said, the conflict here was hardly egregious.\nWilliam Browder , Hermitage founder, said in an email that the \"decision sets a terrible precedent for victims of crime.\nHe added that lawyers can now “switch sides from representing the victims to representing the perpetrators of the same crime and the worst that will happen is they get kicked off the case with no financial consequence.”\nBakerHostetler partner Mark Cymrot said the firm had no comment on Pauley’s ruling.\nThe views expressed in this article are not those of Reuters News.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/23/william-browder-us-entry-lawmakers-244078", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T11:49:04.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
