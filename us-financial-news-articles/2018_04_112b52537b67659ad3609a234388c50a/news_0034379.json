The previous year was a transformative period for SSLJ as we expanded our operations throughout China and added new revenue segments. In 2016, 91% of our home improving and furnishing products revenue came from our Wuhan, Shenzen, and Shanghai offices, as compared to 63% in 2017 as we strengthened our sales teams in all branches throughout mainland China. Further, we started generating revenues from two additional segments, advertising income from merchants and sales of smart home products and materials as we continue to develop our platform. Accounting for the revenue from our home improvement and furnishing projects, as well as the two new revenue segments, SSLJ saw an impressive 201% increase in revenue and a 133% increase in gross profit from the previous year.\"\nMr. Zheng added, \"We have achieved substantial accomplishments in 2017 to expand the influence of our brand, develop our strategy, and integrate smart technology into our service offerings. Overall, we achieved strong operating momentum in the 2017 fiscal year which we hope will continue. We believe that with the launch of our new smart home services and associated online store, and our increased marketing efforts in 2017 including an endorsement agreement with celebrity and online marketing campaigns on third party websites and search engines, we have laid down a solid foundation for growth in 2018. The following events also complement the aforementioned efforts, where we completed our IPO in two closings, on January 31, 2018 and February 2, 2018, and entered into new cooperation agreements with key partners including JD.com, the largest e-commerce company and retailer in China, Hubei Rural Credit Cooperatives, the largest credit union in Hubei Province, and Tianmen Han Da Tech Co., Ltd., a leading construction and e-commerce platform company in China, as disclosed in previous press releases. Looking ahead, we will continue our mission to develop an optimal experience for our potential customers looking to decorate or redecorate their living spaces.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nFor the Years Ended December 31\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenue\n16.32\n5.42\n201.1%\nHome improving and furnishing projects\n10.49\n5.42\n93.5%\nSales of smart home products and materials\n3.91\n-\nNM\nAdvertising\n1.92\n-\nNM\nGross profit\n1.41\n0.61\n133.2%\nGross margin\n8.7%\n11.2%\n-2.5%\nIncome (loss) from operations\n-23.54\n-12.82\nNM\nOperating margin\n-144%\n-236%\nNM\nNet income (loss) attributable to SSLJ.com\n-23.72\n-13.18\nNM\nEarnings (loss) per share\n-0.59\n-0.32\nNM\nRevenues increased by 201.1% to $16.32 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.42 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to increase in contract revenues of home improving and furnishing projects in terms of number of contracts completed and average revenue per contract; and new sales of smart home products and materials as well as advertising services.
