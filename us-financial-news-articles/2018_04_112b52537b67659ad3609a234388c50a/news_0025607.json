I can’t go beyond that,” Sanders told reporters.\nThe U.S. State Department said the United States has proof at “a very high level of confidence” that the Syrian government carried out the attack but is still working to identify the mix of chemicals used.\nTrump warned on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in response to the Douma incident. Russia has told the United States and its allies not to carry out any military strike.\nChemical weapons experts for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived in Syria to investigate the suspected poison gas attack.\nThe investigators, who are mandated to determine only if chemical weapons were used and not who used them, were expected to start their investigations into the Douma incident on Saturday, the Netherlands-based organization said.\nUnited States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley greets Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vasily Nebenzya before the United Nations Security Council meeting on Syria at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz ‘ANYTHING ADVENTUROUS’ Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier that Moscow was in contact with Washington to discuss an atmosphere he described as alarming.\n“God forbid anything adventurous will be done in Syria along the lines of the Libyan and Iraqi experience,” Lavrov told a news conference, referring to past Western military interventions elsewhere in the region.\nBritain’s U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce, meanwhile, rejected a charge by a Russian defence ministry spokesman that Britain was involved in staging a fake in Douma.\n“This is grotesque, it is a blatant lie, it is the worst piece of fake news we’ve yet seen from the Russian propaganda machine,” Pierce told reporters.\nAssad is supported by Iranian-back fighters as well as the Russian air force and has cemented his control over most of the western, more heavily populated, part of the country.\nThe capture of Douma from rebels who evacuated this week has clinched a major victory for Assad, crushing what was once a centre of the insurgency near Damascus, and underlines his seemingly unassailable position in the war.\nThe Syria crisis has come as a test not only for Trump, but incoming White House national security adviser John Bolton, a hawk who joined Trump’s team this week.\nWhile Trump himself was silent on Syria on Friday, giving no further clues on whether American military action is imminent, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Washington estimated that Assad’s forces had used chemical weapons at least 50 times during the seven-year-old Syrian conflict.\n“Our president has not yet made a decision about possible action in Syria. But should the United States and our allies decide to act in Syria, it will be in defence of a principle on which we all agree,” Haley told the U.N. Security Council.\n“All nations and all people will be harmed if we allow Assad to normalize the use of chemical weapons.”\nSlideshow (5 Images) Any U.S. strike would probably involve the Navy. A U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean. Last year, the United States carried out strikes from two Navy destroyers against a Syrian air base after another deadly toxic gas attack on a rebel-controlled area.\nReporting by Steve Holland and Michelle Nichols; Additional reporting by John Walcott, Lesley Wroughton, Phil Stewart, Alistair Smout, Tom Perry, Ellen Francis, Maria Tsvetkova, Leigh Thomas and Ingrid Melander; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Yara Bayoumy and Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T01:54:45.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
