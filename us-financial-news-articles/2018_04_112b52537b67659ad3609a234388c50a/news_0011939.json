REUTERS/Edgard Garrido \nFreeland met with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo for several hours amid pressure from Washington to quickly wrap up an agreement in principle. \nBut Freeland, speaking to reporters outside the building where Friday’s talks took place, made clear there had been no major breakthroughs. \n“We had some constructive conversations both yesterday and today, ... and that intensive pace of work, which has been happening over the last couple of weeks, will continue in the days to come,” she said. “We are going to keep on working until we get a good deal.” Related Coverage NAFTA deal within reach soon: senior Mexican official \nLighthizer, citing the need to avoid clashing with the Mexican presidential election on July 1, says he wants the outlines of a deal to update the regional trade agreement. \nU.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to walk away from the $1.2 trillion pact unless major changes are made, on Thursday said the three nations should have something to announce fairly soon.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nUnveiling the outlines of a deal would allow leaders to claim a political victory while leaving officials to work out the precise details in the months to come. \nIt would also enable Trump and his trade team to focus on a widening trade dispute with China that could hurt the world’s two biggest economies. \nBut there are major challenges to overcome, in particular a contentious U.S. demand that the North American content of vehicles made in NAFTA countries be increased to 85 percent from 62.5 percent. \n“We continue to work in that area and to make some good progress and advances,” said Freeland, who gave no details.

You can’t leave things gray,” said one source with direct knowledge of the talks, citing the huge complexity of the industry. \n“The last thing you want to do is to be making something that isn’t compliant and to be told in an audit, ‘You’re not NAFTA compliant and you owe duties,’” said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. \nThe lack of clarity over the pact’s future has hit the Canadian and Mexican currencies in recent months as well as worrying financial markets, which are on edge about possible damage to the highly integrated North American market. \nThe chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, Dave McKay, on Friday said uncertainty over the pact was a concern for customers of the bank, Canada’s biggest lender, but he remained hopeful a deal would be reached.
