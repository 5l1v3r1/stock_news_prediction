Their arrests sparked protests and a decision by Starbucks to close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 for employee racial-tolerance training. \nThe incident put Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, at the centre of a social media storm after the cafe manager called police on Nelson and Robinson, who had not made a purchase and were waiting to meet a friend. \nThe manager, who is no longer with the company, called police within two minutes of the pair’s arrival, according to the men’s account of the incident. They were released without charges. \n“It didn’t really hit me what was going on, that this was real, until I’m being double-locked with my hands behind my back,” Robinson said.

Police will draft a policy to deal with similar situations, he said. \nThe men’s attorney, Stewart Cohen, said they are in mediation with Starbucks. \nThe arrests in Philadelphia have also prompted comments from relatives of a man in Milwaukee who was shot to death four years ago after employees at a Starbucks twice called police to report a man sleeping in a nearby park. While Starbucks referred to the calls as wellness checks, an officer shot the man, who was black, to death. \nThen-Chief Executive Howard Schultz met with the man’s family in 2015 and apologised in a private meeting, said Nate Hamilton, the brother of victim Dontre Hamilton, who spoke to media this week after the Philadelphia arrests. \n“I’m happy it didn’t turn out the same way,” Hamilton told Reuters. “Starbucks, they talk a good game,” he said of Schultz’s plans. “Is it going to be put into action?” Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Dan Grebler and Lisa Shumaker", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T02:03:14.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
