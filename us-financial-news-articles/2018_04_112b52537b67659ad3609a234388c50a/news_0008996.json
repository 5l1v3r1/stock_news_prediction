According to Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro, despite those drawdowns of 20 percent or more peak-to-trough, the stock was not only able to recover but was also able to stay within a clearly defined uptrend channel.\n\"The issue here is, are we at risk for breaking the lower band of the channel that the stock has lived in its entire public existence? I think so.\" Worth said Monday on CNBC's \" Fast Money .\"\nWorth illustrated that Facebook's stock has not only been struggling on an absolute basis, but on a relative basis as well.\n\"We know that even as [Facebook] stock was going higher, its relative performance [to the S&P 500 ] started to stall, and now it's broken [below] trend,\" Worth said.\nSince the scandal broke on March 17, Facebook shares have tumbled nearly 15 percent, while the S&P is down only 5 percent.\nWorth noted that Facebook has not only underperformed the broad market, but also the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary and Tech sectors.\nFacebook stock's weakness is not a reflection of how the tech sector more broadly has performed lately, according to Worth.\n\"Not only has tech stayed in an uptrend, its relative performance [to the broader market] has stayed in an uptrend. Facebook's problems are idiosyncratic. I think it's highly unlikely that this is a dip to be bought. In fact, I would suggest there's more downside,\" Worth added.\nDisclaimer Vote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
