Security Council meeting to take OPCW investigators to Douma. In Tuesday’s statement, the government said it was ready to offer all assistance needed for the mission to fulfil its task.\nIt also called on the mission to operate “in a full transparent manner and to rely on solid and credible evidence,” the statement cited by state media added.\nReporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:19:33.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
