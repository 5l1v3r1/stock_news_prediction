Tesla, however, has always released its figures on a quarterly basis. It remains to be seen whether other auto makers will follow suit. While Tesla has proven that quarterly reporting neither hurts nor helps a company’s stock, GM’s announcement comes almost exactly a year after Tesla surpassed GM as America’s most-valuable auto maker (though that’s no longer the case.)\nAnalysts fear that less frequent reporting could hide important trends until it’s too late to fix them. For instance, CNBC pointed out that monthly sales figures helped officials and investors understand how quickly the economy was deteriorating. If that information had been delayed by three months, there may have been a bigger shock to the markets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T18:15:19.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
