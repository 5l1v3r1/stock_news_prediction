(NYSE: LXU) (“LSB” or “the Company”), in anticipation of its meetings with debt investors, today announced that it expects total sales for the first quarter of 2018 to be approximately $95 million to $100 million and to report adjusted EBITDA of approximately $20 million to $23 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $20.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, which included approximately $1.6 million of adjusted EBITDA attributable to businesses sold later in 2017.\nAdditionally, ammonia on-stream rates for the first quarter of 2018 for El Dorado, Pryor and Cherokee were approximately 100%, 91% and 85%, respectively, which represents an improvement overall as compared to the rates for the fourth quarter of 2017 of 77%, 22% and 99%, respectively. The Cherokee ammonia plant’s on-stream rate for the first quarter of 2018 was impacted by maintenance completed on its primary reformer. Periodic downtime for maintenance activities is contemplated in management’s targeted annual average on-stream rates.\nThe Company plans to issue results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on April 25, 2018.\nThe preliminary information provided herein is based on information available to management as of the date of this press release.

Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section.\nSee Accompanying Tables\nLSB Industries, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nThis news release includes certain “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Regulation G. These non-GAAP measures are calculated using GAAP amounts in our consolidated financial statements.\nEBITDA Reconciliation\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) (which includes DD&A of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible and other assets), less benefit for income taxes. We believe that certain investors consider EBITDA a useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance. EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, cash flow from operations or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure of other companies. A reconciliation of the low and high ends of the outlook provided for EBITDA for the company’s quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 is presented below.\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree Months\nEnded\nMarch 31, 2017\nLow End\nRange\nHigh End\nRange\n($ in millions)\nNet loss\n($6.7)\n($4.6)\n($6.0)\nPlus:\nInterest expense\n9.3\n9.3\n9.4\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n18.0\n18.5\n17.6\nBenefit for income taxes 1\n(1.2)\n(0.8)\n(1.3)\nEBITDA\n$19.4\n$22.4\n$19.7\n1 In December 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”), making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. We have estimated our benefit for income taxes in accordance with the Act and guidance available as of the date of this filing. This amount reflects certain provisional amounts and the ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, and additional regulatory guidance that may be issued.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is reported to show the impact of one time/non-cash items such as, loss on sale of a business and other property and equipment, one-time income or fees, start-up/commissioning costs, certain fair market value adjustments, non-cash stock-based compensation and severance costs. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain items. The following tables provide reconciliations of EBITDA excluding the impact of the supplementary adjustments. Our policy is to adjust for non-cash or non-recurring items that are greater than $0.5 million quarterly or cumulatively.
