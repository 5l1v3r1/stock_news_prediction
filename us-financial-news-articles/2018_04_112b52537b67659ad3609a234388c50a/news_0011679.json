China hit back with equal measure on U.S. goods such as soybeans, autos, chemicals and some types of aircraft.\nShares of big U.S. manufacturers, grain traders and chipmakers were hit hard until mid-day.\nBut the sentiment reversed after President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a “negotiation” with China rather than a trade war.\nAlso, the effective date of China’s move depended on when the U.S. action took effect, providing room for maneuver.\nU.S. economic data published on Wednesday underscored the prevailing bullish view on the economy. Private payrolls increased solidly in March as hiring rose across the board, boding well for Friday’s jobs data.\nAt 7:10 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 35 points, or 0.14 percent, with 57,520 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 9 points, or 0.34 percent, with 184,279 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 41 points, or 0.62 percent, on volume of 66,231 contracts.\nFacebook rose 2.5 percent after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen “any meaningful impact” on usage or ad sales since the scandal.\nWells Fargo rose 1 percent after UBS upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral”.\nAdvanced Micro Devices jumped 2.8 percent after Stifel upgraded to “buy”, while Micron Technology fell 0.9 percent after UBS started with a “sell” rating.
