Bush. Under Trump, he worked at the White House with George David Banks, who handled international energy and environmental issues such as the president’s plan to leave the 2015 Paris climate accord.\nCatanzaro joins other officials on economics who have recently left the White House. Banks resigned in February because of difficulties getting security clearance. Their boss, Gary Cohn, who was Trump’s top economic adviser, resigned last month.\nNext week Catanzaro will return to CGCN Group, an advocacy and public relations company, where he worked for energy clients who wanted Washington to lift a 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports as U.S. crude output exploded, thanks to shale drilling. Congress killed the ban in late 2015 after President Barack Obama’s administration had allowed exports of some light oil.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Catanzaro’s move, which was first reported by E&E News.\nCGCN managing partner Steve Clark said in a statement that Catanzaro’s experience in the White House “will be an invaluable resource for current and future clients and we will make every effort to ensure his work complies with all relevant ethics guidelines.”\nDays after taking office in 2017, Trump, who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington, put restrictions on the types of lobbying that White House aides can accept after they leave government. Trump signed an executive order that said his appointees would refrain from lobbying their own agency for five years after leaving, although there is no criminal penalty for doing so.\nReporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Bill Trott and Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T21:43:51.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
