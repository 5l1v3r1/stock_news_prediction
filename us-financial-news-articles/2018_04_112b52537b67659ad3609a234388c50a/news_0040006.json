Worldwide, Boralex increased its total installed capacity by more than 11%, from 1,456 MW to 1,619 MW.\nAcquisition of 163 MW of wind power projects in operation with a weighted average remaining life of 8 years under contract, a 10 MW ready-to-build project and a portfolio of projects totalling about 158 MW, bringing Boralex's potential in Europe to nearly 1,000 MW without considering the 152 MW in projects in France set out in the Growth path.\nTotal consideration of €129.4 million (C$202 million).\nBoralex expects the transaction to add approximately €23 million (C$36 million) to EBITDA(A) based on the anticipated results of Kallista calculated in accordance with French GAAP.\nIntegration into Boralex of the Kallista Energy Investment SAS development team, whose highly specialized expertise in repowering wind power projects can be leveraged immediately.\nMONTRÉAL and LILLE, France, April 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Boralex Inc. (TSX: BLX) (\"Boralex\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a purchase agreement with Ardian Infrastructure to acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Kallista Energy Investment SAS (\"Kallista\"), for a consideration of €129.4 million (C$202 million) and the assumption of €94 million (C$146.7 million) in project debt.\nThe consideration will be paid by Boralex from its recently enhanced revolving credit facility. Boralex anticipates an increase in discretionary cash flow per share following the transaction.\nIn the medium term, the integration of Kallista's assets should enable development and operations team synergies. In the longer term, given Boralex's presence in France for nearly 20 years, the number of development projects completed or in the process of completion, and its dynamic team, Boralex will have the strength it needs to exert greater influence with the various stakeholders and take full advantage of its leadership role.\nBoralex President and CEO Patrick Lemaire applauded the deal: \"This transaction is very strategic and beneficial for Boralex and will strengthen our position as France's largest independent producer of onshore wind power and allow us to take full advantage of our unique and integrated model as developer, prime contractor and operator of our projects. Boralex will enjoy a number of operational synergies and significantly improve its growth prospects in light of the very ambitious renewable energy development goals set by the French government.\"\n\"Since 2003, Boralex has had a pioneering vision in France developing its wind power operations,\" said Patrick Decostre, Vice-President and General Manager of Boralex Europe. \"The major acquisition announced today is a hallmark of steady, well-controlled growth. It shows that with the agility of a company on a human scale like ours, along with our financial strength, we have become a leading player in the current market consolidation as France's largest independent producer of onshore wind power.\"\nEach of the projects under construction or under development may benefit either from a known and predictable rate under an existing feed-in premium scheme or, once all licences are obtained, be submitted under the open-window scheme or future requests for proposals.\nThe transaction is expected to close in or around late June 2018, once regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions have been met. An adjustment mechanism has been provided to confirm the consideration payable at closing.\nSummary of projects acquired\nThe following map shows the locations of the projects acquired and Boralex's geographic coverage in France once the transaction is completed.\nWith the portfolio of acquired projects, Boralex's new installed capacity will be 1,619 MW, including nearly 800 MW in France, representing an increase of over 11% worldwide. Considering this announcement and the projects already under development in France and the United Kingdom, Boralex will have a portfolio of potential projects totalling approximately 1,000 MW in Europe alone.\nAdvisors\nMessier Maris & Associés served as financial advisors and New York- and Paris‑based K&L Gates served as legal advisors to Boralex in connection with the transaction.\nCaution regarding forward-looking statements and non-IFRS measures\nSome of the statements contained in this press release, including those regarding the EBITDA(A) expected from the acquisition of Kallista, increase in discretionary cash flows, future results and performance, are forward-looking statements based on current expectations, within the meaning of securities legislation.
