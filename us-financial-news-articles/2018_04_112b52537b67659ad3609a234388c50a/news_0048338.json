Uber is the ride-hailing leader in Mexico, where it has 7 million users in more than three dozen cities.\nDidi, which has an operations hub in the Juarez neighborhood in Mexico City, said it hopes to bring its ride-hailing service to other major Mexican cities later this year.\nDidi said teams in Mexico, Beijing and California studied the Mexican market to adapt Didi's algorithms and other ride-service technologies for the local market, addressing issues such as crime.\nDidi is bringing to Mexico a number of new safety features, including an emergency alert button in the app that will connect drivers and passengers with police and other emergency contacts if they find themselves in danger, a safety monitoring system and a way for passengers to share their ride itinerary.\nThe company started recruiting drivers early this month, promising not to take any piece of their fares until June 17. After mid-June, Didi plans to take a 20 percent cut, below Uber's 25 percent commission, Reuters previously reported.\nDidi late last year bought Brazilian ride-hailing firm 99, giving the company its first toehold in Latin America.\n(Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco.
