Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire agreed. “To initiate the kinds of missile strike he did last year? I think he has the authority to do that,” she said. \nThe lack of congressional interest in a debate on Syria strikes comes as Congress is about to reopen a long-simmering debate on the 16-year-old law that underpins the war on terrorism.
