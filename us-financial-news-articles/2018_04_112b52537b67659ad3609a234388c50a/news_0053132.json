REUTERS/Ola Lanre Five suicide bombers were also killed in the attack, which Nigeria’s military said had been repelled by troops.\nBlasts and gunfire were heard by residents in the city which is the capital of Borno, the state worst hit by an insurgency which has killed more than 34,000 people since 2009.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in 2015 vowing to end Boko Haram’s push to create an Islamic caliphate in the northeast, has made it a priority to improve security in Africa’s most populous country.\nThe issue has become politically charged in the run-up to an election next year which Buhari said he wants to contest.\nLocal volunteers carrying weapons stand in the Jiddari Polo area in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, after an attack by Boko Haram militants, in Nigeria April 27, 2018.
