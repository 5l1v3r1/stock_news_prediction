The county sheriff’s office has been investigating since the singer was found unresponsive at his Paisley Park mansion outside Minneapolis on April 21, 2016. \n“We have no direct evidence that a specific person provided the fentanyl to Prince,” Metz said at a news conference. “The bottom line is that we simply do not have sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime related to Prince’s death.” \nKey details surrounding Prince’s death at age 57 remain a mystery. According to Metz, investigators didn’t identify any suspects or evidence to suggest anyone had a motive to harm Prince. Metz said that in all likelihood Prince was unaware that he was taking counterfeit pills. He said Prince had no prescriptions for Vicodin, a pain medication, and that there was no evidence that a doctor provided the pills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T23:58:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
