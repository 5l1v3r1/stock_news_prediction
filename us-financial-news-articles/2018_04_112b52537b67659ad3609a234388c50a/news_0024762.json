FILE PHOTO: The Rio Tinto mining company's logo is photographed at their annual general meeting in Sydney, Australia, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Jason Reed/File Photo \nAlmost all of Rio’s aluminium production comes from a joint venture with Rusal in Australia, and the mining group said on Friday it was working with its customers to minimise disruptions to supply and would fully comply with U.S. sanctions. \nRio also said it was reviewing Rusal’s 20 percent stake in the Queensland Alumina refinery, Rusal’s supply and offtake arrangements, bauxite sales to Rusal’s refinery in Ireland and offtake contracts for alumina. \nThe United States imposed sanctions last week against Russian entities and individuals, including Rusal, to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and other “malign activity”. \nRio owns the other 80 percent of the Queensland refinery, which produces 3.95 million tonnes of alumina per year. Rio produced 3.6 million tonnes of aluminium in 2017. \nForce majeure is a clause in a contract that allows both parties not to fulfil the contract terms when they are affected by an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond their control. \nThe sanctions on Rusal, which produces 7 percent of global supply, pushed aluminium prices in London CMAL3 to their biggest weekly gain on record.
