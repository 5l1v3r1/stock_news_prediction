He didn’t provide further details about the accident. \nChinese state television aired footage appearing to show an overturned bus, without providing details about the vehicle or the number of casualties. The footage also showed emergency crews at the scene under heavy rain and medical personnel attending to a patient. \nChinese diplomats, accompanied by North Korean counterparts, had rushed to the scene, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement earlier Monday. It later said a Chinese medical team was en route to North Korea to provide assistance. \nAn international arm of state-run broadcaster China Central Television tweeted Monday morning that more than 30 people died after a tour bus fell from a bridge. That tweet was later deleted. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T14:56:35.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
