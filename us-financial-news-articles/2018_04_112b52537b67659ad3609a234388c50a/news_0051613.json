There are currently 47 such areas around the globe, each housing more than 10 million residents.\nMore than half the global population now lives in urban areas, comprising about 3 percent of the Earth . The ecological footprint of this growth is vast and there's far more that can be done to improve life for urban residents around the world.\nWhen it comes to natural spaces, trees are keystone species in the urban ecosystem, providing a number of services that benefit people. My research team has calculated just how much a tree matters for many urban areas, particularly megacities. Trees clean the air and water, reduce stormwater floods, improve building energy use and mitigate climate change, among other things.\nMore from the Conversation:\nUS rivers are becoming saltier – and it's not just from treating roads in winter\nWhy are some E. coli deadly while others live peacefully within our bodies?\nStand up for science: More researchers now see engagement as a crucial part of their job\nFor every dollar invested in planting, cities see an average $2.25 return on their investment each year.\nMeasuring trees Our team , led by Dr. David Nowak of the USDA Forest Service and Scott Maco of Davey Institute, develops the tree benefits software i-Tree Tools .\nThese tools simulate the relationship between trees and ecosystem services they provide. These services can include food, clean air and water, climate and flood control, pollination, recreation and noise damping. We currently don't simulate many services, so our calculations actually underestimate the value of urban trees.\nOur software can simulate how a tree's structure – such as height, canopy size and leaf area – affects the services it provides. It can estimate how trees will reduce water flooding; or explore how trees will affect air quality, building energy use and air pollution levels in their community. It can also allow users to inventory trees in their own area.\nOur systematic aerial surveys of 35 megacities suggest that 20 percent of the average megacity's urban core is covered by forest canopy. But this can vary greatly. Trees cover just 1 percent of Lima, Peru, versus 36 percent in New York City.\nWe wanted to determine how much trees contribute to human well-being in the places where humans are most concentrated, and nature perhaps most distant. In addition, we wanted to calculate how many additional trees could be planted in each megacity to improve the quality of life.\nHow tree density affects a city We looked in detail at 10 megacities around the world , including Beijing, Cairo, Mexico City, Los Angeles and London. These megacities are distributed across five continents and represent different natural habitats. Cairo was the smallest , at 1173 square kilometers, while Tokyo measured in at a whopping 18,720.\nFor most cities, we looked at Google Maps aerial imagery, randomly selecting 500 points and classifying each as tree canopy, grass, shrub and so on.\nWe calculated that tree cover was linked to significant cost savings. Each square kilometer saved about $0.93 million in air pollution health care costs, $20,000 by capturing water runoff, and $478,000 in building energy heating and cooling savings.\nWhat's more, the median annual value of carbon dioxide sequestered by megacity tree cover was $7.9 million. That comes out to about $17,000 per square kilometer. The total CO2 stored was valued at $242 million, using a measure called", "external_links": ["https://www.fs.fed.us/ucf/supporting_docs/UCF-Brief-Feb2018.pdf", "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yz-Kh1gAAAAJ&hl=en", "https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf", "https://theconversation.com/us-rivers-are-becoming-saltier-and-its-not-just-from-treating-roads-in-winter-92648", "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03622-0", "https://theconversation.com/why-are-some-e-coli-deadly-while-others-live-peacefully-within-our-bodies-95499", "http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-urban-area/", "https://theconversation.com/stand-up-for-science-more-researchers-now-see-engagement-as-a-crucial-part-of-their-job-91801", "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.07.016", "http://www.itreetool.org/", "https://www.livescience.com/6893-cities-cover-earth-realized.html"], "published": "2018-04-27T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T22:43:14.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
