A third train is currently under construction and is expected to be completed around 2020, Samsu said. * BP leads the Tangguh project with a 37.16 percent stake. Its partners include MI Berau, China National Offshore Oil Co and a venture between Mitsubishi Corp and Inpex The table below shows buyers of LNG from BP's Tangguh project this year.
