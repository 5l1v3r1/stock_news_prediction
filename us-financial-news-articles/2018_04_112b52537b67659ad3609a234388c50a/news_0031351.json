REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nThe Federal Communications Commission is considering more steps in the wake of growing concerns in Washington that Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp, which both make networking equipment and handsets, could act as conduits for espionage, something the two companies have denied. \nThe FCC decision came a day after the U.S. Commerce Department banned American firms from selling parts and software to ZTE for seven years. That move followed ZTE’s violation of an agreement that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran. \nThe United States and China, in addition to wrangling over the role of Chinese telecom companies in the United States, have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full blown trade war that could hurt global supply chains as well as business investment plans.

REUTERS/Sergio Perez \nThe proposed new rules, which are expected to be finalized this year, would prevent funds from the $8.5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telephone service to poor and rural areas, from being spent on goods or services from companies or countries which pose a “national security threat to the integrity of communications networks or their supply chains.” \n“Hidden ‘backdoors’ to our networks in routers, switches, and other network equipment can allow hostile foreign powers to inject viruses and other malware, steal Americans’ private data, spy on U.S. businesses, and more,” said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, who introduced the proposal.
