This brings the total of OurCrowd portfolio companies achieving exits to 20 in five years.\nNike announced the acquisition of Tel Aviv-based Invertex, a computer vision company that provides anatomical 3-D scanning for instant-product customization, such as shoes, which helps make the shopping experience easier. Invertex is a portfolio company of OurCrowd First , the first fund raised by OurCrowd in 2015 to make seed investments.\n“Invertex is a great example of our investment strategy to focus on cognitive AI driven technologies, which is the underpinning of our new $100M OurCrowd Cognitiv fund ,” said Eduardo Shoval, Managing partner, Cogntiv Ventures.\nSan Francisco based JUMP, formerly Social Bicycles, is a fully integrated smart, dockless bike-sharing platform. The announcement by Uber to acquire JUMP follows a trial program the company conducted with them earlier this year.\nOurCrowd is creating access for individual accredited investors from around the world to invest in Venture Capital level deals alongside and on the same terms as major institutional investors, from within Israel and beyond. OurCrowd continues to change the landscape of alternative finance and allows the crowd the opportunity to benefit from the fruits of these investments through OurCrowd.\n“We are proud of our entrepreneurial leaders who are building companies that the largest corporations in the world want to acquire,” said Founder and CEO of OurCrowd, Jon Medved. “We are proving that crowdfunding done right can provide the average accredited investor with opportunities to get in on the next exit and profit from the success of hightech companies.”\nOurCrowd Portfolio Company Exits :\n1.
