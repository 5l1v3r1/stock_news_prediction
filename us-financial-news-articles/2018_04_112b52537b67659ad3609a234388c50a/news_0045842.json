Their internal supporters will be dealt with as a secondary target,” the Taliban said. \nThousands more U.S. troops have been sent to Afghanistan to help train the army, and commanders have been given greater authority to carry out air strikes against the militants in a major reversal of the previous policy of phased withdrawal of American forces. \nAs in previous years, the Taliban pledged to protect the lives of civilians, and made no mention of incidents such as an attack it claimed in Kabul in January in which an explosives-packed ambulance blew up, killing about 100 people. \nHowever, the announcement underlines the risk to parliamentary and district council elections due to be held in October as efforts to register voters in remote areas of Afghanistan get underway. \nOn Sunday, some 60 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a voter registration centre in Kabul in an attack claimed by Islamic State. There have been a number of other attacks outside the capital. \nEstimates of Taliban territorial control vary but the Pentagon estimates that 56 percent of the country is under government control, while a BBC survey this year estimated the insurgents were active in 70 percent of the country.
