(the “Company”) (OTCPink:BKOR), the parent company of Bank of Oak Ridge (the “Bank”), announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Highlights\nEarnings per share of $0.40 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up 14 cents from 2017 Return on average common stockholders’ equity of 12.44% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 9.21% for 2017 Period end loans of $345.5 million, up 1.4% (5.9% annualized) from December 31, 2017 Period end deposits of $364.7 million, up 0.8% (3.3% annualized) from December 31, 2017 Period end noninterest-bearing deposits of $53.7 million, up 2.6% (10.6% annualized) from December 31, 2017 Nonperforming assets of $2.8 million, unchanged from December 31, 2017\nTom Wayne, President and Chief Financial Officer, reported, “We were very pleased with the year over year growth in our pretax and after tax net income and earnings per share for 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Loan and deposit growth was more measured in the first quarter of 2018 compared to all of 2017, but there were less loan opportunities in our market in 2018 than in 2017. I am very pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter of 2018 and thank our stockholders, our dedicated employees, our Board of Directors, and our clients for their continued support.”\nBank of Oak Ridge’s capital ratios remain strong and exceed all regulatory requirements at March 31, 2018. As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s stockholders’ equity was 7.3% of total assets, compared to 7.2% as of December 31, 2017. Book value per common share was $13.06 as of March 31, 2018, compared to $11.77 as of March 31, 2017.\nWith respect to the consolidated statement of operations for 2018 and 2017, net interest income was $3.8 million for all of 2018, which was an increase from $3.4 million during the same period in 2017. For 2018, the net interest margin was 3.83% compared to 3.73% for the same period in 2017, an increase of 10 basis points.\nThe Company recorded no provision for loan losses in 2018, compared with a provision of $65,000 for 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.02% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.04% at December 31, 2017. The need to supplement the allowance for loan losses in 2018 was reduced by improvement in various quantitative and qualitative factors used in the determination of the allowance. Nonperforming assets represented 0.65% of total assets at March 31, 2018, unchanged from December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income totaled $956,000 in 2018, compared with $585,000 in 2017, an increase of $371,000 or 63.4%. The biggest noninterest income category contributing to the increase were gains on sale of SBA loans of $305,000 in 2018. There were no gains on sale of SBA loans in 2017.\nNoninterest expense totaled $3.6 million in 2018, an increase of $551,000, or 18.2%, from 2017. There were several expense categories that mostly contributed to the overall increase in noninterest expense. Salaries increased due to higher incentive payments in 2018 compared to 2017, salary merit increases that took effect on January 1, 2018, and commissions related to the gain on sale of SBA loans in 2018. Employee benefits increased due to lower post-retirement benefit costs in 2017 compared to 2018. Other expenses increased due to higher check and debit card losses in 2018 compared to 2017, as well as higher expenses in 2018 related to the gain on sale of SBA loans.\nThe enactment of the new federal tax law, signed in late December 2017, positively affected net income for the Company for the current quarter. The law provides for the corporate tax rate to be reduced from 35% to 21%.\nAbout Oak Ridge Financial Services, Inc.\nOak Ridge Financial Services, Inc.
