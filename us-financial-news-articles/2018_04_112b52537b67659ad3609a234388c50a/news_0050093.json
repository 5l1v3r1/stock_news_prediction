REUTERS/Max Rossi “The Commission has concerns that the duration of the loan, extending from May 2017 until at least December 2018, exceeds the maximum duration of six months allowed for a rescue loan under the guidelines,” the European Commission said in a statement.\nThe Commission, which can order Italy to recover the money if it rules that the aid is illegal, also voiced doubts as to whether the aid was limited to the minimum necessary.\nAlitalia entered into insolvency proceedings in May 2017 and the two state aid loans provided by Italy triggered complaints to the European Commission.\nItaly’s quest to find a buyer for Alitalia’s assets has attracted bids from easyJet and Lufthansa and a source told Reuters budget carrier Wizz Air has also put in an offer.\nConsortium Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) owns 51 percent of Alitalia while Etihad Airways holds 49 percent.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:32:14.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
