The survey is based on responses from 75 institutional investors and sell-side analysts globally, representing over $2.2 trillion in assets under management.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Ahead of Trump’s tariff announcement and China’s retaliation, trade wars were at the forefront of surveyed investors’ minds with 74% expressing concern about the potential to reverse global economic momentum. This, along with ongoing concern regarding rising input costs and interest rates tempered last quarter’s record optimism somewhat, though the majority expect continued expansion in organic growth, EPS and cash flow.\n“My top concerns are trade wars, interest rates and irrational exuberance,” commented Malcom Polley, Chief Investment Officer at Stewart Capital Advisors. Dan Denbow, Portfolio Manager at USAA Investment Management added, “My sentiment is neutral to bearish, I am worried about inflation and margins. Every management team we meet with discusses costs, especially labor.”\nAt the time of the survey, nearly 60% considered U.S. equities Overvalued, with only 23% expecting 2018 valuations to expand, a significant decrease from 40% last quarter. For Europe and Asia, equities are generally seen as more compelling with room to expand.\n“Following last quarter’s all-time high expectations and the most upbeat management tone registered since September 2014, driven by continued growth momentum, our research identified an inflection downward from these record levels, due in large part to trade war uncertainty,” commented Rebecca Corbin, Founder and CEO of Corbin Advisors. “Still, expectations for continued economic growth, as well as a strong first quarter and full year, remain intact heading into earnings season. Management tone and outlooks on upcoming calls will be a critical factor in market behavior going forward, as investors look for decisiveness on the potential impact of trade, taxes and inflation,” added Ms. Corbin.\nDespite 52% of surveyed investors purporting Relatively High or High confidence levels in the global economy, all geographic regions saw a slight pullback in optimism with Japan and Mexico experiencing the largest declines. Still, the Eurozone and U.S. remain the top picks for economic improvement over the next six months.\nAs for sector views, bullish sentiment receded across the board though Technology saw its highest level of support in over a year, with the high level of optimism likely exacerbating the recent sector sell-off. For the sixth quarter in a row, Utilities and REITs garnered the lion’s share of downbeat sentiment, while Industrials witnessed the most significant negative shift amid fewer bulls and increased bears.\nSince 2006, Corbin Advisors has tracked investor sentiment on a quarterly basis.
