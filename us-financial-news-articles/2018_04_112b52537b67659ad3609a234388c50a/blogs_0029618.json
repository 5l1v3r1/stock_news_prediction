He noted even if the company doubled its dividend, it will have more than $40 billion per year of free cash flow to buy back its stock for its fiscal 2019, boosted by corporate tax cuts.\nDespite Apple's likely large future capital returns, the analyst reiterated his neutral rating on the company's stock.\n\"Short-term, we remain cautious on the iPhone vs. consensus while highlighting that other near-term positives in terms of services growth and accelerated capital are known to investors,\" he wrote.\nApple is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings results on May 1, according to its website .\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T22:12:41.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
