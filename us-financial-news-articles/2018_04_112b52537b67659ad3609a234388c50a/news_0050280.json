REUTERS/Eric Gaillard The companies said on Wednesday they were in talks to jointly negotiate purchases with their main, multi-national food and non-food suppliers, in a partnership that is also intended to favor French agricultural producers.\nThe deal is the latest alliance within the French supermarket industry, which has seen U.S. internet giant Amazon ( AMZN.O ) make inroads over the last year.\nIn January, Carrefour announced plans to cut costs and jobs, boost e-commerce investment and seek a partnership in China in an effort to lift profits and compete with Amazon.\nEarlier this month, French retailers Casino ( CASP.PA ) and Auchan [AUCH.UL] said they had begun talks on forming a partnership regarding the purchase of food and non-food items, as competition intensifies in France.\nSysteme U had been widely expected to join that alliance.\n“If Systeme U had joined that alliance, it would have made Casino the biggest buyer (in France). That competitive advantage now goes to Carrefour,” said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.\nCarrefour shares rose 0.3 percent in early trading.\nUnlisted supermarket operator Leclerc has a 21 percent share of the French market, Carrefour has 20.7 percent and Systeme-U 10.2 percent, according to industry data from Kantar.\nAnalysts said the deal with Systeme-U would therefore give Carrefour an advantage in purchasing power over Leclerc.\nCarrefour and Systeme-U said they would aim to offer “fair compensation” to French farmers, a powerful voice in the country’s political system who have lobbied President Emmanuel Macron to do more to help them.\nMacron has promised 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion) in agricultural investment as well as minimum farm prices to prevent producers selling at a loss.\nNevertheless, French farmers and their FNSEA lobby group remain concerned about issues ranging from trade talks with South America’s Mercosur bloc to a land-buying spree by Chinese investors.\n($1 = 0.8190 euros)\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta, Pascale Denis and Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T09:28:33.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
