Gasoline and distillate stocks also fell, and refinery usage has been at highs not seen for this time of year in 13 years, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\"Product demand was strong, products (inventories) were lower, crude was lower - it was really across the board supportive,\" said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.\nAlso supporting prices is the possibility that the United States might re-impose sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, which could result in further supply reductions from the Middle East.\n  Shadia Nasralla in London, Koustav Samanta and Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Nina Chestney in London; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Evans)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T20:21:34.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
