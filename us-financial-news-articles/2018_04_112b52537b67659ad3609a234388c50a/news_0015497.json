But all Americans have reason to be wary.\n\"The net losers in a trade war are always consumers,\" said David French, senior vice president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, an advocacy group.\nIf the proposed tariffs on Chinese imports are enacted, the result could be increased prices on consumer electronics, including TVs, printers and copy machines, and some household appliances, like dishwashers.\nUS imports from China of goods subject to proposed tariffs ($ billions, 2017)\nSource: Capital Economics.
