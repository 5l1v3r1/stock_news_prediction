Cole (0-1) for 10 runs on 10 hits in 3 2/3 innings. Before being replaced, Cole did connect for his first career home run in the second inning, one of three long balls surrendered by Atlanta starter Julio Teheran.\nBryce Harper and Ryan Zimmerman also homered for the Nationals (4-1).\nTeheran exited in the third inning after allowing five runs on six hits. He entered the game with 19 consecutive scoreless innings against the Nationals, but Washington got to him quickly Tuesday.\nHarper had an RBI groundout and Zimmerman hit a two-run home run in the first inning to give the Nationals a 3-0 lead. Washington has scored in the first inning in each of its five games this season.\nThe Braves (3-2) answered in the bottom half of the first. Markakis doubled home Albies, and Tucker followed with a three-run blast to right field that gave Atlanta a 4-3 lead. It was the first time this season that the Nationals trailed.\nWhile Teheran struggled, four Braves relievers — Shane Carle (1-0), Sam Freeman, A.J. Minter and Dan Winkler — combined to allow just one run, which was unearned, in 5 2/3 innings.\nMax Scherzer will make his second start of the season in Wednesday’s series finale. The Nationals ace pitched six shutout innings and struck out 10 Cincinnati Reds in an opening win. The Braves will counter with right-hander Mike Foltynewicz.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:24:13.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
