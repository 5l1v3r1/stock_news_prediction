The company is also suffering due to tighter distribution policies.\nRetail sales fell 0.6 percent on a comparable-store basis and net of currency moves as the strong performance of Sunglass Hut was more than offset by weak sales of sunglasses in Europe and ongoing difficulties at the group’s U.S. optical retailer LensCrafters.
