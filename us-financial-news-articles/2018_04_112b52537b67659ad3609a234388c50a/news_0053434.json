There was 82.82 percent support for short-term bonuses for executives, a particular point of contention the year before.\nCredit Suisse this week delivered its best quarterly results since Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam in 2016 launched his restructuring plan for Switzerland’s second-biggest bank.\nThe bank in March also revealed a revised payment scheme for its top management, introducing a returns-focused policy from next year and lowering 2017 rewards.
