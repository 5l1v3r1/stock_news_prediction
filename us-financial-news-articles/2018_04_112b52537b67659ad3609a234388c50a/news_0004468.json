Some elements of the unit are currently deployed in Mali as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force there, military officials said. \nGermany has closer military ties with the Netherlands than any other European Union country. The Dutch military put some 2,000 paratroopers under German control in 2014, and the two countries linked up their tank divisions two years later.
