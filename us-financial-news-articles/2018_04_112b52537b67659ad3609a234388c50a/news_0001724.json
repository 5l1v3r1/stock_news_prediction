But there are, in fact, three dozen such nations.\nThe CIA World Factbook lists 36 nations without armed forces , many of which rely on other countries and international groups to provide their defense. Switzerland and Austria have agreed to provide a collective defense of Liechtenstein, for instance, while Spain and France protect Andorra.\nAlthough several of these states do not have a \"regular military force,\" per the CIA's definition, their national police forces act as de facto military forces. For example, Vanuatu's Mobile Force or the Public Forces of Costa Rica are responsible for protecting their nations' borders.\nOne state that is notably absent from this list is the Vatican City, which is home to the famed Swiss Guard. While largely ceremonial, they are tasked with preserving the territorial integrity of the city-state and, of course, for protecting the pope. The CIA World Factbook considers them as a regular force since they fulfill much of the duties that a traditional standing army would â€” even though Italian Armed Forces also guarantee the territorial integrity of the Holy See.\nAndorra Aruba Cayman Islands Cook Islands Costa Rica Curacao Dominica Falkland Islands Faroe Islands French Polynesia Greenland Grenada Iceland Kiribati Kosovo Liechtenstein Macau Marshall Islands Mauritius Federated States of Micronesia Monaco Montserrat Nauru New Caledonia Niue Palau Panama St. Lucia St. Vincent and the Grenadines Samoa San Marino Sint Maarten Solomon Islands Svalbard Tuvalu Vanuatu\nCorrection: An earlier version misspelled St. Vincent.", "external_links": ["https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2055.html#cw"], "published": "2018-04-03T16:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:29:59.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
