After two free throws by Richardson, the guard then blocked a 3-pointer by Atlanta’s John Collins at the buzzer.\nGoran Dragic scored 22 points and grabbed 10 rebounds for Miami, and Whiteside had 18 points and 12 boards.\nThe spot in the postseason was the 18th in the last 23 seasons for the Heat and 20th overall in 30 campaigns.\nThe win in the final contest of the Heat’s four-game homestand also kept them in the seventh seed ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference playoff race. The Heat hold the tiebreaker over Milwaukee, having beaten the Bucks 3-0 in the season series.\nCollins led Atlanta with 19 points, and Tyler Dorsey had 18. Lee added 16.\nThe Hawks dropped to 6-33 away from home, matching the Memphis Grizzlies for the NBA’s lowest total for victories on the road.\nThe Hawks led early in the first quarter behind five points from Prince, but the Heat dominated play in the paint, piling up a 16-4 advantage through eight minutes as they led 20-18.\nWhiteside had nine points, six rebounds and three blocks in 11 minutes as Miami shot 50 percent and held a 30-25 lead after the first quarter.\nLee helped Atlanta regain the lead in the second, scoring 10 of his 12 first-half points, as the Hawks outscored Miami 31-22 to take a 56-52 halftime lead.\nMiami charged back in the third with a 9-0 run, punctuated by a Dragic trey, to take a 69-61 lead in the third quarter. However, Dorsey and Collins hit threes for Atlanta in the final minute of the third quarter to tie the game at 78-all.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:39:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
