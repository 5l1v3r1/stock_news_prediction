Growth was also helped by a 13 percent rise in loans and advances thanks to demand from the public sector, as well as from the services and industrial sectors.\nIt is the fourth major Qatari bank to report earnings for the period. Qatar National Bank and Masraf Al Rayan posted results broadly in line with forecasts, while Qatar Islamic Bank beat estimates.\nQatari banks have sought to diversify funding sources since a political dispute erupted in June last year between Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt.\nCommercial Bank this month said it had borrowed $250 million through a loan syndicated in the Asian market and last month said it had received shareholder approval to launch a global medium-term bond programme of up to $2 billion in U.S. markets.
