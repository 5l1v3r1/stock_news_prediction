(NYSE American: ORM) (the \"Company\") today announced that its Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has declared an increased quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock for the quarter ending June 30, 2018. The dividend is payable on July 13, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 29, 2018, which represents a 25% increase in the Company's quarterly dividend. Additionally, the Company provided an update on its progress with respect to previously announced plans to enhance its governance structure.\nCommenting on the Company's increased dividend and shareholder-friendly corporate governance changes already underway, Bryan H. Draper, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated: \"The previously announced amendment to our external management agreement – negotiated by management on one side and independent directors on the other – contemplated, among other things, that the Company would permanently reduce management fees.\"\n\"These changes along with the Company's longer term plans of reducing real estate ownership and growing our loan portfolio, significantly affected today's dividend announcement representing a 25% increase over the dividend paid to shareholders last quarter and a 100% increase over the 2017 fourth quarter dividend. In addition to this dividend increase, we continue to enhance shareholder value through stock repurchases, which over the past 5 years has included repurchasing approximately 2,103,000 shares of the Company's stock through December 31, 2017, representing 18.8% of the original shares outstanding, at an average price of $15.05 per share. We remain intensely focused on strategically and regularly returning capital to our shareholders through a mix of dividends and share repurchases.\"\nThe Company's Lead Independent Director, Dennis G. Schmal, stated: \"The independent Board members are also leading the Company's efforts to implement targeted modifications to its corporate governance structure that align with the Company's commitment to shareholders. We are considering a range of inputs received from our shareholders, including, among others, adopting formal policies with respect to Board diversity, voting standards with respect to uncontested director elections, director and officer stock ownership/retention guidelines, and hedging and pledging policies.\n\"Consistent with the Company's commitment to Board diversity, we have been conducting a careful and thoughtful search process to identify female director candidates who possess the requisite skills and experience needed to assist in executing the Company's strategic growth plans,\" continued Schmal, \"We look forward to identifying this candidate for appointment to the Board in the near-term.\"\nAbout Owens Realty Mortgage, Inc.\nOwens Realty Mortgage, Inc., a Maryland corporation, is a specialty finance mortgage company organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") that focuses on the origination, investment, and management of commercial real estate mortgage loans.
