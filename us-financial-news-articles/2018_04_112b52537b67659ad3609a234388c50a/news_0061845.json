He’s a tough man on the field at training,” said Tupou.\n“He wants everything to be absolutely spot on. Obviously with Thorny, you know, he’s a winner. He’s won pretty much everything. When he speaks to you, you kind of want to listen because you know he’s done it all.”\nWith last year’s harrowing axeing of Perth-based team Western Force still fresh in the memory and a 36-game losing streak to New Zealand opponents, Australian rugby could do with a good news story.\nWith a bye this week, the Reds will pause and reset before continuing their playoffs bid away to the Sunwolves in Tokyo.\nAttention will turn to the next attempts to break the New Zealand hoodoo, with the Melbourne Rebels hosting the champion Canterbury Crusaders on Friday.\nShould the Rebels fail, the Waratahs will be under huge pressure to win at home on Saturday against the injury-stricken Auckland Blues, the bottom team in the New Zealand conference.\nTonga-born Tupou was a schoolboy sensation in New Zealand but turned down a national contract to move to Australia at the age of 18.\nHe has endured plenty of banter from his former classmates about the losing streak to New Zealand sides, which dates all the way back to 2016.\n“We need to finish that because I’m hating seeing in the media, New Zealand this, New Zealand that,” said the 21-year-old.\n“Yeah, all my schoolmates are New Zealanders, they’re fierce, but they know I support Australia and the Wallabies.\n“It’s good that they hate me but also support me.” (Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:26:28.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
