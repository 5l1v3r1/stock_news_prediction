Although expenses continued to outpace revenue, the gap tightened because of a $5.2 billion year-over-year increase in premium revenue, driven largely by rate increases in the personal and commercial auto segments, as well as by a $2.3 billion increase in realized gains from the strong equity market. Operating income was flat year-over-year, but the cumulative change in deferred tax expenses or benefits recognized in income from continuing operations resulted in the drop in net income.\nOverall, premium revenue grew 2.3%, constituting the main contributor to the group’s $8.9 billion increase in revenue. Net investment income grew by 4.5%, but overall yield remains historically low. The $1.8 billion increase in other revenue was driven by $1.1 billion in realized gains, as companies cashed in on the rise in equity prices.\nThe TCJA-related write-downs diminished shareholders’ surplus by $10.2 billion, or 2.8% of 2016 surplus. However, TCJA was not negative for all companies, since some believe the new law makes them more competitive as buyers in terms of mergers and acquisitions.\nTo access a full copy of this special report, please visit http://www3.ambest.com/bestweek/purchase.asp?record_code=272642 .\nA.M.
