(OTC Pink:MEDH) through unanimous vote from a Special Board of Directors meeting has Cancelled and Retired 150 Million Common shares from the Authorized Share count effective immediately. Please visit http://soswy.state.wy.us/ for further information.\nAdditionally, 98,117,200 Restricted Shares were surrendered by Kathleen Roberton to Mark Miller per the Management Agreement that was executed in December of 2017. Those shares were transferred into the New CEO Mark Miller’s name and remain restricted.\nMr. Miller stated, “This share reduction helps put to rest some legacy issues from previous management that reaffirms our commitment to build investor and shareholder value. Any assets leased or owned by the past owners has nothing to do with the current state of events or assets held by MedX Holdings presently. At this point, in weighing our options, we are discussing with our accountant and attorney what our capacity will be to cancel and retire shares from the OS by 30 to 50 Million. This may require the issuance of an E Class Share to secure sole voting rights, but we have not yet crossed that bridge.”\nFollow us on Twitter @MedX_Holdings\nABOUT: MedX Holdings\nMedX Holdings is a Holding Company that Acquires \"Real\" Businesses throughout the United States that have operational track records; including the expansion of its current operations in Residential/ Commercial Construction and Real Estate.\nSafe-Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This press release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), including all statements that are not statements of historical fact regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the company, its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) the company's financing plans; (ii) trends affecting the company's financial condition or results of operations; (iii) the company's growth strategy and operating strategy; and (iv) the declaration and payment of dividends.
