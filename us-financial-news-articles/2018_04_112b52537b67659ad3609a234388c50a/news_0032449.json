It is currently seeking to develop four regional projects including plans for the East and West Coast, a loop connecting D.C. and Baltimore, and a loop between downtown Chicago and the O'Hare airport. \nMusk's vision is to move people or cargo on \"electric skates\" at between 125 and 150 miles per hour, a technology he calls \"Loop.\" The tunnels could also someday be used for \"hyperloop\" transportation, a much faster vacuum-powered technology that could move \"pods\" at up to 600 miles per hour. Several companies, including Virgin Hyperloop One, are working on developing hyperloop technology, which was first proposed by Musk in 2012.\nWhile the SEC filing did not reveal which investors participated in the new round of funding, SpaceX engineer Steve Davis is listed as a director, and Neuralink President Jared Birchall is also listed as an executive. \nThe Boring Company famously sold $10 million worth of \"flamethrowers,\" which appear to be modified roofing torches, to fans and followers of the company and Elon Musk earlier this year. \nMusk is also a founder of space exploration company SpaceX and brain-computer interface start-up Neuralink, and the CEO of electric car pioneer Tesla.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T02:37:31.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
