I don't really like it right now. I need some of these things to be resolved. I need that NXPI deal to be resolved. Let's just say until that is, I am not a fan.\"\nWorthington Industries : \"Worthington Industries is in the metals business. When we talk about metals on this show, we talk Nucor . My charitable trust owns it. That's what you want to buy.\"\nDropbox : \"There are two IPOs, although one really doesn't count as an IPO: Spotify , which I really like, and Dropbox. And [Dropbox CEO] Drew Houston, you know where to go when you want to report. You're going to come on our show when we're in California. Of course you are.\"\nMyriad Genetics : \"This company's been kicking around for a while. It's an early-stage company that sells at 25 times earnings. Good spec. Chart's bad.\"\nSkechers : \"I think Skechers is doing well. I happened to particularly like that Tony Romo ad. I'm not kidding. I think it's really good. Skechers is doing fine. I think that the boys who run that company have done a good job. They've weathered a lot.\"\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions : \"Now, Kratos has been in a crossfire. There's longs and shorts. We recommended it lower. It's a battleground stock. I don't want to be in a battleground. Sell.\"\nYY Inc. : \"We've got a trading problem. You know what that means? That means sell, sell, sell.\"\nEnterprise Products Partners : \"EPD is good. Now, remember, we had [CEO Mike] Mears on recently from Magellan , which I did not do a good job on for my charitable trust. Not at all. Jeez, that was a real bad call by me. But EPD is in the same biz and I think it's good and I think you ought to hold onto it.\"\nAmerican Water Works Company : \"Always liked it. Good growth. Consistent company. Nothing the matter with that. I'd say it's a buy. It's been a buy since we started the show.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Qualcomm needs to resolve its slew of issues 19 Hours Ago | 04:12 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nucor.\n ", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/jimcramer", "https://vine.co/u/984542302087651328", "https://twitter.com/MadMoneyOnCNBC", "https://www.facebook.com/madmoney?ref=aymt_homepage_panel", "https://twitter.com/jimcramer"], "published": "2018-04-19T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T02:05:33.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
