(OTC Pink:SVVB), the small bank holding company for SaviBank, today reported first quarter 2018 earnings grew 82% to $661,000, or $0.04 per share, compared to $363,000, or $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the net loss was $1.14 million, which included the $1.49 million valuation charge for its deferred tax asset (DTA). Profitability was fueled by 15% loan growth and 36% deposit growth year-over-year, excellent asset quality and strong net interest margin. All results are unaudited.\n“We are continuing to build our franchise, implementing plans to expand our branch network, investing in technology and recruiting seasoned bankers while establishing and deepening our customer relationships,” said Michal D. Cann, Chairman and CEO. “The markets we serve in Northwest Washington continue to generate excellent growth in household income, employment and population.”\n“While the changes in the tax law reduced earnings in 2017, our marginal tax rate in the first quarter dropped to 21% from 34%, which contributed to profitability,” said Rob Woods, Chief Financial Officer.\nTotal revenue, consisting of net interest income and non-interest income, increased 26% to $2.83 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.25 million in the first quarter a year ago, and grew 17% from $2.43 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting the strong market for Small Business Administration loans.\nNet interest margin, remains well above average, at 4.30% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.23% in the fourth quarter and 4.43% in the first quarter a year ago. “With the recent increase in interest rates, we are seeing the benefits of repricing 26% of the loan portfolio that carries an adjustable rate. Deposit costs have been relatively stable, but we anticipate that both cost of deposits and cost of borrowings will begin to rise in the future,” Cann noted. The net interest margin is significantly better than the peer average of 3.72% posted by the 518 micro-cap banks in the SNL Financials Microcap Bank Index as of December 31, 2017.\n“The robust SBA and USDA loan production generated during the quarter contributed to the rise in non-interest income year-over-year. Non-interest income increased 70% in the first quarter 2018 to $633,000, of which $449,000 was from gains on the sale of loans, compared to $372,000, of which $203,000 was from loan sales in the first quarter of 2017,” said Andrew Hunter, President. “Our local economic growth is primarily driven by construction, manufacturing, agriculture and retail businesses, generating strong loan demand from these owners in our markets.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (at, or for the period March 31, 2018)\nEarnings per share improved to $0.039 in the first quarter on 17.1 million shares outstanding, up from $0.024, on 14.8 million shares outstanding in the first quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, change to the DTA valuation reduced EPS to ($0.067).\nNet interest income increased 17% to $2.20 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.87 million a year ago, and was up 3% from $2.13 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAverage first quarter total loans increased 17%, to $182.6 million, compared to $156.3 million a year ago, and grew 4% from $176.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. End of quarter total loans increased 15% to $185.8 million, compared to $162.0 million a year ago and grew 1% from $183.3 million at December 31, 2017.\nAverage first quarter total deposits grew 34% to $179.9 million from $134.4 million in the first quarter a year ago, and increased 3% from $175.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. End of period deposits grew 36% to $186.2 million from $136.9 million a year ago, and grew 4% from $178.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAsset quality remained exceptionally strong with nonperforming loans at 0.01% of total loans at March 31, 2018, and 0.03% at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets were 0.22% at the end of the first quarter, down from 0.79% a year ago.\nNet recoveries were $2,000 in the first quarter of 2018 and $315,000 in the first quarter a year ago. In the fourth quarter of 2018 net charge-offs were $51,000.\nAllowance for loan losses, as a percentage of total loans was 1.05% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.15%, at March 31, 2017.\nWith the new capital raised during the second half of 2017, SaviBank capital levels remained above the threshold for well-capitalized institutions. The total risk-based capital ratio was 14.44% and the tier-1 leverage ratio was 12.12%.\nAbout Northwest Washington\nSaviBank operates two branches and one loan production office in Skagit County, two branches in Island County, and one branch in Whatcom County. The new Bellingham branch building in Whatcom County opened in October 2017.\nAccording to USNews.com , Washington state ranked 3 rd for the best economy in the nation.
