IMPROVING FRENCH HYPERMARKETS \nCasino shares, which had fallen 17 percent so far in 2018, were up 0.3 percent at 42.09 euros in early session trading. \nBrokerage Bryan Garnier raised its rating on Casino to “buy” from “neutral”, saying the quarterly sales “could bring some reassurance as to relative strength of the commercial momentum”. \nIn France, Casino has cut prices at its Geant hypermarkets and reduced retail space for non-food items in response to competition from online and smaller convenience stores. It has also increased its focus on organic and fresh food products. \nSame-store sales at the Geant Casino hypermarkets in France rose 2.1 percent, an acceleration from 0.3 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, with food sales up 4.2 percent. \nThe group’s Monoprix, Franprix and Casino-branded stores also turned in robust performances, while same store food sales in Brazil rose 2.2 percent in the quarter, lifted by a 9.4 percent rise at its Assai cash-and-carry outlets. \nCasino has begun talks on a forming a partnership regarding the purchasing of food and non-food items with domestic rival Auchan, and it is also expanding its online offering through a deal to use UK online retailer Ocado’s platform. \nWith the Ocado and Amazon deals, Casino “will significantly increase its reach, win new clients and generate profitable growth,” added Giscard d’Estaing.
