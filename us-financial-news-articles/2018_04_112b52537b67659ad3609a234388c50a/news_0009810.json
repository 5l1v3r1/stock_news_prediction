As part of our plan, we need to improve representation of women and people of color.” \n“While we’ve spoken about this many times, and tried different ways to achieve change, we have failed to gain traction — and our hiring and promotion decisions are not changing senior-level representation as quickly as we have wanted,” she wrote. \nMatheson disclosed that 29% of the company’s vice presidents are women, even though the company’s global workforce is evenly split between men and women. In the U.S., 16% of vice presidents are nonwhite, she wrote.
