Officials at ETP were not immediately available to say if that extension would affect the expected startup of the project. \n* In related news, ETP is still waiting for Pennsylvania regulators to allow liquids to flow through the existing Mariner East 1 pipe. The company told shippers using the line that it will likely restart in late April. \n* Pennsylvania utility regulators suspended operations on Mariner East 1 on March 7 after sinkholes were discovered near the project. \n* The Mariner East 1 shutdown has forced shippers, including Range Resources Corp, to find another route for their liquids. \n* Mariner East 1 can transport up to 70,000 bpd of propane and ethane from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including ETPâ€™s Marcus Hook industrial complex near Philadelphia.
