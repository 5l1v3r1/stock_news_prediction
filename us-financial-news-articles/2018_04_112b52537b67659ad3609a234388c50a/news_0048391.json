It allows us to set the baseline price,\" said Anthony Hooper, the company's head of commercial operations. \"We've listened to the affordability question in the marketplace... we are quite prepared to talk to payers about risk-based contracts with Aimovig,\" meaning insurers could be compensated if the drug was not effective.\nHe added that Amgen \"will continue to come forward with prices that are responsible.\"\nAnalysts have estimated list prices for Aimovig at $8,000 to $10,000 a year.\nAmgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, emphasized that its migraine drug may be more potent than competitors' and could have advantages in terms of dosing and ease of administration.\nAmgen posted first-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.47 per share, up from $3.15 a share a year earlier, helped by lower taxes and fewer outstanding shares. Analysts on average expected $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe biotech company slightly raised the lower end of its full-year financial outlook and said its adjusted tax rate would be 13.5 percent to 14.5 percent, or half a point less than previously expected.\nFirst-quarter revenue rose 2 percent to $5.55 billion, with sales up 3 percent to $5.34 billion.\nJefferies analyst Michael Yee said the results marked \"a good quarter and a good start to the year\" for Amgen.\nAmgen's sales of anti-inflammatory drug Enbrel, faced with more competition in the rheumatology and dermatology sectors, fell 6 percent to $1.05 billion, below Wall Street estimates of $1.09 billion.\nSales of cholesterol drug Repatha more than doubled to $123 million, but the product \"still has a long way to go to restore confidence that it has multi-billion-dollar sales potential,\" JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a research report.\nFor the full year, Amgen said it now expected adjusted EPS of $12.80 to $13.70, compared with $12.60 to $13.70 previously. It raised the lower end of 2018 revenue guidance to $21.9 billion from $21.8 billion and left the upper end unchanged at $22.8 billion.
