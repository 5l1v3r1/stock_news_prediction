REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol \nJet Airways, in a regulatory filing late on Tuesday, said it had entered an agreement to buy the aircraft, but it did not say whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding. \nBoeing said in a statement that Jet Airways will be the first Indian airline to take delivery of the new and improved 737 jet. \nBased on Boeing’s list prices, the deal could be worth between $7.2 billion and $9.7 billion depending on which 737 MAX variants the airline chooses. Airlines usually get significant discounts from manufacturers though, bringing costs well below list prices.
