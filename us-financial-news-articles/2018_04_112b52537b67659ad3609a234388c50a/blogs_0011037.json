More than half went to treat employees' children.\nThe analysis released Thursday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation finds such spending cost companies and workers about $26 per enrollee in 2016.\nEmployers have been limiting insurance coverage of opioids because of concerns about addiction. The report finds spending on opioid prescriptions falling 27 percent from a peak in 2009.\nResearchers analyzed insurance claims from employers with more than 1,000 workers. Most are self-insured, meaning they assume the financial risk.\nWorkers share the costs. Steve Wojcik of the National Business Group on Health says for every $5 increase, employers typically cover $4 and pass $1 to workers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:11:07.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
