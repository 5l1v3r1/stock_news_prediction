Jonathan Ernst | Reuters President Donald Trump visits the Forbidden City with China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing on November 8, 2017. \nWashington has long pressed Beijing to level the playing field for foreign companies in China, which remain excluded from certain sectors such as services. Not only will market reforms help heal the U.S.-China relationship , it will also benefit China's economy, according to Brilliant. \nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday suggested Xi's government will remove trade barriers \"because it is the right thing to do.\" \nBeijing's previous reforms, such as November's announcement of raising foreign equity ownership in financial firms , were \"a little bit too little,\" Brilliant said. The Trump administration is seeking immediate action from the Chinese that goes beyond financial liberalization, he explained.
