Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Celta Vigo vs FC Barcelona - Balaidos, Vigo, Spain - April 17, 2018 Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele celebrates scoring their first goal with Philippe Coutinho REUTERS/Miguel Vidal \nBarca lead the standings on 83 points after 33 games, 12 ahead of second-placed Atletico Madrid, who visit Real Sociedad on Thursday, while Real Madrid, a further four points back in third, host Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday. \nFrance forward Ousmane Dembele struck his first goal in the Spanish top flight to give Barca the lead against the run of play in the 36th minute but Celta got a deserved equaliser just before halftime when Jonny Castro struck from close range. \nPaco Alcacer restored Barca’s lead in the 64th minute but Celta, who had beaten the Catalans 4-3 and 4-1 at home in the previous two seasons, continued to pour forward and caused the visitors’ inexperienced defence problems. \nSubstitute Roberto was given a straight red card in the 71st for halting a surging run from Iago Aspas and the Spain striker levelled in the 82nd minute, bundling the ball in with the help of his arm and scoring his 20th league goal this season.

It’s another point and now we need two more victories to become champions.” \nBarca’s King’s Cup final opponents Sevilla, who are seventh, were held to a 0-0 draw at relegation-threatened Deportivo earlier on Tuesday, while sixth-placed Villarreal beat Leganes 2-1 as they battle for a Europa League qualifying spot.
