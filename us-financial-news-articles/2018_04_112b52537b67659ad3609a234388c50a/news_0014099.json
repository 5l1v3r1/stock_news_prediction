(NasdaqGM: LFIN) have filed a class action complaint against the company's officers and directors for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 between December 13, 2017 and April 2, 2018. Longfin is an independent finance and technology company in the United States and internationally.\nView this information on the law firm's Shareholder Rights Blog: www.robbinsarroyo.com/longfin-corp\nLongfin Accused of Including False Statements in its SEC Filings\nAccording to the complaint, Longfin lied about the age of its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"), the location of its principal offices, and listed an employee as an officer when she did not have that position. Further, Longfin acquired crypto company Ziddu.com shortly after Longfin's IPO to capitalize on the popularity of blockchain companies in order to manipulate the company's stock price. On March 26, 2018, Citron Research called Longfin a \"pure stock scheme\" and predicted imminent action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") against the company due to fraud and inaccuracies in the company's filings and press releases. On Friday, April 6, 2018, the SEC halted trading of the stock and obtained an emergency freeze of $27 million in trading profits involving the CEO and three other people in order to prevent the profits from being transferred out of the country. Then on Monday, April 9, 2018, Longfin's public accounting firm resigned amid the SEC investigation.\nLongfin Shareholders Have Legal Options\nIf you would like more information about your rights and potential remedies, contact attorney Leonid Kandinov at (800) 350-6003, LKandinov@robbinsarroyo.com , or via the shareholder information form on the firm's website.\nRobbins Arroyo LLP is a nationally recognized leader in shareholder rights law.
