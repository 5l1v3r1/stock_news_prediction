The Fed’s target rate is currently for a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75, and most Fed policymakers expect the rate to be between 3.1 percent and 3.6 percent by 2020.\nReporting by Jesus Aguado and Isla Binnie; writing by Ann Saphir Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:18:52.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
