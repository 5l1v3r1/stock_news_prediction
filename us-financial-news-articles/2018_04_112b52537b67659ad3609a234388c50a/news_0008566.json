The people of this great nation have voted to take a new direction,” he said in a speech following the short ceremony in which he made an appeal for national unity.\n“We have only one country, Sierra Leone, and we are all one people.”\nOpposition candidate and former military junta leader Julius Maada Bio takes his oath as Sierra Leone's new president in Freetown, Sierra Leone April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Olivia Acland “EVERYONE IN, NO ONE OUT” Maada Bio, who briefly ruled Sierra Leone as head of a military junta in 1996, replaces outgoing President Ernest Bai Koroma, who could not seek re-election due to term limits.\nThe largely peaceful election process has come as a relief for the country of 7 million people, who in the 1990s endured a brutal civil war fueled by the diamond trade and notorious for its drug-addled child soldiers and punitive amputations.\nSLPP supporters packed into the NEC headquarters on Wednesday, and following the announcement of the election results party officials urged the Maada Bio’s backers to remain calm.\n“Celebrate responsibly. Do not disturb your neighbor. Victory for all men, not victory for some. Everyone in, no one out,” the party’s campaign manager Ali Kabba said.\nSlideshow (6 Images) Opposition supporters, confident of victory, sang and danced in the streets of Freetown on Wednesday evening hours before Maada Bio was officially declared the winner.\n“I feel happy about the results. I am here because my president Julius Maada Bio has won the election in this country,” said Adolfus Kargbo, among a group of SLPP supporters chanting Maada Bio’s name.\nWriting by Aaron Ross and Joe Bavier; Editing by Sandra Maler and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:15:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
