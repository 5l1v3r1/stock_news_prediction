(TSX:NWC) (the “Company” or “North West”) today released its Annual Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2018, its Annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and Annual Information Form for the same period. These documents can be found on the Company’s profile on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at www.northwest.ca .\nU.S. Tax Reform\nThe Company previously reported its fourth quarter unaudited interim period condensed consolidated financial statements on March 15, 2018. On April 2, 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service issued notice 2018-26 which provides additional guidance for computing the Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax (“transition tax”) under H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. Tax Reform\"). As a result of this guidance, the Company recorded an additional estimated transition tax of $1.9 million on the accumulated undistributed earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries in its annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2018. This adjustment increased income tax expense and decreased net earnings by $1.9 million from the amounts previously reported in the fourth quarter unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for both the fourth quarter and the year ended January 31, 2018. Further information on the impact of U.S. Tax Reform is provided in the consolidated income tax expense and quarterly financial information sections of the Annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis and in Note 9 to the Annual Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended January 31, 2018.\nChanges to North West Directorship\nNorth West announces the resignation of Gary Merasty as a member of its Board of Directors, effective April 11, 2018, so that Gary can join the Company, effective May 1, 2018, in a senior executive role, accountable for Heath Products & Services, Store & Community Development and new ventures with an emphasis on indigenous business partnerships.\nAlso effective April 11, 2018, North West announces the appointment of Deepak Chopra to its Board of Directors.
