He became a U.S. citizen in the 1970s.\n\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" in which a psychiatric institution becomes a microcosm of the contemporary world, and \"Amadeus,\" the life of 18th-century composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival Antonio Salieri, earned 13 Oscars between them, including those for best director to Forman.\nHis other notable work included the rock musical \"Hair\" in 1979, \"Ragtime\" in 1981 and \"The People vs Larry Flint\" in 1996, which was nominated for an Academy Award that year.
