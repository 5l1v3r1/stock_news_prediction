President Mauricio Macri’s administration has reduced subsidies for utilities and transportation as part of its efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit.\nDujovne added that a prolonged drought in Argentina’s main agricultural areas contributed to higher food price inflation in March, pointing to substantial increases in prices for bread, eggs and chicken.\nHe said the drought would reduce economic output in 2018 by 0.8-1 percentage point, but said that GDP would likely still expand by around 3 percent year-over-year, in line with what Treasury Ministry officials have previously said.\nReporting by Buenos Aires newsroom; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:26:33.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
