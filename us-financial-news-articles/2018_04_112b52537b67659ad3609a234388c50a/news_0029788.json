Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!” Mr. Trump wrote Saturday morning on Twitter.\nThe tweet came hours after American, British and French forces launched airstrikes on targets including a Damascus scientific research center and a storage facility for chemical weapons, a reprisal for an attack last week that killed at least 43 civilians and injured hundreds more.\nThe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joe Dunford, said at a Pentagon briefing Friday that the forces had made a single wave of strikes that is complete, for now.\nThe phrase “mission accomplished” in the U.S. is commonly associated with a speech given by President George W. Bush on an aircraft carrier, against a banner with the slogan, during the early days of the Iraq war.\nMr. Trump has often said he opposed that war. On Syria, he has been conflicted, at times indicating he wants to scale back U.S. involvement but also spending much of the week searching for a response that could permanently deter attacks he had described on Twitter as “SICK!”\n“America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria, under no circumstances,” Mr. Trump said in Friday night remarks.\n“So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There won’t be anything, or anyone, even close!” he added on Twitter Saturday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T05:55:53.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
