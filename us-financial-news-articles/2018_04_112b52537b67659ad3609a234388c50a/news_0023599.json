Based on several online media stories, Zambia has been singled-out as a potential source of hidden debt,” Smith wrote in the report.\n“But there is no hard evidence to suggest the probability is higher there than for other sovereigns of similar credit ratings.”\nDebt-ridden Mozambique, one of the world’s poorest countries, is struggling to repay loans of more than $2 billion that were not approved by parliament.\nThe discovery in 2016 of the undisclosed loans prompted the International Monetary Fund and foreign donors to cut off support, triggering a currency collapse and leading to a default.\nZambia’s economy is expected to grow by more than 4 percent this year helped by the mining, agriculture and construction sectors, Finance Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe said last week.\nMwanakatwe said the government would complete a detailed debt sustainability exercise within two weeks before re-opening discussions with the IMF.\nZambia will rearrange loans from Chinese companies and instead look to borrow directly from the Asian giant’s government in a bid to satisfy IMF conditions and unlock a potential $1.3 billion loan from the multilateral lender.
