Rival Halliburton fell 1 percent.\nOil majors Exxon and Chevron were off about 1 percent and weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\nThe Dow, however, got a boost from General Electric, which jumped 4.5 percent after it posted quarterly results that topped estimates and affirmed its 2018 forecasts.\nHoneywell rose 1.4 percent after reporting higher-than-expected quarterly profit and lifting its full-year earnings forecast.\nFirst-quarter profit at S&P 500 companies are expected to have recorded their strongest gain in seven years. Of the 73 companies that have reported through Thursday, 76.7 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nInvestors are questioning if the tax cuts are going to be as beneficial as expected and are worried rising interest rates would hit borrowing costs, said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.\n“There are some lingering concerns around interest rates, and earnings, although so far are very robust, the forward-looking statements aren’t as exciting,” Bakhos said.\nAt 9:58 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 30.81 points, or 0.12 percent, at 24,634.08, the S&P 500 was down 5.71 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,687.42 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 43.50 points, or 0.60 percent, at 7,194.55.\nBank stocks got a boost with U.S. ten-year Treasury yields , the benchmark for global borrowing costs, hitting a near two-month high of 2.9410 percent.\nTechnology stocks were weak for the third session in a row, dropping 0.89 percent. The biggest drag was Apple , which fell 3.2 percent.\nOne bright spot in tech was Twitter, whose shares rose 3.7 percent after bullish brokerage actions, including MKM Partners’ upgrade to “buy”.\nSkechers USA shares tumbled 26.9 percent after the footwear maker’s quarterly profit forecast missed analysts’ estimates.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.59-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.58-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 21 new highs and 27 new lows.
