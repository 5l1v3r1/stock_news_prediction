(Nasdaq:SBPH), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of viral infections, inflammatory diseases and certain cancers, today announced its 2018 first quarter financial results and provided an update on recent corporate and clinical developments.\n“We believe that we continue to lead the field in the development of a simple, safe, and selective functional cure for chronic hepatitis B with our ongoing Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial involving our lead development candidate, inarigivir,” said Martin Driscoll, president and chief executive officer of Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals. “We presented compelling data on inarigivir at the recent APASL and International Liver Congress (EASL) meetings and expect to continue to disclose advancing data from our inarigivir clinical program at future scientific conferences. We are progressing the IND- and CTA-enabling programs for our next-generation STING agonist compound, SB 11285, with the goal to enter clinical trials later this year with the first STING agonist to be administered to patients intravenously. We are focused on the continued timely execution of our development plans.”\nRecent Highlights\nPresented expanded inarigivir data from the ACHIEVE trial at the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) in Paris, France\n-- Highlighted combined results from the 24-week trial of both the 25mg and 50mg cohorts of Part A of the ongoing Phase 2 ACHIEVE trial examining the use of inarigivir soproxil followed by Viread® for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)\n-- Demonstrated significant reductions in viral markers, including HBV DNA, HBV RNA and HBsAg with favorable safety and tolerability profiles\nPresented 12 and 24-week inarigivir data from the ACHIEVE trial at the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) in New Delhi, India\nContinued to progress the IND and CTA-enabling programs for SB 11285 with the goal to enter the first oncology clinical trial later this year involving the intravenous route of administration of a STING agonist compound\nAppointed Timothy Clackson, Ph.D. to the Board of Directors\n2018 First Quarter Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $47.2 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $50.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $6.2 million, compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2017. Spring Bank anticipates that its existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2019, but will not be sufficient to fund the initiation of any Phase 3 trial for inarigivir, which could occur earlier than the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOperating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $6.2 million, which consisted of $4.0 million of research and development (R&D) expenses and $2.2 million of general and administrative (G&A) expenses.\nNet loss: The Company’s net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $4.9 million, or $0.37 per share, compared to $6.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or $0.69 per share.\nAbout Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals\nSpring Bank Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of a novel class of therapeutics using its proprietary small molecule nucleic acid hybrid (SMNH) chemistry platform.
