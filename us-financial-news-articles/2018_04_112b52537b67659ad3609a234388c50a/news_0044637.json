REUTERS/Feline Lim \nSecrecy was key during filming on the Walt Disney Co. movie, which brings together almost every comic-book hero in Marvel’s cinematic universe for an all-out battle with supervillain Thanos. \nMost of the actors were given scripts for only the scenes they were filming, or given complete scripts that turned out to be fake, in order to prevent spoilers - particularly which characters may get killed off - from leaking out. \nThe cast will not see the finished product until the world premiere in Los Angeles on Monday night. \n“I kind of like that,” said Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays Dr. Strange. “I like that we’ll be sitting in our own audience ... it’s just going to be a thrill to watch it for the first time. I’m genuinely really, really excited.” Cast members Sebastian Stan (L), Winston Duke (C) and Anthony Mackie pose for a portrait while promoting the \"Avengers: Infinity War\" in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., April 21, 2018.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni \nWith outsize heroes, including Captain America, Spider-Man, Iron Man, Black Widow, Black Panther and the Guardians of the Galaxy, comes massive fan appeal. \nAnalysts say the film could come close to, or even break, the $248 million North American box-office opening set in 2015 by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” also from Disney. \nBarton Crockett, media industry analyst at B. Riley FBR, predicted a $238 million debut for the film, which would make it the biggest opening this year.
