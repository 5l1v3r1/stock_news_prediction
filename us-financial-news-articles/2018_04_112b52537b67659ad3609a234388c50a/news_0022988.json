Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook Inc, has been testifying before lawmakers this week.\nSilicon Valley has long opposed efforts to rewrite the Communications Decency Act, which protects companies from liability for content posted by their users and has been credited with fueling the sector's growth for 20 years.\nHowever, Facebook and other technology companies and lobbying groups mostly withdrew opposition to the legislation in recent months after negotiating changes that limited the bill's potential impact.\nSome technology companies fear the bill could signal more efforts to tighten regulation on the industry.\nLaw enforcement has lobbied for such legislation for years, and the bill had drawn support from Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter and a White House adviser.\n\"This is a momentous day in the fight to help stop online sex trafficking, and a big victory for trafficking victims and survivors who for too long have been denied the opportunity to get the justice they deserve,\" said Republican U.S. Senator Rob Portman, a co-sponsor of the Senate version of the bill.\nOn Monday, an indictment against Backpage.com , the internet's second-largest classified ads website, which is used for sex trafficking, was unsealed.\nTrump, who had been expected to sign the bill, did not respond to reporters' questions when he signed it.
