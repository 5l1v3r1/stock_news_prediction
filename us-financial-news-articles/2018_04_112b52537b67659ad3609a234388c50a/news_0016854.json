An MSU spokeswoman told the Detroit News that the school does not comment on pending litigation.\nThe lawsuit does not name the three members of the basketball team accused of rape.\nThe court papers noted that the university has been under scrutiny over its handling of sexual assault cases in its athletics programs, an apparent reference to the Larry Nassar a former faculty member and physician at Michigan State and a doctor for USA Gymnastics. He was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.\nAccording to Jane Doe’s lawsuit, the aspiring sports journalist met three Michigan State basketball players at an East Lansing bar in April 2015, shortly after the team was eliminated from the NCAA tournament.\nThe young woman said in the court papers that she accepted a drink from one of the players and agreed to return to an apartment shared by several of them after he falsely told her that her roommate would be there.\nAt the apartment the plaintiff felt drugged, was thrown onto a bed and violently raped by the three players, the lawsuit said.\nThe victim said she told Michigan State University Counseling Center counsellors and other staff. But they told her she faced an uphill battle against “guys with big names” and discouraged her from notifying police.\nThe university is under investigation by state and federal agencies over its handling of the Nassar case. Nassar’s former supervisor, William Strampel, was arrested in March and charged with criminal sexual conduct involving medical school students.\nReporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit and and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T03:34:28.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
