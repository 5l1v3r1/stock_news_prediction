With the index essentially flat for the year, that equates to around a 12 percent gain over the next 8 months.\nDespite the gap between current levels and his price target, he contended blockbuster earnings and market fundamentals could breathe new life into stocks.\n\"We think that what it'll be is continued improved earnings, improved revenues, and an economy that shows sustainability at a level around 2.5 percent to perhaps better,\" Stoltzfus said, with that dynamic bolstered by \"the effects of tax reform as it begins to flow into the economy.\"\nIn the beginning of April, Stoltzfus told \"Trading Nation\" uncertainty would be swept away by a strong first quarter earnings season.\nHe believes a bullish catalyst next week could be \"FANG\" technology stocks, a group that's been hammered recently over a government regulation threat. A blowout number by the group, which contains names such as Alphabet [Google] , Facebook and Amazon , could further drive gains, according to Stoltzfus.\n\"We'd like to think earnings season has to be enough for now,\" Stoltzfus said.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
