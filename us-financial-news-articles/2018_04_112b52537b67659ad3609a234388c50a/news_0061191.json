When stripping away the effect of energy price moves, inflation remains on a weak note despite the economy’s expansion and the narrowing output gap.\n“There’s no change to our view, formed three months ago, that inflation will likely reach 2 percent during fiscal 2019.”\n“There’s no change to our commitment to achieve 2 percent inflation at the earliest date possible.”\nON WHY THE BOJ REMOVED THE TIMEFRAME FOR HITTING ITS PRICE GOAL:\n“The timeframe was always a forecast, not a binding deadline for meeting our goal. But some market players interpreted the timeframe was a deadline and tied it with monetary policy action.\n“In reality, it’s taking time to achieve 2 percent inflation and there are various uncertainties to the price outlook. It’s inappropriate for markets to focus too much on the timeframe.\n“If the economy loses momentum for achieving 2 percent inflation, we’ll undoubtedly consider easing policy ... We removed the timeframe to arrest market misunderstanding that the timeframe is directly linked to monetary policy.”\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:49:02.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
