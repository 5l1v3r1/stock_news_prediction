I think you're going to get a pullback toward about 2,325, 2,350\" on the S&P, he said.\nThat will then be the better entry point into the market, Johnson said.\nHe is predicting the S&P will then rally to 2,850 by year-end.\nJim Lacamp, senior portfolio manager at UBS, also thinks the market may see another sell-off.\n\"That would be healthy. It would shake out some of the weaker players,\" he said on \"Closing Bell.\"\nAnd he's not overly concerned about rising Treasury yields , which initially caused a sharp fall in stocks earlier Wednesday.\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield traded at 3.03 percent on Wednesday after since 2014 on Tuesday. Investors are worried rising borrowing costs may slow the economy and hurt companies' ability to buy back their own stock.\nLacamp said that while people are worried about a 3 percent yield, it is still attractive compared with other yields around the world.\nEven if the Federal Reserve keeps raising rates, which could result the 10-year hitting 4.25 percent, it doesn't mean investors should run from stocks, he said.\n\"One of the reasons the Fed is able to do this is the global economic recovery. We have no recessions anywhere in developed markets around the world,\" Lacamp said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T00:46:36.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
