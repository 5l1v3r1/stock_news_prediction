At 0854 GMT they were down 8.3 percent at 52.14 euros.\nOther semiconductor-related stocks also traded lower, following Asian technology shares after a warning on smartphone demand from the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor.\n“The gross margin in Q1 at 38 percent was impacted by an unfavourable product mix and costs related to our preparation for further growth. We estimate our gross margin in Q2 to show a substantial improvement bringing it back again in the range of low- to mid-40s,” Chief Executive Chuck del Prado said.\nASMI is ramping up production of new tools for layering materials on silicon wafers.\nThe company said it expected sales of 200-230 million euros in the current quarter, and order intake of 160-200 million, down from 206 million in the first quarter.\nNatixis analyst Charles Quote: : “We expect the share price to react negatively today... probably amplified by the current volatility in the sector. Nevertheless, our investment case is unchanged.” ($1 = 0.8109 euros) (Reporting by Toby Sterling and Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Jon Boyle, Georgina Prodhan)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:53:42.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
