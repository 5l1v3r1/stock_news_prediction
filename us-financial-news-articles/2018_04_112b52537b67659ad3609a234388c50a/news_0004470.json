When you look at some of the boys divisions, some of them have 24 to 26 boxers there,” Evans told local media. \n“We’ve got a guaranteed bronze but I’m tipping that color might change.” Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:02:23.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
