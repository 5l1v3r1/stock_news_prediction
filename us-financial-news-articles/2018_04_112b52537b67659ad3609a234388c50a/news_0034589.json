Flowers and messages of Justice at Last are left on the memorial stone to murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, at the place where he died in Eltham south-east London January 3, 2012. Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18 years after he was stabbed to death. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor \nHarry, who will marry Markle at Windsor on May 19, will read a message of support from his father, Prince Charles, the palace said on Twitter. \nThe service will take place on Monday 23 April at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in London. \nLawrenceâ€™s murder, an unprovoked attack by a gang of white youths as the 18-year-old waited at a bus stop, shocked Britain and exposed racism in its police force. \nTwo of the killers were found guilty almost 10 years after his death following years of campaigning by his parents to bring them to justice.
