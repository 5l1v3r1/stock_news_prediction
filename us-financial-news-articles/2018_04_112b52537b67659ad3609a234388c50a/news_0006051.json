Península Participações, Diniz’s family investment vehicle, did not have an immediate comment.\nAs part of the agreement with the funds, Luiz Fernando Furlan will take on the role of chairman until April 26, when a shareholders meeting will vote on new names to the board.\nDiniz will also get to appoint two members to the board as part of the negotiated solution with the funds, the newspaper said.
