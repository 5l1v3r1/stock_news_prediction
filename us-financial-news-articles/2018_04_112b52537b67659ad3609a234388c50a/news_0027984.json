Graff, CFA®, as the firm’s co-chief investment officer.\nGraff has worked side-by-side with Richard M. Burridge, Jr., RMB’s founding partner, CEO, and co-chief investment officer, for 16 years—predating the firm’s inception in 2005.\n“Bringing Chris into this role has been a long time coming, as he’s been my co-pilot through almost two full market cycles,” said Burridge. “I’ve never been more excited about the wide range of strategies we’re able to offer our clients. The growth of our investment platform has made the role of CIO a two-person job, especially since we have many more ideas to execute on behalf of our wide range of investors.”\nA founding member of RMB’s investment committee, Graff has overseen significant growth of the firm’s asset management capabilities and offerings. Over the past decade, RMB has developed new investment strategies in multiple asset classes, including fixed income, core domestic and international equities, opportunistic equities, absolute return, private equity, and real estate. The investment team now totals more than 80 professionals. The firm also has broadened its ability to deliver its strategies through multiple vehicles including mutual funds, separate accounts, and private partnerships.\n“I’m excited to officially step into this role alongside Dick,” said Graff. “We are doubling down on the vision we have shared since the beginning, which is to offer a distinct array of actively managed investment solutions that can capture untapped value for our clients.”\nGraff will continue to serve as managing director of asset management concurrently with his new role. He holds a bachelor’s degree in finance from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Graff is also a member of the CFA Society of Chicago and a CFA® charterholder.\nCFA® and Chartered Financial Analyst® are registered trademarks owned by CFA Institute.\nABOUT RMB ASSET MANAGEMENT\nRMB Asset Management specializes in long-term, concentrated, active investing strategies.
