REUTERS/Peter Andrews/Files Around 45 percent of the European Union’s output of greenhouse gases is regulated by the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc’s flagship policy to tackle global warming by charging for the right to emit carbon dioxide (CO2).\nThe ETS is expected to contribute around two thirds of the reductions needed to meet the EU’s target of slashing emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels.\nAccording to the analysts’ interpretation of the data, emissions totalled 1.756 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) last year for companies under the ETS excluding airlines, up 0.3 percent on the previous year.\nCapped emissions from power and heating generation fell by 1 percent, but the overall figure was lifted by a 1.8 percent rise in emissions from industry.\n“The European economy grew 2.5 percent last year. Solid growth in the European economy resulted in increased activity leading to higher emissions,” Ingvild Sorhus, lead carbon analyst at Thomson Reuters, said.\nThe ETS caps the emissions of around 12,000 power plants, factories and airlines, forcing them to surrender one carbon permit for every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted annually by the end of April of the following year.\nThe data published on Tuesday accounted for 94 percent of companies covered by the scheme, the analysts said.\nThe emissions figure is keenly watched by participants in the EU’s ETS as it provides a first indication of the supply and demand balance.\nThe benchmark EU carbon contract traded at 13.08 euros/tonne at 1140 GMT, down 1.5 percent from the previous day’s close.\nAfter further reviewing the preliminary data, the analysts forecast emissions from aviation rose 6.1 percent year-on-year in 2017 to 65.2 million tonnes, due to an increase in the number of flights, the analysts said.\nWith aviation included, total EU ETS emissions were 1.821 billion tonnes, up 0.5 percent year-on-year, the analysts said.\nUnder the ETS, airlines have to report emissions for all flights that begin and end within the EU.\nReporting by Susanna Twidale, editing by Jason Neely and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T16:51:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
