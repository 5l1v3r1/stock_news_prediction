It’s everything you’ll hear tonight,” said the “You Make It Easy” singer, who was later named entertainer of the year. \nIn the most anticipated performance of the night, Underwood emerged from five months of isolation following a fall at her home that required 40-50 stitches to her face. \nPerforming her new single “Cry Pretty,” her face seemed well recovered and Underwood was welcomed back with a long standing ovation that left the former “American Idol” winner overcome with emotion. \n“I’m still kinda shaky right now,” Underwood said afterward, fighting back tears. 53rd Academy of Country Music Awards - Photo Room - Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., 15/04/2018 - Jason Aldean poses backstage with his award for Entertainer of the Year. REUTERS/Steve Marcus \nMiranda Lambert was named female vocalist of the year for the 9th time in a row, and she also won best song for her heartbreaking single “Tin Man,” thought to be inspired by her 2015 divorce from country star Blake Shelton. \n“Thanks for sharing my broken heart with me,” said Lambert, accepting her award in front of an audience that included Shelton and his new girlfriend, pop singer Gwen Stefani. \nLambert also made ACM history by taking her all-time wins to 32, surpassing the record held by veteran duo Brooks & Dunn. \nOther winners on Sunday included Chris Stapleton for both male vocalist and album of the year for “From a Room: Vol. 1”; Old Dominion for vocal group of the year, and Brothers Osborne for vocal duo of the year. \nStapleton was not present because his wife was expecting twins. Show host Reba McEntire, accepting the award on his behalf, broke the news of their arrival. Slideshow (19 Images) \n“We just found out that those little rascals came a little bit early. Hot off the press, twin boys,” said McEntire.
