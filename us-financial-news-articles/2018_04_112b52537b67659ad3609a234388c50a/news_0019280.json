We are here for the long term and we are going to be supporting Jordan and the others who are shouldering a huge burden,” she said.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Officials say British aid money has helped to revamp schools and rehabilitation centres in Jordan, for the benefit of both Jordanians and Syrian refugees.\nAfter more than seven years of war, some 5 million people have fled to neighbouring states, including around 1.3 million to Jordan, and an estimated 6.3 million are displaced from their homes across Syria.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T22:22:35.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
