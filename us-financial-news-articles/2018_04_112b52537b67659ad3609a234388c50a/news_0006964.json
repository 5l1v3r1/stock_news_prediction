The closing of the agreement is expected on May 1, 2018.\nThe commercial tubular heat exchanger business with base in Alonte, Italy, and with focus on the refrigeration and air conditioning market, has been a part of Greenhouse since 2016. It was moved there, along with a few other selected product groups, to give it the best possible conditions to improve its performance. The strategy has proven to be successful and the commercial tubular heat exchanger business reported revenues of about SEK 120 million in 2017.\n\"We have seen a positive development of the commercial tubular heat exchanger business last year,\" says Tom Erixon, President and CEO of the Alfa Laval Group. \"However, under the ownership of the BITZER Group we are convinced the business will have even better opportunities to develop.\"\n\"I am delighted to be able to welcome Alfa Laval's shell-and-tube heat exchangers to the BITZER family.
