It’s uncertain if Jeff Bezos will be in attendance. \nComey and Bezos, of course, are frequent targets of Trump’s Twitter wrath. Friday morning, Trump complained via social media about Comey’s book and, once again, accused the former law enforcement official of leaking classified information. So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018 James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue? \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2018 \nAmazon (amzn) has been a target due to founder Jeff Bezos’ ownership of The Washington Post . Trump has accused the online retailer of unfair competition, claiming it is costing the U.S. Postal Service “ billions of dollars .” \nComey’s book is already a bestseller on Amazon.com, among other retailers. Macmillan, which published A Higher Loyalty ordered a production run of 850,000 copies to meet demand—more than five times the initial print run of Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury . \nTrump has not yet acknowledged Comey’s planned appearance at Amazon on social media or other forums.
