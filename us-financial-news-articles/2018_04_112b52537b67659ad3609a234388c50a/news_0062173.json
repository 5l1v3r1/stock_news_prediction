After Utah sliced what was once a 27-point deficit to 11 early in the fourth quarter, Harden restored order with three free throws, a 3-pointer and a second-chance basket of his own miss.\n“He’s a special player,” said Jazz coach Quin Snyder. “It’s hard to give credit to all the things that he does. He just impacts the game in so many mays. You have to try to make it harder for him.”\nClint Capela recorded a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds while PJ Tucker chipped in 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting, including 3-of-5 from behind the arc. Chris Paul tallied 17 points, six assists and four steals for the Rockets, who will host Game 2 on Wednesday night.\nDonovan Mitchell and Jae Crowder scored 21 points apiece for the Jazz, coming off a grueling, seven-game series against Oklahoma City that concluded late Friday. Joe Ingles added 15 points, six rebounds and five assists while Rudy Gobert totaled 11 points and nine boards but failed to impact the game defensively.\nThe first half offered a glimpse of the Rockets at their very best — Harden and Paul in particular. Paul masterfully orchestrated the offense in the opening quarter, finding teammates for a pair of assists while also uncovering crevices for his own shot. Paul scored nine points in the first.\nHarden was even more potent, converting a 3-pointer and driving layup in succession to push the lead to 26-15. By the close of the frame, Harden and Paul had combined for as many points (21) as Utah managed, with the Rockets carrying a 13-point lead into the second. They didn’t let up.\nWhen Capela followed a Harden 3-pointer with a finger roll after a hard cut to the basket, Houston led 49-29 at the 6:42 mark of the second quarter. Down the stretch of the half, Capela added a dunk before Harden and Tucker combined for three 3-pointers, the second corner trey from Tucker pushing the advantage to 64-37 with just over a minute remaining in the first half.\nHouston shot 53.5 percent (23 of 43) before the break, including a scorching 10-of-16 on threes. The Jazz mustered better energy in the second half, but the 27-point deficit proved too damaging.\n“We’re different,” Harden said afterward. “We’ve seen so many different defenses throughout this year that have prepared us for this moment.”\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-30T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:16:12.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
