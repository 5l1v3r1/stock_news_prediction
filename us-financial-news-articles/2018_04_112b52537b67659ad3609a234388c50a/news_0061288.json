(NASDAQ: SILC), a leading provider of high-performance networking and data infrastructure solutions, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Results\nRevenues for the first quarter of 2018 totalled $29.5 million, up 16% compared with $25.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss for the quarter totalled $1.4 million, or $(0.19) per share (basic and diluted), compared with net income of $2.6 million, or $0.35 per share (basic and diluted), for the first quarter of 2017. The loss derives from the Company's recording of a $5 million write-off related to the program aborted by its top-10 cloud customer.\nOn a non-GAAP basis (as described and reconciled below), non-GAAP net income for the period totalled $4.3 million, or $0.56 per diluted share ($0.57 per basic share), up 12% compared with $3.9 million, or $0.52 per share (basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2017.\nGuidance for the Second Quarter\nManagement projects that revenues for the second quarter of 2018 will total $27 to $28 million.\nComments of Management\nMr. Shaike Orbach, Silicom's President and CEO, commented, \"During the first quarter, we were disappointed that our top-10 Cloud client aborted the massive program that promised to be such a large revenue generator for us. While this reality presents us with short-term operational and growth-related challenges, our growth strategy remains intact. This is well demonstrated by the major win that we announced today with a Tier 1 US telco. We believe that this strategy will continue to generate more design wins and lead to new engagements which, over time, will compensate for the loss of the Cloud deal.\"\nMr. Orbach continued, \"In fact, we are very excited by this new SD-WAN-related win, which, together with other important new developments, demonstrates the fundamental resilience of our growth model. In addition to this new win, during the quarter, we also achieved a new Cyber Security Design Win, another major NFV-related Virtual CPE (vCPE) Design Win from another major telco is around the corner and additional similar opportunities are accumulating. Since each of these telco-related deals is expected to ramp to tens of millions of dollars per year, winning any combination will have a significant positive impact on our revenues and profits. The response that we are receiving from these global giants confirms that they view us as a strategic 'performance partner' that brings the products, development capabilities and support they need to cope with today's challenging high-speed, high-volume, connectivity demands.\"\nMr. Orbach concluded, \"Our sales generation engine is running smoothly and our pipeline is becoming deeper and longer by the day. With a winning value proposition, major new wins expected for both the near-term and the long-term and endless opportunities, we expect to return to strong growth once the new wins that we project outpace the cancelled Cloud deal.\"\nConference Call Details\nSilicom's Management will host an interactive conference today, April 30 th , at 9am Eastern Time (6am Pacific Time, 4pm Israel Time) to review and discuss the results.\nTo participate, please call one of the following teleconferencing numbers.
