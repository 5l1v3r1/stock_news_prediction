This will lead to whiteout conditions, making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel,” it said.\nIce and snow covered roadways across the region, forcing several interstate highways to remain closed early on Saturday.\nThe storm was expected to dump almost a foot of snow in northern Wisconsin and Michigan and cause wind gusts of 65 miles per hour (105 km) and unseasonably cold temperatures in Texas, the NWS said.\nIt could break April snowfall records in parts of the northern Midwest, Weather.com said.\nThe system was also forecast to create a mix of snow and ice that is likely to topple power lines and trees, causing power outages in the upper Midwest.\nOn Friday, the system produced 10 reports of tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas, the weather service said. Four people were injured and 160 buildings damaged in a possible tornado in northwest Arkansas, local media reported.\nAbout 115,000 customers in the Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas while an additional 12,000 were without power in Michigan early on Saturday, the website Poweroutage.us reported.\nEditing by Helen Popper\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T14:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T14:50:02.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
