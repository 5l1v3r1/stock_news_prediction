Net sales jumped more than 8% to $2.6 billion.\nAnalysts polled by Thomson Reuters had forecast adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share on $2.58 billion in revenue.\n“Domestic steel consumption remained strong from the automotive and construction sectors, while energy and general industrial demand continued to grow,” President and Chief Executive Officer Mark D. Millett said in prepared remarks.\nThe stock has risen less than 1% to $47 in after-hours trading Wednesday. Shares are up 45% in the last year.\nSteel Dynamics, which has facilities located in the U.S. and in Mexico, produces steel products, liquid pig iron, and processes and sells ferrous and nonferrous scrap.\nU.S. steel prices have scored a lift from President Donald Trump’s plan announced in March to tack a 25% tariff on steel imports, a move likely to keep prices high, and domestic demand strong, this year.\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:50:09.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
