(the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PFLT) (TASE:PFLT) announced today that on April 5, 2018, its board of directors approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (which includes the Small Business Credit Availability Act). As a result, the Company’s asset coverage requirements applicable to senior securities will be reduced from 200% to 150%, effective as of April 5, 2019.\n“The Company has generated an excellent track record over the last seven years investing in lower risk first lien senior secured floating rate assets. We believe that such assets represent an appropriate risk profile that can be prudently leveraged under the revised statute to provide attractive returns for our investors. Our successful operation of the PennantPark Senior Secured Loan Fund I LLC joint venture is evidence of this strategy,” said Arthur H. Penn, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Over the next year, we look forward to working closely with our lenders, bondholders, rating agencies and stockholders to discuss our roadmap into the future.”\nABOUT PENNANTPARK FLOATING RATE CAPITAL LTD.\nPennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. is a business development company which primarily invests in U.S. middle-market private companies in the form of floating rate senior secured loans, including first lien secured debt, second lien secured debt and subordinated debt.
