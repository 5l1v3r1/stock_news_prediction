In April, the company announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for priority review its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Opdivo to treat patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) whose disease has progressed after two or more prior lines of therapy.

( link ) CheckMate -568: First presentation of data from a Phase 2 study evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy in treatment naïve patients with advanced NSCLC. Results demonstrated Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus low-dose Yervoy (1mg/kg) identified high tumor mutational burden of ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb) as an effective cutoff for selecting which patients were most likely to respond to first-line treatment of Opdivo plus Yervoy regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. CheckMate -078: First presentation of data from the Phase 3 study evaluating Opdivo monotherapy versus docetaxel in a predominantly Chinese patient population with previously treated advanced NSCLC.

In February, the company and Nektar Therapeutics announced a global strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead Immuno-Oncology program, NKTR-214. The companies will jointly develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\nBristol-Myers Squibb is decreasing its 2018 GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.00 - $3.15 to $2.70 - $2.80 and increasing its non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $3.15 - $3.30 to $3.35 - $3.45. Both GAAP and non-GAAP guidance assume current exchange rates. Key revised 2018 GAAP and non-GAAP line-item guidance assumptions are:\nWorldwide revenues increasing in the mid-single digits. Research and development expenses increasing in the low-single digits for GAAP. An effective tax rate between 17% and 18% for both GAAP and non-GAAP.\nThe financial guidance for 2018 excludes the impact of any potential future strategic acquisitions and divestitures, and any specified items that have not yet been identified and quantified. The non-GAAP 2018 guidance also excludes other specified items as discussed under “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.” Details reconciling adjusted non-GAAP amounts with the amounts reflecting specified items are provided in supplemental materials available on the company’s website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP earnings and related EPS information, that are adjusted to exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses and other specified items that are evaluated on an individual basis. These items are adjusted after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including restructuring costs, accelerated depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, R&D charges in connection with the acquisition or licensing of third party intellectual property rights, divestiture and equity investment gains or losses, upfront payments from out-licensed assets, pension charges, legal and other contractual settlements and debt redemption gains or losses, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Non-GAAP information is intended to portray the results of our baseline performance, supplement or enhance management, analysts and investors overall understanding of our underlying financial performance and facilitate comparisons among current, past and future periods. For example, non-GAAP earnings and EPS information is an indication of our baseline performance before items that are considered by us to not be reflective of our ongoing results. In addition, this information is among the primary indicators we use as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets and planning and forecasting for future periods. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted EPS prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nStatement on Cautionary Factors\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding, among other things, statements relating to goals, plans and projections regarding the company’s financial position, results of operations, market position, product development and business strategy.
