So that suggests the market is a little bit skeptical,\" he added.\nThis earnings season has been robust, with close to 80 percent of the 276 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday topping analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S . Earnings in the first quarter are projected to rise 24.6 percent compared to a year ago.\nLargely upbeat earnings releases have buoyed U.S. stocks, although markets stateside finished little changed on Friday.\n\"This is a tricky phase, where the sentiment, because of the trade war, affected the markets, and the markets may start to affect the real economy, so I think a little bit of caution is warranted here,\" Kumada said.\nMarkets 'right to be cautious' Amid fading geopolitical tensions on the back of a historic bilateral meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last week, Kumada pointed out that uncertainty could remain.\n\"Denuclearization is easier said than done. I think the market is right to be cautious here, even though this is a very positive development that opens up a lot of new opportunities as well,\" he added.\nAnd while there had been \"lots of presidents holding hands\" in the previous week, Kumada said, alluding to the inter-Korea summit and French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to Washington , the recent easing in tensions had come on the back of an escalation in geopolitical rhetoric.\n\"I think the market is basically pricing in a higher level of uncertainty in possible outcomes,\" he said.\n\"The outcomes could be very good, such as permanent peace and denuclearization in an agreement on North Korea, or they could also be very bad, such as going back to the belligerent situation that we had before,\" Kumada added.\nGiven sources of uncertainty in the markets, Kumada said he had a \"very high cash quota,\" but also remained slightly overweight on equities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T08:33:48.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
