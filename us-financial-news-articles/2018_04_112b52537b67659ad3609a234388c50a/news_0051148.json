It has a virtual monopoly on petroleum imports and retail sales, and owns and operates the country’s main refineries.\n‘BURDEN ON PERTAMINA’ The company estimates it would need $115 billion over the next decade to realise Widodo’s plans to make Indonesia self-sufficient in energy.\nManik had said in December a single price nationwide for “Premium” (RON 88) gasoline and “Solar” diesel could cost Pertamina losses of 3.8 trillion rupiah ($274 million) a year.\n“This is a burden on Pertamina (and) so far there has been no discussion of compensation,” he told parliament.\nThe government then added to Pertamina’s difficulties this year, saying fuel prices would not change until after the 2019 elections, and extended price controls to all retail fuels.\nWhile Pertamina’s growing upstream output will benefit from higher crude prices, unless retail fuel prices are increased, its “superior” downstream earnings will be unsustainable, S&P said in a ratings note on Tuesday.\n‘FOR THE PEOPLE’ Fuel prices are politically sensitive in Indonesia. More than 160 million people, around 60 percent of the population, live on $5.50 a day or less, according to recent World Bank data, leaving them vulnerable to price swings.\n“People’s purchasing power has to be number one,” Ego Syahrial, then acting oil and gas director general, said at the same December hearing where Manik spoke.\nSince January 2016, benchmark Brent crude prices have nearly doubled, while net-oil-importer Indonesia has not raised fuel prices, forcing heavy losses on Pertamina.\nSoutheast Asia’s largest economy grew 5.1 percent in 2017, its best pace in four years, but consumption - the biggest contributor to the economy - has remained sluggish. That’s a concern for Widodo, who is seeking re-election in 2019.\nState Owned Enterprise Minister Soemarno promised in March to enforce government fuel rules, telling Rakyat Merdeka newspaper in an interview she was “saddened” by Pertamina’s complaints on the matter.\n“We are doing this for the people,” she said, noting that other state enterprises such as power utility PLN had not complained about rules impacting profitability.\nAfter agreeing to dismiss Manik and four other directors, the head of Pertamina’s board of commissioners acknowledged the company’s financial dilemma.\nThe new leadership has been instructed to study “the changes in costs and the latest increases in (crude) prices,” which were impacting Pertamina’s performance, Board Chairman Tanri Abeng told reporters on Friday.\n($1 = 13,890 rupiah)\nReporting by Fergus Jensen, Agustinus Beo Da Costa and the JAKARTA Bureau; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T04:59:57.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
