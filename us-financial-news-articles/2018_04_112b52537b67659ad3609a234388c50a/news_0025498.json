Alex Caruso had 15 points and Brook Lopez 14 for the Lakers, who finished the season 35-47, a nine-game improvement over last season.\nPayton, Caruso and Lopez hit three 3-pointers apiece to help the Lakers outscore the Clippers 51-18 from beyond the arc.\nThe losing season was the Lakers’ fifth straight.\nTobias Harris had a team-high 23 points for the Clippers, who finished the season losing six of their last seven.\nHarris, acquired in the in-season Blake Griffin trade with Detroit, hit nine of his 15 shots.\nBoban Marjanovic recorded a 12-point, 10-rebound double-double, while Montrezl Harrell totaled 15 points, Sindarius Thornwell 12 and Sam Dekker 10 for the Clippers, who finished 42-40, their seventh consecutive winning season.\nThe Clippers won nine fewer games than last year’s club that made the playoffs for the sixth consecutive time.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T13:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:29:26.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
