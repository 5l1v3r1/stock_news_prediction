Photo: Adrienne Grunwald for The Wall Street Journal When Vera Konig asked a tennis pro how to improve her game, he told her to swap her racket for boxing gloves. “If anyone else had suggested kickboxing, I would have laughed,” she says. She’s been hooked on the combat sport for 20 years. Now, at 75, she credits twice-weekly sessions for keeping her competitive on the court.\nMs. Konig, a retired college professor based in New York City, describes herself as a lifelong athlete. She grew up skiing, running, swimming and hiking. In her 40s, she started working with a tennis pro. She caught on quickly, but kickboxing elevated her game. “When I added the kickboxing, I saw great improvement to my upper-body strength, balance and agility,” she says.\nSeven years ago Ms. Konig started competing in National Senior Women’s Tennis Association-sanctioned tournaments. Last year she found a partner her age and she now competes in singles and doubles. “It’s not easy to find someone my age who wants to make that commitment and who will work to develop a partnership,” she says.\nThe pair meet with a tennis pro once a week, but Ms. Konig hasn’t convinced her partner, Jo Shepoiser, to try kickboxing yet. In March, they placed third in their age group at the Barbara Cooper Cup tournament in Winter Park, Fla. Ms. Konig won her singles age category. They are training for the USTA National Women’s Grass Court Championships July 9 to 15 in Forest Hills, N.Y.\nTrainer Jimmy Fusaro works with Ms. Konig at Aerospace High Performance Center in New York City.

Their hourlong workout starts with a warm-up on the punching bags. He then holds up mitts as targets and calls punches—jabs, hooks, uppercuts—for her to throw. She might do squats on a balance board to work her core and legs and push-ups on a balance board to work her shoulders and core. She does upper-body work, like a dumbbell fly, on a stability ball for an added balance challenge. She then might hold the handles of a TheraBand and mimic the twisting trunk motion used in tennis to activate her core.\nMs. Konig meets her tennis pro once a week for a 90-minute or two-hour session. “We focus on techniques, like hitting ground strokes deep, as well as game tactics and strategy,” she says. “I like that he is always challenging me. It’s the only way I’ll get better.” She and Ms. Shepoiser meet a pro for a two-hour doubles clinic once a week.\nMs. Konig had both of her knees replaced in 2015. “I promised my pro I’d be back in eight weeks, and I was,” she says. “The rehab made me rethink my approach to stretching, something I now do every morning to help my mobility.” Her doctor prescribed the recumbent bike, which she rides 30 minutes twice or three times a week. She also does lower-body exercises like the leg press machine.\nMs. Konig uses poles to help steady her while she squats on a balance board. Photo: Adrienne Grunwald for The Wall Street Journal The Diet Ms. Konig’s breakfast ritual involves a fruit smoothie, coffee, toast with butter and peanut butter and the newspaper. “I only eat fresh bread,” she says. “No Wonder Bread or packaged stuff.” Lunch might be a BLT, grilled Swiss and bacon or a salami sandwich. She often snacks on raw vegetables. “I love fennel,” she says. She also loves to cook. On weekends she makes pasta from scratch. “My husband and I like to share a bottle of wine over a good meal,” she says. “We wake up and discuss what to have for dinner.”\nGo-to dishes are steak with raspberry sauce or pasta with shrimp and clams. If she’s craving something sweet, she’ll have a ginger ale.\nThe Gear & Cost Dues at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills are $6,000 a year. From October through April, the club charges additional fees to use the indoor courts. Ms. Konig buys a pass for $800 to have unlimited court time during indoor season. She pays $100 an hour for lessons with her tennis pro. She occasionally shares the lesson and cost. Her Wilson Burn 100ULS racket cost $180. Her Adidas tennis sneakers cost $130 and she buys Adidas tennis apparel. Her kickboxing sessions cost $80 each and she paid $40 for her boxing gloves and wraps.\nMs. Konig works with a tennis pro twice a week at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, N.Y.

Tennis and combat sports have a lot in common, says Rex Miller, a Thai boxing and tennis coach based in Durham, N.C. Both are meditative and repetitive but extremely physical, he says.\n“Boxing emphasizes the same skill sets that a tennis player needs: quickness, agility, proper footwork, power—but with agility—and a heavy dose of stamina,” he says.\nThat’s not the only parallel, he says. “Balance, turning your hips, finishing or following through, then recovering to the ready position for the next challenge occur in both sports,” Mr. Miller says. Tennis and combat sports require players to play both offense and defense. Strategy is also similar.\n“You have to know what kind of player you are, how you can best win points,” he says. Boxing can also help tennis players learn how to react to stress and stay focused.\n“One of the biggest obstacles to tennis success is not letting go of a bad outcome, whether it be a poorly played point or a distraction on the sidelines,” he says. “When you make a mistake in tennis, you have the time until the next point to dwell on it. In kickboxing, when you make a mistake and get popped, you are forced to move on immediately because there is another strike coming in one second.”\nTennis greats, including Caroline Wozniacki and Maria Sharapova, have been known to mix fight-based training into their workouts .\nMs. Konig says kickboxing has improved her upper-body strength, balance and agility.
