He said he was interested in using the new platform.\nU.S. advertisers are expected to spend $60.9 billion this year on Facebook and Google, an 86 percent increase from the $32.8 billion they spent three years ago, according to research firm eMarketer.\nMeanwhile advertisers’ spending on TV ads is expected to be $69.9 billion, a 1.45 percent increase from three years ago.\nThe trial has seen a parade of witnesses testifying about how the merger would affect them. Executives from smaller pay TV companies talked about how important it was to have access to Time Warner’s movies and television shows.\nBoth the Justice Department and AT&T called on economists to defend their points of view.\nAmong them were Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley, who said the $84.5 billion deal would cost American consumers some $286 annually in higher prices, while Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, said it would mean a benefit of 52 cents per month to every pay TV subscriber.\nThe trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month.
