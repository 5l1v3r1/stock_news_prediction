They may have been on the weak side but fit in with a trend of growth in excess of potential.” \n“We’ve been growing above potential so it’s natural for growth to slow over time,” he source added. \nThe ECB declined to comment. \nWhile the euro zone economy has been expanding for 20 straight quarters, output figures, PMI readings and sentiment indicators suggest growth may have slowed to around 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent in the first quarter from 0.6 percent three months earlier. \nECB President Mario Draghi highlighted the bloc’s robust growth on Friday, arguing that the key risks are external while domestic growth drivers are intact. \n“Notwithstanding the latest economic indicators, which suggest that the growth cycle may have peaked, the growth momentum is expected to continue,” Draghi said in Washington. \n“Downside risks continue to be related primarily to global factors, including rising protectionism,” Draghi said. \n“The latter may have already had some negative impact on global sentiment indicators. In this context, preserving free and open trade that is underpinned by multilateral cooperation is crucial to foster a favourable global economic environment,” he added. \nThe ECB will next meet on April 26. The sources said no substantial policy change is expected at that meeting, with only marginal tweaks in the policy language likely. \nMore substantial decisions on the future of asset buys will be coming in June and July as the bond purchases are now scheduled to expire by the end of September. \nThe central bank has long predicted that growth would slow in the coming years, to 2.4 percent this year and then to 1.9 percent next year.
