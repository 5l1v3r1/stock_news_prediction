Integrating it into the wider EU law would make it an EU, rather than just a euro zone institution.\nMost euro zone governments oppose it on concerns of losing full control over the funds’ 500 billion euro lending capacity.\n“The proposed regulation is an important first step ... (but) further reforms of the ESM will be essential,” the ECB said.\nThe ESM should be provided with the financial instruments needed to fulfill its tasks and should have the capacity for swift and credible decision-making procedures.\n“In particular, the precautionary financial assistance instruments, with adequate conditionality, should be improved in order to better contribute to crisis prevention,” the ECB said.\nSupervising Europe’s biggest banks, the ECB said it also supported efforts for the reformed ESM to provide a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, which is tasked with resolving failing lenders.\nSuch a backstop, which should be in place no later than the end of 2023, could help the Resolution Fund provide liquidity support to failing banks to ensure they are wound down at the lowest possible cost.\n“Such liquidity support presents a far smaller risk that losses will be incurred, and is by definition temporary in nature,” the ECB said.\nSuch a backstop would still shield the taxpayer as costs could be recouped through ex post levies on the financial industry, the ECB said.\nRepeating a key objection to the reform proposal, the ECB said the ESM should not be renamed as European Monetary Fund as it will have no monetary function since monetary policy is the task of the ECB.
