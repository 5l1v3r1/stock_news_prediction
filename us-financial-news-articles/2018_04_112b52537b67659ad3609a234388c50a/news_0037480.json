We have always fully complied with the checks of customs officers at the port of Antwerp,” a spokesman for Danmar Logistics said. Under Belgian law a defendant is not required to enter a plea.\nWestern countries say the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad has used chemical weapons, including sarin, against its own population, most recently on the town of Douma on April 7. The Syrian government denies this.\nWidely used as an industrial solvent and also in some medical products, isopropanol, or rubbing alcohol, is one of two key ingredients for sarin. Since 2013 companies need a license to export chemicals to Syria.\nBelgium’s finance ministry, which oversees customs, said it was awaiting the court’s decision and could not give further details.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:44:16.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
