Price controls would also be thinkable.”\nBNetzA has started a market investigation, results of which could be expected next year, the FAZ reported.\nVodafone confirmed in February it was in talks with John Malone’s Liberty Global about buying some of the cable company’s assets in the continental European countries where they both operate.\nDeutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges has clashed with Vodafone’s Vittorio Colao, suggesting that the proposed deal would not stand up to anti-trust scrutiny.\nReporting by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T21:27:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
