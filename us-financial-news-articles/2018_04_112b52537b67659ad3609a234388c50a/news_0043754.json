PwC declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\nFacebook has been under scrutiny from lawmakers across the world since disclosing that the personal information of 87 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, a Britain-based firm hired by Donald Trump for his 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.\n\"We remain strongly committed to protecting people's information. We appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have,\" Facebook Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman told Reuters in an emailed statement on Thursday.\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg appeared for hearings in front of U.S. lawmakers last week and is currently facing pressure from European Union lawmakers to come to Europe and shed light on the data breach involving Cambridge Analytica.
