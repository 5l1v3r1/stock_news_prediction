REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Credit Suisse has received a license from the Securities and Exchange Commission and approval from the central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, to set up a representative office for its wealth management business, it said in a statement.\nOther global private banking majors are also tapping Southeast Asian wealth through an onshore presence. Switzerland’s Julius Baer ( BAER.S ) said last month it was forming a joint venture in Thailand.\nTotal household wealth in the Philippines grew by 10.7 percent a year since 2000 to reach $662 billion in 2017, according to Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Report 2017.\nThe number of ultra-high net worth individuals with more than $50 million in net wealth grew 13 percent over the same period to over 400, the report said, adding this is likely to expand by more than 10 percent a year in the next five years.\nIn the Philippines, Credit Suisse’s existing services include advisory on capital raising, liability management, M&A, and structured finance. In 2011, it set up an onshore brokerage in the country covering equity research, sales, and trading.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T06:59:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
