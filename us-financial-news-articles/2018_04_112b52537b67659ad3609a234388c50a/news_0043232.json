A beneficial owner ultimately has significant control of, or owns, a corporate entity.\nThe U.S., Australia and China are the only nations in the group to have improved from \"weak\" to \"average\" legal frameworks combating financial corruption.\nCanada and South Korea lag far behind all other G-20 countries.\n\"The glacial pace of progress by the federal, provincial and territorial governments is an invitation to the corrupt, tax evaders and money launderers to continue 'snow-washing' their dirty money in Canada.\" warned Transparency International Executive Director Alesia Nahirny. \"Meanwhile, Canada's reputation deteriorates further with only words to show and no concrete accomplishments.\"\nThe Panama Papers saw the unprecedented leak of 11.5 million documents from offshore law firm Mossak Fonseca in April 2016. The leak raised questions over tax avoidance from prominent individuals such as the late father of former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, to secret offshore deals worth $2 billion with links to Vladimir Putin .\nMossack Fonseca operated tax havens in Switzerland, Cyprus and, most notably, in the Caribbean.
