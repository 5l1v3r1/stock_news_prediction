(the “Company” or “Meridian”) (NASDAQ:EBSB), the holding company for East Boston Savings Bank (the “Bank”), announced net income of $12.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $9.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $9.2 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflects a reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018 related to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017, following a $7.1 million charge in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 related to enactment of the Tax Act. The Company’s return on average assets was 0.90% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.70% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 0.82% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s return on average equity was 7.35% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 5.56% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 6.03% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nRichard J. Gavegnano, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “I am pleased to report record first quarter net income of $12.0 million for 2018, up $2.8 million, or 30%, from the prior record set in the first quarter of 2017. This increase reflects a 10% rise in pre-tax income, including growth of 19% in net interest income. Our pre-tax income would have increased 28% from the first quarter of 2017 if the $691,000 loss from the decline in fair value of equity securities and gains on sale of securities for both periods as reported in non-interest income were excluded. New accounting rules require changes in the fair value of our equity securities portfolio to be recorded in net income beginning in 2018.”\nMr. Gavegnano added, “Our net income was also significantly enhanced due to the decline in income tax expense of 29% from the first quarter of 2017 reflecting the Tax Act’s lower federal income tax rate. We believe the lower federal tax rate will provide strong support for our long-term growth plans.”\nThe Company’s net interest income was $39.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $519,000 or 1.3%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $6.5 million, or 19.5%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The interest rate spread and net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis were 2.92% and 3.16%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2.97% and 3.20%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 2.99% and 3.20%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increases in net interest income were primarily due to loan growth, partially offset by increases in the average balances of total deposits and borrowings and the cost of funds for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the respective prior periods. The interest rate spread and net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were adjusted to reflect the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nTotal interest and dividend income increased to $52.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $1.1 million, or 2.2%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $10.2 million, or 24.5%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in the Company’s average loan balances to $4.777 billion. The Company’s yield on loans was 4.29% on a tax-equivalent basis for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down 10 basis points from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and up six basis points from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s yield on interest-earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis was 4.11% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, unchanged from the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and up 13 basis points from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The yields on loans and interest-earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflect the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21% from 35%.\nTotal interest expense increased to $12.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $607,000, or 5.3%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $3.8 million, or 44.7%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense on deposits increased to $10.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $409,000, or 4.0%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $3.1 million, or 41.6%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to growth in average total deposits to $4.116 billion and increases in the cost of average total deposits to 1.04% from 1.00% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 0.85% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Interest expense on borrowings increased to $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up $198,000, or 13.7%, from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $662,000, or 67.6%, from the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to growth in average total borrowings to $521.1 million and an increase in the cost of average borrowings to 1.28% from 1.18% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 1.20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s total cost of funds was 1.06% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, up four basis points from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 18 basis points from the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nMr. Gavegnano noted, “Our net loan growth was $278 million, or 6%, for the quarter ending March 31, 2018, a new first quarter record, and $880 million, or 22%, since March 31, 2017, which continues to drive our net interest income growth. As expected, the decline in our net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis to 3.16% resulted from the reduction in our federal income tax rate under the Tax Act. Without this change in our tax rate, our yields on loans and interest earning assets, the interest rate spread and the net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis would have been five basis points higher than reported . Our net interest margin without tax-equivalent adjustments increased to 3.11% from 3.08% from the first quarter of last year, despite the increase of 18 basis points in our cost of funds to 1.06%.”\nThe Company recognized a provision for loan losses of $2.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a credit of $715,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and a provision of $1.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $47.5 million or 0.96% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $45.2 million or 0.97% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and $41.8 million or 1.03% of total loans at March 31, 2017. The changes in the provision and the allowance for loan losses coverage ratio were based on management’s assessment of loan portfolio growth and composition changes, declines in historical charge-off trends, reduced levels of problem loans and other improvements in asset quality trends.\nNet recoveries totaled $114,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, or 0.01% of average loans outstanding on an annualized basis compared to net recoveries of $257,000, or 0.02% of average loans outstanding on an annualized basis, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and net charge-offs of $3,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, or 0.00% of average loans on an annualized basis.\nNon-accrual loans were $8.0 million, or 0.16% of total loans outstanding, at March 31, 2018; down $332,000, or 4.0%, from December 31, 2017; and down $5.7 million, or 41.3%, from March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets were $8.0 million, or 0.15% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $8.4 million, or 0.16% of total assets, at December 31, 2017, and $13.7 million, or 0.30% of total assets, at March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income was $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down $6.4 million, or 73.2%, from $8.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and down $1.7 million, or 42.7%, from $4.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The declines in non-interest income were primarily due to decreases in the gain on sales of securities, net, of $5.9 million from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $1.4 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In addition, a $691,000 loss on equity securities, net, was recognized as non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018 related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.\nNon-interest expenses were $24.7 million, or 1.86% of average assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $23.9 million, or 1.85% of average assets for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $21.9 million, or 1.94% of average assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest expenses increased $820,000, or 3.4%, compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to increases of $1.6 million in salaries and employee benefits, $741,000 in occupancy and equipment and $152,000 in data processing, partially offset by a $1.7 million decrease in merger and acquisition related expenses. As compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, non-interest expenses increased $2.8 million, or 12.9%, primarily due to increases of $1.7 million in salaries and employee benefits, $516,000 in occupancy and equipment and $304,000 in data processing. The increases in salaries and employee benefits expenses reflect annual increases in employee compensation and health benefits during the first quarter of 2018. In addition, the increases in salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses and data processing include costs associated with the expansion of our branch and support staff, including two branches acquired from Meetinghouse Bank on December 29, 2017, one new branch opened and four new branch openings planned for later in 2018. The Company’s efficiency ratio, which excludes merger and acquisition expenses, was 57.62% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 52.61% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 61.02% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nMr. Gavegnano said, “The increase in our efficiency ratio from the fourth quarter of 2017 was largely due to annual employee salary and benefit increases that went in effect and overhead expenses for the branches acquired in the Meetinghouse Bank acquisition in late December. The increases in non-interest expenses also reflect the Bank’s raise in its minimum wage to $15 per hour effective January 1, 2018, the opening of our 34th full service location in Boston’s Cleveland Circle neighborhood during March 2018 and preparations for the opening of new branches in Boston’s Brigham Circle and in Lynnfield, Burlington and West Peabody later in the year. As we have demonstrated in the past, we believe investments such as these in our team and toward expansion of our footprint will enhance our market share and future financial performance.”\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, reflecting an effective tax rate of 21.6%, compared to $15.9 million, or an effective tax rate of 63.7%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $4.7 million, or an effective tax rate of 33.6%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The reductions in the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 reflect the decrease in the statutory federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. In addition, the income tax provision and effective tax rate for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, reflected a $7.1 million charge related to enactment of the Tax Act that required the Company to revalue its net deferred tax assets as of December 22, 2017. This charge may be subject to adjustment in future periods.\nTotal assets were $5.461 billion at March 31, 2018, up $161.2 million, or 3.0%, from $5.299 billion at December 31, 2017 and $822.0 million, or 17.7%, from $4.639 billion at March 31, 2017. Net loans were $4.900 billion at March 31, 2018, up $277.5 million, or 6.0%, from December 31, 2017, and $879.6 million, or 21.9%, from March 31, 2017. The net increase in loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to increases of $189.2 million in commercial real estate loans, $79.3 million in multi-family loans, $10.4 million in one- to four-family loans and $7.5 million in commercial and industrial loans. Cash and due from banks was $316.4 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $86.3 million, or 21.4% from December 31, 2017. Securities, at fair value, were $34.2 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.1 million, or 10.8%, from $38.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $4.189 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $81.5 million, or 2.0%, from $4.108 billion at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $532.7 million, or 14.6%, from $3.657 billion at March 31, 2017. Core deposits, which exclude certificates of deposit, increased $43.7 million, or 1.6%, during the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $2.781 billion, or 66.4% of total deposits. Total borrowings were $582.6 million, up $69.1 million, or 13.5%, from December 31, 2017 and up $247.7 million, or 74.0%, from March 31, 2017.\nTotal stockholders’ equity increased $9.2 million, or 1.4%, to $655.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $646.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was primarily due to net income of $12.0 million and $2.0 million related to stock-based compensation plans, partially offset by the repurchase of 100,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at a total cost of $2.0 million, and dividends of $0.05 per share totaling $2.6 million. Stockholders’ equity to assets was 12.01% at March 31, 2018, compared to 12.20% at December 31, 2017. Book value per share increased to $12.13 at March 31, 2018 from $11.96 at December 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share increased to $11.70 at March 31, 2018 from $11.54 at December 31, 2017. Market price per share decreased $0.45 or 2.2%, to $20.15 at March 31, 2018 from $20.60 at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company and the Bank continued to exceed all regulatory capital requirements.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 100,000 shares of its stock at an average price of $19.96 per share. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had repurchased 2,159,611 shares of its stock at an average price of $14.00 per share, or 78.9% of the 2,737,334 shares authorized for repurchase under the Company’s repurchase program adopted in August 2015.\nMeridian Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for East Boston Savings Bank.
