Trump has repeatedly denied that he either colluded or obstructed justice. \nHe condemned the raid against Cohen as a \"disgrace\" and claimed it was a violation of attorney-client privilege. \nExposure of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, on which Trump is heard bragging about grabbing women without their consent, caused a sensation and led to speculation that it would doom his candidacy. \n\"I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the p----. You can do anything,\" Trump told Bush on the tape. As the campaign was headed into the home stretch, Trump recorded a video in which he apologized for making the remarks. \nIt was already known that FBI agents seized records relating to a $130,000 payment that Cohen made porn star Stormy Daniels three weeks after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape came to light, and shortly before Election Day. \nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said that she was paid that money in exchange for her agreement to remain silent about an affair she had with Trump that began in 2006. The White House has denied such an affair. \nFBI agents were also looking for documents in Cohen's possession related to payments made to another woman who claims she had an affair with Trump, Playboy model Karen McDougal. \nStephen Ryan, Cohen's attorney, told CNBC on Wednesday that he was making no statement on the case. \n\"Access Hollywood,\" which is an entertainment news show, is now known as \"Access.\" It is aired by NBCUniversal Television, which like CNBC is a division of NBC Universal. \nBush was fired from his job at NBC's \"Today\" Show after the tape with Trump came to light. \nBush told CNBC on Wednesday that he was unaware of the Times story about FBI agents being interested in the tape during their raid of Cohen. \n\"I have not been contacted\" by federal investigators, Bush said. \nCNBC has reached out for comment from both NBC Entertainment and \"Access.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T23:09:58.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
