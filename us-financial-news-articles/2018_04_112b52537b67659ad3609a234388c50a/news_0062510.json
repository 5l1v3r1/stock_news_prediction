The issue consists of secondary shares.\nVinhomes is majority-owned by Vingroup, the country’s biggest conglomerate, which operates in real estate, education, healthcare, entertainment, retailing and automobile manufacturing sectors.\nRoadshows for the issue kicked off in Hong Kong on Monday, followed by London, New York, Singapore and Boston, the term sheet showed. The shares are set to be priced on May 7 and expected to be listed on May 17.\nReporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T13:14:54.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
