The stock has more than halved in value since the start of the year.\nIts U.S.-listed shares were briefly halted from trading due to the spike, but then resumed.\nA spokeswoman at Elliott Management declined to comment. Micro Focus was not immediately available for comment.\nReporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Alasdair Pal/Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T17:13:38.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
