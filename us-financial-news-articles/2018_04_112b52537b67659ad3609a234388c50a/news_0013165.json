Parts of it are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, besides the Philippines.\nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday flew to China for the Boao Forum for Asia, and will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday.\nLast month, the Philippines identified two areas in the South China Sea where joint exploration for oil and gas may be undertaken with China.\nBut any potential deals between Manila and Beijing should be agreed with a company and not the Chinese government, the presidential spokesman said.\nThe idea of joint development dates from 1986, but disputes and the sovereignty issue have kept it from materializing.\nIn 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled that portions of the contested areas were part of the Philippines’ 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone, and Manila had sovereign rights to resources there. China refuses to recognize the ruling.\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Martin Petty and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T11:25:33.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
