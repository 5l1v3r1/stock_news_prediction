(NYSE:HRB) today released its preliminary U.S. tax results, which reflect overall tax return volume growth compared to the prior year. For fiscal year 2018 through April 19, 19.9 million returns were prepared by or through H&R Block in the U.S., a 2.6% increase over fiscal year 2017.\n“Our goal this fiscal year was to continue improving our client trajectory, which we achieved, with growth in DIY and improved performance in Assisted,” said Jeff Jones, H&R Block’s president and chief executive officer. “Based on these results, we expect to deliver revenue growth and margins consistent with our previously provided outlook.”\nThe improvement in Assisted resulted from the company’s strong promotional offerings which included an enhanced Refund Advance no-interest loan, Free Federal 1040EZ offer, and Half Off promotion. Assisted returns declined 0.6% for fiscal 2018 which compares favorably to the 2.5% decline for fiscal year 2017. The company also reported an increase in net average charge, which was in line with expectations.\nDIY online returns increased 10.4%, driving overall DIY growth of 7.9%. The increase was attributable to continued product improvements, enhanced partnerships, the H&R Block More Zero ® promotion, and new self-employed offering. Additionally, net average charge increased due to favorable mix.\nThe aforementioned results are included in a table attached to this press release.\nH&R Block to Announce Fiscal 2018 Results on June 12\nIn conjunction with the announcement of fiscal 2018 results, the company will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on June 12, 2018 for analysts, institutional investors, and shareholders to discuss fiscal 2018 results, outlook and a general business update.
