U.S. and Colombian law-enforcement officials are also probing alleged drug trafficking of at least one other former rebel commander, one of the people familiar with the investigations said.\nThe developments pose risks to a fragile peace process that President Juan Manuel Santos’s government sealed in 2016 with the former rebels’ political party, FARC, the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Hundreds of former rebel fighters, impatient with slow progress in programs designed to adapt them to civilian life, are returning to crime, Colombian officials and scholars close to the process say.\nThe latest investigation into an ex-commander, a 62-year-old hard-line communist named Luciano Marín—better known by the alias Ivan Marquez and now a designated Colombian senator—stems from a cellphone video intercepted by investigators, in which Mr. Marín allegedly speaks to an associate of a known Mexican drug trafficker, the people familiar with the investigations said. The video was recorded after the peace deal went into effect, one of these people said. Mr. Marín hasn't been charged with a crime in this case.\nFARC guerrillas at their camp in El Diamante, in Colombia’s Caqueta department in 2016, before the peace accord. Photo: Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images Under the peace accord, combatants surrendered more than 7,000 weapons and began reintegrating into Colombian society. They are shielded from any drug-trafficking-related charges that occurred before the accord took effect on Dec. 1, 2016, but get no immunity for crimes that have taken place since.\nThe peace process faces numerous hurdles. Work and education programs to help former combatants have been marred by delays. Hundreds of former rebel fighters have abandoned government camps where they had settled with the promise of state aid, according to Colombia’s Defense Ministry. Many of those who remain in the camps are skeptical about the benefits of the peace dea l, according to the Colombian officials and scholars. About 40 former rebels have been killed in what rights groups suspect are acts of vigilantism.\n“Inside the FARC there’s a lot of fear,” said Álvaro Jimenez, who heads an organization that helps former rebels clear land mines. “They all think they’ll wind up in jail. They each think they’ll be targeted.”\nMr. Marín didn’t respond to requests for comment. Jairo Estrada, a member of the FARC’s leadership council, said the government’s failure to expedite social programs for former combatants, as well as continuing criminal allegations against FARC commanders, may doom the peace initiative. “It would be a demonstration of a failed process,” he said. “It would be a lost historic opportunity.”\nA Colombian official said that seeking to prosecute FARC members amounts to “a massive political decision” because of its potential impact on peace. “The whole thing is going to be left in a state of devastation,” the official said.\nColombian President Juan Manuel Santos, left, with FARC commander Rodrigo Londono Echeverry after signing the peace accord in 2016.

Wanted on an indictment issued in New York, Mr. Hernández is now in custody in Bogotá and nearly three weeks into a hunger strike. The former guerrilla—who is better known by his alias Jesús Santrich—says he is innocent and was set up by U.S. and Colombian authorities who want to sink the peace process.\nA week after Mr. Hernández was arrested, Colombia’s Attorney General Humberto Martinez in a televised interview denied that other former rebel leaders are being probed and that there are indications any are still involved in drug trafficking, “Categorically, no,” he said. A spokesman for the attorney general didn’t respond to requests for comment.\nOn April 20, Mr. Marín said he was leaving Bogotá and temporarily moving to a hamlet in Colombia’s rural south “until there is more clarity and certainty over what’s going on.” Since then, he has blasted the investigation against his comrades as an effort to derail the peace treaty.\n“Colombia’s peace deal must be respected as it was signed in Havana, without tricks or treason,” a post on Mr. Marín’s Twitter account said. “You do not mess with the peace of a country.”\nColombian authorities this month arrested FARC commander Seuxis Hernández and charged him and three associates with allegedly conspiring to traffic 10 tons of cocaine to Florida.

In an indictment unsealed in 2006, he is accused of being part of rebel leadership overseeing production of more than 60% of the cocaine imported into the U.S. He was never arrested or tried. Mr. Marín and other commanders have long said they weren’t traffickers but rather taxed cocaine producers to fund what they saw as a righteous war against the state.\nMr. Marín in recent days also said he wouldn’t take the senate seat designated to him in July as part of the peace deal. Mr. Hernández, who faces possible extradition to the U.S., also was a designated senator.\nInvestigators came to Messrs. Marín and Hernández after months of surveillance and intercepted phone calls in which Mr. Marín’s nephew, Marlon Marín, was allegedly heard discussing drug deals with purported members of a Mexican drug gang, law-enforcement officials said. Colombia’s attorney general said a phone call between Mr. Hernández and a purported drug trafficker was among the evidence that led to Mr. Hernández’s arrest.\nMexican cocaine traffickers increasingly send emissaries to Colombia to secure shipments of a drug that has been booming, said Jerry McDermott, co-director of Insight Crime, which tracks Colombian drug gangs. The younger Marín boasted in the intercepted communications of direct access to cocaine-production labs, the law-enforcement officials said.\nOne of the officials, who is familiar with the evidence against the elder Mr. Marín, said the video in which he speaks was intended as a message to reassure Mexican gang contacts following the seizure in Miami of an alleged drug payment. The Drug Enforcement Administration seized $5 million in Miami that the officials said was an alleged payment for a shipment of cocaine. The date of that seizure remains unclear.\nLast week, his nephew, Marlon Marín, boarded a DEA plane to New York, where he was arraigned before a Manhattan federal judge on drug charges. The younger Marín, who has allegedly served as his uncle’s bodyguard in recent years, agreed to cooperate with authorities, providing them information about drug trafficking by his cohorts here in Colombia, a person familiar with the case said. Mr. Marín’s family has been moved out of Colombia for their safety, people familiar with the case said.\nWrite to Juan Forero at Juan.Forero@wsj.com and Kejal Vyas at kejal.vyas@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T01:54:26.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
