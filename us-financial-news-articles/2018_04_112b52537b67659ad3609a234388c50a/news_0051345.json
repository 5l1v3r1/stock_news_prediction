We present revenues adjusted for constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect during the prior period presented, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. We believe the presentation of revenues adjusted for constant currency facilitates the comparison of revenues year-over-year. Billings. We believe billings is a useful leading indicator regarding the performance of our business. We define subscription billings, professional services and other billings, and total billings as the applicable revenue plus the applicable change in deferred revenue, unbilled receivables and customer deposits as presented or derived from the statement of cash flows. We adjust for constant currency, as described above, and adjust for constant duration by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the prior period presented. We believe these adjustments facilitate greater comparability in our billings information year-over-year. Gross Profit, Income from Operations and Net Income. Our non-GAAP presentation of gross profit, income from operations, and net income measures exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs related to our convertible senior notes, loss on early note conversions, amortization of purchased intangibles, legal settlements, business combination and other related costs, and the related income tax effect of these adjustments. We believe the presentation of operating results that exclude these non-cash or non-recurring items provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of our operating results and comparison of operating results across reporting periods. Free Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash paid for legal settlements and repayments of convertible senior notes attributable to debt discount, reduced by purchases of property and equipment. Free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of total revenues. We believe information regarding free cash flow and free cash flow margin provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the strength and performance of our business operations.\nOur presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to carefully consider our results under GAAP, as well as our supplemental non-GAAP information and the reconciliation between these presentations, to more fully understand our business. Please see the tables included at the end of this release for the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nUse of Forward - Looking Statements\nThis release contains “forward-looking statements” regarding our performance, including but not limited to statements in the section entitled “Financial Outlook.” Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make.\nFactors that may cause actual results to differ in any forward-looking statements include: (i) errors, interruptions, delays, or security breaches in or of our service or datacenters, (ii) our ability to grow at our expected rate of growth, including our ability to convert deferred revenue and backlog into revenue, add and retain customers, sell additional subscriptions to existing customers and enter new geographies and markets, (iii) our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, improved versions of our services, (iv) our ability to develop and gain customer acceptance of new products and services, including our platform, (v) our ability to compete successfully against existing and new competitors, and (vi) material changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nWe undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update these forward-looking statements, to review or confirm analysts’ expectations, or to provide interim reports or updates on the progress of the current financial quarter.\nAbout ServiceNow\nServiceNow makes work better across the enterprise.

% (1) Adjusted revenues and the corresponding growth rates are derived by applying the exchange rates in effect during the comparison period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period. (2) Adjusted billings and the corresponding growth rates are derived by applying the exchange rates in effect during the comparison period rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the current period, and by replacing the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the current period with the portion of multi-year billings in excess of twelve months during the comparison period. (3) Amounts in the comparison period have been restated for Topic 606 and are unaudited. Effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations and fluctuations in billing durations are not applicable for the comparison period. (4) Effect of dilutive time-based stock awards and the in-the-money portion of convertible senior notes are included in the GAAP weighted-average diluted shares in periods where we have GAAP net income. We exclude the in-the-money portion of convertible senior notes for non-GAAP weighted-average diluted shares as they are covered by our note hedges.\nServiceNow, Inc.
