Employees say it resulted in the creation of fiefdoms and rivalries that proved difficult for any CEO to control.\nThe investment bank debate is tricky for Sewing because he is not an investment banker. He joined Deutsche out of school at age 19 at a branch in Bielefeld in north-west of Germany. He was crowned CEO in a hastily arranged board call late on Sunday.\nThe bank’s major shareholders and top managers are also divided over how to proceed, with some favoring further investment in investment banking and others retrenchment.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Some analysts have said that even modest exits from specific business areas could erode revenues at the investment bank, which generates just over half the group’s total.\nThe future of the investment bank is just one of many problems for Sewing, the third head of the bank in six years. He also has to tackle high costs, heavy losses and stiff competition in Germany’s crowded banking market.\nPeter Nerby, who analyses Deutsche for credit rating agency Moody’s, pointed to tough competition among numerous international banks, asking “whether there’s enough food for everyone”.\nThat view was echoed elsewhere. Hendrik Leber, a fund manager with Acatis, said Deutsche should focus on German companies overseas: “Without the investment bank, Deutsche Bank would be much more reliable and profitable.”\nJPMorgan analysts said in a research note that Deutsche Bank should shrink its U.S. investment banking business to create shareholder value.\nSchenck, the investment bank co-head, had wanted to expand it, but Achleitner, in an interview with the the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Monday said: “The bank didn’t currently support that effort.”\nSewing has hinted he is open to a smaller investment bank in his staff memo on Monday, saying “we’ll have to further adapt our revenue, cost and capital structure”.\nSome in Germany would welcome a return to Deutche Bank’s roots - it was founded during the Industrial Revolution to finance German firms’ expansion overseas.\n“He has a huge task ahead of him that has big significance for Germany and our export orientated industry,” Carsten Schneider, a prominent lawmaker from Germany’s governing Social Democrats, told Reuters.\nTo view a graphic on Deutsche Bank's share price, click: tmsnrt.rs/2mMpPUl\nReporting by Tom Sims; Additional reporting by Arno Schuetze and Matthias Sobolewski; Editing by John O'Donnell and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T20:04:31.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
