(NYSE: TWTR) today announced financial results for its first quarter 2018.\n\"The first quarter was a strong start to the year,\" said Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO. \"We grew our audience and engagement, marking another quarter of double digit year-over-year DAU growth, and continued our work to make it easier to follow topics, interests, and events on Twitter. We also introduced a new framework to think more cohesively about the issues affecting our service, including information quality and safety. This holistic approach will help us more effectively address these challenges by viewing them through the broader lens of the health of the public conversation, and we're encouraged by our initial progress in this area.\"\n\"We're pleased to report growth across all major products and geographies in the first quarter,\" said Ned Segal, Twitter CFO. \"We grew total revenue 21% year-over-year and owned-and-operated advertising revenue 28% year-over-year, driven by continued audience growth, differentiated ad product features, improved ROI, and better sales execution. Our strong revenue performance drove better than expected profits and GAAP net margins of 9%, reflecting our continued prioritization and disciplined execution across our strategic priorities.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights\nThe company reported first quarter revenue of $665 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $61 million, representing a GAAP net margin of 9% and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.08. This compares with a quarterly GAAP net loss of $62 million, a GAAP net margin of (11%) and GAAP diluted EPS of ($0.09) for the same period last year.\nQuarterly non-GAAP net income was $123 million, representing a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.16. This compares with a quarterly non-GAAP net income of $53 million, representing a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.07 for the same period last year. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the blended US federal and state statutory tax rate used to calculate the company's reported non-GAAP provisions for income taxes decreased from 37% to 24% beginning in Q1 2018. Approximately $21 million of the $70 million year-over-year increase in non-GAAP net income resulted from this change.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $244 million or 37% of total revenue, compared to $170 million or 31% of total revenue for the same period last year.\nAverage monthly active users (MAUs) were 336 million for the quarter, an increase of 3% year-over-year and an increase of 6 million compared to 330 million in the previous quarter. Average daily active users (DAU) grew 10% year-over-year, marking another quarter of double-digit growth.\nOutlook\nFor Q2, we expect:\nAdjusted EBITDA to be between $245 million and $265 million Adjusted EBITDA margin to be between 37% and 38% Stock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million\nFor FY 2018, we expect:\nStock-based compensation expense to be in the range of $350 million to $450 million Capital expenditures to be between $375 million and $450 million\nNote that our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2018 reflects foreign exchange rates as of April 16, 2018.\nFor more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this letter, please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below. Guidance for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin excludes stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest and other expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain. We have not reconciled adjusted EBITDA guidance to projected GAAP net income (loss) because we do not provide guidance on GAAP net income (loss) or the reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and GAAP net income (loss), other than stock-based compensation expense, as a result of the uncertainty regarding, and the potential variability of, certain of these items. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort.\nTwitter's complete first quarter 2018 financial results can be found by accessing the company's Shareholder Letter at: https://investor.twitterinc.com/releases.cfm .\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nTwitter will host a conference call today, Wednesday, April 25, 2018, at 5:00 a.m. Pacific Time (8:00 a.m. Eastern Time) to discuss financial results for the first quarter of 2018.

The in this release are based on information available to Twitter as of the date hereof, and Twitter disclaims any obligation to update any , except as required by law.\nA Note About Metrics\nTwitter defines monthly active users (MAUs) as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website, desktop or mobile applications, SMS or registered thirdparty applications or websites in the 30-day period ending on the date of measurement. Average MAUs for a period represent the average of the MAUs at the end of each month during the period. Twitter defines daily active usage or users (DAU) as Twitter users who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter through our website, mobile website or mobile applications on any given day. Average DAUs for a period represent the average of the DAUs at the end of such period.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement Twitter's financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, or GAAP, Twitter considers certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP provision for income taxes, adjusted EBITDA margin, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Twitter defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, interest and other expense, net, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and restructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring gain; and Twitter defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, non-cash expense related to acquisitions, impairment of investments in privately-held companies, restructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring gain, and adjustment to income tax expense based on the non-GAAP measure of profitability using Twitter's blended US federal and state statutory tax rate. Twitter defines non-GAAP income before income taxes as income (loss) before income taxes adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquired intangible assets, non-cash interest expense related to convertible notes, non-cash expense related to acquisitions, impairment of investments in privately held companies, restructuring charges, and one-time nonrecurring gain; and Twitter defines non-GAAP provision for income taxes as the current and deferred income tax expense commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability using Twitter's blended US federal and state statutory tax rate. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by non-GAAP share count. Non-GAAP share count is GAAP share count plus potential common stock instruments such as stock options, RSUs, shares to be purchased under employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted stock, the conversion feature of convertible senior notes, and warrants. Twitter is presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing Twitter's operating results through the eyes of management, and because it believes that these measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing Twitter's core business operating results over multiple periods with other companies in its industry.\nTwitter uses the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income before income taxes, non-GAAP provision for income taxes, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS in evaluating its operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. Twitter believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS help identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the expenses and onetime gains or charges that it excludes in adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Twitter also believes that adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of Twitter's past performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by Twitter's management in its financial and operational decision-making. Twitter uses these measures to establish budgets and operational goals for managing its business and evaluating its performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nPress:\nCherryl Valenzuela\nKristin Binns\nir@twitter.com\npress@twitter.com\nTWITTER, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nNon-GAAP net income and net income per share:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n60,997\n$\n(61,559)\nExclude: Provision for income taxes\n2,885\n3,194\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n63,882\n(58,365)\nStock-based compensation expense\n73,266\n116,997\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n4,942\n16,191\nNon-cash interest expense related to convertible notes\n20,722\n19,248\nRestructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring gain\n(983)\n(9,572)\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes\n161,829\n84,499\nNon-GAAP provision for income taxes (1)\n38,839\n31,265\nNon-GAAP net income\n$\n122,990\n$\n53,234\nGAAP basic shares\n747,697\n722,048\nDilutive equity awards (2)\n18,164\n8,675\nNon-GAAP diluted shares (3)\n765,861\n730,723\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share\n$\n0.16\n$\n0.07\nAdjusted EBITDA:\nNet income (loss)\n$\n60,997\n$\n(61,559)\nStock-based compensation expense\n73,266\n116,997\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n96,846\n102,792\nInterest and other expense, net\n11,043\n18,087\nProvision for income taxes\n2,885\n3,194\nRestructuring charges and one-time nonrecurring gain\n(983)\n(9,572)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n244,054\n$\n169,939\n(1) As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the blended US federal and state statutory tax rate used to calculate our reported non-GAAP provisions for income taxes decreased from 37% to 24% beginning in the first quarter of 2018.\n(2) Gives effect to potential common stock instruments such as stock options, RSUs, shares to be issued under ESPP, unvested restricted stocks and warrants.
