Eric Hosmer then was credited with a single off the glove of first baseman Pat Valaika.\nRenfroe followed off reliever Bryan Shaw with an opposite-field drive into the right field seats for his first homer of the season.\nTrevor Story hit a two-run homer in the first to give the Rockies a quick 2-0 lead. The homer followed a throwing error by Lucchesi on a comebacker by Chris Iannetta.\nLuchhesi (1-0) gave up the two unearned runs on four hits and a walk with eight strikeouts.\nSubmariner Kazuhisa Makita entered the game with runners at the corners and no one out in the seventh and kept the Rockies from scoring. Padres relievers Makita, Robbie Erlin, Adam Cimber and closer Brad Hand retired eight of the nine hitters they faced with a double-play grounder erasing the only baserunner.\nHand was credited with his fourth save of the season and his second in as many nights at Coors Field. Shaw (1-1) took the loss after allowing three runs in his lone inning.\nTyler Anderson started for the Rockies and held the Padres to two runs on seven hits and two walks with eight strikeouts in six innings.\nThe Padres got on the board on back-to-back, two-out doubles in the third by Manuel Margot and Pirela, who was thrown out with the tying run at the plate by left fielder Eric Hosmer while trying to score on Eric Hosmer’s single.\nPadres catcher Austin Hedges homered leading off the fifth to tie the game at 2-2.\nRockies center fielder Charlie Blackmon was a late scratch from the lineup due to right quad stiffness.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:55:35.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
