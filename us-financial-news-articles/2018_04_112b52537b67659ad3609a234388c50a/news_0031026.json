A person familiar with the matter identified the planned vehicle as the Grandland SUV model. \n“Unfortunately, the conditions for investment approval were not completely met because last Friday’s meeting with our social partners did not deliver the required outcome,” Lohscheller said, adding that both parties agreed to continue the talks.
