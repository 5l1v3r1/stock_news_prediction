Slideshow (9 Images)\nWith Burnley struggling to score at home and Brighton away, goals were unlikely to flow, although visiting keeper Mat Ryan had to keep out first-half efforts from Ashley Barnes and Berg Gudmundsson.\nBrighton started positively after the break when Burnley replaced injured Chris Wood with Sam Vokes, who almost scored with his first touch. The visitors held on for a welcome point although they have not won in six league games and face a tough run-in with games against both Manchester clubs and Liverpool.
