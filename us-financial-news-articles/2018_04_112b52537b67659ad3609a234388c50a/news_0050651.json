We have some clarity moving forward now,” Allardyce told a news conference ahead of Saturday’s league trip to Huddersfield Town.\n“Didn’t I just say that? For clarification, yes,” he added when asked to confirm he was staying for next season.\nAllardyce was pleased with Everton’s rise during his five-month reign and has urged his team to improve next season.
