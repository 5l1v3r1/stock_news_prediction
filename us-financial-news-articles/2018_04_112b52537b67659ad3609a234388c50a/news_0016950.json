Ceremony of unveiling of the monument to the victims of the Smolensk air disaster, marking the eighth anniversary of the crash of the Polish government plane in Smolensk, Russia, that killed 96 people, including President Lech Kaczynski and his wife Maria, at the Pilsudski Square in Warsaw, Poland April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel \nThe marches became an opportunity for PiS to fan emotions that drive many of its conservative supporters: distrust of foreigners, patriotism infused with Catholic piety and anger that Poland’s economic success is not more evenly shared. \nBut opposition critics accused PiS of using them to foment divisions in Poland and the party, whose opinion poll ratings haven fallen sharply, decided that Tuesday’s official gathering on the eighth anniversary of the disaster would be the last. \n“We want Poles to be united, but united around good, not evil. We want a strong Poland, a just Poland, a Poland which is being listened to,” PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Lech’s twin, told supporters in Warsaw during a ceremony to unveil a monument to the victims.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel \nThe crash in thick fog near the Russian city of Smolensk shook Poland to the core: the 96 dead included top army brass, the central bank chief and lawmakers from across the political spectrum, as well as Lech Kaczynski, a PiS founder. \nAt the time Jaroslaw Kaczynski accused the then prime minister Donald Tusk - a centrist who is now European Council president - of being indirectly responsible for the crash, caused, in his view, at least partially by government negligence.
