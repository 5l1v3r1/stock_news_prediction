Football Soccer- World Cup 2018 Qualifier - Bolivia v Peru - Hernando Siles stadium - La Paz, Bolivia 01/09/16. Peru's Paolo Guerrero. REUTERS/David Mercado Picture Supplied by Action Images \nGuerrero had been suspended for a year by world football’s governing body FIFA on Dec. 8 after testing positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine after Peru’s 0-0 draw away to Argentina in October. \nFIFA then reduced the ban to six months. \nGuerrero, who has claimed the positive test was due to contamination, is seeking to remove the sanction completely while WADA is demanding a stiffer sentence of up to two years for the doping violation. \nShould WADA win the appeal the player could miss out on the World Cup in Russia in June. \nCAS said a hearing would take place next month. \nPeru, who have qualified for their first World Cup in 36 years, have been drawn in a group with France, Denmark and Australia.
