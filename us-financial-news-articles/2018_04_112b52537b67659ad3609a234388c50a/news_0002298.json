We began facility improvements on our factory in early October, and had the full team moved in by the end of the year. We also ordered and began installing some key pieces of automated equipment and started delivering the first Signature Series Fun Utility Vehicles to paying customers.\n“We’ve also continued to grow our base of pre-orders for our pioneering FUV electric vehicle. As we begin to deliver more FUVs to our pre-order customers, we expect the pace of new orders to accelerate as a result of owner referrals, strategic partnerships and other innovative marketing initiatives, which we believe have the potential to create significant value for our shareholders.\n“Arcimoto’s position in the market represents the culmination of a decade-long journey to create a true sustainable mobility solution. We are working on transitioning from a development-stage venture to a next-generation vehicle production enterprise. We are committed to creating a world-class production facility, capable of manufacturing reliable, high-quality, and affordable electric vehicles for the masses, and we are pleased to report that we are on-plan in meeting that commitment.”\nUpcoming Events\nArcimoto is scheduled to present at The MicroCap Conference in New York City on April 9, 2018, and management will host one-on-one meetings throughout the day.
