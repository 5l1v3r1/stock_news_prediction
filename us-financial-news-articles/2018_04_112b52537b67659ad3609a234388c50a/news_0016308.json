REUTERS/Ben Nelms/File Photo “You don’t build a long-term, sustainable economic plan for your province based on speculation in the real estate market,” Carole James told Reuters in an interview.\nThe West Coast province’s New Democratic government in February moved to crack down on real estate speculators, expanding a foreign buyer tax and introducing a new speculation tax, in an effort to cool sky-rocketing prices in Canada’s most expensive real estate market.\nThe plan has been criticized by the development industry, which has said tax increases could deter investment in new supply, needed in both the tight rental and real estate markets.\nCritics have also said the measures, particularly the speculation tax, unfairly target Canadians from other provinces who have bought vacation homes in British Columbia that they plan to live in when they retire.\nBut James said it would be a “huge risk” for the province to continue with the status quo, with an affordability crisis causing labor shortages that are threatening other sectors of the economy that are important for long-term growth.\nWhen people “don’t have a home in the areas they work in, it causes labor market challenges, because you can’t recruit and retain people,” she said during a visit to several eastern U.S. and Canadian cities, adding the government is hoping for a “moderation” in housing prices.\nBritish Columbia, once a forestry and mining powerhouse, has in recent years become dependent on the real estate and construction industries. The province is now eyeing its burgeoning tech sector for future economic growth.\nSeattle-based Amazon ( AMZN.O ) is investing heavily in Vancouver, despite the high housing prices, and tech hubs have popped up in the Metro Vancouver region, along with Victoria.\nBeyond tech, British Columbia sees growth opportunities in tourism and agriculture, among other sectors.\nReporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T02:25:14.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
