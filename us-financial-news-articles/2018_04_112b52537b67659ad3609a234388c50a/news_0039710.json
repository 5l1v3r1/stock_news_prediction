The contract settled down 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $68.29.\nInternational benchmark Brent crude rose 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $73.79 by 2:33 p.m. ET. It earlier rose to $74.74, its best intraday price since Nov. 27, when Brent peaked at $77.46.\nThe dollar index, which tracks the dollar's performance against six other currencies, rose 0.2 percent to 89.82, while the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield broke above 2.9 percent.\nEarlier on Thursday, crude futures were extending gains from the previous session, which came after the Energy Information Administration reported U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.1 million barrels last week.\nThe weekly figures also showed gasoline demand rose to 9.86 million barrels a day ahead of the summer driving season.\nThe \"EIA inventories we got yesterday were Bullish across the board as the EIA showed record gasoline products supplied,\" Roberto Friedlander, head of energy trading at Seaport Global Securities, said in a research note.\nThe EIA report provided additional support in an already bullish environment, as tensions escalate among world powers involved in Syria's civil war and rocket attacks by Yemeni rebels target top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.\n\"What we're seeing is the re-emergence of a geopolitical risk premium — which was absent for the past few years — as the underlying market has gotten tighter,\" said Tamar Essner, director of energy and utilities at Nasdaq Corporate Solutions.\nshow chapters Saudi Arabia is 'going to the whip' to drive oil prices higher, says pro 9 Hours Ago | 03:21 The market's attention is also shifting to a deadline that President Donald Trump faces in just over three weeks to extend sanctions relief for Iran, OPEC's third-biggest oil producer.\nTrump says he will not waive the sanctions unless he can reach a deal with France, Germany and the U.K. to toughen the terms of the deal — an outcome that is far from certain.\n\"We've had some resistance from the EU three that we've been dealing with, but maybe there will be a breakthrough before May 12.

Bob Corker , chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNBC on Thursday .\nEssner said concerns about trade wars under Trump could offset geopolitical tension in the oil market, but crude prices are more likely to rise than fall ahead of the Iran decision.\nTraders are also monitoring a deteriorating situation in OPEC-member Venezuela, where production has steadily fallen amid the country's long-running economic crisis.\nshow chapters Commodities tomorrow: Crude crosses $68 for first time since 2014 4:14 PM ET Wed, 18 April 2018 | 00:53 Oil workers have been resigning in droves since a military leader took control of the nation's state oil giant, Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, Reuters reported.\n\"It has become an absolute mess,\" said John Kilduff, founding partner of energy hedge fund Again Capital. \"The production there could go to near zero.
