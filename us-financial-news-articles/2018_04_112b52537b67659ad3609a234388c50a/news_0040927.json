In 2015, the eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party won a general election and changed almost all state-run institutions and company managements. \n“The rebranding case was accepted by KNF taking into account Santander’s investor obligations and in line with the law,” a KNF spokesman said in an emailed comment to Reuters on Friday, without giving further details. \nInvestors are keen to know the cost of the rebranding, but the bank’s press office declined to comment on Friday. Next week, BZ WBK presents its first quarter results and is expected to address questions regarding the plan. \nSome analysts estimate the cost of rebranding at around 50 million zloty ($15 million). $1 = 3.3926 zlotys Reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T17:39:47.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
