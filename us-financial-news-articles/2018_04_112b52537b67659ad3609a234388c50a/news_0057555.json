The brand plans to launch in Europe next year.\nGeely and Volvo have said they plan to bring the brand to the United States, but have not said when. “MIDDLE OF NOWHERE”\nThe Zhangjiakou complex will build the Lynk & Co 02 SUV and a sedan called the 03 for the Chinese market. Currently the plant has about 1,800 workers on one daily shift, laboring alongside nearly 300 robots. A general view of Geely's Lynk & Co plant in Zhangjiakou, Hebei province, China April 26, 2018. Picture taken April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Joe White\nWhen the factory goes to a second shift, it will employ 3,000 people capable of building about 200,000 cars per year, Tong said. Those are employment and production levels consistent with mature market auto plants.\nThe factory uses Kuka robots to weld together the bodies of its vehicles - the same brand used by Daimler AG to build Mercedes-Benz cars.\nU.S. firm Rockwell Automation and Germany’s Robert Bosch Gmbh [ROBG.UL] supply the technology used on the final assembly line.\nA robot from ABB Ltd glues windshields into each Lynk & Co 02 sport utility, relieving human workers of that messy job.\nU.S. tool maker Atlas Copco provided what plant manager Tong describes as a “huge-ass nut runner” that bolts wheels on vehicles, records the force used and sends the data to a cloud server.\nThe Zhangjiakou factory’s advanced systems are evident in both the robots seen by journalists during the tour, and other things that are missing.\nUnlike many older auto factories, there are no natural gas fueled forklifts or tug vehicles operated by drivers to haul parts to the assembly line. At Lynk & Co, parts are brought to work stations by unmanned, automated machines.\nFor its human workforce, some of whom live up to 500 kilometers (311 miles) from the plant, the company is building housing for its employees, Tong said.\nBut he also saw benefits in the plant’s remote location.\n“We’re in the middle of nowhere,” he said. “We can expand any direction we want.” Slideshow (2 Images)\n($1 = 6.3390 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Joe White in ZHANGJIAKOU; Editing by Darren Schuettler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T11:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:27:49.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
