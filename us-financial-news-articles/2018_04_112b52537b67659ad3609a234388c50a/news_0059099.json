Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, and Ireland's Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attend an all All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit in Dundalk, Ireland, April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\nNorthern Ireland will be Britain’s only land frontier with the European Union after Brexit. Both sides say they are committed to keeping the border with the Irish Republic open, but finding a practical solution has proved elusive so far.\nThe EU and Dublin insist the Brexit treaty must lock in a backstop arrangement in case a future trade pact does not remove the need for border controls. London signed up for this last month but disagrees with the EU’s means of achieving it..\n“We need to ... agree rapidly by June on the scope of all island customs and regulations - the safety and controls that we need to respect the single market,” negotiator Michel Barnier said, referring to an EU leaders’ meeting in June that he called a “stepping stone” towards reaching a full agreement in October.\n“I am confident that together with unity of the EU27 and a constructive attitude on both sides, we will be able to agree the right solution,” he told a news conference in the Irish border town of Dundalk. However, he added: “There is a real risk and we have to be prepared for any options, including no deal.”\nUnder the EU proposal, if all other attempts to avoid a hard border fail, Northern Ireland would form a “common regulatory area” with Ireland and 26 other EU states, in effect keeping the British province in a customs union with the EU.
