OTP, the region's biggest independent bank, bucked the trend, shedding more than 2 percent. Profit-taking hit other bank stocks in the region as well, after Vienna-based regional bank Raiffeisen plunged 13 percent plunge, Equilor brokerage analyst Gabor Bukta said. But most Budapest shares rose, the forint gained 0.1 percent to 311.9 against the euro, and the yield on Hungary's 10-year government bonds was fixed lower by 10 basis points at 2.46 percent. \"The forint has strengthened a tad due to the elimination of any tail risk of a hung parliament that could have led to political, economic and monetary uncertainty,\" Nordea analyst Morten Lund said in a note. Investors are now focusing on stability rather than the political risk, after Orban's Fidesz party won a two-thirds parliamentary majority. However, investors will watch to see whether Orban uses his super-majority for policies that weaken the rule of law, some analysts said. \"It will be important to see if the prime minister and others refer to such plans,\" said Gergely Urmossy, analyst of Erste in Budapest. If that happens, low interest rates and a narrowing current account surplus could increase the forint's volatility later this year, he said. Even without such measures, Hungary's relations with Brussels and some European Union capitals might remain strained as Orban leads resistance in Central Europe to the EU's quotas to distribute migrants. The economy, however, is on the right track, with growth around 4 percent, inflation well within the central bank's target range and the budget deficit below the EU's threshold of 3 percent of economic output, analysts said. Urmossy said the Fidesz government was likely to keep budget discipline as a priority, and may deliver a minor budget adjustment later this year to contain the deficit.
