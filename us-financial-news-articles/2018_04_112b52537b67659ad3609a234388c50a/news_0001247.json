The U.S. Treasury building is seen in Washington, September 29, 2008. REUTERS/Jim Bourg \nMuzinich advises Mnuchin on tax reform and other domestic and international policy initiatives, the White House statement said. Before joining the Treasury Department, he was president of Muzinich & Co, an international investment firm, and taught at Columbia Business School, the statement added. \nThe New York Times said the Treasury had operated without a full-time deputy secretary, a position that includes overseeing a broad portfolio of policy matters such as taxes, financial regulation, trade and economic sanctions, since Mnuchin was confirmed early last year. \nTrump has been revamping his economic team in recent weeks, including appointing Larry Kudlow as director of the National Economic Council to replace Gary Cohn. \n“Far from a flamethrower, Mr. Muzinich, who spent most of his career on Wall Street, will add a more moderate voice with traditional conservative economic ideas to the table,” the Times said. \nIt said Muzinich, 40, had been serving as Mr. Mnuchin’s tax counselor and played a central role in drawing up and negotiating the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed by the U.S. Congress late last year. \nThe Times said Mnuchin welcomed the nomination in a statement and added: “Justin has established himself as a leader in the department, and played a key role in the passage of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act.” \n“He brings significant experience in financial services and in public policy and has become a reliable and trusted adviser on a number of important issues,” the secretary said. \nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, the Times said, Muzinich served as policy director for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, one of more than a dozen Republican candidates defeated by Trump, and helped to craft Bush’s tax plan.
