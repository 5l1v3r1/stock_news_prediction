In the rest of the region, deficits continued, driven by recurrent spending, often on poorly targeted social benefits and subsidies. \nTo remedy that, Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo are now working to revive growth-enhancing capital investment, the World Bank said. \n“Careful financial, public investment, and budgetary management will help ensure that fiscal risks associated with investments are minimized,” the report said.
