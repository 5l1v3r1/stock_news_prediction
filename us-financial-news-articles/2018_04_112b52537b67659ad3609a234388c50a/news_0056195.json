Assets under management increased 17 percent to $251.7 billion.\nTotal revenue jumped 20.5 percent to $768.2 million, while provision for income taxes fell 39.2 percent due to U.S. tax reforms.\nNet income attributable to Lazard rose to $159.7 million, or $1.21 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $107.6 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.26 per share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.04, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:04:32.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
