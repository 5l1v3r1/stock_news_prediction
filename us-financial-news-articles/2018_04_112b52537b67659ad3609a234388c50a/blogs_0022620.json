Dealing with innovation risk involves thinking about how to make changes to better carry out a company’s strategy, according to a new report from PwC. iStockphoto.com/monsitj \nGood morning. Companies are trying to balance the need to make technological innovations against the associated risks. Those that are succeeding actively involve their risk-management teams early in the process, according to a report from PwC. \nA survey of around 1,500 senior risk executives from companies in 76 countries found 60% said their company was very effectively or somewhat effectively managing innovation risk. Dealing with innovation risk involves thinking about how to make changes to better achieve the company’s strategy, as well as how to quickly respond to marketplace changes to offer the right products and services are offered, said Jason Pett, PwC’s newly appointed risk assurance leader. \n“Innovation risks encapsulates other risks—it captures technology risks, it captures people risks, it captures new product-development risks,” said Mr. Pett in an interview. “All come under the umbrella of how to change the way we do our work to be more effective in delivering solutions.” \nCompanies that are effective at managing innovation risk—PwC calls them ‘adapters’—share some traits, said Mr. Pett. \nThe survey found 57% of adapters let their risk teams have influence concerning innovation decisions, versus 18% at firms ranked as non-adapters. Also, 58% of executives at adapter companies said their risk-management function brings value to the innovation process. \nAdapter companies are two to three times more likely than non-adapters to be confident in their risk-management team’s ability to manage the risks associated with implementing new technologies, the study found. \nHow to get started? Mr. Pett said the first question companies need to ask is whether they even are considering risks in their innovation processes. “It’s a pretty easy question to ask but a more difficult one to answer,” he said. “Is risk in the discussion when I am considering innovation of any kind? Am I embedding risk into that process?” \nAdapter companies generally share five traits that companies looking to improve their innovation risk-management programs should consider, said Mr. Pett. These include: having risk teams involved early on in planning innovation projects; using multiple tools to address risk concerns; frequently adjusting their risk tolerances as innovation projects proceed; bringing aboard needed people and tools to support innovation; and monitoring and assessing the contributions of the risk-management team. \nA company that believes risk management is the key to its strategy, and that technology makes possible more effective and more efficient risk management, will make the necessary changes and start to put weight behind that with the appropriate resources, said Mr. Pett. \n“I believe if they do that, they make that upfront investment, the return is multiplefold,” he said. \nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL \nU.K. regulator picks interim director.
