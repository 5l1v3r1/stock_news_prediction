REUTERS/Daniel Munoz/File Photo \nThe figure primarily pertains to workforce reduction costs, it said, and is closer to the higher end of the range of A$500 million to A$800 million set in early November. \nIn an announcement earlier this week, London-listed lender CYBG PLC ( CYBGC.L ), which was spun off from NAB, said it would raise its half-year provisions to cover costs related to an earlier insurance industry scandal. \nThe expected use of the remaining undrawn capped indemnity of £148 million ($208.30 million) by CYBG would not impact NAB’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, the Australian lender said on Friday. \nNAB shares were up 0.1 percent at 0402 GMT, while the Australian equity benchmark was 0.2 percent lower.
