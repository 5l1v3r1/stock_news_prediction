REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo Turnout was higher than the final turnout of 61.73 percent in the last election in 2014 which gave Orban a landslide victory. Some pollsters have said voter turnout above 70 percent this time could cause the ruling Fidesz to lose its parliamentary majority.\nWhile voters were no longer allowed to join queues at polling stations as of 1700 GMT, those already in line will be allowed to cast their ballots, a process that can take hours at the busiest polling stations.\nReporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Andrew Roche and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T19:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T21:47:39.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
