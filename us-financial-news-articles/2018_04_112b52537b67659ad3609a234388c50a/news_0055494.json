Christopher Giancarlo on Thursday laid out his vision for overhauling the system, setting the stage for new rules to be rolled out in the coming months.\nMr. Giancarlo, a Republican, has long criticized the swap-execution rules enacted by the CFTC under former Democratic Chairman Gary Gensler, saying they are overly prescriptive and run counter to what Congress intended in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law.\nSwaps are derivatives contracts in which two parties agree to exchange payments based on fluctuations in certain benchmarks. Companies use them to hedge risks or make bets in such areas as fuel prices or interest rates.\nM. Giancarlo has said that liquidity in swaps markets has been hurt by the rules, which restricted trades to a smaller subset of trading platforms rather than allowing market participants to trade according to “any means of interstate commerce,” as Dodd-Frank states.\nThe CFTC chairman told reporters this week to expect a rule proposal on trade execution this year. At an industry conference in Miami on Wednesday, CFTC Division of Market Oversight Director Amir Zaidi said he hoped the proposal could be ready as early as July.\nThe planned overhaul was detailed in a white paper by Mr. Giancarlo and CFTC chief economist Bruce Tuckman that was published Thursday. Mr. Giancarlo described the paper as “regulatory reform 2.0”—an update, rather than a repudiation, of Dodd-Frank.\nWhile the chairman laid out his views on a variety of swaps regulations, he promised near-term action only on swap-execution rules, a longtime project of his and the focus of a 2015 white paper he wrote as a minority CFTC commissioner.\nAs for other aspects of the swaps regulatory regime, Mr. Giancarlo said he was content to allow his proposals to percolate in the “marketplace of ideas” for a while, with no immediate plans to act on them.\n“I do not want this to say, ‘OK, there’s going to be a rulemaking following this,’” he told reporters. “We’re not operating in the wake of a crisis right now. I think we can be more deliberative about things.”\nHe did, however, reach conclusions in his paper that could inform future policies. After years of silence on the issue, he and Mr. Tuckman concluded that orderly liquidation authority, Dodd-Frank’s last-resort mechanism for winding down large banks that are about to fail, could be applied to clearinghouses that need to be resolved in crisis situations. The determination comes after the Trump administration declined to recommend abolishing the mechanism and a congressional effort to do so fizzled. Orderly liquidation authority has been available since 2010 but has never been used.\nThe paper also lays the groundwork for the CFTC chairman to work with U.S. and international regulators on less-prescriptive capital rules for swap dealers and end-users. The CFTC cannot move to change its methodology for those rules unilaterally because they are based on international accords, or they require interagency consensus in the U.S.\nSome of the changes advocated by Mr. Giancarlo are based on a new methodology for measuring the size of the swaps market that supplants the current “notional value” metric, which Mr. Giancarlo has criticized as “meaningless.” But given that the metric is used by all global regulators, the CFTC won’t be able to introduce rules based on a new methodology unless the international community moves to adopt it.\nWrite to Gabriel T.
