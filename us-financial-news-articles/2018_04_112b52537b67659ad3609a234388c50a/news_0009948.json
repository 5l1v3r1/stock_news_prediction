But to be right up there and have the ability to stay patient, because of the position I’m in, that’s a nice luxury I have over the next few days.”\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland smiles after making a birdie putt on the 13th green during first round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 5, 2018.

My short game wasn’t quite as sharp as I wanted. And I didn’t capitalize on some putts that I’ve usually been making.\n“But what I did do well is plot my way around the golf course. I got in a reasonable score.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) Dustin Johnson (73), Justin Thomas (74) and Jason Day (75) did not far so well.\nWorld number one Johnson was three-over after 10 holes, and in the end was not too fazed by his ordinary score.\n“I feel like the game’s in good form. I just need to roll in some putts tomorrow, that’s all,” he said.\nWorld number two Thomas double-bogeyed the par-three 16th and said his round had been ruined by four holes.\n“Four holes killed me today, which is a bummer,” said Thomas.\nDay made an awful start, four-over after seven.\n“I just got to keep pushing, just try and claw myself back into the tournament,” lamented the Australian.\nEditing by Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:49:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
