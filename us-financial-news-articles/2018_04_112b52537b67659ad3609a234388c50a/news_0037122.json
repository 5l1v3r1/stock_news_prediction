A staggering amount of 73 rotary rigs have been placed since January 2018,\" said Benjamin Lu of Phillip Futures in a note on Tuesday.\n\"As such, we expect a softening in crude oil prices as markets adjust from a bullish streak,\" he added.\nU.S. shale oil production is expected to increase in May for the fourth consecutive month, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed on Monday. Shale oil output is set to rise by 125,000 barrels bpd to 7 million bpd.\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to publish weekly U.S. fuel inventory data later on Tuesday, while official government data, including on production, is due from the EIA on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford and Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:21:52.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
