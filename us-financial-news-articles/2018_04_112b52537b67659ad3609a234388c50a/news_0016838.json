He also documented the nearly 2,800-mile (4,500 km) trek and said he used it to connect with everyday Americans along the way. \n“I don’t ever use that dirty word for myself - celebrity - but it was very grounding,” Leto told Reuters. “And I think it just reminds you that we’re all connected, that we all have our challenges, that we all have our dreams.” \nLeto said his journey taught him that despite the current political polarization of the United States, he found a sense of shared purpose among Americans. \n“I think the most eye-opening thing right now, that at a time of such instability that there’s so much community, so much we have in common, such unity,” he said. “I think that would surprise people, especially if you live outside the country.” FILE PHOTO: Lead singer of Thirty Seconds to Mars Jared Leto attends a launch party for the album \"America\" at a pop-up museum called \"Museum of America\" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., April 6, 2018.

It was inspiring.” \nThe actor, who won an Oscar for his role as an HIV-positive transgender woman in 2013 drama “Dallas Buyers Club,” is also directing a documentary, “A Day in the Life of America,” in which he explores the lives of different Americans on U.S. Independence Day, July 4, 2017. \nIt was not Leto’s first trip across the United States. \n“I had done it when I was a kid as an art school dropout and I headed to L.A. to become a director,” said Leto, who caught his first big break in Hollywood on the mid-1990s cult teen TV drama “My So-Called Life” as a moody high school heartthrob.
