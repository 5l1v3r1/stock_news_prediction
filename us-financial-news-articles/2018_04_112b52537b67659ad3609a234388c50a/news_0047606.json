And we believe it will take one year, maybe a little bit more, to have it finished,” he told Time Magazine.\nSarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW, said: “Any plan to limit drug executions needs to include improvements to a justice system that doesn’t provide for fair trials.”\nSaudi Arabia has gone through a series of reforms in the last year, but international human rights groups urge the kingdom to make changes to its treatment of human rights advocates, to stop executions and cancel its pervasive system of male guardianship.\nSaudi Arabia has carried out nearly 600 executions since the beginning of 2014, over 200 of them in drug cases, HRW said.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T22:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T22:22:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
