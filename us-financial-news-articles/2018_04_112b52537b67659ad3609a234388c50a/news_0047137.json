REUTERS/Aly Song Approved financial institutions, publicly-offered securities investment funds, and commercial banks’ wealth management products may participate in the tri-party repo agreements, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) said in a statement on its website late on Tuesday.\nThe rules were also published by the China Securities Depository and Clearing Co Ltd (CSDC), the state-owned company that provides clearing services for the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.\nThey detail the use of credit bonds as collateral, including a breakdown of discount rates for publicly-offered and privately-placed corporate bonds by rating.\nUnder the rules, the senior tranches of asset-backed securities can also be used as collateral for the first time.\nThe stock exchange and CSDC had posted draft rules with a call for market feedback in January.\nYun Xiong, partner at Leiton Capital in Shanghai, said the new rules would “dramatically” improve the liquidity of asset-backed securities (ABS).\nThey would also help to reduce risk compared with exchange-traded repos, which expose the stock exchange to default risk as the central counterparty, he said.\nIn tri-party repo agreements, the third party is only a central clearing house, with default risk borne by the other two parties.\n“More and more, SSE realizes it is sitting on a volcano,” Xiong said.\nAnalysts at Pengyuan Credit Rating Co cautioned in a research note that the near-term development of tri-party repos would depend on factors including market acceptance of ABS-backed products.\n“In the long term, because of the improved standardization and convenience, the introduction of tri-party repos will certainly help to improve ABS liquidity. However, in the near term it should not be over-interpreted,” the analysts said.\nReporting by Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T07:11:23.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
