Asked about reports of the missile attack, an Israeli military spokesman said: \"We don't comment on such reports.\"\nSaturday's strikes by the U.S., Britain and France were in retaliation for a suspected chemical weapons attack by the Syrian military in eastern Ghouta. Both Damascus and its ally Russia have denied using any such weapons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T16:25:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
