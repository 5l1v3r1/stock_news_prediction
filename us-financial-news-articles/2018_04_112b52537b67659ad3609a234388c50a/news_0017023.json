While two-thirds of adolescent boys are literate, the figure for girls is little more than half that.\nMohammadi said AYA was in touch with Ahmadi, who has three children including the two-month-old baby pictured with her.\nHer husband, who is reported to be illiterate, was widely praised on social media for supporting his wife in a patriarchal society where women are mostly expected to stay at home.\nAfghan politician Farkhunda Zahra Naderi, known for championing women’s rights, also pledged to help Ahmadi with her studies, and told the Thomson Reuters Foundation she had paid Ahmadi’s university fees in full for the next four years.\nReporting by Serena Chaudhry, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
