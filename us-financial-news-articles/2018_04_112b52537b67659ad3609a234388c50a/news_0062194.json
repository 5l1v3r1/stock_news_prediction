But much of their recent enmity was fueled by the perception that they back opposite sides in the dispute that erupted last year between Qatar and Turkey against Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n“I assure the Somali citizens that I will honestly serve the country in accordance with the interest of the religion, people and the country,” Abdirahman said after the result of parliament’s vote was announced.\nSomalia has been in a state of lawlessness since 1991, when warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other.\nReporting by Abdi Sheikh and Feisal Omar; Writing by Omar Mohammed; Editing by Maggie Fick\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T18:38:26.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
