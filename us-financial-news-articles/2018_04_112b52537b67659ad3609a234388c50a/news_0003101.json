U.S. stock futures and Treasury yields also fell on the news.\n“Such swift countermeasures from Beijing disillusioned investors who had hoped for a solution at the negotiating table,” said Linus Yip, Hong Kong-based strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd.\n“Some investors also chose to reduce risk exposure ahead of the holiday break at this sensitive juncture.”\nThe Hong Kong market will be closed on Thursday for the Tomb-sweeping festival, or Qingming, exposing investors to volatility in global markets.
