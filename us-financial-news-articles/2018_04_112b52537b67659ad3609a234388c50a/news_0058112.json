It says advertising sales are the majority of its “other” section, which hit $2.0 billion in the first quarter. After adjusting for accounting changes, that is a 72 percent increase from a year earlier, Amazon said.\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky called the ad sales business “a multibillion dollar program and growing very quickly.” Advertisers of all sizes were interested in sponsored product ads “to drive brand awareness, discovery or hopefully, purchase,” he said.\nInternet research firm eMarketer last October forecast Amazon would hit $3.19 billion in net U.S. digital ad revenues by 2019, or 3.0 percent of digital ad spending.\nEstablished advertising firms also have taken notice. Martin Sorrell, the founder of the world’s largest advertising company WPP, who stepped down in mid-April, last month saw Amazon in “head-to-head” competition with Google and Facebook. Sorrell added that WPP had directed $200 million of its clients’ ad budgets to Amazon in 2017 and predicted that number would rise to $300 million this year.\n“Amazon is coming over the hill. Amazon certainly poses a big threat on search and advertising,” he said, adding that its voice assistant, Alexa, would make it an even stronger competitor.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Amazon is pictured inside the company's office in Bengaluru, India, April 20, 2018.
