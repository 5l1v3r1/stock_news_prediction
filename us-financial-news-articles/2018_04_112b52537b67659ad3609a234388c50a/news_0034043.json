According to the sources, the collision could be minor and no oil spills were expected but this could not be confirmed with the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore who declined to comment on the incident when contacted.\nReporting by Roslan Khasawneh and Seng Li Peng, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T17:54:30.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
