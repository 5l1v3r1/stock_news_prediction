While another “global oil company” has signed a long-term contract for use of the terminal, it was not named. \nThe so-called Baja Refinados terminal is designed to offer fuel supplies, mostly gasoline and diesel, to consumers in Baja California. \nThe facility marks IEnova’s fourth fuel terminal in Mexico and will be located some 50 miles (81 km) south of the U.S.-Mexico border, just outside the city of Ensenada.
