The company also stayed with him when he was charged with driving under the influence when he was found asleep behind the wheel of his car. \nWoods has won the Masters tournament four times, and his endorsement contracts are thought to be worth about $90 million a year. TV stations and sponsors are likely to cash in with his return: During the recent Arnold Palmer Invitational, Woods received 580 minutes of brand exposure , according to measurement company Nielsen. \nAnd he doesn't even need to be inside the top five finishers for TV networks and sponsors to get maximum value. Network viewership increased 93 percent or by about 2 million more viewers on average during the first four events this season that Woods finished inside the top 25, Nielsen said. \nJessica Golden contributed to this report.
