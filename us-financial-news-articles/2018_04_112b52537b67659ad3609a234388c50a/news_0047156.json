But what I can tell you is we are in full compliance with every regulation in every jurisdiction we are present in,” Thiam told reporters at the bank’s quarterly results news conference on Wednesday.\n“When there are sanctions, we are fully compliant with the sanctions, of course, and we have invested a lot of resources in continuously upgrading our ability to monitor.”\nSwiss banks practically never comment on individual clients given confidentiality laws that helped make Switzerland the world’s biggest center for managing offshore wealth.\nThe neutral country has now begun to exchange information on bank clients with foreign tax authorities.\nTwo Democratic senators have written to U.S.-based Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase and Citibank as well as European groups Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse.\nThe Trump administration announced sanctions on Russia on April 6, responding to what U.S. intelligence agencies say was Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and other adversarial actions by Moscow.
