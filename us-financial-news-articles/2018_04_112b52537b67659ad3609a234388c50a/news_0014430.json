Somehow from one to the other lap I got like 150 horsepower extra on the rear tires. It overslipped the rear tires and made me spin.”\nVerstappen will line up 15th as a result.\nFormula 1 F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - April 7, 2018 The car of Red Bull's Max Verstappen is removed after crashing out of qualifying REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed Team mate Daniel Ricciardo meanwhile qualified fifth, four-tenths of a second off Ferrari pole-sitter Sebastian Vettel’s benchmark.\nWith the Red Bull enjoying better race pace than qualifying speed, Verstappen was optimistic he could make up ground on Sunday.\n“With a bit of luck, maybe the safety car, I can hopefully maybe fight in front again,” he said. “Like Austin last year.”\nVerstappen started last October’s U.S. Grand Prix in 16th place but finished third, before being stripped of his podium finish for exceeding track limits in his pass of Kimi Raikkonen.\n“I finished on the podium. Of course it got taken away, but...we have a good chance.”\nEditing by Alan Baldwin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T03:37:29.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
