The private equity firms either declined to comment or were not immediately available to comment.\nSome €550m of debt financing would give leverage of around 6.0 times DSP’s approximate €80m Ebitda, including undrawn facilities, the sources said.\nThe debt is expected to be in the form of senior leveraged loans and second lien loans.\nDSM has been focusing on products such as vitamins and enzymes as well as fabrics and plastics used in cars, garments and construction, putting more commoditised and cyclical product lines into joint ventures with the view to eventually exiting those businesses.\nThe company is expected to update the market on its future strategy at a capital market day on June 20. Some investors have questioned the rationale for having a nutrition and a plastics unit under one roof, but so far DSM has not signalled that it will spin off one of the units.\nBy contrast, Dutch peer Akzo Nobel last month sold its €10bn specialty chemicals business to buyout firm Carlyle, to focus on coatings and paints, and delivering a commitment made in its defence against a €26bn (US$32 billion) takeover offer from US rival PPG Industries last year.
