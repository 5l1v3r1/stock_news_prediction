(NYSE: SPB), a global consumer products company offering a portfolio of leading brands providing superior value to consumers and customers every day, today reported results from continuing operations for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended April 1, 2018. The Company also lowered its fiscal 2018 full-year guidance.\nSeparately this morning, the Company announced that Executive Chairman David M. Maura has been named Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately, replacing Andreas Rouvé, who has stepped down as CEO and a Director, and that its Board of Directors has authorized a new three-year, $1 billion share repurchase program.\nSpectrum Brands announced on January 3, 2018 that it was exploring strategic options for its Global Batteries & Appliances (GBA) businesses with the intention to sell the units by December 31, 2018. As a result, effective with the Company’s fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results, the GBA segment has been reclassified as held for sale and is now reported as discontinued operations for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018 and the comparable prior-year periods.\nThis press release includes non-GAAP metrics such as organic net sales, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, organic adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow. See Other Supplemental Information for reconciliation to comparable GAAP metrics.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Highlights from Continuing Operations:\nNet sales of $766.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1.3 percent compared to $756.5 million last year. Excluding the impact of $12.3 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $25.2 million, organic net sales decreased 3.7 percent versus the prior year. Net income from continuing operations of $0.8 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.02 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased compared to net income from continuing operations of $39.9 million and diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.68 in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher production costs and higher operating expenses from incremental transaction costs and restructuring expenses. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.56 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 34.9 percent versus $0.86 last year predominantly due to lower gross profit and higher interest expense. Operating income of $43.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 58.9 percent versus $105.1 million last year as a result of incremental restructuring costs and higher operating expenses. Operating income margin of 5.6 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 830 basis points versus 13.9 percent last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $115.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 declined 27.8 percent compared to $160.2 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange of $0.3 million and acquisition EBITDA of $8.5 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $106.8 million decreased 33.3 percent versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.1 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 610 basis points compared to 21.2 percent in fiscal 2017 primarily due to unfavorable product mix, operating inefficiencies, input cost inflation and higher distribution costs.\n“While our second quarter performance was very disappointing, we believe it is in no way reflective of the underlying earnings power of our continuing operations,” said David Maura, Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Brands Holdings.\n“The challenges related to our two greenfield manufacturing and distribution projects were meaningfully greater than we expected. As we brought our East Coast distribution center into our new Hardware & Home Improvement facility in Edgerton, Kansas at the end of February, we experienced facility-wide disruptions which hampered distribution capabilities materially in March,” Maura said. “Our Global Auto Care facility in Dayton struggled at higher production levels in March, which led to significant inefficiencies and shipping challenges.\n“Given these issues, sales of about $30 million from in-house orders could not be shipped by quarter-end due to higher customer order backlogs at our HHI and GAC facilities, and we are working to return them to normal efficiency levels,” he said. “In addition, cold and wet weather in March hurt Home & Garden revenues by about $10 million as POS declined and retailers delayed orders into April.\n“Our Pet business was impacted, as expected, by the exit of a European pet food customer tolling agreement and from lost rawhide distribution from our recall of last spring that we will lap in June,” Maura said. “Together, these items total about $12 million of revenues in our Pet business.\n“In addition, external cost headwinds and mix combined to deliver a significant negative impact on our sales and margins,” Maura said. “While we expect improvement in the back half of the year, the magnitude of our second quarter shortfall and manufacturing and distribution center start-up inefficiencies has caused us to lower our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance from continuing operations by $57 million at the mid-point and adjusted free cash flow on a total company basis by $135 million. It is our firm belief that the current impact to our free cash flow is mostly transitory and largely reflects one-time investments in working capital and customer relationships. The fact is our recovery is already under way, and full recovery will take place gradually over the next several quarters. We are reiterating full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance for discontinued operations.\n“Our EBITDA and margin declines were more pronounced,” Maura said. “The most significant drivers were the late quarter major manufacturing and distribution center operating inefficiencies as I mentioned above, and unfavorable mix across the businesses due to cold and wet March weather. In addition, we faced broad-based, higher commodity input costs, and increased freight costs. We believe the U.S. facility operating inefficiencies are transitory in nature and the adverse margin impact from them is temporary. Second quarter margins are not representative of the underlying margin structure of each business for the balance of this year and over the longer-term.\n“We have taken the following swift and decisive actions to improve operations:\nConsolidated our Pet, Home & Garden and Global Auto Care (GAC) divisions to address operational challenges, increase efficiency, and leverage liquids and aerosol expertise Replaced and strengthened key front-line talent at the Hardware & Home Improvement (HHI) facility in Kansas and the GAC facility in Dayton Instituted improvement plans with aggressive oversight to reduce the temporary customer order backlogs at the HHI and GAC facilities\n“Looking to the second half of the year, underlying customer demand for our products remains healthy, our order books remain strong and we are optimistic about regaining momentum and growth by delivering increases in net sales and adjusted EBITDA versus the first half,” he said. “More than 70% of POS is still ahead for our Global Auto Care and Home & Garden businesses, new product launches are occurring across the portfolio, we are lapping some prior-year events such as the Pet recall, and, most importantly, we anticipate that customer order backlogs at the HHI and GAC facilities will recede due to recent corrective actions taken to improve operating efficiency.”\nThe Company remains on track to close the sale of its Global Battery and Lighting business to Energizer Holdings for $2 billion in cash in the second half of calendar 2018. In addition, the Company remains in active discussions to divest, and continues to market, its Personal Care and Small Appliances (Appliances) businesses. Although the anticipated results of the Appliances process, including proceeds and timing, cannot be known with certainty at this time, the Company expects to complete the process by the end of fiscal 2018. The Company may provide future updates as appropriate. The Company plans to use the significant net proceeds from these divestitures to reduce debt, repurchase shares, and increase its investment in organic growth initiatives and bolt-on acquisitions in its remaining four businesses.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Consolidated Financial Results from Continuing Operations\nNet sales of $766.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 1.3 percent compared to $756.5 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of $12.3 million of favorable foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $25.2 million, organic net sales decreased 3.7 percent.\nGross profit and gross profit margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $268.2 million and 35.0 percent, respectively, compared to $306.8 million and 40.6 percent, respectively, last year. The gross profit margin percentage decrease was primarily due to the operating start-up inefficiencies in Hardware & Home Improvement and Global Auto Care from the Kansas and Dayton facility consolidations described above, along with higher input costs, weather-driven unfavorable mix, and the negative impact of the Pet U.S. rawhide safety recall.\nOperating expenses of $225.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 11.6 percent compared to $201.7 million in the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, increased restructuring and related charges, and costs associated with the HRG Group merger.\nOperating income of $43.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 58.9 percent versus $105.1 million last year as a result of lower gross margin, incremental restructuring costs and higher operating expenses. Operating income margin of 5.6 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 830 basis points versus 13.9 percent last year.\nNet income from continuing operations was $0.8 million, or $0.02 diluted EPS, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 57.2 million. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, net income from continuing operations was $39.9 million, or $0.68 diluted EPS, on average diluted shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.0 million. The decrease in net income and diluted EPS was primarily due to higher production costs and higher operating expenses from incremental transaction costs and restructuring expenses. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.56 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 34.9 percent versus $0.86 last year predominantly due to lower gross profit and higher interest expense.\nAs a result of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate due to recently enacted tax reform, fiscal 2018 adjusted EPS reflects a 24.5 percent blended tax rate versus 35.0 percent used in previous years.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $115.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased 27.8 percent compared to $160.2 million in fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of $0.3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange and acquisition EBITDA of $8.5 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $106.8 million decreased 33.3 percent versus the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Reported adjusted EBITDA margin declined 610 basis points to 15.1 percent compared to 21.2 percent last year.\nFiscal 2018 First Half Consolidated Financial Results from Continuing Operations\nNet sales of $1.41 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 4.0 percent compared to $1.36 billion for the same period in fiscal 2017. Excluding the favorable impact of $19.8 million of foreign exchange and acquisition sales of $50.0 million, organic net sales of $1.34 billion in the first half of fiscal 2017 fell 1.2 percent from the prior year.\nOperating income of $77.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2018 decreased 53.6 percent from $166.3 million last year, while operating income margin fell to 5.5 percent versus 12.2 percent in 2017 primarily as a result of lower gross margin, incremental restructuring and acquisition costs, and higher operating expenses.\nNet income from continuing operations was $121.0 million, or $2.09 diluted EPS, in the first six months of fiscal 2018 on average shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 57.4 million. In the first half of fiscal 2017, net income was $52.4 million, or $0.88 diluted EPS, on average shares and common stock equivalents outstanding of 59.3 million. The Company generated adjusted EPS of $0.95 in the first half of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 20.8 percent compared to $1.20 last year primarily as a result of lower gross margin and higher operating expenses.\nFiscal 2018 first half adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of $221.3 million compared to adjusted EBITDA in the first half of fiscal 2017 of $265.4 million. Excluding the unfavorable impact of $1.3 million of foreign exchange and acquisition EBITDA of $17.3 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $205.3 million decreased 22.6 percent in the first half of fiscal 2018 versus the prior year. The reported adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7 percent in the first half of fiscal 2018 fell 380 basis points compared to 19.5 percent in fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter Segment Level Data\nHardware & Home Improvement (HHI)\nThree Month Periods Ended Six Month Periods Ended (in millions, except %) April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 318.5 $ 313.7 $ 4.8 1.5% $ 644.4 $ 602.5 $ 41.9 7.0% Operating Income 19.6 45.5 (25.9) (56.9%) 51.2 92.3 (41.1) (44.5%) Operating Income Margin 6.2% 14.5% (830) bps 7.9% 15.3% (740) bps Adjusted EBITDA 45.5 56.6 (11.1) (19.6%) 105.5 115.8 (10.3) (8.9%) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 14.3% 18.0% (370) bps 16.4% 19.2% (280) bps Higher second quarter net sales were due to continued strong demand in residential security in the U.S. and Canada, largely offset by the distribution capacity constraints described earlier as the second of two distribution center operations was transferred to the new Kansas distribution center at the end of February. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $2.5 million, organic net sales grew 0.7 percent.\nDecreases in second quarter operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins were primarily a result of the operating start-up issues and restructuring costs connected with the U.S. distribution center consolidation project described above, as well as input cost inflation and unfavorable product mix.\nGlobal Pet Supplies (PET)\nThree Month Periods Ended Six Month Periods Ended (in millions, except %) April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 211.2 $ 191.8 $ 19.4 10.1% $ 413.6 $ 386.0 $ 27.6 7.2% Operating Income 14.9 20.1 (5.2) (25.9%) 27.9 39.6 (11.7) (29.5%) Operating Income Margin 7.1% 10.5% (340) bps 6.7% 10.3% (360) bps Adjusted EBITDA 35.7 31.9 3.8 11.9% 69.7 62.7 7.0 11.2% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 16.9% 16.6% 30 bps 16.9% 16.2% 70 bps Second quarter net sales increased as a result of $25.2 million of revenues from the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions completed in June and May 2017, respectively. Partially offsetting the increase was a decline in European dog and cat food sales largely from the planned exit of a pet food customer tolling agreement of $7.1 million, which negatively impacted segment sales by approximately 3.7 percent. U.S. companion animal sales were adversely by an estimated $5.0 million from lost business as a result of the rawhide dog chew product safety recall initiated in June 2017 as well as sluggish store traffic in the pet specialty channel. Excluding the impact of favorable foreign exchange of $8.5 million and acquisition sales of $25.2 million, organic net sales decreased 7.5 percent in the second quarter.\nDecreased operating income and margin were primarily driven by the rawhide recall, related incremental production costs and operating inefficiencies. Adjusted EBITDA and margin increased as a result of the PetMatrix and GloFish acquisitions. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $0.7 million and acquisition EBITDA of $8.5 million, organic adjusted EBITDA of $26.5 million fell 16.9 percent.\nHome and Garden (H&G)\nThree Month Periods Ended Six Month Periods Ended (in millions, except %) April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 118.1 $ 132.0 $ (13.9) (10.5%) $ 167.4 $ 181.7 $ (14.3) (7.9%) Operating Income 20.4 31.5 (11.1) (35.2%) 21.1 33.1 (12.0) (36.3%) Operating Income Margin 17.3% 23.9% (660) bps 12.6% 18.2% (560) bps Adjusted EBITDA 25.3 35.6 (10.3) (28.9%) 30.7 41.3 (10.6) (25.7%) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 21.4% 27.0% (560) bps 18.3% 22.7% (440) bps Lower second quarter net sales were primarily driven by significantly reduced POS and resulting retailer order and promotional delays due to unfavorable weather in March, slightly offset by growth in Latin America. More than 70 percent of POS in the U.S. remains in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018.\nLower operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins decreased predominantly due to reduced volumes and unfavorable product mix.\nGlobal Auto Care (GAC)\nThree Month Periods Ended Six Month Periods Ended (in millions, except %) April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance April 1, 2018 April 2, 2017 Variance Net Sales $ 118.3 $ 119.0 $ (0.7) (0.6%) $ 187.2 $ 188.5 $ (1.3) (0.7%) Operating Income 12.1 34.5 (22.4) (64.9%) 18.8 47.6 (28.8) (60.5%) Operating Income Margin 10.2% 29.0% (1,880) bps 10.0% 25.3% (1,530) bps Adjusted EBITDA 19.8 45.4 (25.6) (56.4%) 34.5 65.2 (30.7) (47.1%) Adjusted EBITDA Margin 16.7% 38.2% (2,150) bps 18.4% 34.6% (1,620) bps Second quarter net sales fell slightly as higher U.S. appearance product revenues were offset by lower performance product and refrigerant sales. Approximately $9 million of Global Auto Care orders were in-house and unable to be shipped at the end of the quarter due to higher order backlogs that developed late in the quarter during work to complete the Dayton facility consolidation project. Cold and wet weather in March also impacted POS and retailer order timing. Excluding favorable foreign exchange impacts of $1.3 million, organic net sales decreased 1.7 percent.\nLower operating income, adjusted EBITDA and margins were predominantly the result of the major operating inefficiencies relating to the Dayton facility start-up and reduced volumes described above, as well as unfavorable mix and higher refrigerant and other input costs.\nFiscal 2018 Second Quarter and First Half Consolidated Financial Results from Discontinued Operations\nSpectrum Brands announced on January 3, 2018 that it was exploring strategic options for its Global Batteries & Appliances (GBA) businesses with the intention to sell the units during 2018. As a result, effective with the Company’s fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results, the GBA segment has been reclassified as held for sale and is now reported as discontinued operations for the second quarter and six months of fiscal 2018 and the comparable prior-year periods.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $0.6 million and diluted EPS of $0.01 from discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased compared to $18.9 million and $0.32, respectively, in fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS from discontinued operations of $0.30 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 fell 9.1 percent compared to $0.33 last year.\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $41.4 million and diluted EPS of $0.72 from discontinued operations in the first half of fiscal 2018 decreased compared to $71.7 million and $1.21, respectively, in fiscal 2017. Adjusted diluted EPS from discontinued operations of $1.05 in the first half of fiscal 2018 fell 12.5 percent compared to $1.20 last year.\nLiquidity and Debt\nSpectrum Brands completed the second quarter of fiscal 2018 on April 1, 2018 with ample liquidity, including a cash balance of approximately $135 million and $210 million available on its $800 million Cash Flow Revolver.\nAs of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company had approximately $4,468 million of debt outstanding, consisting of $571 million on its Cash Flow Revolver and a series of secured Term Loans in the aggregate amount of $1,271 million, $2,343 million of senior unsecured notes, and approximately $283 million of capital leases and other obligations.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nSpectrum Brands expects fiscal 2018 reported net sales from continuing operations to grow above category rates for most categories, along with an anticipated modest positive impact from foreign exchange based upon current rates.\nFiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is now projected to be approximately $600-$617 million versus previous guidance of $657-$674 million and compared to $639 million in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA from discontinued operations is still expected to be approximately $300-$310 million.\nFiscal 2018 adjusted free cash flow is now projected to be approximately $485-$505 million compared to prior guidance of $620-$640 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be between $110 million-$120 million.\nConference Call/Webcast Scheduled for 9:00 A.M.

For more information, visit www.spectrumbrands.com .\nNon-GAAP Measurements\nManagement believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be useful in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior operating periods. Management believes that organic net sales provide for a more complete understanding of underlying business trends of regional and segment performance by excluding the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and the impact of acquisitions. In addition, within this release, including the supplemental information attached hereto, reference is made to adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management to evaluate segment performance and frequently used by the financial community which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA also is one of the measures used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period. Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales of the Company. Organic adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The Company’s management uses adjusted diluted EPS as one means of analyzing the Company’s current and future financial performance and identifying trends in its financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that adjusted diluted EPS is a useful measure for providing further insight into our operating performance because it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. An income tax adjustment is included in adjusted diluted EPS to exclude the impact of the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax-related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate of 35%. The Company’s management believes that adjusted free cash flow is useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company’s ability to service and repay its debt and meet its working capital requirements. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for pretax income, net income, net cash from operating activities or other statement of income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of profitability or liquidity. In addition, the calculation of adjusted free cash flow does not reflect cash used to service debt and therefore, does not reflect funds available for investment or discretionary uses. The Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results. Other Supplemental Information has been provided to demonstrate reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements discussed above to most relevant GAAP financial measurements.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this news release and other oral and written statements by representatives of the Company regarding matters such as statements under “Fiscal 2018 Outlook” and other statements regarding the Company’s ability to meet its expectations for its fiscal 2018 (including expectations regarding capital expenditures and its ability to increase its net sales, free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA) may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

BRANDS HOLDINGS, INC.\nOTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)\nADJUSTED DILUTED EPS\nWe define adjusted diluted EPS as reported diluted EPS excluding the effect of one-time, non-recurring activity and volatility associated with our income tax expense. The Company believes that adjusted diluted EPS provides further insight and comparability in operating performance as it eliminates the effects of certain items that are not comparable from one period to the next. Adjustments to diluted EPS include (1) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from nonrecurring acquisition transactions during the period or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business further summarized below; (2) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives across the segments further summarized below; (3) purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (4) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (5) and other adjustments. During the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2018, other adjustments consisted of estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and transaction costs associated with the HRG Merger. During the three and six month periods ended April 2, 2017, other adjustments consists of transaction costs associated with the HRG Merger. Income tax adjustment to diluted EPS is to exclude the impact of adjusting the valuation allowance against deferred taxes and other tax related items in order to reflect a normalized ongoing effective tax rate, net of adjustments made to diluted EPS. For the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2018, the normalized ongoing effective tax rate was updated to 24.5% to reflect a lower effective tax rate from 35% due to changes in the enacted corporate tax rate in the United States.

We believe this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional and operating segment performance from our activities without the effect of changes in currency exchange rate and/or acquisitions. We use organic net sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional and segment performance. Organic growth is calculated by comparing organic net sales to reported net sales in the prior year. The effect of changes in currency exchange rates is determined by translating the period’s net sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect during the prior period. Net sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. We exclude net sales from acquired businesses in the current year for which there are no comparable sales in the prior period.

Further, adjusted EBITDA is a measure used for determining the Company’s debt covenant. EBITDA is calculated by excluding the Company’s income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation expense and amortization expense (from intangible assets) from net income. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes: (1) stock based compensation expense as it is a non-cash based compensation cost; (2) acquisition and integration costs that consist of transaction costs from acquisition transactions during the period, or subsequent integration related project costs directly associated with the acquired business as previously summarized; (3) restructuring and related costs, which consist of project costs associated with restructuring initiatives as previously summarized; (4) non-cash purchase accounting inventory adjustments recognized in earnings subsequent to an acquisition; (5) non-cash asset impairments or write-offs realized; (6) and other adjustments. During the three and six month periods ended April 1, 2018, other adjustments consist of estimated costs for a non-recurring voluntary recall of rawhide product by the PET segment and transaction costs associated with the HRG Merger. During the three and six month periods ended April 2, 2017, other adjustments consist of transaction costs associated with the HRG Merger. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of reported net sales for the respective period. Organic adjusted EBITDA is calculated by excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and adjusted EBITDA contributed from acquired businesses in the current year.
