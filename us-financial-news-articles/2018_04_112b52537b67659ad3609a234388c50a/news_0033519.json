It presented a restructuring plan to its commercial creditors in March.\n“We are making dialogue with the creditors and we are looking at what should be done, naturally this is a complex process,” said Nyusi, speaking through a translator at international think tank Chatham House in London.\n“It is a complex process because it is not only Mozambique to be seen as a culprit....this loan was from a certain place, they were not aware we are just giving this, due diligence should have been done, so this is a responsibility that should be shared,” he added.
