The Interior Ministry in North Rhine-Westphalia would neither confirm nor deny the report. \nBode said investigators were looking at the possibility that other suspects fled the scene, though they had no evidence that this was the case, he added. \nBild newspaper said police were searching for two possible additional suspects after witnesses said they had seen two people jump out of the van. Jens R. had no police record, the newspaper said. \n“The crime scene investigators are checking out the crime scene, trying to identify, investigate and secure traces. That is our current task,” Bode said. \n\nPolice stands guard in a street near a place where a man drove a van into a group of people sitting outside a popular restaurant in the old city centre of Muenster, Germany, April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Leon Kuegeler A police spokeswoman said: “The danger is over.” \nMartin Wiech, who said he had studied in Muenster, told Der Spiegel he had driven to Muenster to go shopping and was now unable to return to his car. \n“Unbelievable that something like this could happen in Muenster. It is one of the most peaceful cities I know,” he said. \nMERKEL “SHAKEN” The incident came one year to the day after a truck attack in Stockholm that killed five people. \nIt also evoked memories of a December 2016 truck attack in Berlin that killed 12. In that attack, Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck, killed the driver and then plowed into a crowded marketplace, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others. \nChancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was “deeply shaken”. \n\nSlideshow (17 Images) “Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,” she added. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “All my thoughts are with the victims of the attack in Muenster. France shares in Germany’s suffering.” \nDer Spiegel reported that police were investigating a similar incident that occurred in the eastern German city of Cottbus on Friday evening, when a man drove his car into a group of people, injuring two, before fleeing. \nAdditional reporting by Sabine Siebold and Andrea Shalal in Berlin, Matthias Inverardi in Duesseldorf, and Sarah White in Paris; Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Dale Hudson and Hugh  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T17:58:53.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
