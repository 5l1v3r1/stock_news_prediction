REUTERS/Kenny Katombe/File Photo Lourenco succeeded Dos Santos last September, pledging to tackle an endemic culture of corruption and bring economic reforms to Angola, Africa’s second biggest producer of crude oil, which is marred by widespread poverty despite its oil wealth.\nGeneral Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda, the head of the armed forces before his sacking, was named by prosecutors last month as a suspect in an investigation of a scheme to negotiate a fraudulent international credit line of $50 billion.\nAndré de Oliveira Sango, a long-time Dos Santos loyalist, was made foreign intelligence chief over a decade ago.\nTheir sackings were announced in a presidential decree broadcast on the national public radio station.
