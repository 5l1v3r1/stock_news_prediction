Although Fortune is first and foremost a place for business journalism, we range beyond business narrowly defined to put a spotlight on government officials, chiefs of NGOs, clergy, coaches, athletes, artists, educators—anyone who has used their influence and status to make a difference in the wider world. One of our premises is that anyone who wants to lead in business can learn lessons from anyone leading anywhere. \nThat said, there’s always a place for business leaders on this list, too, and this year is no exception: We feature 12 CEOs (or holders of equivalent posts with different titles), from six countries, who we think are exemplary. Here’s who you’ll find on the list ( click to the feature itself to learn more about them and the rest of the Top 50): \nKenneth Frazier , Merck (#5). At a sensitive time for the pharmaceutical industry, he took a bold social and political stand. \nLarry Fink , BlackRock (#8). The chief of the world’s biggest asset manager is now leaning on other CEOs to put their money where their principles are. \nMary Barra , General Motors (#11). Tesla may get all the headlines, but Barra is positioning GM well for a future of driverless (and electric) cars. \nTim Cook , Apple (#14). He has helped turn Apple into a phenomenal cash-generating machine, without sacrificing innovation. \nHuateng ‘Pony’ Ma , Tencent (#19). China’s wealthiest man is turning Tencent into a global player whose reach goes far beyond its own products. \nMarc Benioff , Salesforce (#21). Few can match Benioff’s combination of imagination in business and zeal in social advocacy. \nMukesh Ambani , Reliance Industries (#24). In less than two years, he has turned India’s cellphone market upside down. \nOprah Winfrey , OWN (#27). Long after her talk show went off the air, her spreading media empire ensures she’s an influential presence in countless U.S. homes. \nJamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase (#33). One of the business world’s most tireless advocates for tax reform is now figuring out how to deploy a tax-cut windfall. \nDaniel Servitje Montull , Grupo Bimbo (#36). The head of the world’s largest baking company is fighting to make his product more accessible and more earth-friendly. \nFeike Sijbesma , DSM (#44). At the helm of a Dutch speciality chemical maker, he’s gone farther than any other executive in giving his company a planet-friendly overhaul. \nAna Botin , Banco Santander (#46). She has turned Spain’s Santander into a pillar of strength in Europe’s still shaky banking world. \nThis article is part of the World’s 50 Greatest Leaders feature, our annual list of world-changing leaders in business, government, philanthropy and beyond.
