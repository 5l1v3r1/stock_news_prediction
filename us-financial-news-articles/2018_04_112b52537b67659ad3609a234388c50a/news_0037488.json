Financials are up because they do better in a higher rate environment.” \nWhen yields are high, investors favor bonds over defensive sectors such as consumer staples and real estate, which promise high dividends and slow growth. But banks benefit as high interest rates can boost their profits. \nAt 2:57 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 118.81 points, or 0.48 percent, to 24,629.26, the S&P 500 lost 19.2 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,689.44 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 62.93 points, or 0.86 percent, to 7,232.31. \nThe S&P consumer staples sector was the benchmark’s biggest drag, down 3.3 percent, led by Philip Morris’ 15.4-percent slide. Altria was down 6.5 percent. \nProcter & Gamble shares were down 3 percent after it said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins. \nApple shares fell 2.7 percent, with analysts telling Reuters that TSMC’s warning was related to the iPhone maker. It was the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq. \nTSMC’s U.S.-listed shares fell 6.4 percent, while the Philadelphia SE semiconductor index tumbled 4.3 percent. \nA 1.3-percent rise in the S&P’s financial sector, was supported by a 7.3 percent jump in American Express shares due to strong earnings as well as climbing yields. \nBut rising bond yields hurt homebuilders and the PHLX housing index was down 2.8 percent. \nOf the 52 companies among the S&P 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8 percent topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.51-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.73-to-1 ratio favored decliners. \nThe S&P 500 posted 23 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and 47 new lows.
