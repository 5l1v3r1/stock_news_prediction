REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\nReuters’ monthly asset allocation poll of 18 European asset managers was conducted between April 16-26, when technology shares worldwide experienced a sharp sell off on concerns of greater regulatory scrutiny and slowing smartphone demand.\nAt the same time, investors were dumping U.S. bonds, worried about the growing supply of government debt and inflationary pressures from rising oil prices. This led to 10-year yields US10YT=RR breaking above 3 percent for the first time in four years.\nThis rise in volatility made poll participants more cautious - they trimmed their overall equity allocation by 0.6 percentage points to 43.6 percent in April, the lowest level since August.\nEuropean managers also cut their U.S. stocks exposure to 36.4 percent of their global equity portfolios, also an eight-month low, and down from 38 percent in January.\nU.S. tech stocks plumbed two-month lows in April, although the index is still set to end the month in the black. The pull-back followed a volatile March, when the S&P tech sector .SPLRCT fell almost 4 percent.\nMichele Morganti, senior equity strategist at Generali Investments, noted that IT company earnings were well above their historical trend, even more so for those in the S&P 500.\nBut based on current earnings estimates and market multiples, the 14 biggest IT stocks by capitalisation looked relatively overvalued, he argued, putting the S&P 500 at risk, especially if future earnings growth comes under pressure.\n“In this respect, we estimate the downside potential for the S&P at around 5 percent in the short term,” he said, adding that increased regulatory pressure, and competition from new technologies or emerging market companies could induce “a more prolonged negative scenario”.\nYet just under two-thirds of poll participants who answered a question on leading tech stocks, including the FANGs - Facebook ( FB.O ), Amazon ( AMZN.O ), Netflix ( NFLX.O ) and Google owner Alphabet ( GOOGL.O ) - thought the pullback was only temporary.\nSandra Crowl, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac, said short-term weakness was an opportunity to buy into the shares of some tech firms, such as Facebook, which benefit from the winner-takes-all phenomenon.\nHowever, Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Prime Partners, said he had reduced his IT overweight to neutral, as he expected the FANGs to go through a consolidation phase.\nIn fixed income, poll participants cut their overall bond holdings by 1.7 percentage points to 40.4 percent of their global portfolios, a three-month low. They also trimmed U.S. bond holdings to 20 percent, down from 20.7 percent in March.\n“We see bond yields in developed markets ticking higher as growth expectations rise, global output gaps close and as wage growth rises from its current very low base,” Boris Willems, a strategist at UBS Asset Management, said.\nInvestors raised exposure to alternatives by one percentage point to 8.4 percent, the highest since October 2016. They also raised emerging debt allocations to 16.6 percent, from March’s 15.1 percent, but trimmed exposure to emerging equities to 17.1 percent from last month’s 17.4 percent.\nRobeco strategist Peter van der Welle said emerging equities looked like a crowded trade after a good run under the low volatility regime: “Now that global growth is about to become less synchronised, the transition to a higher volatility regime could especially hurt emerging stocks,” he said.
