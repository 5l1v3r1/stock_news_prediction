It was important to initiate this conversation,” Sanchit Sethi, founder of StayUncle, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n“We wanted people to see how real the problem of trafficking is ... how victims are affected. In our understanding, there was no better way than creating a fake website. It is only through technology that you can reach the masses.”\nHotels and home rental services such as Airbnb have launched measures to tackle trafficking as concerns mount over their properties being used to exploit vulnerable women and girls.\nMore than 8,000 cases of human trafficking were reported in India in 2016, up 20 percent on the previous year, government data shows.\nThe website listed about a dozen girls and their physical attributes, adding that some had joined voluntarily while others were “procured from remote areas of India such as Assam and West Bengal by trusted brokers and promised big dreams”.\n“Getting laid could never be easier,” it promised.\nSubscribers then received an email explaining that thousands of women are forced into sex slavery in India, calling for greater awareness to bring about change.\nMany poor victims from rural areas are lured by traffickers with promises of good jobs, only to find themselves sold to brothels, forced to work in fields or brick kilns or enslaved in homes as domestic workers.\nStaylaid.com’s offer of girls “suited for every taste, every demand and every pocket” provoked strong reactions on social media, with #StopWomenTrafficking trending on Twitter until late Tuesday night.\n“It was surprising that people started talking about it on Twitter - but the fact is that people wanted to use it,” said 29-year-old Sethi.\nLaunched in 2015, StayUncle helps “privacy-starved lovers” find accommodation in about 900 partner hotels across India, where premarital sex is frowned upon.\nHasina Kharbhih, founder of anti-trafficking charity, Impulse NGO Network, called on StayUncle to work more closely with established campaigners.\n“Their idea might be good, but there was much confusion in the anti-trafficking sector last night on whether this was real,” she said.\nReporting by Roli Srivastava @Rolionaroll; Editing by Katy Migiro.
