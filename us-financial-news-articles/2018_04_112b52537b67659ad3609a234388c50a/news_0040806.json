In addition to the WeedMD shareholder approval, the Transaction is also subject to the receipt of certain regulatory, court and stock exchange approvals and certain other closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature.\nThe Arrangement Agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each of WeedMD and Hiku. The financial advisor to Hiku, BMO Capital Markets, has provided an opinion to the board of directors of Hiku that, subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set out in such opinion, the Exchange Ratio provided for in the Arrangement Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Hiku.
