The U.S. Pacific Command’s CBP missions, which have been routinely employed since March 2004, are in accordance with international law.”\nAn Air Force spokeswoman said: “This was a routine mission”.\nThe exercise was reported in Taiwanese media this week, which speculated it could have been a warning from the United States to China following China’s stepped-up military presence around Taiwan, the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own.\nChinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian was asked about the U.S. bombers at a news briefing on Thursday but would only say Chinese armed forces had the situation under control and would defend the country’s sovereignty, as always.\nOn Friday, the ministry referred Reuters to Wu’s previous statement, without elaborating.\nChina has been issuing increasingly strident warnings to Taiwan to toe the line and has been flying military aircraft around the island in what China calls “encirclement patrols”.\nBeijing fears Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wants to push for the island’s formal independence. Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo and peace with China.\nThe widely read Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said in an editorial on Friday if the U.S. bombers were meant to send a message to Beijing about Taiwan it would not work.\n“The U.S. cannot prevent the mainland exerting military pressure on Taiwan,” it said.\n“Mainland military aircraft will fly closer and closer to Taiwan and in the end fly above the island,” the paper said.\n“If the Taiwan authorities openly promote the ‘Taiwan independence’ policy and cut off all official contacts with the mainland, the mainland will deem Taiwan a hostile regime and has endless means to deal with it.”\nTaiwan and the South China Sea are two major faultlines between Washington and Beijing.\nChina has been angered by U.S. “freedom of navigation” patrols in the disputed South China Sea, where China has reclaimed land for military bases, and by U.S. support for democratic Taiwan.\nAs part of China’s military modernisation, its new aircraft carrier could soon begin sea trials, according to images on Chinese news portals this week of the vessel leaving its dock in the northern city of Dalian.\nOn Friday, the government warned shipping to keep away from an area off Dalian for a week, for what it called military activities, but gave no further explanation.\nReporting by Tim Kelly and Ben Blanchard; Editing by Paul Tait and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T04:58:03.055+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
