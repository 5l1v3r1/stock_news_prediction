In New Zealand, only 10 people used the app, but Facebook said Tuesday that they exposed the data of over 63,000 people in that country. \nFacebook removed that capability from third-party apps in 2015, following criticism over its privacy implications. But by that time, many app developers had been able scrape extensive data that they may still have. \nFacebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg claimed last week that the company “did not think enough about the abuse cases” that could arise from its lax privacy settings, because it was “way too idealistic.” \n“The idea that this was unforeseeable seems like a stretch,” Hughes said at the FT event. “The public reckoning now is very much overdue.” \nZuckerberg’s prepared testimony for his appearance before the House’s energy and commerce committee, states that Facebook is “in the process of investigating every app that had access to a large amount of information before we locked down our platform in 2014.” \n“If we detect suspicious activity, we’ll do a full forensic audit,” Zuckerberg will say. “And if we find that someone is improperly using data, we’ll ban them and tell everyone affected.” \nThe problem with the modern data economy is that no amount of action by Facebook (fb) now will effectively retrieve and contain the information that is already out there. Many of those app developers will have sold the data on to brokers and other third parties, and indeed some of those startups will have sold themselves in the interim period, with the data they held being one of their most saleable assets.
