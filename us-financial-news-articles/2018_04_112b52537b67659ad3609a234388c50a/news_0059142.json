The annual report on Form 20-F, which contains TechFaith's audited financial statements, can be accessed on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or on the Company's investor relations website at www.techfaithwireless.com .\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, TechFaith reported total net revenues of US$46.8 million compared to US$61.0 million for the full year ended December 31, 2016. The decline primarily reflects lower revenue in the Company's mobile phone business, which was negatively impacted by softness in the overall China handset market. Gross profit for the full year 2017 was US$9.8 million, compared to US$12.5 million for the full year 2016. Gross margin for the full year 2017 was 20.9%, compared to 20.4% for the full year 2016. Operating expenses for the full year 2017 were US$15.6 million compared to US$15.9 million for the full year 2016. Net loss attributed to TechFaith for the full year 2017 was US$9.3 million, or US$0.88 per basic and diluted weighted average outstanding ADS, compared to a net income of US$10.1 million, or US$0.96 per basic and diluted weighted average outstanding ADS, for the full year 2016.\nTechFaith also announced the appointment of the Company's CEO, Mr. Deyou Dong, to the additional role of Chairman of the Board. Mr. Deyou Dong succeeds Mr. Defu Dong, who has served as the Chairman of the Board since founding the Company in 2002. The Company also announced the retirement of Ms. Ling (Shelly) Sui, 63 years old, who has served as an independent director since 2007.\nMr. Defu Dong, TechFaith's outgoing Chairman of the Board, commented, \"I am proud of what TechFaith has accomplished over the past 16 years. Our team has successfully navigated challenging markets and established an impressive track record in our core business areas. I would like to thank our Board, management, employees, customers and investors for their support and wish everyone continued success.\"\nMr. Deyou Dong, TechFaith's Chairman and CEO, said, \"I am grateful to Mr. Defu Dong for his tireless contributions, dedication, vision and leadership since he founded the Company back in 2002. We remain focused on building upon the legacy he has established. We are also appreciative of Ms. Shelly Sui's contributions as a director, and we wish her and her family all the best. We are optimistic entering 2018 as we work to deliver greater value to shareholders as the asset base TechFaith has built is more properly valued for its cash flow potential and the higher appreciated value of the land and buildings in the Company's portfolio. We also expect the Company will continue to execute on the anticipated revitalization of its mobile phone business.\"\nAbout TechFaith\nTechFaith (NASDAQ: CNTF) is a developer, owner and operator of commercial real estate properties across China as well as a China-based mobile solutions provider for the global mobile handsets market.
