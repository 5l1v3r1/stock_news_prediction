He returned and hit third Saturday, going 2-for-5 with a strikeout.\nAndrew Benintendi also had three RBIs and J.D. Martinez hit a solo homer and drove in two runs total for Boston, which continued its offensive onslaught with a seventh straight game with six or more runs for its 12th victory in 13 attempts.\nCobb (0-1), a Massachusetts native who spent his first six MLB seasons with Tampa Bay before signing with Baltimore, struggled mightily in a park in which he has fared well historically. He allowed eight runs (seven earned) on 10 hits — including two homers — and a walk in 3 2/3 innings.\nThe right-hander was 5-1 with a 3.15 ERA in seven starts at Fenway Park before Saturday.\nPedro Alvarez drove in a pair of runs and Chance Sicso added an RBI for Baltimore, which suffered its fifth loss in seven games.\nBoston starter Hector Velazquez (2-0) earned the victory with five innings of two-run ball, giving up six hits and walking one while striking out five.\nThe Red Sox lost All-Star right fielder Mookie Betts to a foot injury in the first inning during a collision at home plate. Betts was diagnosed with a left foot contusion and his X-rays came back negative.\nBoston scored three runs in the first and four in the fourth to build a 8-0 lead before Baltimore scored twice in the fifth. Single runs in the sixth and seventh for the Red Sox put any hopes of an Orioles comeback to rest.\nBoston ace left-hander Chris Sale (1-0, 1.06 ERA) opposes Baltimore right-hander Dylan Bundy (0-1, 1.35 ERA) in the third game of the weekend series Sunday afternoon.\n— Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:02:25.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
