The importer dollar demand has eased,” said a currency dealer. \n“There were demand for longer tenure bonds like 10-year t-bonds after the no-confidence vote ended yesterday.” \nThe central bank governor, after the policy rate announcement on Wednesday, said if the inflation rate can be maintained between 4-5 percent, the depreciation in the rupee would be around 2-3 percent. \nDealers expect pressure on the currency to ease with more inward remittances ahead of the traditional New Year on April 14. \nThe currency has recovered and risen 0.6 percent since it hit a record low of 156.20 per dollar on March 16. The rupee has weakened 1.3 percent so far this year after declining 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nA gradual depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility are expected this year on account of debt repayments by the government, dealers have said. \nThe International Monetary Fund in March said that Sri Lanka’s economy remained vulnerable to adverse shocks due to its large public debt and low external buffers. \nThe government must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.68 billion) in 2018 - a record - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 4.8 billion rupees ($30.9 million) so far this year through March 28, central bank data showed.
