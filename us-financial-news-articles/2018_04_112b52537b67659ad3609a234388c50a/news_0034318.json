Speakers at rallies across the EU country in recent weeks have criticised him for ineffectiveness in prosecuting corruption.\nDrucker said he had found no grounds to fire the police chief and had not asked him to resign.\n“I don’t think it would be right for me to directly fire Gaspar (despite) the polarisation he’s causing. If I should increase the polarisation instead of neutralising it, I have no right to remain as minister,” Drucker told reporters.\nThe former health minister said he would leave politics altogether.\nPRESSURE FROM BOTH SIDES President Andrej Kiska, a long-time adversary of Fico, said when appointing the new cabinet last month that he had agreed with Drucker that a change in the police leadership was needed.\nGaspar has won the backing of new Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini who said on the weekend he was a top professional.\n“It’s the minister who appoints and removes the police chief but it’s not entirely up to him, the decision is usually a result of political negotiations,” political analyst Martin Slosiarik said.\n“Robert Fico, whose Smer party has been losing voter support in past weeks, is gesturing towards his core voters who want to see him as a strong leader not bowing to pressure.”\nGaspar said he was surprised by Drucker’s resignation and would evaluate the situation.\nPeople on the streets have demanded the police chief’s removal as an assurance that Kuciak’s murder will be investigated thoroughly. They see Gaspar as too close to Smer and Kalinak.\nSome of Kuciak’s reporting dealt with deals between the government and Slovakia’s biggest privately-owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar. The police chief has denied any wrongdoing.\nNo senior Slovakian politician has gone to prison for corruption in the past decade, according to Transparency International. The special prosecutor in charge of cases of alleged abuse of power among public servants and politicians personally oversaw 61 cases from 2009 to 2017 but did not press criminal charges in any.\nBut in a case handled by another prosecutor last year, two ex-ministers were sentenced to nine and 12 years for rigging a public tender in 2007. Both remain free pending appeal.\nReporting by Tatiana Jancarikova; Writing by Jan Lopatka; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:22:49.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
