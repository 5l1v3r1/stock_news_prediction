Dasht-i Archi has been largely under the control of Taliban fighters and many details about the strike were unclear.\nHowever health officials in Kunduz city said five dead and 40 wounded had been brought into city hospitals.\nA statement from the Taliban said the strike killed 150 religious scholars and civilians and denied that any of its forces were present.\n“There is no truth in this claim by the enemy that members of the Islamic Emirate were present at the ceremony or that members of the Taliban Council went there,” the statement said.\nArmy Colonel Lisa Garcia, U.S. Forces-Afghanistan spokesperson, said U.S. forces had not carried out any attacks in the area.\n“U.S. Forces-Afghanistan did not conduct air strikes in Kunduz province today. Any claims to the contrary are baseless,” she said in an emailed statement.\nThe incident nonetheless underlined one of the risks of the greater use of air power under the new U.S. strategy announced last year to try to force the Taliban to the negotiating table.\nBuilding up the fledgling Afghan air force (AAF) has been a major priority for the NATO-led Resolute Support training and advisory mission in Afghanistan and the AAF has had increasing success in supporting ground forces.\nBut civilian casualties caused by the air strikes have risked undermining public support for the campaign.\nRecent figures from the United Nations have shown a rise in the number of civilian casualties caused by air strikes even while the total number of civilian casualties has declined.\nReporting by Sardar Razmal; writing by James Mackenzie; Editing by Gareth Jones and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T17:45:44.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
