An evening session would be needed if we decide to trade in foreign shares. For now this plan is at the stage of discussion.” (Reporting by Zlata Garasyuta Writing by Christian Lowe and Polina Nikolskaya Editing by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T20:01:25.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
