The S&P 500 fell 0.71 percent to 2,595.96 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.81 percent at 6,885.06.\nThe declines were broad based, with 23 of the Dow’s 30 components lower. The industrials index’s 1.4 percent slide was the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, as has been the case since the trade war fears surfaced.\nWhile Washington’s list covered many obscure industrial items, Beijing’s covers 106 key U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, and chemicals.\nShares of Boeing, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, tumbled 3.8 percent. Caterpillar fell 3 percent.\nFord, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler fell between 0.2 percent and 0.8 percent as investors weighed the competing impacts on their global operations and production.\nWhile manufacturers were the bigger losers as a group, the technology sector’s 1.3 percent drop weighed the most on the market.\nMajor tech names Apple and the FANG group – Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet were down between 0.3 percent and 2.9 percent.\nChipmakers, many of which have the highest revenue exposure to China among S&P 500 companies, also fell. 28 of the 30 constituents of the Philadelphia semiconductor index were lower.\n“As a sector, technology has the most to lose from a world in which global trade is restricted and of course, some of the subjects of the tariffs, will also be hit,” said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.\nAmong the few bright spots was housebuilder Lennar, whose shares jumped 6.8 percent after it reported quarterly revenue that beat estimates as it sold more homes at higher prices.
