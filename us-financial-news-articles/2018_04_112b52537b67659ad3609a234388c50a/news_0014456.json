It’s totally ridiculous.”\nTrain strikes due to start at 1900CET (17GMT) and lasting through to the early hours of Tuesday spelled more chaos for commuters and travelers at the beginning of some mid-term school holidays in France.\nThe rolling strikes, called in protest at Macron’s bid to modernize the state-run rail company SNCF, through a reform that would end job-for-life guarantees for workers, are set to last until June.\nOn Sunday, some 35 percent of the workers needed for the network to run smoothly were expected to be absent, SNCF officials said on Saturday. That compares to a 48 percent absentee rate during strikes last Tuesday and Wednesday.\nSlideshow (2 Images) One in five high-speed TGV trains were set to run on Sunday, while three out of four international Eurostar and Thalys routes would be operational, the SNCF said.\nReporting by Michaela Cabrera and Myriam Rivet, Writing by Sarah White; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T18:50:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
