(NASDAQ: AGII ), an international underwriter of specialty insurance and reinsurance products, today released its digital 2017 Annual Report . In addition to highlighting Argo’s diverse product portfolio, strong investment results and growth in gross written premium, the report provides insights from leading industry experts on the future of insurance.\n“2017 was an important year for Argo,” writes Argo Group CEO Mark E. Watson III in his letter to shareholders. “Despite significant, industry-wide catastrophe claims and underwriting challenges in the London market, our balance sheet held up well, and we finished the year in a better competitive position than we started.”\nWatson points out that Argo Group served its customers faithfully through its claims handling. “The resulting losses affected our bottom line,” he writes, “but they also remind us that we are fulfilling our mission: We’re here to help businesses stay in business.”\nWatson’s letter also focuses on the future of insurance – a future in which Watson says Argo is uniquely positioned to excel. “For more than a decade, we have been anticipating the transformation currently underway in our industry, predicting the unavoidable disruption of our value chain, service delivery and capital structure,” writes Watson. “Specialty insurance lives at the crossroads of new ideas and new threats. We are confident specialty underwriters will continue growing in importance as a critical support for new enterprises, enabling entrepreneurs to mitigate the considerable risks associated with early adoption of new technologies.”\nIn addition, Watson discusses the ways in which Argo is building its digital expertise, developing new software, investing in leading and emerging technologies, and partnering with startups. He also notes Argo’s emphasis on attracting, developing and retaining a new generation of talent.\nThe full digital report can be viewed at: http://www.argolimited.com/reports/2017-annual-report .\nABOUT ARGO GROUP INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS, LTD.\nArgo Group International Holdings, Ltd.
