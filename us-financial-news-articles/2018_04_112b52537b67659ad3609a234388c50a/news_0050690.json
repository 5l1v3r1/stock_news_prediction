(NYSE: FBHS), an industry-leading home and security products company, today announced first quarter 2018 results.\n“In the first quarter our teams delivered solid results despite the headwind from a more normal winter weather pattern, and I am especially pleased with the strong performance of our Global Plumbing Group,” said Chris Klein, chief executive officer, Fortune Brands. “With overall housing demand indicators intact, company results meeting our expectations, the benefit from recent share repurchases and the full benefit from our pricing and targeted cost actions still to come, we are increasing our EPS outlook.”\nFirst Quarter 2018\nFor 2018, sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of 6 percent over 2017. Earnings per share were $0.49, compared to $0.50 in the prior-year quarter. EPS before charges/gains were $0.56, compared to $0.53 the same quarter last year. Operating income was $119.4 million, compared to $111.0 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating income before charges/gains was $124.3 million, compared to $118.1 million the same quarter last year, up 5 percent.\n“We see strong momentum coming out of the new Global Plumbing Group team and their strategy, along with share gains in doors and security, and have again taken advantage of the opportunity to repurchase our shares at attractive prices,” Klein said.\nFor each segment in 2018, compared to the prior-year quarter:\nPlumbing sales increased 19 percent with strong, double digit growth across all channels. Excluding recent acquisitions, sales increased 16 percent. Operating margin before charges/gains was 20.5 percent, an increase of 210 basis points. Cabinet sales declined 3 percent versus the prior year. Excluding exits from targeted U.S. homecenter and Canadian business in the prior year, cabinet sales increased 1 percent. Segment operating margin before charges/gains was 4.3 percent. Door sales were up 8 percent and overcame a strong prior year comparison, led by double digit growth in the wholesale channel. Operating margin before charges/gains increased 470 basis points to 12.5 percent. Security sales were up 4 percent versus the prior year, driven by solid growth in U.S. retail and commercial. Operating margin before charges/gains was 11.1 percent.\nThe Company announced that 2018 year-to-date share repurchases now total $400 million paid for approximately 6.4 million shares, of which $350 million occurred in the first quarter. “Cash was $244 million and net debt to EBITDA was 1.9 times at the end of the quarter. Along with our solid operating performance, we continue to have substantial flexibility to create incremental shareholder value through acquisitions and additional share repurchases,” said Patrick Hallinan, chief financial officer, Fortune Brands.\nAnnual Outlook for 2018\nThe Company’s 2018 annual outlook continues to be based on a U.S. home products market growth assumption of 5 to 7 percent and an assumption of 5 to 6 percent growth for the total global market. The Company expects full-year 2018 sales growth in the range of 6 to 7 percent.\nThe Company increased its outlook for EPS before charges/gains to be in the range of $3.58 to $3.70, which compares to 2017 EPS before charges/gains from continuing operations of $3.08.\n“We are off to a solid start to the year despite the impact of winter weather, and the demand for our home and security products remains strong,” said Klein. “Overall we are growing in-line or above our market growth rate, and we now enter the busy spring selling season with the continued emphasis on growing profitably. We also remain sharply focused on driving incremental shareholder value, as we are busy evaluating a healthy pipeline of potential acquisitions as well as additional opportunities to repurchase our shares at very attractive prices,” said Klein.\nThe Company also expects to generate free cash flow of approximately $525 - $550 million for the full year 2018.\nAbout Fortune Brands\nFortune Brands Home & Security, Inc.

Reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to GAAP diluted EPS guidance cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to gains and losses associated with our defined benefit plans and restructuring and other charges, which are excluded from the diluted EPS before charges/gains. In addition, the Company's GAAP EPS range assumes the Company incurs no gains or losses associated with its defined benefit plans during 2018.\n(b) (d) For definitions of Non-GAAP measures, see Definitions of Terms page\nFORTUNE BRANDS HOME & SECURITY, INC.
