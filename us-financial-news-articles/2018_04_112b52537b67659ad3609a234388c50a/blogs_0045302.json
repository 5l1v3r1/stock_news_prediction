Photo: Reuters \nA growing share of U.S. executives is planning to pursue an acquisition within the next 12 months, buoyed by the certainty provided by the U.S. tax reform late last year, according to a new report by Ernst & Young LLP.\nThe survey, part of the bi-annual Global Capital Confidence Barometer report, shows that 54% of U.S. executives plan to pursue a merger or acquisition transaction within the next 12 months, up from 42% in the prior report six months ago.\nEY surveyed more than 500 U.S. executives as part of a wider panel of 2,500 respondents from 43 countries interviewed in March and April.\n“Clearly we are seeing a bit of a boost from tax reform,” said William Casey, Americas Vice Chair of transaction advisory services for EY. “Eliminating some of that uncertainty helped.”\nThe U.S. tax overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. The new tax law, completed in December, also opened the way for companies to bring back profits stowed away in foreign subsidiaries at a lower tax rate.\nMr. Casey said ultimately companies look for deals because of strategic reasons and not based on tax concerns. But the lower corporate tax rate, coupled with readily available credit and economic growth has propelled executives’ confidence in deal making, he said.\nThe top U.S. investment destination was Brazil, according to the report, a country that has seen some political and economic turmoil in recent years.\nThe South American country endured its worst recession on record during the two-year period between 2015 and 2016. Brazil’s   retreated 3.8% in 2015, followed by a 3.6% contraction in 2016.\nAnd earlier this month the country’s former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva began a 12-year sentence for corruption and money laundering.\n“They are coming out of a very tough recessionary period,” Mr. Casey said. However, taking a long term view, “the demographics are extremely positive. You are looking at an increasing number of college educated people (in Brazil),” Mr. Casey said.\nBrazil’s economy returned to growth in 2017, expanding 1.0%. The International Monetary Fund estimates the economy will expand 1.9% in 2018.\nShare this: M&A Previous The Morning Ledger: U.S. Companies Turn to Teens Amid Labor Shortage  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T17:54:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
