FILE PHOTO: Tehran Prosecutor General Saeed Mortazavi attends a news conference in Tehran April 19, 2009. REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi/File Photo \nAgents detained former Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi in northern Iran and were taking him to prison to serve his sentence, the judiciary’s news website Mizanonline reported. \nMortazavi was sentenced to two years in prison in late 2017 for complicity in the death of a man arrested after the pro-reform protests. Mortazavi had denied the charge. \nAfter Iranian media reported last week that Mortazavi had gone missing instead of turning himself in to serve his sentence, activists put up wanted posters of the hardline figure, whose role in curbing dissent has been condemned by human rights groups for years. \nDuring Mortazavi’s tenure three detainees were killed and many tortured in a detention centre south of Tehran after the 2009 nationwide demonstrations, according to human rights campaigners. \nMortazavi first gained widespread attention in the early 2000s for his role in closing a number of reformist newspapers while heading the revolutionary court during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami, who was despised by conservative hardliners for trying to liberalise the Islamic Republic. \nZahra Kazemi, an Iranian-Canadian photo journalist, died in Tehran’s Evin prison in 2003 in the midst of this crackdown on critical media. The Canadian government said Kazemi was tortured to death and accused Mortazavi of direct involvement. Mortazavi has denied the accusation.
