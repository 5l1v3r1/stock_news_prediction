Bracken as managing director of Government and Mortgage Industry Relations, tasked with representing the company across the mortgage marketplace, as well as interfacing with legislators, regulators, executives and analysts to build a consensus on stronger credit scoring standards and solutions for lenders and consumers.\n“I’d like to thank Barrett and the VantageScore team for welcoming me into this role,” said Bracken. “The mortgage ecosystem rests on dependable yet innovative credit scoring, and I look forward to doing my part in helping move the industry forward for lenders and consumers alike.”\nA senior financial services executive, Bracken holds more than 40 years of experience in leading large financial institutions and managing complex government and industry relations initiatives. Bracken was most recently Chief Policy Officer & Head of Government and Industry Relations at Radian Guaranty, where he developed policy and managed relations between government regulators, consumer groups, and trade associations.\n“Phil is widely acknowledged as one of the most thoughtful and driven executives in the mortgage industry and has earned enormous respect over the course of his career,” said Barrett Burns, President and CEO of VantageScore Solutions, LLC. “We are honored to welcome Phil to our team and excited for him to bring his unmatched experience and skillset to continue building strong relationships between VantageScore and industry stakeholders.”\nPrior to joining Radian, Bracken was executive vice president of the Home Mortgage and Consumer Finance Group at Wells Fargo, President and CEO of Prudential Home Mortgage’s Lender’s Service, Inc. and Private Label Mortgage Service Corporation. Additionally, Bracken founded America’s Mortgage Company in 1980, serving as President and CEO for 11 years.\nA recipient of several lifetime achievement awards from mortgage industry associations, Bracken has also served in several leadership roles for organizations such as the Mortgage Bankers Association, National Association of Real Estate Brokers and the Consumer Lender Roundtable of Washington D.C.\nAbout VantageScore Solutions\nCredit scores can impact many aspects of your life, everything from whether you are able to get a loan and how much interest you will have to pay to whether you are able to rent an apartment.\nVantageScore Solutions, LLC ( www.VantageScore.com ) is the independently managed company that owns the intellectual property rights to the VantageScore credit scoring models and is the leader in scoring innovation. Recently introduced VantageScore models score 30-35 million consumers* who typically are not scored by conventional models – without sacrificing predictiveness.\nVantageScore credit scores are used by lenders, landlords, utility companies, telecom companies, and many others to determine creditworthiness. In fact, a recent study found that more than 8.5 billion VantageScore credit scores were used in June 2016-July 2017 by over 2,700 unique users. Of those, over 6 billion scores were used by more than 2,200 lenders of all sizes in their lending processes and over one billion VantageScore credit scores were provided directly to consumers through dozens of websites and lenders who provide their users and customers with their credit scores for free. By using the VantageScore model, these enterprises have access to many more consumers, and in turn, consumers have greater access to mainstream credit.\nWhile there are many credit scoring models in the industry, the “win-win” for VantageScore is its innovative, highly predictive, patent-protected, tri-bureau scoring methodology that provides lenders and consumers with more consistent credit scores across all three national credit reporting companies.\n* Reduction in public records and collection trade lines in consumers’ files will cause the number of consumers who would be newly scoreable using the VantageScore credit scoring model to decline.\n***\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403005555/en/\nVantageScore Solutions\nJeff Richardson, 203-363-2170\nVice President, Group Head Marketing Communications\njeffrichardson@vantagescore.com\nSource: VantageScore Solutions", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vantagescore.com%2F&esheet=51782346&newsitemid=20180403005555&lan=en-US&anchor=VantageScore+Solutions%2C+LLC&index=1&md5=afeb124d6fa10e2fb837e10cc9b46df4", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.VantageScore.com&esheet=51782346&newsitemid=20180403005555&lan=en-US&anchor=www.VantageScore.com&index=2&md5=6943f363ed15ddea640d8237f28b774e", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403005555/en/"], "published": "2018-04-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:32:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
