( Nasdaq: ATRC ), a leading innovator in treatments for atrial fibrillation (Afib) and left atrial appendage (LAA) management, today announced first quarter 2018 financial results.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter performance and meaningful progress toward completing enrollment in CONVERGE,” said Mike Carrel, President and Chief Executive Officer of AtriCure. “We remain well-positioned to help treat patients suffering from atrial fibrillation through our continued investments in an innovative product pipeline, clinical data, and physician education and training.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $47.0 million, an increase of $5.7 million or 13.9% (12.0% on a constant currency basis), compared to first quarter 2017 revenue. U.S. revenue increased 15.5% to $38.4 million, driven by increased sales of ablation-related open-heart products and appendage management products. International revenue was $8.6 million, an increase of $0.6 million or 6.9% (a decrease of 2.5% on a constant currency basis), compared to first quarter 2017 revenue, driven primarily by softness in China and certain European markets.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $34.5 million compared to $30.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 increased to 73.4% compared to 72.7% in the first quarter of 2017, driven primarily by higher concentration of revenue in the U.S.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased 10.8%, or $4.3 million, compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by increases in selling expenses and legal fees related to the Civil Investigative Demand we received from the U.S. Department of Justice in December 2017.\nLoss from operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $9.4 million, compared to $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss per share was $0.31 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.32 for the first quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $3.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 (see reconciliation of GAAP results to non-GAAP results in the table accompanying this release).\n2018 Financial Guidance\nManagement reiterates 2018 revenue guidance of approximately $190 million to $196 million, with positive full-year adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure.\nConference Call\nAtriCure will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, April 26, 2018 to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results.

For details on the uncertainties that may cause our actual results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements, visit http://www.atricure.com/fls as well as our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q which contain risk factors. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. This document also includes forward-looking projected financial information that is based on current estimates and forecasts. Actual results could differ materially.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement AtriCure’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, AtriCure uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release as supplemental financial metrics.\nRevenue reported on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by applying previous period foreign currency exchange rates to each of the comparable periods. Management analyzes revenue on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on revenue, the Company believes that evaluating growth in revenue on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of revenue to both management and the company’s investors.\nAdjusted EBITDA provides an indication of performance excluding certain items. Management believes that in order to properly understand short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of these excluded items in addition to GAAP measures. The excluded items vary in frequency and/or impact on our continuing operations and management believes that the excluded items are typically not reflective of our ongoing core business operations. Further, management uses adjusted EBITDA for its strategic planning. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA reported in this release to the most comparable GAAP measure for the respective periods can be found in a table later in this release.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used by AtriCure may not be the same or calculated the same as those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for AtriCure’s financial results prepared and reported in accordance with GAAP.\nATRICURE, INC.
