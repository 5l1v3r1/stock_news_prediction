Cohen filed a legal action to block them from reviewing the documents, arguing that either his lawyers or a special master should get a first look.\nLawyers for Trump have also argued that they should be allowed the first look at documents related to the president. In a court filing on Wednesday, they said that Trump would personally “make himself available, as needed, to aid in our privilege review on his behalf.”\nWood said at a hearing last week that she believed a taint team could be fair, but that a special master might help ensure “the perception of fairness.”\nBoth prosecutors and Cohen’s lawyers last week submitted a list of candidates for special master.\nCohen has admitted paying $130,000 to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, before the 2016 election to secure her silence about a sexual relationship she said she had with Trump. Daniels has sued to end her nondisclosure agreement.\nOn Wednesday, Cohen said in a filing in Los Angeles federal court that he would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in connection with the civil lawsuit filed by Daniels.\nProsecutors are investigating Cohen for possible bank and tax fraud, possible campaign law violations in connection with the payment to Daniels, and perhaps other matters related to Trump’s campaign, a person familiar with the probe has said.\nThe investigation stems in part from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible collusion between Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia, something Trump has repeatedly denied.
