REUTERS/Erik De Castro/Files \nNajib is under pressure to secure a strong mandate as he grapples with a multi-billion dollar scandal at a state fund and public anger over rising living costs. \nTo do so, he must fend off an unprecedented challenge from his old mentor, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad. \nThe prime minister will likely dissolve parliament on Friday after he chairs a weekly cabinet meeting, Abdul Rahman Dahlan, the minister in charge of the economic planning unit, said on Tuesday. \n“I think it’s Friday, probably ... traditionally we’ll have our manifesto launch after parliament dissolution, so the manifesto is going to be launched this Saturday,” he told Reuters. \nThe dissolution of parliament paves the way for a general election. The date of the vote will be announced by the Election Commission after the dissolution of parliament. \nThe New Straits Times newspaper cited unidentified sources as saying preparations were underway for Najib to call the election after Friday prayers this week. \nNajib’s United Malay National Organization party has led every multi-ethnic coalition since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule in 1957. \nNajib only narrowly won the last election in 2013 after losing the popular vote to an opposition bloc, now led by Mahathir, who is 92. \nMahathir has emerged as Najib’s fiercest critic over his handling of a scandal surrounding losses at the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB), a state investment firm. \nNajib has denied wrongdoing. \nA general election must be held by August. \nThe opposition has complained that two recent steps backed by the government will boost Najib’s chances at the polls. \nLast week, parliament approved a plan to redraw constituency boundaries for more than a third of its seats, changes that critics say will help Najib. \nOn Monday, parliament passed a bill outlawing fake news and setting jail of up to six years for violators.
