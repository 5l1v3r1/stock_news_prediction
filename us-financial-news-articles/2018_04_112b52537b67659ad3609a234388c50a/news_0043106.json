It also lifted the cash component by 3.25 pounds to 21 pounds a share, a shift that analysts said was needed to appeal to Shire’s shareholders.\nShire said it was considering the new approach.\nThe latest proposal is 7 percent above Takeda’s first offer and 58 percent above London-listed Shire’s share price prior to any takeover speculation, the Japanese firm said.\nBut Shire’s shares were trading at 38.42 pounds on Friday, well below the latest approach and down 3 percent on the day after another company, Allergan, decided not to pursue its own bid on Thursday, ending the prospect of a battle.\nRelated Coverage Takeda weighs raising Shire bid to more than 47 stg/share: sources Botox-maker Allergan had seen its shares fall 7 percent after Reuters reported its interest.\nInvestors in Takeda are also cautious. Its shares lost almost 5 percent of their value on Friday as investors fretted over the Japanese firm making a record-breaking purchase of the London-listed company.\nThe drugs industry has seen a flurry of dealmaking across the world, as companies look for scale and for promising new assets to bolster their pipelines.\nFILE PHOTO: Takeda Pharmaceutical's signboard is seen on its headquarters building in Tokyo, Japan January 30, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo Takeda said it wanted to work with Shire to agree a recommended deal and to allow an extension to an April 25 deadline imposed by the British regulator to make a firm offer.\n“Takeda believes that the improved proposal represents a highly compelling opportunity for Shire shareholders, which reflects a further increase in value and a material increase in the cash component of the consideration mix,” it said.\nShire, which also makes drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), rejected the previous three approaches, saying they significantly undervalued the company and the drugs it has in development.\nBuying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.\nIt would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster haemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in ADHD drugs.\nFILE PHOTO: Vitamins made by Shire are displayed at a chemist's in northwest London, Britain, July 11, 2014. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo But it would be a financial stretch since Shire is worth a lot more than Takeda, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion).\nBased on Takeda’s current market value, Shire shareholders would own approximately 49 percent of the enlarged company should the latest proposal be accepted.\nReporting by Sam Nussey in Tokyo and Paul Sandle in London; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Kate Holton and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T03:43:07.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
