Unfortunately, they (Siemens) can not be a reliable partner anymore,” RIA cited Dvorkovich as saying at a forum in Krasnoyarsk. \n“We are still working with them because we believe that our colleagues have time to change and hope for such a change but you can not betray our trust,” Dvorkovich said, according to RIA. \nSiemens declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T10:50:43.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
