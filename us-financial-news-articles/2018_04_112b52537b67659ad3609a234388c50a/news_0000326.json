(Nasdaq: EQIX), the global interconnection and data center company, today announced the completion of its acquisition of the Infomart Dallas from ASB Real Estate Investments. The US$800 million debt and cash transaction provides approximately 1.6 million gross ft 2 of space, which includes multiple diverse fiber entry points and more than 50 tenants including networks, colocation providers and office tenants.\nThe acquisition of the Infomart facility further broadens Equinix capabilities by strengthening interconnection density on the Equinix global platform; providing opportunity to accelerate business relationships in industries such as banking, technology, energy and healthcare; and supporting the Equinix enterprise offering. Additionally, it secures the ability to further expand in the Dallas market through build-out of the existing underdeveloped capacity and additional capacity to build on land adjacent to the Infomart building.\nThe agreement was signed on February 11, 2018 and the acquisition was completed on April 2, 2018.\nHighlights/key facts\nThe Infomart building generated approximately $50 million of revenues in 2017. Of that revenue, approximately $20 million was attributed to rent and maintenance recoveries from Equinix.
