If players in India get more exposure through the media, it’ll help kids get into golf and look at golf as a career. That is what’s missing. \n“If I have a good finish this week, it will definitely help grow the game back home.” ARMY BACKGROUND \nSharma, the fourth Indian to play at the Masters after Jeev Milkha Singh, Arjun Atwal and Anirban Lahiri, credits his father’s army career for giving him access to the sport. \n“I was fortunate enough to be from an army background so I could actually start playing golf because a golf course was easily accessible to us. There was a course at every station dad was posted at,” he says. \n“I would spend hours on the range alone, just playing by myself and that’s what I really liked about it.” \nAt Augusta, Sharma is hoping his chances will be boosted by his partnership with the experienced Mitch Knox, a caddie who has walked the greens of golf’s grandest stage for two decades. \n“Arjun Atwal and (Sweden-born golfer) Daniel Chopra suggested I go with him,” Sharma said. “He’s been to the Masters for many, many years now. It’ll be great to have a man of his experience on the bag.” \nSharma claimed his maiden European Tour title at the Joburg Open in December and followed that up with victory at the Maybank Championship in Malaysia before his eye-catching PGA Tour debut at the Club de Golf Chapultepec in Mexico City. \n“Honestly, if you had asked me last year, I wouldn’t have thought it possible to play the Masters this year, but I knew I was going to get here eventually,” he added. \n“It just shows it’s that kind of a game. If you play well and catch the right breaks everything is possible.” (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T21:21:06.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
