This optimally-designed 1.1 million ft 2 cannabis growing facility is located in one of the best growing climates in Canada, in Delta, BC, and is conservatively projected to produce 75,000 kg of quality cannabis annually at full production. Following receipt of the cultivation license, starter plants were transferred to the greenhouse to initiate the ACMPR sales license application process.\nHealth Canada also granted a sales license for a second site of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Emerald Health Therapeutics Canada Inc. in Victoria, BC.\nExpansion Projects\nConversion of the first 250,000 ft 2 section of the Delta 3 greenhouse to cannabis production is substantially complete, with conversion of the remainder of the 1.1 million ft 2 greenhouse ongoing and on schedule. Senior growing, financial, human resources and operational personnel, including the established team transferred from Village Farms, are in place for production ramp-up.

This would provide incremental electricity to power supplemental lighting during the 2018/2019 winter months when there is insufficient natural sunlight available and prior to the installation of the approved additional 24MW from the local utility. Successful execution of this plan is expected to increase Pure Sunfarms’ production in 2019 by up to 30% over the current target of approximately 35,000 to 40,000 kilograms of dried cannabis.\nApart from making tremendous progress on the joint venture Delta 3 greenhouse conversion project, the Company has completed a significant amount of construction at its Metro Vancouver site and in October 2017 applied to Health Canada to produce cannabis at this facility.\nDMG Blockchain Solutions Joint Venture\nEmerald and DMG Blockchain signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture, to be named CannaChain Technologies, to develop a blockchain-based supply chain management system and e-commerce marketplace for the legal cannabis industry.\nNamaste Technologies Collaboration\nThe Company and Namaste signed a non-binding letter of intent to collaborate on strategic business opportunities worldwide and develop a fully integrated e-commerce platform to serve as a retail channel for the Company’s patients.\nAcquisition of Northern Vine\nThe Company acquired control of Northern Vine, a Licensed Dealer under the provisions of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (Canada), which permits Northern Vine to carry out a broader range of cannabis research and development and pursue international business opportunities.\nTSX Venture 50 Performer\nThe Company achieved the #1 ranking in the TSX Venture 50 for the clean technology & life science sector in 2017 and was recognized as a top performing company for the second consecutive year.
