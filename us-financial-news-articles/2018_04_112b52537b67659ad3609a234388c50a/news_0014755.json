It is too early to know what its effects would be: it could be very helpful or very harmful”. \nSimon Nicholson, co-executive director of the Forum for Climate Engineering Assessment, based in Washington, said while early geoengineering experiments like Harvard’s present no physical risk, they could lay the groundwork for eventual large-scale deployment of the technology. \n“The urgency comes from the desire to get out in front of something that might be important a few years from now,” Nicholson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \n“The risk comes from the slippery slope argument, that it could quickly move from something that looks like a test to something that looks like deployment.” \nLarge-scale use of such sun-dimming technology could have a range of little-understood side effects, scientists warn, including potentially shifting Asian monsoons that are crucial to farming that feeds billions. \nNicholson said the planned Arizona experiment has met all legal requirements, and the researchers have pushed to include an environmental impact assessment even though it is not formally required by law. \n“They could do this experiment tomorrow. Under Harvard research guidelines and U.S. law there is nothing stopping them. All the boxes are checked,” he said. \nBut “they’re going slow because they realize that, as the first labeled solar geoengineering experiment, they have an obligation to get it right”, he said. \nPasztor, a former United Nations assistant secretary-general on climate change, said a growing number of governments “recognize some parts of geoengineering are coming ... and we need to seriously deal with it”. \n“It’s on their radar screen,” he said.
