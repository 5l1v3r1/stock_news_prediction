I had a chance on 17, too, but it wasn’t to be.” \nWith his slight build and non-descript appearance, Fleetwood remains a stranger to all but hard-core golf fans, but the 27-year-old from Southport, England is no stranger to his peers. \n“It was a pleasure to watch some tremendous golf,” said Canadian Hadwin, speaking to a small group of reporters, said of Fleetwood’s five-birdie stretch. \n“There’s a reason he’s 12th in the world.” \nAsked what was particularly impressive about Fleetwood’s game, Hadwin said: “Everything.” \n“When he gets off line he knows what to do. He’s got a great short game, hits it real solid off the tee, hits his irons great, wedges great, putts well. What more do you want?” (Reporting by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T04:50:16.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
