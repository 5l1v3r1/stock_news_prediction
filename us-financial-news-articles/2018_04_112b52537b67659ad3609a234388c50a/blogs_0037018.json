A number of cases are winding their way through the federal court system, and the issue ultimately could be decided by the Supreme Court. iStockphoto.com/Tomasz Wyszomirski \nGood morning. Can companies he held liable under the U.S. Clean Water Act for discharges from their operations into groundwater that seeps into nearby surface waters? A number of cases are winding their way through the federal court system, and the issue ultimately could be decided by the Supreme Court. \nA ruling Thursday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reinstated a lawsuit filed in South Carolina by two environmental groups against Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. and its Plantation Pipe Line Co. Inc. subsidiary. Hundreds of thousands of gallons of gasoline spilled from a ruptured pipeline in Belton, S.C. in 2014. The lawsuit claimed the gas continued to travel into nearby waters. \nThe case was dismissed by a district court in South Carolina that said it didn’t have jurisdiction. The appeals court disagreed and ruled “citizens may bring suit…for discharges of pollutants that derive from a ‘point source’ and continue to be ‘added’ to navigable waters.” \nKinder Morgan expressed disappointment in the appeals court ruling. “This decision appears to conflict with other Appellate Court decisions, resulting in inconsistent interpretations of the scope of the Clean Water Act,” said the company. “We are evaluating our options on the best course of action going forward.” \nSimilar cases are being heard in the Sixth Circuit involving a case in Tennessee and in the 9th Circuit involving a case in Hawaii. A second case before a different Fourth Circuit appeals panel dealing with a matter in Virginia is expected to be decided this spring, said Meaghan Boyd, a partner in the environment, land use and natural resources group at law firm Alston & Bird. \nThe issue could reach the Supreme Court if the appeals courts reach conflicting decisions, or if one of the losing parties appeals to the highest court, she said. That means companies that may have similar liability issues should be on guard, she said. \n“What is interesting is there are different industries that are subject of these various decisions,” so companies beyond those named in the lawsuits could face similar actions, said Ms. Boyd. “Speaking generally, one impact from this decision will be that we will see an uptick in these type of suits, or at the very least it is likely that environmental groups will feel emboldened by a decision like this.” \nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL \nGadfly pushes conservative spin on shareholder resolutions.
