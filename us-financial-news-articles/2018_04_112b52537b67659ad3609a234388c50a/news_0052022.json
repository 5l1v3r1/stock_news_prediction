They have proved adept at exploiting local tensions between ethnic groups to sow discord — such as those between mostly lighter-skinned Tuareg and black Fulani herdsmen over scarce watering points in the Sahara.\nBajan Ag Hamatou, a local legislator, confirmed the attack, as did Menaka town’s mayor, Nanout Kotia.\nRising violence across Mali has cast doubt over the feasibility of elections scheduled for the end of July, in which President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita will seek a second term.\nIslamic State’s Saharan affiliate is active in the Menaka region bordering Niger. It is led by an Arabic-speaking north African called Adnan Abu Walid al-Sahrawi, but the majority of its fighters are Fulani.\n“The dead were mostly youths, no women or children, mostly of the age where they can carry arms,” Maiga said.\nThe victims included many members of the Tuareg militia National Movement for the Salvation of Azawad (MSA).\n“The MSA is fighting the Islamist groups, which are composed mostly of Fulani,” Maiga said. “So these two attacks were reprisals against them. They want to transform the conflict into something inter-communal.”\nMali has been in chaos since Tuareg rebels and Islamists swept across its deserts in 2012, despite a French intervention to push them back the following year, and a large French military and U.N. peacekeeping presence.\nReporting by Tiemoko Diallo; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Catherine Evans and Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
