The Coyotes have won four of their last five, while the Flames have dropped eight of nine games.\nRichard Panik opened the scoring at the 3:48 mark of the first period at the Scotiabank Saddledome. Panik was parked in the slot when he deflected Connauton’s long wrist shot past Flames goalie Jon Gillies.\nConnauton, the league’s hottest defenseman in terms of goal scoring over the last couple of months, made it a 2-0 game at 16:39 of the first frame. Connauton faked a slapper, which drew opposing center Curtis Lazar out of position, before moving to the middle of the ice and wristing a puck into the top corner for his fourth goal in as many games and 10th tally since Feb. 1.\nChristian Fischer was the beneficiary of a lucky break when the Coyotes stretched their lead to 3-0 at the 2:18 mark of the second period. Gillies stopped a puck that ricocheted off Fisher, but defenseman Rasmus Andersson kicked it into his own net as he moved into position. Fischer was credited with his first goal in 31 games.\nNick Shore gave the flickering Flames a bit of life when he put them on the board 4:32 into the second period. Lazar drove down the wing before sending a shot on net that set up the rebound for Shore to bury for his first goal since being acquired by the club at the trade deadline.\nBut the Coyotes, outshot by a huge margin, regained their three-goal edge with seven minutes left in regulation on another lucky bounce. Dylan Strome’s shot was stopped but rebounded off Flames forward Michael Frolik and into the net.\nStrome has two goals and seven points in eight games since being recalled from the minors. Max Domi collected a pair of assists to give him seven points (1-6-7) in three games.\nArizona’s Jakob Chychrun left the game late in the first period and did not return.\nGillies made 17 saves for Calgary.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:18:06.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
