I was speechless.” \nLast month Harry, fifth-in-line to the British throne, and actress Markle said they would invite 1,200 members of the public into the grounds of Windsor Castle, Queen Elizabeth’s home west of London, where they are due to marry on May 19. \nAmong them would be young people who had shown leadership or served their community, Harry’s office said. \nThomas’s mother Lisa Newton said she nominated her daughter who was in the crowd targeted by a suicide bomber at the end of a concert by singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena in northern England last May. \nThe attacker killed 22 people, including seven children, and injured 500 more. \n“She has been through a lot and she has had a obviously a rough couple of years and since Manchester it has been really hard,” Newton said. \n“I nominated Amelia ... and then got an email on Thursday night and it was quite late and ... I mean I couldn’t believe it. I then gave Amelia the phone, she had no idea up until that point, so when she got the phone she thought someone was messing, thought it was a joke.” \nNewton herself also received an invitation but she passed it to a woman whose granddaughter was killed in the attack. \n“It was something Amelia wanted to do. It feels right and it is going to make another family happy,” Newton said. \nOn Tuesday, it was revealed that neither British Prime Minister Theresa May nor U.S. President Donald Trump would be among the 600 people invited to attend the wedding ceremony itself at Windsor Castle’s St George’s Chapel and a reception.
