REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo \nWith just four days left before Hungarians head to the polls, surveys conducted by think tanks Median and Republikon showed a slight increase in support for Fidesz as premier Orban campaigns for a third successive term in office. \nFidesz increased its backing by two points to 41 percent of all voters according to a survey by Median taken between March 23 and 27, the results of which were published on the website of Hungarian business weekly HVG. \nIt projected Fidesz would win 142 of the 199 seats in parliament, giving Orban a comfortable two-thirds majority. Nationalist Jobbik would have the second largest parliamentary group with 22 seats, followed by the Socialists at 19 seats. \nAnother survey, by the think-tank Republikon, showed Fidesz gaining one point among all voters for 30 percent support, followed by Jobbik and the Socialists at 12 and 11 percent, respectively. \nFor more stories on the Hungarian election, see \nFollowings are the latest polls: \nAll voters (figures in percentages of those polled): \nDATE POLLSTER FIDESZ JOBBIK MSZP DK LMP OTHER UNDECIDED \nMarch Median 41 12 9 5 5 5 23 \nMarch Republikon 30 12 11 3 3 2 38 \nMarch Median 39 12 9 6 4 3 27 \nLate Szazadveg 36 8 8 5 7 N/A 35 \nFeb \nFeb Publicus 26 11 12 4 6 1 40 \nFeb Iranytu 31 18 8 5 5 4 29 \nFeb IDEA 31 14 8 8 5 2 32 \nFeb Republikon 29 12 11 3 3 2 39 \nFeb Nezopont 40 7 5 4 3 5 35 \nFeb Szazadveg 35 8 7 6 8 1 35 \nFeb Zavecz 32 11 9 5 4 6 33 \nJan Tarki 46 11 5 5 4 4 25 \nJan Median 37 13 8 6 5 3 28 \nJan Szazadveg 35 10 8 5 7 1 34 \nJan Nezopont 40 7 5 4 3 5 36 \nJan Republikon 32 11 8 3 3 4 38 \nJan Publicus 26 11 11 3 5 2 42 \nJan Iranytu 33 17 6 5 5 5 29 \nJan Zavecz 33 10 8 5 4 5 35 \nDec IDEA 33 13 8 8 5 5 28 \nDec Szazadveg 36 9 9 5 6 1 34 \nDec Nezopont 37 8 5 4 4 5 37 \nDec Republikon 34 10 7 3 3 3 40 \nDec Publicus 26 9 9 4 5 3 44 \nDec Iranytu 35 16 6 5 5 6 27 \nDec Zavecz 33 9 8 5 5 5 35 \nNOTES - The last election was held on April 6, 2014. \nFIDESZ: Fidesz-Christian Democrat Alliance \nJobbik: Movement for a Better Hungary \nMSZP: Hungarian Socialist Party \nLMP: Politics Can Be Different \nOTHER: All other parties’ supporters combined Reporting by Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Catherine Evans", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T18:19:47.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
