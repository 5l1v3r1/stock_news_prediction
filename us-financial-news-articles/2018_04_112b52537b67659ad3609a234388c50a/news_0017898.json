And he has been set-up to take the fall.\"\n\"In my opinion, an enormous amount of misplaced faith has been placed on his shoulders and I do not believe he has the mettle to withstand it. If I am correct, this could end very, very badly for Mr. Trump and others,\" Avenatti said.\nMueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and possibly collusion with Russians by the Trump campaign.\nThe raids on Cohen's office and residence Monday was spurred by information Mueller's investigation came across, which Mueller referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\nAfter news of the raids broke, Trump angrily lashed out at federal investigators during a White House event.\n\"It's a total witch hunt,\" Trump fumed.\nHe called the raids, which were approved by a federal judge and by deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, \"an attack on our country in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for.\"\nAsked if he would fire Mueller, Trump replied, \"We'll see what happens.\"\n\"Many people have said you should fire him.\"\nWATCH: Daniels goes on the record about Trump show chapters Stormy Daniels goes on the record about Trump      9:19 AM ET Mon, 26 March 2018 | 01:29", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T01:19:23.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
