REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThe flag carrier’s unions have called for action on Tuesday and on April 7 and plan further walkouts on April 10 and 11, over demands for a 6 percent wage increase that management has rejected. \nMeanwhile French commuters are bracing for chaos from Monday evening as a series of rolling nationwide rail strikes get under way that nearly half of unionised staff have indicated they will join. \nThe rail strike, due to run for three months in successive waves of two days, is expected to be the biggest test yet of President Emmanuel Macron’s ability to push through wide-ranging labour and economic reforms.
