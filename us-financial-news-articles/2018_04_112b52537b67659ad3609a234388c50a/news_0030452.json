The goals had been carefully chosen and I observe that there are no incidents to report between our forces and other forces active in the region,” Parly told a news conference.\nFrench army chief Francois Lecointre added Syria’s ground-to-air defence system had been effective but that its efficiency proved “very limited.” Russian assets deployed in Syria were “neither active nor proactive” he said.\nHe added that there was no reason to think there could have been any collateral victim.
