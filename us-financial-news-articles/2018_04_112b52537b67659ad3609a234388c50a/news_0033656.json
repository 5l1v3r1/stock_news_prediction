Once confirmed, they are legally enforceable through asset seizures, if necessary. $1 = 0.8080 euros Reporting by Domenico Lusi; writing by Giselda Vagnoni; editing by Steve Scherer and Jason Neely", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T11:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T12:06:11.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
