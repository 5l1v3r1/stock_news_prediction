The photo is then cross-referenced with the company's database of \"millions of photos\" to recognize the damage level of the car.\n\"Before ... your car gets towed away, we can immediately reimburse the money back into your account,\" Chan added, noting that the process results in a situation where the customer is happier.\nAI's impact on health care and jobs On the company's foray into health care, Chan said Ping An helps doctors to work more efficiently. Its machines, he said, were recently recognized as a world leader in detecting potentially cancerous lung nodules accurately from x-rays.\nWith the help of those machines, \"doctor(s) can scan through a lot more X-rays in a much shorter period of time,\" Chan said. \"That is an efficiency gain.\"\nThe company has also made inroads into the field of preventative care through the use of big data analysis and artificial intelligence.\nWith a cache of data and AI modeling, Chan said, the company can detect hand, foot and mouth disease, influenza and other diseases \"at least a week earlier than before.\" Governments, he explained, can use that information to warn the public and take preventative measures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T13:11:52.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
