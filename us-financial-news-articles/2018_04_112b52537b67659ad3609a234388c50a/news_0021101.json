The views expressed are his own)\nFILE PHOTO: Crude oil storage tanks are seen from above at the Cushing oil hub, in Cushing, Oklahoma, March 24, 2016. REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File Photo Hedge funds trimmed their bullish position in crude oil and fuels in the most recent week after increasing it significantly over the previous fortnight.\nBut the overall reduction conceals a sharp shift away from U.S. light crude (WTI) and toward the international marker Brent, according to an analysis of position data published by regulators and exchanges.\nHedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by 43 million barrels in the week to April 3.\nPortfolio managers cut their net long position in WTI (NYMEX and ICE) by 48 million barrels while trimming their net long in Brent by just 4 million barrels ( tmsnrt.rs/2GPRVs8 ).\nThe fall in WTI net length was the largest one-week reduction since the end of August, when hurricanes disrupted the U.S. refining system, and continues a trend evident in recent weeks.\nFunds have been steadily cutting their exposure to WTI over the last two months while maintaining a strong bullish position in Brent.\nThe net long position in WTI has fallen by 105 million barrels since it peaked on Jan. 23 even as the net position in Brent has risen by an extra 27 million barrels over the same period.\nThe result is that the position in Brent now looks exceptionally stretched while positioning in WTI looks far less lopsided.\nFund managers now hold almost 21 long positions in Brent for every short position, a record imbalance, up from a ratio of 11:1 on Jan. 23.\nBy contrast, funds hold fewer than nine long positions in WTI for every short, down from a ratio of almost 12:1 in late January.\nThe shift in relative positioning between WTI and Brent mirrors the changing calendar spreads at the front end of the futures curve.\nThe front-month calendar spread in WTI has gradually eased from backwardation toward contango since the start of February.\nCrude stocks have been increasing around the WTI delivery point at Cushing and there are reports of spreading pipeline bottlenecks throughout the West Texas/Permian region.\nBy contrast, Brent calendar spreads have remained firmly in backwardation, and recently tightened again after softening during much of the last three months.\nHedge funds are being drawn from WTI toward Brent in the search for roll yield (long positions have a positive yield in a backwardated market but cost money to maintain in a contango market).\nWith oil prices having been basically flat since December, roll yield is becoming increasingly important to portfolio managers.\nEditing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T04:54:09.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
