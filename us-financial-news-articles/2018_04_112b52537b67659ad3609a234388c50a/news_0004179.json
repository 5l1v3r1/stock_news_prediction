BABA -1.92% , further diversifying beyond e-commerce, said it would acquire a Chinese online delivery platform.\nThe Chinese internet giant said Monday that it will buy out all the shares outstanding of Ele.me it doesn’t already own in a deal that values the Shanghai-based company at $9.5 billion. Ele.me delivers takeout food as well as groceries and household items.\nThe acquisition will help Alibaba, which runs China’s two largest e-commerce platforms, advance in brick-and-mortar retail and local services. Since 2016, the Hangzhou-based company has sought to expand beyond its core e-commerce business —where it faces slowing growth and intensifying competition—into serving physical stores.\nAlibaba and its affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group Co. currently own about 43% of the outstanding voting shares of Ele.me. Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said in an email to staff that Ele.me would complement its Yelp-like online platform Koubei.\nThe deal sharpens the competition between Alibaba and rival Tencent Holdings , which backs Meituan-Dianping, a large startup that runs a competing online food-delivery service.\nWrite to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T16:44:57.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
