Hoskins made it 6-2 when he scored on a throwing error by Pirates first baseman David Freese.\nCloser Hector Neris, who got the final out of the eighth inning, pitched a scoreless ninth for his fourth save.\nAaron Nola (2-1) got the win for the Phillies, allowing two runs and six hits in seven innings. He struck out nine and did not walk a batter.\nOne of the hits allowed by Nola was Rodriguez’s third home run of the season, which came on the second pitch of the game.\nBrault did not get a decision after allowing just two hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings. He walked three and struck out four.\nHoskins finished with two hits for the Phillies, who have won 10 of their last 12 games.\nSantana and Herrera scored twice apiece.\nRodriguez had two hits and scored twice for the Pirates, who out-hit the Phillies 8-7.\nCorey Dickerson also had a pair of hits for Pittsburgh.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
