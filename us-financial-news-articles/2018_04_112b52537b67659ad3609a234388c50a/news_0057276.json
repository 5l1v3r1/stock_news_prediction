This is the highest quarterly net income ever recorded by the Company and compares to first quarter 2017 net income of $6.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share.

Our experience and market leadership in construction and development financing has helped fuel 4.8 percent year-to-date growth in our loan portfolio during the first quarter of 2018, and our pipeline of loans for both new and existing commercial clients continues to grow.”\n“West Bank in Rochester followed up on a very good year in 2017 with solid momentum in the first quarter of 2018.
