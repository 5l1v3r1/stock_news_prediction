You can see it and say it’s wrong but to then back it up with such a sanction says a huge amount.” \nSmith and Bancroft were also barred from holding leadership positions within the Australian team for two years, while Warner will never be able to hold such a position again. \nMorgan accepts there are some “grey areas” around the issue of ball-tampering but Cricket Australia’s actions have made it clear that none of methods to scuff up the ball are acceptable. \n“Throwing the ball in, one bounce, is fine... but if you throw to the keeper from long-on or long-off, the umpires will monitor how often the ball hits the playing surface and tell you they’ll change the ball if you do it again,” he added. \n“So, yes, there are grey areas but I think Cricket Australia have gone a long way to saying none of it is acceptable.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T09:56:55.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
