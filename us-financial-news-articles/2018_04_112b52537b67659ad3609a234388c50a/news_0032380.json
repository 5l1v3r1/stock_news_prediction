Bump stocks serve no purpose other than to create the functional equivalent of a machine gun,” said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control group based in Washington, D.C. that had sued Slide Fire on behalf of victims of the Las Vegas shooting.\nThe deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which killed 58 people and injured more than 850, made the Congress consider legislation that would regulate bump stocks.\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum in February directing the Justice Department to make the regulatory change.\nSlide Fire had temporarily paused its sales following the Las Vegas shooting, but subsequently restarted it.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T06:49:28.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
