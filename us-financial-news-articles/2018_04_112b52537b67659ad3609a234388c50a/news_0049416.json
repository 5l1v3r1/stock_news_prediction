Avicii, whose real name is Tim Bergling, was known for international hits like \"Wake Me Up\" and \"Hey Brother\". He announced in 2016 that he was retiring from touring, but he kept making music and was nominated for a Billboard music award earlier in the week that he died. Avicii told Billboard magazine he decided to stop touring in 2016 for health reasons. Three years earlier, he underwent surgery for a ruptured appendix and a blocked gall bladder and in 2012, he was hospitalized with pancreatitis.

He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace.”\nThe statement appeared to suggest that the electronic dance musician and producer took his own life. His U.S. publicist, Diana Baron, declined to comment further.

An over-achieving perfectionist who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress,” the family’s statement said on Thursday.\n“When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most – music,” it added.\nAvicii’s death shocked the music world, particularly in Europe.\nChurch bells played one of Avicii’s biggest hits in the Swedish capital Stockholm on Tuesday.
