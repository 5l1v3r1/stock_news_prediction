(NASDAQ:LSTR) reported record first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.37 in the 2018 first quarter, on record first quarter revenue of $1.048 billion. Landstar reported diluted earnings per share of $0.77 on revenue of $781 million in the 2017 first quarter. Gross profit (defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents) was $155.5 million, a record quarterly gross profit, in the 2018 first quarter compared to $121.6 million in the 2017 first quarter. Operating margin, representing operating income divided by gross profit, was 48.3 percent in the 2018 first quarter.\nTruck transportation revenue hauled by independent business capacity owners (“BCOs”) and truck brokerage carriers in the 2018 first quarter was $979.1 million, or 93 percent of revenue, compared to $726.8 million, or 93 percent of revenue, in the 2017 first quarter. Truckload transportation revenue hauled via van equipment in the 2018 first quarter was $656.1 million compared to $470.0 million in the 2017 first quarter. Truckload transportation revenue hauled via unsided/platform equipment in the 2018 first quarter was $299.4 million compared to $237.2 million in the 2017 first quarter. Revenue hauled by rail, air and ocean cargo carriers was $52.8 million, or 5 percent of revenue, in the 2018 first quarter compared to $42.4 million, or 5 percent of revenue, in the 2017 first quarter.\nTrailing twelve-month return on average shareholders’ equity was 32 percent and trailing twelve-month return on invested capital, representing net income divided by the sum of average equity plus average debt, was 27 percent. Currently, the Company is authorized to purchase up to approximately 2,986,000 shares of the Company’s common stock under Landstar’s previously announced share purchase programs. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $260 million in cash and short term investments and $217 million available for borrowings under the Company’s senior credit facility.\nIn addition, Landstar announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share payable on June 1, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 10, 2018. It is currently the intention of the Board to pay dividends on a quarterly basis going forward.\n“I am extremely pleased with the execution of the Landstar model during the 2018 first quarter,” said Landstar’s President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Gattoni. “Diluted earnings per share was $1.37 in the 2018 first quarter, the highest first quarter diluted earnings per share in Landstar history. Revenue and the number of loads hauled via truck each set new all-time Landstar first quarter records. All-time quarterly records were set for both gross profit and operating income and the Company also set a new all-time record for trucks provided by BCOs with 9,868 as of the end of the quarter.”\nGattoni continued, “The number of loads hauled via truck in the 2018 first quarter increased 12 percent over the 2017 first quarter, driven by a 13 percent increase in the number of loads hauled via van equipment, an 8 percent increase in the number of loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment and a 12 percent increase in less-than-truckload volume. The number of loads hauled via railroads, ocean cargo carriers and air cargo carriers was 20 percent higher in the 2018 first quarter compared to the 2017 first quarter, primarily due to a 25 percent increase in rail intermodal volume.”\nGattoni further commented, “As expected, the pricing environment for our truckload services continued to be very strong in the 2018 first quarter, as industry-wide truck capacity continued to be very tight. Revenue per load on loads hauled via van equipment increased 24 percent over the 2017 first quarter and revenue per load on loads hauled via unsided/platform equipment increased 17 percent over the 2017 first quarter. As a result, revenue per load on loads hauled via truck was 21 percent higher than the 2017 first quarter.”\nGattoni continued, “Through the first few weeks of April, load growth on a year-over-year basis in loads hauled via truck was consistent with the load growth experienced in the first quarter. I expect that trend to continue and, therefore, expect the number of loads hauled via truck in the 2018 second quarter to increase in a 10 to 12 percent range over the 2017 second quarter. My expectation is that pricing conditions for truck services in the 2018 second quarter will continue to be very strong with little change in the level of available truck capacity. Assuming those truck conditions remain, I expect 2018 second quarter truck revenue per load to be higher than the 2017 second quarter in a 19 to 22 percentage range. I anticipate revenue for the 2018 second quarter to be in a range of $1.115 billion to $1.165 billion. Assuming that range of estimated revenue and insurance and claims expense at 3.5 percent of BCO revenue, representing average insurance and claims costs as a percent of BCO revenue over the past five years, I would anticipate 2018 second quarter diluted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.48 to $1.54 per share compared to $0.89 per diluted share in the 2017 second quarter.”\nLandstar will provide a live webcast of its quarterly earnings conference call tomorrow morning at 8:00 a.m. ET.
