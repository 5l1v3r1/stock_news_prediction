Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.\"\nThe original 12-member agreement, which included Japan but not South Korea, was known as the TPP. It was a signature trade policy of President Barack Obama, but he was unable to secure Congressional support for the deal.\nIt was thrown into limbo when Trump withdrew from the deal three days after his inauguration in January 2017, a move he said was aimed at protecting U.S. jobs.\nFollowing the U.S. withdrawal, the remaining 11 countries renegotiated parts of the TPP, and in March, they signed the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - also known as TPP-11.
