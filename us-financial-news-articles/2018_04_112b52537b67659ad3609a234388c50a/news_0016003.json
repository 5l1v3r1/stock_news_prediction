It’s clear that we need to improve, we have to improve our car, our package. I guess everybody’s trying to do the same so the competition is very high.”\nVettel will also be well aware that the calendar has possibly flattered him.\nThe Ferrari driver also won in Australia and Bahrain last season, when China was the second round of the championship rather than the third, but his title challenge imploded later in the campaign.\nHamilton was second in Australia and Bahrain last year, however, compared with a second and third so far.\nIf Hamilton loses out again next weekend in Shanghai, a race that he has won five times previously and that Mercedes has won in five of the last six years, then there will be serious concern in Brackley and Stuttgart.\nIn Bahrain, Valtteri Bottas finished second for Mercedes after chasing down Vettel in the closing laps when the Ferrari driver was on badly worn soft tyres after making one less pitstop.\nThe gap at the end was 0.699 seconds; close but not close enough.\nMercedes team boss Toto Wolff told reporters afterwards that his team felt sure they had a winning tyre strategy.\nThat was because Bottas and Hamilton were on mediums that could go to the end whereas Vettel had to decide whether to pit again and lose the lead or stay out and risk running out of rubber.\n“This was the moment where I would say probably 90 percent probability was on us winning and we lost that,” said Wolff.\nHe recognised however that Ferrari had swept the front row in qualifying when Mercedes were not good enough, with Hamilton also having a five place penalty for a gearbox change that left him lining up in ninth.\nThat setback cost Hamilton - who missed out on victory in Australia after a virtual safety car period played into Ferrari’s hands - any chance of winning.\nAnd that was cause for concern for a team that have won the past four drivers’ and constructors’ titles but are now second behind Ferrari.\n“The points that you don’t make are the ones that could decide the championship,” said Wolff.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T18:28:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
