You can even use Alexa Blueprints to create custom trivia games. \nIt's a fun tool that will help you get more out of your Amazon Echo. Here's how to do it. Go to the Alexa Blueprints website and log-in with your Amazon account. Pick a Blueprint \nThere are lots to choose from, including custom templates for what you might use for a house-guest, a birthday trivia game customized to the birthday boy or girl, or instructions for a dog sitter. For the sake of this tutorial, select the \"Custom Q&A\" option. Now tap \"make your own.\" \nThe page will look like this, with pre-filled questions and answers that you can customize: \nCustomize the questions and responses: Tap in the first box under \"When you say 'Alexa'..\" Enter in the phrase you'll want to ask. You can make it fun or useful: \"What time should the kids go to bed?\" might be useful for a babysitter. \"Who's the best mom in the world?\" Could be a fun one for your kids to ask. Enter in the answer you want Alexa to give. If the kids go to bed at 8pm, write that in the next box. If the best mom in the world is you, put your name there. \nEverything should look like this: Next tap \"Create Skill\" on the top-right of the page. Tap \"Update account.\" \nThat's it! After a few minutes the skill will be added to your Amazon Echo units. You can disable it at any time through the Alexa app on an iPhone or Android phone.
