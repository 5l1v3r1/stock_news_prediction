FMC said the investment had enabled it to gain insight in value-based care programmes in the U.S. and that it was now in a position where it could divest Sound Inpatient and use the proceeds for other investments. \nIn 2017, Sound generated revenues of around 1.25 billion euros and EBIT of around 90 million euros with 3,500 employees. \nFMC’s financial targets for 2018 and 2020 do not include the effects of the Sound Inpatient sale or the acquisition of NxStage Medical, it added. \nFMC is due to publish first quarter results on May 3.
