Under the terms of the agreement, Connecticut Water shareholders will receive 1.1375 shares of SJW Group common stock for each share of Connecticut Water common stock they own, the equivalent of $63.70 per share, based on SJW Group’s closing stock price on April 19, 2018. Connecticut Water’s shareholders would benefit not only from an immediate 21% premium to the closing share price on March 14, 2018 – the day prior to the merger announcement – but, importantly, will retain future upside through a 40 percent ownership of the combined company.\n“SJW Group is committed to the existing merger agreement with Connecticut Water, which remains on track to close by year-end 2018. The SJW Group Board continues to believe the merger of equals provides the shareholders of both companies with the best opportunity for value creation over the long term, including:\nHighly attractive earnings and growth accretion. The combination is expected to be mid- to high-single digit percentage accretive to each company’s earnings per share. It will also offer greater flexibility to grow the business through increased investments and to compete more effectively in a fragmented industry. The new company should have the opportunity to expand across a national footprint with a leading forecasted growth rate. Attractive total shareholder return proposition. Over the past five years SJW Group has delivered a 145 percent total return to its company’s shareholders and Connecticut Water has delivered a 154 percent total return to its company's shareholders compared to only 57 percent for Eversource Energy over the same period. A strong balance sheet that enhances financial flexibility to increase growth. The combined company is expected to benefit from a robust balance sheet and enhanced financial flexibility, with total assets of $2.4 billion. This will result in a stronger financial foundation and increased capital markets access yielding a lower cost of capital, better enabling the new organization to compete for attractive growth opportunities on a national level. A solid credit profile that supports share repurchase. The incremental debt capacity resulting from the merger of equals, and the expectation that the combined company will maintain a strong \"A\" credit profile, is expected to enable the combined company to pursue a share repurchase program of up to $100 million. Robust, stable dividend with immediate uplift. The new company is expected to establish a dividend at least equivalent to SJW Group’s announced 2018 annual dividend of $1.12 per share. This represents an immediate dividend uplift for Connecticut Water shareholders, when adjusted for the agreed exchange ratio.\n“In addition to benefits to shareholders of both companies, the proposed merger of equals with Connecticut Water will benefit employees, customers and communities of both companies in the following ways:\nHonoring commitments to employees. SJW Group and Connecticut Water do not anticipate any job losses as a result of the merger of equals. Following the close of the transaction, employees will have additional opportunities for career development and geographic mobility as part of a larger, stronger and more diverse organization. The companies do not anticipate any significant changes in employee compensation or benefits packages as a result of the transaction. SJW Group values its trusted union partnerships, and all union contracts will continue to be honored. Delivering customer benefits. The new organization will maintain the longstanding commitments of SJW Group and Connecticut Water to outstanding customer service, which will be enhanced by the sharing of best practices, operational expertise and more extensive resources. There will be no change in customer rates as a result of the merger of equals, and the operating subsidiaries of the combined company will each continue to be subject to oversight by their respective state regulatory commissions for rates and quality of service. Serving local communities with a passionate, dedicated team of locally-based water professionals. Each of the combined company’s operating utilities and their customers will continue to be supported locally by a team of passionate, dedicated employees and existing leaders. They will continue to bring their extensive certifications, operating experience and local knowledge to the communities where they live, work and serve. Strengthening existing community ties. In addition to retaining dedicated employee teams across its footprint, the new company will maintain strong community ties and participation in community events and organizations in Connecticut, Maine, California and Texas. The combined company will continue to focus on supporting economic development with investments in growth, safety and reliability. Advancing environmental stewardship. Environmental stewardship is a core value for both organizations, given the local nature of the water business. Both companies have been industry leaders in their efforts to promote water conservation and protect the valuable lands and water resources that have been entrusted to them. That focus will continue as the combined company seeks to further reduce its environmental footprint and look for opportunities to improve the sustainability of its business practices. Providing increased scale, financial strength and geographic diversity and deep operating expertise. In addition to an expanded market presence, increased scale and more diverse geographic footprint, the new organization will provide the opportunity for investments in service and reliability that can enhance value for shareholders as well as for customers and communities through our strong multi-state presence with high-quality and well-run operations, as well as constructive regulatory relationships in Connecticut, Maine, California and Texas. Leveraging technology and capital investments. The combined company can cost effectively implement updated customer service tools across Connecticut and Maine utility operations by leveraging leading Information Services and Technology systems that have been established at SJW Group. The new company will honor commitments for approximately $200 million of annual capital investments across its combined operations, including moving forward with the construction of the new surface water treatment facility in Saco, Maine.”\nAs disclosed at the time of the announced merger of equals , the transaction, which is expected to close by year-end 2018, is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, including the approval of the issuance of shares in the transaction by SJW Group shareholders, the approval of Connecticut Water shareholders, the approvals of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
