As of the previous close, the Hang Seng has risen 2.45 percent this month. ** The top gainers among H-shares were Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd up 3.71 percent, followed by China Telecom Corp Ltd gaining 1.4 percent and Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd up by 1.36 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Ltd which was down 4.84 percent, SINOPHARM GROUP CO LTD which fell 3.4 percent and China Vanke Co Ltd down by 2.7 percent. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 22.88 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
