When riders are done with one of the bikes, they can park them anywhere that's convenient, if it's legal to do so — no kiosks required.\nshow chapters Uber halts self-driving tests after deadly accident      7:11 AM ET Tue, 20 March 2018 | 04:41 Bike-sharing technology is far simpler to master than self-driving cars. Uber has recently had to suspend its autonomous vehicle testing after a deadly accident in Tempe, Arizona.\nUber has already partnered with Jump to offer its pedal-assist electric bikes in San Francisco. \nJump CEO and founder Ryan Rzepecki said his company will now operate as a wholly owned subsidiary with all 100 employees joining Uber. Rzepecki will report directly to Khosrowshahi.\nThe companies are also exploring ways to make e-bikes useful to Uber Eats couriers. \"They have found increased efficiency from using the e-bike in tests,\" Rzepecki said. \"We see this as a potentially big segment.\"\nWhile bike-sharing has been wildly popular in China and parts of Europe, its fate in the U.S. is still to be determined. Venture capitalists have been pouring money into bike sharing companies here, in hopes the segment will grow like it has overseas.\nDrew Angerer | Getty Images Uber's new CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, replaced Travis Kalanick. On Wednesday, Nov. 22, an Uber hack involving 57 million customers and drivers was revealed. Under Kalanick, the company had hidden the hack for over a year and paid a $100,000 ransom. Last week, one of the biggest bike-sharing platforms in China, Mobike, was acquired by Meituan Dianping, the nation's largest provider of on-demand online services, for $2.7 billion.\nPrior to its acquisition by Uber, Jump Bikes had raised $24 million in venture funding from investors including Menlo Ventures, SineWave Ventures and SOSV.\nJump, founded in 2010, was the first company to offer dockless bike sharing in the U.S. One competitor that followed Jump into the market, LimeBike , has raised $132 million since it was founded in January 2017.\nU.S. start-ups such as LimeBike, Spin and Zagster will now face competition not just from Uber-owned Jump, but Chinese players coming to the U.S. including Mobike and Ofo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:05:21.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
