It expects contract rates to increase by high single-digit to low double-digit percentages this year.\nBut the company continues to struggle to hire and retain enough drivers amid a chronic driver shortage in the industry and a tight overall U.S. labor market, which has curbed the number of trucks it can put on America’s highways.\n“We continue to face perhaps the most difficult driver-sourcing challenge we have seen,” Chief Executive Dave Jackson told analysts after Knight-Swift reported first-quarter results.\nThe Phoenix, Arizona-based company reported first-quarter profit of $70.36 million, or 39 cents per diluted share, up from $14.87 million, or 18 cents per diluted share in the year-ago period.\nAdjusting for one-time items, Knight-Swift reported earnings per share of 44 cents. Wall Street analysts expected 40 cents.\nKnight-Swift posted revenue of $1.27 billion, below the $1.3 billion analysts expected.\nRecruiting and retaining truck drivers has been a lingering problem for U.S. trucking companies as they compete for qualified ones at a time of low U.S. unemployment, while striving to keep pay, a huge expense, as low as possible.\nShippers are facing one of the tightest trucking markets in years, as they struggle to find capacity for their cargo and complain of persistent service problems on U.S. railroads.\nThe company said its effective tax rate for the first quarter decreased to 21.2 percent from 35.3 percent in the same quarter last year.\nThe average number of trucks in its fleet was down 1.9 percent at Knight and 8 percent at Swift year-over-year. The company plans to spend between $525 million-$575 million on tractor and trailer replacements.\nA new federal mandate that drivers electronically log their hours on the road is expected to speed up consolidation in the deeply fragmented $676 billion U.S. trucking market and potentially reduce capacity further.\nKnight-Swift also said on Wednesday it had acquired Abilene Motor Express, a Richmond, Virginia-based truckload carrier with about $100 million in annual revenue in March for an undisclosed sum.\nReporting by Eric M.
