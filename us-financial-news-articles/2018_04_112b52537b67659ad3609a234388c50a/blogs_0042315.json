Neither brother has a background in genetics, but they saw an opportunity to use software to help scientists automate their research. \n\"As a field, CRISPR and genome engineering is very early on, \"Synthego's Paul Dabrowski told us. \n\"This, as a computer engineer, is like being, say, in the 1970's with computers, where everyone had mainframes and there were very few computer users.\" \nCNBC sat down with the Dabrowskis to discuss how their start-up, known as Synthego, makes it easier for scientists to use tools like CRISPR to find cures for diseases in the next decade. Here's what they had to say.
