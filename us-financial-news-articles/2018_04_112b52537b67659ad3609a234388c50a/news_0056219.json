Univest reported net income of $12.9 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $10.9 million, or $0.41 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 included restructuring costs related to financial center closures of $451 thousand, net of tax, or $0.01 of diluted earnings per share. There were no restructuring costs during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 also included a reduction in the Corporation's statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”).\nLoans\nGross loans and leases increased $69.8 million, or 7.7% (annualized), from December 31, 2017 and $348.0 million, or 10.4%, from March 31, 2017. The growth in loans from December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017 was primarily in commercial real estate, commercial business and residential real estate loans.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits decreased $57.6 million, or 6.5% (annualized), from December 31, 2017 and increased $131.3 million, or 3.9%, from March 31, 2017. The growth in deposits compared to March 31, 2017 was primarily due to increases in commercial and public funds deposits.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income of $37.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased $566 thousand, or 1.5%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $3.0 million, or 8.7%, from the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the growth in loans during the last year.\nNet interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.72% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.76% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.80% for the first quarter of 2017. The favorable impact of purchase accounting accretion was 2 basis points ($146 thousand) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4 basis points ($449 thousand) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 8 basis points ($764 thousand) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion, the net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.72% for both the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nNet interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, for all periods in 2017 was calculated using a 35% federal tax rate as compared to a 21% federal tax rate for the first quarter of 2018. Assuming a 21% federal tax rate and excluding purchase accounting, net interest margin was 3.64% for both the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $15.6 million, an increase of $612 thousand, or 4.1%, from the first quarter of 2017. Investment advisory commission and fee income increased $502 thousand, or 15.8%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to new customer relationships and favorable market performance during 2017. Insurance commission and fee income increased $478 thousand, or 10.8%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase in contingent commission income of $422 thousand, which was $1.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $963 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the net gain on mortgage banking of $397 thousand, or 35.7%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in mortgage volume due to a shortage of housing supply and the extended winter weather in March 2018. In addition, BOLI income decreased $114 thousand, or 14.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to a decrease in value of our non-qualified annuity portfolio, which is subject to equity market volatility.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $35.1 million, an increase of $3.1 million, or 9.7%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring costs related to financial center closures and staffing rationalization were $571 thousand for the quarter. There were no restructuring costs during the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSalaries, benefits and commissions increased $1.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily attributable to additional staff hired to support revenue generation across all business lines, expansion of our financial center footprint in Lancaster County and the Lehigh Valley and annual merit increases. Data processing expense increased $174 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increased investments in customer relationship management software, internal infrastructure improvements and outsourced data processing solutions. Other expense increased $358 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 primarily due to increases in deferred director stock expense and loan processing expense.\nAsset Quality and Provision for Loan and Lease Losses\nNon-accrual loans and leases, including non-accrual troubled debt restructured loans, were $27.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2017 and $19.9 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets were $32.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $28.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $27.3 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in non-accrual loans and leases at March 31, 2018 is primarily due to one commercial real estate loan in the amount of $12.3 million which was placed on non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2018. This was partially offset by troubled debt restructured commercial real estate loans for another borrower totaling $10.3 million which were returned to performing status during the first quarter of 2018 as the borrower was in compliance with the modified terms of the restructuring for the required time period.\nNet loan and lease charge-offs were $198 thousand during the first quarter of 2018. The provision for loan and lease losses was $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases held for investment, excluding covered loans acquired in the Fox Chase and Valley Green Bank acquisitions, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, was 0.73% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.70% at December 31, 2017 and 0.74% at March 31, 2017.\nTax Provision\nThe effective income tax rate was 18.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to an effective income tax rate of 26.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As previously discussed, the Corporation's statutory federal tax rate was reduced to 21% effective January 1, 2018 in accordance with the TCJA. The Corporation's effective income tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by discrete tax benefits totaling $118 thousand. Excluding these discrete items, the effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nDividend\nOn February 28, 2018, Univest declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, payable on April 2, 2018. This represented a 2.90% annualized yield based on the closing price of Univest’s stock on the date the dividend was paid.\nConference Call\nUnivest will host a conference call to discuss first quarter 2018 results on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. EDT.
