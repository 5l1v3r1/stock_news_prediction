(NYSE: NSP), a leading provider of human resources and business performance solutions for America’s best businesses, today reported results for the first quarter ended Mar. 31, 2018:\nRevenues up 15% on worksite employee growth of 12% Gross profit up 25% on strong pricing and direct cost trends Net income up 40% to $50.0 million Adjusted EBITDA up 34% to $83.8 million EPS up 39% to $1.18; adjusted EPS up 53% to $1.41\nFirst Quarter Results\nFirst quarter 2018 net income and diluted earnings per share of $50.0 million and $1.18 represented increases of 40% and 39%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.41, a 53% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34% over the first quarter of 2017 to $83.8 million.\n“We are pleased to report these outstanding record results reflecting our dynamic business model and strong execution all across the company,” said Paul J. Sarvadi, Insperity chairman and chief executive officer. “Our key drivers to growth and profitability are in place setting up a fourth consecutive year of impressive earnings growth for 2018.”\nRevenues increased 15% over the first quarter of 2017 to $1.0 billion on a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month. The continued double-digit worksite employee growth was the result of strong new client sales driven by an increase in the number of trained Business Performance Advisors, a continuing high level of client retention, and an improvement in the net hiring of worksite employees by our client base. Worksite employees paid from new sales increased 23% over the first quarter of 2017 on a 15% increase in the average number of trained Business Performance Advisors. Client attrition totaled only 8% during the heavy first quarter client renewal period, an improvement over the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased 25% over the first quarter of 2017 to $199.7 million. This increase was driven by the 12% worksite employee growth, lower cost trends in our benefits and workers’ compensation programs and solid pricing. Operating expenses increased 28% over the first quarter of 2017 to $135.0 million, including one-time bonuses related to tax reform and additional accruals for incentive compensation tied to our outperformance during the quarter.\nNet income and adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 25% and 19%, respectively, over the first quarter of 2017 to $85 and $143, respectively.\nThe first quarter 2018 effective income tax rate of 23% was impacted by the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 and the benefit associated with the vesting of long-term incentive plan shares during the quarter.\n“Our double-digit worksite employee growth, combined with the effective management of pricing and direct cost programs, continued to produce adjusted EBITDA at record levels,” said Douglas S. Sharp, senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer and treasurer. “This strong cash flow positions us to continue to invest in the growth of our business while also providing excellent shareholder returns.”\n2018 Guidance\nThe company also announced its updated guidance for 2018, including the second quarter of 2018. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables at the end of this press release for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nQ2 2018 Full Year 2018 Average WSEEs 202,000 — 203,700 206,400 — 208,400 Year-over-year increase 12% — 13% 13% — 14% Adjusted EPS $0.59 — $0.63 $3.36 — $3.44 Year-over-year increase 44% — 54% 37% — 40% Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) $41 — $43 $218 — $223 Year-over-year increase 23% — 29% 23% — 25% Definition of Key Metrics\nAverage WSEEs - Determined by calculating the company’s cumulative worksite employees paid during the period divided by the number of months in the period.\nAdjusted EPS - Represents diluted net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock-based compensation and costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees.\nInsperity will be hosting a conference call today at 10 a.m. ET to discuss these results, provide guidance for the second quarter and an update to the full year guidance, and answer questions from investment analysts.
