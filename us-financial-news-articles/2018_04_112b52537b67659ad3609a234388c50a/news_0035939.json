Most notably, this acquisition will bring Premier's Bag-on-Valve (BOV) filling capabilities in-house at Wisconsin Pharmacal Company's Jackson, WI facility.\nBOV aerosol technology works by using compressed air around a filled bag-on-value unit inside a can as the pressure necessary to propel the product out of the can. Although bag-on-valve continuous sprays look like traditional aerosol cans from the outside, this superior spray dispensing system offers a multitude of benefits over traditional aerosols, including:\nEnvironmentally friendly – contains no harmful propellants and completely recyclable 360° Spray - can be sprayed in any direction, even upside down, with no pumping or shaking 100% Emptying - dispenses 100% of the product in the can 100% Formula - a BOV is filled with 100% of actual formula with no need for propellants, giving it a longer shelf life and the ability to have a sterilize final product\nTo learn more about how Bag-on-Valve technology works, visit http://pharmacalway.com/bag-on-valve.php http://pharmacalway.com/bag-on-valve.php .\n\"We're really excited to have completed this acquisition,\" said John Wundrock, President and CEO of Wisconsin Pharmacal Company . \"Bringing the ability to fill BOV products in-house not only expands our capabilities for contract manufacturing opportunities, but also puts us in a proprietary position for our existing branded BOV products and will allow us to expand on those branded offerings.\"\nWisconsin Pharmacal currently offers the first available 100% Deet BOV as well as the first Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus insect repellent product available in a continuous spray, under their Coleman ® Insect Repellents brand ( www.ColemanRepellents.com ). They also have plans to extend the technology into their MG217 ® line of psoriasis and eczema treatment products in the near future.\nFor more information on Wisconsin Pharmacal Company, their branded product lines and their contract manufacturing capabilities, please visit www.pharmacalway.com .
