Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. People across the world have spoken and made it clear, they do not want to share their personal data. (For more on this, see below for the Download’s overview of Facebook Inc .’s visit to Washington, D.C.) The assumption seems to be that the public is battling tech companies for control of a vital resource, insofar as data is the putative oil of the 21st century. What if, however, that formulation isn’t quite right? What if data is more akin to gas… the sort that inflates hot air balloons?\nLet’s consider the idea of the social graph, an assemblage of everything that the users of a digital platform view or do, every like, every share, every thumbs up, every endorsement, every page view, every purchase and even the amount of time that their cursor or finger lingers over an object on a page. Soon digital cameras and microphones will record our vocal inflections and subtle facial expressions. All of this data feeds into algorithms and analytic engines that are supposed to anticipate what we want to buy with a precision that today’s marketers can’t even imagine. Personalized wellness plans and medical treatments will extend our lives, and our time on this earth as productive assets. That’s what people mean when they talk about digital business.\nOf course there is bound to be a lot of value here. Companies are already building successful businesses on this model and there is reason to believe that more will be created. The danger is that companies will be distracted by this exhaust pipe of daily life. While they are sifting through the endless, mundane detritus of digital activity to figure out what people want, the next Steve Jobs or Henry Ford or Thomas Edison will be imagining it.\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS \nDuring his testimony Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the company’s recent data-breach scandals ANDREW HARRER/BLOOMBERG NEWS In Facebook hearings, lawmakers ramp up talk of regulation.

He was so unsticky, the questions slid right off him.”\nYet, Facebook’s days as an unregulated monopoly may be numbered. If regulators want to change Facebook’s calculus, they will have to either enact tougher regulation or nurture more competition, says the Journal’s Greg Ip .\nLosers: People wanting answers.

Wildlife traffickers are using the Facebook platform, including Instagram and Whatsapp, to engage in the illegal trade of body parts of threatened animals, the Associated Press reports . Meanwhile the social network is displaying ads for “well-known corporations” on the traffickers’ Facebook group pages.\nSo a New York Times reporter downloaded his Facebook data. “With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers — many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band — had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name.” Read more .\nNew target for China’s censors: Content driven by AI.
