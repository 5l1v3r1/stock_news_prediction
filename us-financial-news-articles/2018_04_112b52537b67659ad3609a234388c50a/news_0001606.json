The company financed the acquisition with the proceeds of an $825 million incremental term loan facility, which closed simultaneous with the acquisition.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Lifetouch to the Shutterfly family, and are excited to bring together two undisputed leaders in adjacent verticals, both of which have the common mission of helping customers share life’s joy through photos,” said Christopher North, President & Chief Executive Officer of Shutterfly. “We are focused on realizing the three value creation opportunities that we previously articulated: gaining access to many Lifetouch customers as Shutterfly customers, offering Shutterfly’s broader product range to Lifetouch customers and accelerating the development of Lifetouch’s online platform, and realizing significant supply chain, manufacturing, and fulfillment synergies over time.”\nMichael Meek will remain as President and Chief Executive Officer of Lifetouch, and will report to Christopher North.\nNow that the acquisition has closed, Lifetouch will no longer be required to fund the Lifetouch Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). At closing, the sale proceeds were paid to the trustee of the ESOP who will distribute the proceeds to participants. Generally, participants will receive full payment for their ESOP interest in two installments, and following expiration of applicable escrows and final approval of the IRS, the ESOP will be terminated.\nShutterfly expects the acquisition to result in approximately $935.0 million of additional Net Revenues, and approximately $100.0 million of additional Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve-month period following closing of the acquisition. The Company will provide updated 2018 financial guidance incorporating Lifetouch results of operations for the remainder of the year, on its Q1’18 earnings call.\nAs mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, the Company is targeting a minimum of $450 million of Adjusted EBITDA by 2020. For additional information on the components of this Adjusted EBITDA target, please see the presentation accompanying the Company’s January 30, 2018 conference call.\nTransaction Details\nShutterfly acquired privately-held Lifetouch for $825 million, cash-free, debt-free. The acquisition of Lifetouch was announced on January 30, 2018 and was approved by the Board of Directors of Shutterfly and the trustee of the Lifetouch ESOP prior to announcement. Shutterfly financed the acquisition with incremental term loans, which closed simultaneous with the acquisition.\nIncremental Term Loan B Details\nIn connection with the acquisition of Lifetouch, the company incurred $825 million of incremental term loans. The incremental term loans bear interest at LIBOR, plus 250 - 275 basis points (determined based on the company’s secured leverage ratio, as defined), and were issued at a discount to par of 25 basis points. The incremental term loans mature on August 17, 2024, concurrent with the company’s $300 million of existing term loans incurred on August 17, 2017. The terms of the facility are set forth in an Incremental Term Loan Amendment dated April 2, 2018 by and among Shutterfly, the subsidiary guarantors, the lenders and issuing banks, and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as administrative agent and collateral agent, and amends the company’s existing Credit Agreement, dated as of August 17, 2017. The incremental term loans were drawn in full at closing.\nAs part of the Term Loan B issuance, the company received updated credit ratings, which now incorporate the Lifetouch acquisition and the incremental debt. The company maintained its Ba3/BB- rating profile through this process, consistent with the company’s stated intentions.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains a non-GAAP financial measure (adjusted EBITDA). We have not reconciled our combined company non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA target of $450 million for 2020 and Lifetouch non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA of $100 million for the twelve-month period following closing of the acquisition to comparable GAAP operating income at this stage of the process because it is unreasonably difficult to provide guidance for stock-based compensation expense, capitalization and amortization of internal-use software and charges related to the proposed acquisition, which are reconciling items between GAAP operating loss and non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA. The factors that may impact our future stock-based compensation expense and capitalization and amortization of internal-use software are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and therefore we are unable to provide such guidance without unreasonable effort. Factors include our market capitalization and related volatility of our stock price and our inability to project the cost or scope of internally-produced software and charges related to the proposed acquisition during this time period.\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we believe that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about the Company's core operating results. We believe this measure provides both management and investors a more complete understanding of the Company's underlying operational results and trends and performance. The method we use to produce this measure may differ from the methods used by other companies. The presentation of additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures in accordance with GAAP.

These forward-looking statements include the expected acceleration of Shutterfly and Lifetouch strategies, expectations around gaining access to Lifetouch customers and benefits to Shutterfly customers; anticipated acceleration of the development of Lifetouch’s online platform; and expected supply chain, manufacturing and fulfillment synergies over time; the distribution of the proceeds to participants and the receipt of full payments by the participants; the expected increase in New Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets for the twelve months following closing; the Adjusted EBITDA targets for 2020. You can identify these statements by the use of terminology such as “guidance”, “believe”, “expect”, “will”, “should,” “could”, “estimate”, “anticipate” or similar forward-looking terms. Factors that might contribute to such differences include, among others, the retention of Lifetouch employees and our ability to successfully integrate the Lifetouch businesses; risks inherent in the achievement of anticipated synergies and the timing thereof; general economic conditions and changes in laws and regulations; decreased consumer discretionary spending as a result of general economic conditions; our ability to expand our customer base and increase sales to existing customers; our ability to meet production requirements; our ability to retain and hire necessary employees, including seasonal personnel, and appropriately staff our operations; the impact of seasonality on our business; our ability to develop innovative, new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis; consumer acceptance of our products and services; our ability to develop additional adjacent lines of business; unforeseen changes in expense levels; and competition and the pricing strategies of our competitors, which could lead to pricing pressure.
