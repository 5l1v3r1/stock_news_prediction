Total stocks are up 9 percent since the start of the Rusal sanctions on April 6. \nDOLLAR: Boosting commodity prices was a softer dollar , which tends to support metals it is priced in. \nLME: The LME will suspend Rusal’s aluminium from its list of approved brands from April 17 after some members raised concerns about settling LME contracts with companies facing sanctions. \nSPREADS: The premium of cash to the three-month contract on the LME was at $52 a tonne on Thursday, its highest in at least a decade, but nearly evaporated by Monday to above $6. CMAL0-3 \nU.S. PREMIUMS: The U.S aluminium premium on Comex was at 21.1 cents per pound ($465 a tonne) on Friday, close to its highest in three years. \nOTHER METALS: Three-month copper ended 1.2 percent higher at $6,910.50 a tonne, tin was flat at $21,025, zinc gained 0.6 percent to $3,136.50, lead added 3 percent to $2,370 and nickel rose 2.8 percent to a two-month high of $14,335 tonnes.
