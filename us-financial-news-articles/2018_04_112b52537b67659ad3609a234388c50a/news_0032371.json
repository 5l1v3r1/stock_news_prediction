On the streets of Luanda, a dollar goes for nearly twice the official rate. \nA devaluation of around 30 percent to the dollar this year has gone some way to closing the gap with the street rate. \nAngola has been trying to persuade international banks to rekindle dollar correspondent relationships with the country, which were cut over the past few years due to perceived compliance risks in doing business there.
