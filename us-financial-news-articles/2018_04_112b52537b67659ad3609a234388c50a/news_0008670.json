The Raptors need one win or a Celtics loss to clinch the top seed.\nMarcus Morris led the Celtics with 21 points, and Greg Monroe had 17 and eight rebounds. Boston lost its second consecutive game after winning six straight. The Celtics split their four-game season series with the Raptors after winning 110-99 last Saturday in Boston.\nToronto had lost two straight — including a 111-91 decision at Cleveland on Tuesday — and five of eight since a season-high, 11-game winning streak.\nBoston was playing without star Kyrie Irving, who missed his 11th game in a row after undergoing a left knee procedure. Marcus Smart (thumb) also missed his 11th straight and Shane Larkin (illness) sat out a second straight game.\nThe Raptors won despite shooting just 43.5 percent (40 of 92) for the game. Toronto outrebounded the Celtics 48-43.\nAl Horford contributed 16 points for the Celtics, who were held to a season low in points. Boston shot just 33.3 percent (25 of 75) from the floor while making just 13.6 percent (3 of 22) of its 3-point attempts.\nTerry Rozier was back in the Celtics’ starting lineup after missing the team’s 106-102 defeat at Milwaukee on Tuesday with an ankle injury. He finished with two points, a team-leading nine rebounds and three assists.\nThe turning point came in the second quarter when the Raptors erased a six-point hole to outscore the Celtics 29-13 and take a 43-33 advantage into halftime.\nToronto stretched its lead to 20 in the third and entered the fourth up 67-53. Boston was unable to trim its deficit under single digits in the final period.\nBoston hosts the Chicago Bulls on Friday, the same day Toronto hosts the Indiana Pacers.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T10:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:01:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
