Aluminium has lost about 8.2 percent in London this week, having fallen sharply on Monday and Tuesday after the United States gave American customers of Rusal more time to comply with the sanctions, which were first announced on April 6. This has left it on course for its biggest weekly drop since August 2011, although it is still up 13.1 percent in April on the back of Rusal concerns, which would be its best month since September 2010.
