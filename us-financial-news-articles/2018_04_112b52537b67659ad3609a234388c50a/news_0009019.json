However, he said the pool of potential targets was limited.\nHe told shareholders that Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, which also has substantial operations in the United States, was confident that talks to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would result in a positive outcome.\nThe United States, Canada and Mexico have been in talks for more than eight months to revamp NAFTA after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to abandon the pact unless it was reformed to his liking.\nCanadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Wednesday the three countries had made good progress in the talks but there was still work to be done.\nReporting by Matt Scuffham Editing by Susan Thomas and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T22:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:03:56.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
