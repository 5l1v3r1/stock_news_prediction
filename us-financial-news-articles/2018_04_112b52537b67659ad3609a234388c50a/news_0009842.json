REUTERS/Francois Lenoir Armed with a bag full of flowers, soil and a small plastic watering can, Anton Schuurmans walks around town planting daffodils or geraniums in every pothole he finds, sometimes braving heavy traffic to reach the middle of busy crossings.\n“Pedestrians, bicycles, people with their cars, everybody is being annoyed by these potholes,” said 29-year-old Schuurmans, standing outside Brussels’ gothic cathedral, where he had just planted several flowers.\nPeople stopped and took pictures on their phones as they walked by the flowers, many agreeing that the potholes had become a problem.\n“There are many potholes in the street in front of my house, so we hear a lot of noise every evening as people drive over them quickly,” said Mathieu Taziaux, who works in Brussels.\nSchuurmans, who moved to Belgium from the Netherlands seven years ago, said his floral protest had already had some success in persuading the council to act, pointing across the street to a newly repaired patch of road.\n“At least one pothole has been repaired two days after I planted the flower in it,” he said. “I was quite happy to see that.”\nSlideshow (9 Images) Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T15:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T15:56:00.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
