LOUIS (Reuters) - A St. Louis judge on Thursday rejected a bid to dismiss a criminal invasion of privacy charge against Missouri Governor Eric Greitens stemming from a sex scandal involving an extramarital affair.\nFILE PHOTO: Missouri Governor Eric Greitens appears in a police booking photo in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S., February 22, 2018. St. Louis Metropolitan Police Dept./Handout via REUTERS Judge Rex Burlison ruled against the Republican governor’s legal team, which filed a motion last week accusing Kim Gardner, the Democratic circuit attorney for the city of St. Louis, of prosecutorial misconduct. The lawyers had argued that Gardner tried to conceal video evidence favorable to the governor and his assertions that the affair was entirely consensual.\nRepresentatives for Greitens and Gardner did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nGreitens was indicted in February on a single felony count of invasion of privacy, charging he took a photo of a woman in a state of undress without her consent and then made it accessible by computer to use as retaliation should she divulge their relationship. Many state politicians, including Republicans, have called for him to resign.\nThe alleged offense occurred in March 2015, the year before Greitens, a married father of two and a former U.S. Navy SEAL commando, was elected governor. If convicted, he would face up to four years in prison.\nGreitens has admitted to a months-long affair with the woman. But he has denied blackmailing her or other criminal wrongdoing. Instead, he has cast himself as the victim of a “political witch-hunt” for private transgressions that have nothing to do with his job as governor.\nHis lawyers have noted neither prosecutors nor anyone else has produced the photograph in question. The woman testified to a state House of Representatives committee that she believes it was taken while she was bound and blindfolded, and partially nude, in Greitens’ basement.\nFollowing the release of the committee’s report last week, pressure has mounted from Missouri politicians in both parties for Greitens to resign, but he has said he will remain in office while he fights to clear his name.\nThat pressure grew more intense on Tuesday after Missouri’s attorney general said his office uncovered evidence of electronic theft by Greitens in an unrelated investigation - an allegation the governor dismissed as “ridiculous.” That case also has been referred to the St. Louis prosecutor.\nWriting by Steve Gorman and Suzannah Gonzales; Editing by Dan Grebler and Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T13:28:33.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
