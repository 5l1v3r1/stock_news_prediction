The inflation data will animate discussions about whether these moves will be enough to keep price pressures under control.\nThe Fed is closer than it has been in years to meeting its mandates to foster the best labor market possible without fueling too much inflation. Officials want to keep gradually raising rates to keep the economy on an even keel, which could become more challenging as the economy absorbs a boost from recent tax cuts and federal spending increases.\nUnemployment, at 4.1% since fall, is below the level officials regard as sustainable over the long run while keeping price pressures contained.\nThe Commerce Department is likely to report Monday an upturn in inflation because weak March 2017 figures will fall out of the 12-month measure. Fed officials say this increase alone won’t change their interest-rate plans. A recent rise in the cost of hospital services has also been giving the inflation reading an extra pop.\nEconomists estimate so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy categories, rose 1.9% for the year ended in March, up from 1.6% in February.\nFed officials see 2% inflation as consistent with an economy with healthy demand for goods and services. Projections released at their meeting last month show all 15 participants expected annual core inflation of at least 2% by 2020, and more than half of them see it rising to at least 2.1% next year and staying there through 2020.\nThis was the first time officials have projected inflation exceeding the Fed’s 2% target, signaling they don’t expect to pick up the pace of rate increases in the case of a modest and temporary overshoot.\n“We’re going to see the Federal Reserve emphasize that we missed the target on the downside for a while and for that reason we’re willing to accommodate inflation somewhat above target for a while,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former Fed economist.\nStill, officials haven’t said how much or for how long they would let inflation go above 2% before moving raising rates more aggressively to bring it down. “We haven’t agreed on that,” said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at a news conference last month.\nSome officials have weighed in on the matter. Addressing questions about a possible rethink of the inflation target, New York Fed President William Dudley said earlier this month that he might be comfortable adopting a range of 1.5% to 2.5%. The comment suggested some comfort with inflation running up to 2.5%.\nChicago Fed President Charles Evans has said 2.5% inflation wouldn’t be a problem for him.\nOfficials are also likely to keep a close eye on inflation expectations. If they remain anchored even as core inflation rises to 2.5%, “I’m not going to be worried about it,” said Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari in a recent interview. If expectations start to rise, however, the Fed might need “to send some kind of signal that we are not going to let that get out of control,” he said.\nInvestors appear to be anticipating higher inflation than in recent years. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit 3% last week, up from near 1.5% a couple of years ago. The 10-year break-even inflation rate, derived from Treasury inflation-protected securities, has climbed to four-year highs.\nFed officials have made few changes to their interest-rate forecasts over the past two years, even though they have repeatedly raised their economic-growth projections. Officials have said they don’t need to make dramatic changes in their rate plans so long as inflation runs below 2%.\nIf inflation floats above 2%, however, the calculations change. The rate path could steepen if Fed officials worry accelerating growth is fueling excessive price pressures or asset bubbles.\nAt the same time, they don’t want to raise rates so much that they trigger a recession.\nFor now, few economists forecast a breakout in inflation, but they see that risk rising. Researchers at Goldman Sachs estimate a 15% probability that core inflation will rise above 2.5% one year from now and a 30% probability two years from now.\n“The extent to which inflation overshoots the Fed’s target is critical to the economic and market outlook this year,” wrote Jeremy Nalewaik, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley who previously worked at the Fed. “Greater Fed tolerance for higher inflation could temper recession risks for a while, but there are limits to the Fed’s tolerance.”", "external_links": ["https://djcs-olympics.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-data-charts/custom-data-chart-wsj-0.8.34.min.js"], "published": "2018-04-29T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T16:11:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
