Horton Inc, which he said should see a boost as more millennials age into the first-time home buyer market. \nThe country’s largest homebuilder has been increasingly focused on its entry-level segment, which it told analysts in January should grow strongly over the next three years. \nAt least two investors, meanwhile, pitched online food ordering companies. Alexander Captain, who runs Cat Rock Capital Management, introduced Dutch company Takeaway.com NV while Lin Ran, who runs Half Sky Capital, pitched GrubHub Inc , the parent company of Seamless. She said GrubHub averages $30 per order, and it earns 15 percent of each order, earning the roughly 15 percent, while spending growth at restaurants is outpacing spending at grocery stores. \n“I like to call this chart ‘Millennials can’t cook,” Ran said, to laughter. \nMillennials, a term for those born between 1981 and 1996, are expected to become the largest generation in the United States in 2019, according to estimates from Pew Research. \nJeffrey Gundlach, one of the world’s most closely-watched investors, recommended a short position in social media giant Facebook Inc and a long position in the SPDR S&P Oil and Gas Exploration ETF. \n“Facebook used to be a place people felt good going to,” Gundlach said. \nFacebook has come under pressure as the company acknowledged misuse of users’ data. \nInvestors were confident about their stock picks at a time when the broad S&P 500 has been lagging and retail clients have expressed nervousness about the durability of the stock market’s long-running gains. \nKhoury, from Long Pond Capital, suggested that DR Horton had more than 60-percent upside, while Ran, from Half Sky Capital, said that GrubHub could hit $160 a share, up nearly 55 percent from its Monday afternoon trading price of $103.25. \nOrganizers said they were expecting as many 3,000 attendees at New York’s Lincoln Center, making Sohn one of the most high-profile investment conferences of the year. \nAgainst a background of more volatile markets and worries that some of the biggest hedge fund managers are nursing losses this year, many in the audience focused on the smaller, better-performing investors like Oleg Nodelman. \nNodelman, founder and managing Director of EcoR1 Capital LLC, whose fund returned a reported 53 percent last year, announced a long bet on drug company Ascendis Pharma A/S .
