There are concerns too that an influx of more than one million migrants, mainly from the Middle East, since mid-2015 might also be fuelling anti-Semitism. \nThe two men, aged 21 and 24, were attacked by three people, police said. The 21-year-old suffered minor injuries. \nOne of the three attackers hit the 21-year-old with a belt and also tried to hit him with a glass bottle. A female witness placed herself between them and prevented any further violence. \nGermany’s Jewish community leader advised Jews in 2015 not to wear skullcaps in areas with a large Muslim population. \nDeidre Berger, director of the AJC Berlin Ramer Institute for German-Jewish Relations, said the assault showed that people had lost their inhibitions to carry out anti-Semitic violence. \n“We mustn’t close out eyes to anti-Semitism, which is becoming increasingly frequent in parts of the Arab and Muslim community,” she said. “We must not allow Jews on our streets to become fair game.” \nForeign Minister Heiko Maas told the Funke media group it was intolerable that young men had been attacked in Germany just because they were wearing skullcaps. \n“Jews must never feel threatened here again,” he said. “We are responsible for protecting Jewish life.” \nGermany recently appointed Felix Klein to serve as the government’s first commissioner to combat anti-Semitism. \nThere have been a spate of reports about anti-Semitic bullying in schools. On Wednesday, education ministers from Germany’s federal states and the Central Council of Jews in Germany together presented material that teachers can use to inform their students about Judaism. \nHelmut Holter, education minister in the eastern state of Thuringia, said that Judaism was largely only talked about in the context of the Holocaust at school, and added that while this remained essential, education about Judaism needed to be broader to help reduce prejudices.
