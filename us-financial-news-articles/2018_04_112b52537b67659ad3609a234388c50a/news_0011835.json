Kaleo will bill their commercial insurer.\nIn response to the opioid epidemic, states have enacted laws to ease access to naloxone. Most states permit dispensing through a standing order, and at least half a dozen allow some pharmacists to prescribe naloxone on their own authority.\nIn a statement, Kaleo said it plans to eventually expand its “Virtual Standing Order” pilot program to additional states.\nIt also said federal and state government agencies, as well as Native American tribes that purchase directly from Kaleo, will now pay $360 for a pack of two Evzio auto-injectors.\nThe drugmaker already sells the device at the $360 cash price for patients without government or commercial insurance and at no cost for people with a household income of less than $100,000.\nKaleo last year caught the attention of lawmakers like U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill after it sharply raised the price of an Evzio twin-pack from $575 in 2014.\nThe use of prescription opioids among people with employer-based health coverage has declined over the past decade, but the cost of treating addiction and overdoses has increased sharply, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study released on Thursday.\nThe study found that the annual cost of treating opioid addiction and overdose - from both prescription and illicit use - rose to $2.6 billion in 2016 from $300 million in 2004.\nKaleo also said it will continue to donate Evzio to qualifying nonprofits and first responders demonstrating need.\nReporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T23:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:09:47.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
