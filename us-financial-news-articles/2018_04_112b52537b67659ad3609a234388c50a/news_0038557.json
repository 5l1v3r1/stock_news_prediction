My husband, however, curls into a ball at the mere idea of 8 a.m. I bought him a sleep mask so we don’t start our days angry, but these cracks at dawn have been the tipping point of an incompatible sleep relationship that has plagued our marriage for the last five years.\nPartnered sleep provides fertile ground for fighting, with couples having competing requirements for what makes a good night’s rest. In a 2012 National Sleep Foundation survey, 1,000 adults aged between 25 and 55 ranked the factors most important for their best night’s sleep. One can almost see the pillows sailing while reading the list: room temperature, noise and the number of blankets piled on the bed rated high.\nIn fact, I do see that sort of nocturnal discord most nights. My husband and I spar over covers and alarms, how much we touch (I’m a notorious spooner) and what he calls my constant thrashing and twitching. I’ve even considered the extreme option of separate beds , which is the current sleep set-up for approximately one in four American households. However, that feels like amputating your arm when stitches might do.\n“A partnership’s intimacy may be mitigated if they each sleep in separate bedrooms,” said Kailen Rosenberg, relationship expert and author of “Real Love, Right Now,” who’s seen many couples troubled with these differences. “It removes an intimate, daily connection.” And a bad night’s sleep can spiral into grumpiness and resentment, neither of which have ever been credited with improving a marriage.\nSo separate beds were out. But we decided it was time to change up our sleep space. In the same National Sleep Foundation survey, 93% of respondents, perhaps not surprisingly, identified a comfortable mattress as the most salient factor for getting quality sleep, and as we were both tired of ours, I started our bedroom’s makeover with its veritable core: the mattress.\nDON’T GIVE UP ON YOUR DREAMS Smart bedroom accessories to help you fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer and sleep more soundly\n1.

ZEEQ Smart Pillow The pillow detects snoring through built-in microphones and raises the sleeper’s head in real-time to help nix the noise. $200, rem-fit.com It’s been hard to ignore the proliferation of sleep brands, most notably Casper, the direct-to-consumer company whose ads cover subway walls and pop up in podcasts. In 2015, I succumbed to the brand’s cheery messaging—notably the three little pigs cuddled up with the Big Bad Wolf. Their free shipping and surprising risk-free 100-night test drive, some version of which is offered by most companies now, led me to buy the one model they offered at the time, which used memory foam instead of traditional spring coils. But now it was clear we were fed up with sharing that bed, which wasn’t doing it for us and only made my twitching worse.\nWe first tested what are known as hybrid mattresses—those with a mix of memory foam and innerspring coils—in the optimistic hope that we’d both be instantly pleased. According to Natalie Dautovich, a scientist for the National Sleep Foundation, hybrid styles are popular because they serve as a compromise for many couples. “There’s softer, more body-conforming memory foam,” Ms. Dautovich said, “but then there’s an innerspring core for the partner who will want more support.”\nBest known for making home exercise equipment, NordicTrack designed its innovative hybrid Sleep Mattress, which starts at $3,350 on nordictrack.com (all prices queen size) for weekend athletes and tech geeks looking to outsmart bad sleep habits. It comes equipped with the iFit Sleep Coach that syncs with a smartphone app to measure heart rate, breathing and the amount of light, deep and REM sleep you get each night. It seemed fun and inventive but was ultimately useless: I was overwhelmed by the metrics and didn’t know how to actually implement the numbers into my daily sleep plan. So the iFit was a hard pass, as was the mattress, which felt like a dense, oversized hospital bed. We realized that simply defaulting to a hybrid approach to find a happy medium left us both unsatisfied, and that we hadn’t actually talked about what was most important to each of us in a shared bed.\nIt turns out we’re like many incompatible sleep couples. According to Arlyn Davich, CEO of lifestyle and decor brand Allswell Home, the most common conflict is how soft (or not) the mattress is. Which is why we tried the two options offered by the new brand aimed at women, who wield much of the household purchasing power, said Mr. Davich. (Their king-size is actually called a “Supreme Queen,” and beds ship in a blush-hued box.) Allswell peddles the Softer One, made of memory foam wrapped in specialty cooling fabrics and infused with buzzy natural ingredients like activated charcoal and green tea, and the Firmer One, which is all that plus coils for support (from $855, allswellhome.com ) .\nFlopping onto the Firmer One first, I was thrilled. Because I have a weak lower back—as do more than two-thirds of American adults according to a 2014 study by the American Physical Therapy Association—I appreciated its sturdy foundation that felt closest to curling up on the floor, a feeling I admittedly grew to love during summers at camp. My husband, however, was horrified by how hard it felt as he pressed down, knowing he’d sleep poorly. He did. But what surprised me was how crummy my night’s rest was. I jerked and wiggled across the superfirm style all night.\n‘ More than 90% of people said a good mattress was the most salient factor for quality sleep. ’\nWe tested the Softer One the next night, which was so pillowy you could sink right in—a quality people like my husband look for in a bed. He woke happy, but I felt choked by its cloudy grasp. And while I definitely slept better on the softer mattress—a surprising fact that I attribute to the memory foam, which experts say is better for side sleepers like me—I just didn’t relish the prospect of feeling buried in quicksand for approximately one-third of my life.\nSince we couldn’t both get what we needed in one mattress, we next tried a Sleep Number bed, the brand famous for letting each partner literally dial in their individual side’s level of softness, adjusting it from zero (softest) to 100 using a remote or smartphone app. The Sleep Number approach aligns with recent research, too: An April 2018 study out of Penn State University found that once you share a bed, sleep is no longer an individual-level activity. Results showed that a male’s sleep duration and quality was often significantly influenced by a female partner (but not vice versa). So an individual approach could be our sleep solution.\nAfter reviewing the litany of offerings—for a price you can add under-bed lighting, zero-gravity positioning, and foot warmers—we decided on the 360 p6 Smart Bed (from $2,799, sleepnumber.com ) . We opted for its fabrics that help regulate temperatures and a FlexFit base that lets each partner raise and lower their heads (a quick fix for snoring). The 360 is smart. Really smart, actually: Its embedded sensors notice when you move and responsively inflate or deflate regions to contour to your body as you roll into different sleep positions.\nHowever, it was this exact technology that turned my husband off to the Sleep Number. Along with feeling my every move, he now sensed the mattress’s nearly constant responses to those twitches. That resulted in his tossing and turning and even more shifting by the mattress. We didn’t find our individual Sleep Numbers to be life changing—or worth the several grand the bed costs.\nDisgruntled and exhausted from all the sleeping, we decided to try Helix, another direct-to-consumer mattress brand I discovered via a subway ad. You might call it the spawn of Casper and Sleep Number, offering an easy purchasing experience and arsenal of options. We decided on the brand’s Dual-Comfort model (from $995, helixsleep.com ) , which literally splits the mattress down the middle, requiring each partner to take an online survey that helps customize his or her side based on their individual body type, preferred sleep position, temperature and level of softness.\nAfter liberating the bed from its shrink-wrapping, we were delighted by the well-designed differences on each of our hemispheres: His was so soft and mushy, mine more like a few planks of wood covered in a thin duvet.\nWhen my husband and I rose the next morning, we were both seriously refreshed from a solid eight hours of sleep and impressed that neither of us awoke during the night. Because of their split-down-the-middle option, Helix markets itself as the mattress for couples. Ms. Rosenberg said she was a fan of the thought behind this design. “It eliminates compromise,” she said, so neither partner feels resentful nor sleep-deprived.\nAfter five years of matrimony, it’s hard to believe a new mattress was all it took to stop us from arguing—about sleep, at least.\nThe Most-Mismatched Sleep Couples: Which Are You Part Of?
