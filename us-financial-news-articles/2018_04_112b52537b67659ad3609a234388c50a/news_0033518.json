REUTERS/Vincent Kessler Addressing the European parliament, Macron was asked by a lawmaker how he intended to keep the strongest economic links between Britain and the EU after it leaves the bloc.\n“I’m for the strongest and closest relationship possible, and there’s one solution we know well for that: it’s EU membership,” he replied, half in jest. “It’s the one solution that allows access to the single market, access to (EU) freedoms and a good integration.”\nPrime Minister Theresa May has said Britain will not stay in the European single market - which would mean giving EU citizens the freedom to work in the country - or join a customs union with the bloc after Brexit. Brussels insists that this will mean some barriers for UK exports.\n“There’s no cherry picking in the single market. You have to be coherent in the choices you make,” Macron said. “Many people in your country propose ‘what if scenarios’, but don’t explain what happens the day after. The day after, you necessarily have to grasp with reality.”\nReporting by Michel Rose in Paris and Alastair Macdonald in Strasbourg; editing by David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T15:33:25.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
