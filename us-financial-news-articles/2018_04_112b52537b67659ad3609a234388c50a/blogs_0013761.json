I've got some apples in my backyard that I want to have squeezed up to give as gifts to my employees.' So we went and picked up the apples, juiced them up and then I said, 'Hey Steve, maybe you can do me a favor and do your employees a favor — I'd be happy to drop some juice off every day for them.'\"\nJobs agreed and started putting the juices in the Apple cafeteria. After all, he was \"a big lover of fresh juice,\" says Steltenpohl.\nBloomberg | Getty Images Apple co-founder Steve Jobs Besides stocking the Apple headquarters with Odwalla and generally promoting the product, Jobs also passed on lasting business advice, Steltenpohl tells CNBC Make It: \"He always said, 'Never be afraid to pick up the phone and call the best person in the world at doing anything.' He said, 'If you care about something, get the best and go for the best.' That was simple advice, but I keep that in mind.\"\nPlus, \"his sense of design has kind of been a consistent source of discipline for me,\" says Steltenpohl, particularly for his latest venture: Califia Farms . After an E. coli outbreak put Odwalla on the brink of bankruptcy in the late 1990s, Steltenpohl and his partners were forced to sell the company in 2001 to Coca-Cola.\nBut Steltenpohl, now in his mid-sixties, is once again generating beverage industry buzz with Califia, a plant-based beverage company he co-founded in 2012 and currently runs as CEO. Califia sells its plant milk in eye-catching, curvy bottles, a design that was partly inspired by Jobs.\nSteltenpohl says he always kept in mind \"the way Steve went the extra mile to make sure that things looked just right. And that gave me a lot of encouragement to push the envelope on Califia's design.\n\"I owe him a lot actually,\" the entrepreneur adds.\nLike this story?
