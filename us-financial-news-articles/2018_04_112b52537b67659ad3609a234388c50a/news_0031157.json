REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay \nThe three-tonne Karl Marx statue was erected ahead of the 200th birthday of the influential thinker and philosopher on May 5, when it will be unveiled. \n“Karl Marx is Trier’s most famous son,” city official Andreas Ludwig told Reuters on Friday. \nIt depicts a thoughtful but towering Marx, who stands tall at over 5 m (16.4 ft) including the sculpture’s base, holding a book in one hand. The 19th century thinker spent the first 17 years of his life in Trier near the Luxembourg border.

The statue was erected in the end by Simeonstiftsplatz, in the heart of the southern German city. \nMarx’s status in Germany is controversial, with some in the country blaming the philosopher’s ideas for the rise of Communist dictators, the Berlin Wall and subsequent Cold War division. \nDieter Dombrowski, Federal Chairman for the Union of Victims of Communist Tyranny (UOKG), said in a statement: “For the victims of crimes that can be traced back to Karl Marx’s ideas this event is disrespectful and inhumane.” Reporting by Reuters TV; Writing by Charley-Kai John", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T19:10:43.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
