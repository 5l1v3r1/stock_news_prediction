REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \n“Fearless Girl,” whose message is for a bigger role for women in corporate America and whose appearance in lower Manhattan on the eve of International Women’s Day last year sparked a social media sensation, will be moved by the end of 2018, officials said. \n“She is a powerful symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America — and she will become a durable part of our city’s civic life,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement. \nAlthough the diminutive 50-inch (127-cm) statue was originally intended to be planted in front of the “Charging Bull” for only a week in March 2017, the city extended its stay by another 11 months after an outpouring of support.

It also opted not to use its equity clout last year in seven of eight shareholder resolutions to enhance boardroom diversity. \n“Fearless Girl” is not without detractors, including Arturo Di Modica, who objected to the placement in front of his “Charging Bull.” \nAlthough city officials said they are looking into moving “Charging Bull” as well, Di Modica’s lawyer, Norman Siegel, said the sculptor would need to give his permission, and has yet to be contacted about it.
