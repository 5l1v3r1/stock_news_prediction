It has a nationwide network of healthcare service providers covering 3,100 hospitals, 1,100 health check-up centers, 500 dental clinics and 7,500 pharmacy outlets.\nMore than 200 investors participated in the Ping An Healthcare share offering, a separate source with knowledge of the matter said.\nAll the sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. A Ping An Group representative declined to comment on the unit’s pricing.\nPing An Healthcare, in which Ping An Insurance will hold a 39.27 percent stake on completion of the offering, will debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange on May 4.\nThe company has secured seven cornerstone investors including Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and U.S. asset manager BlackRock, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse on Monday.\nThe company added that proceeds raised from the IPO would be used to fund acquisitions and strategic alliances as well as for research.\nCitigroup ( C.N ) and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) are the joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners of the issue.\nReporting by Fiona Lau of IFR; Additional reporting by Jennifer Hughes; Writing by Julie Zhu; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T05:40:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
