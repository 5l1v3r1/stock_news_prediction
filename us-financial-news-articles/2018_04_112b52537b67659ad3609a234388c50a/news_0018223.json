And of course Russia is one of those backers,” May said during a news conference in Denmark.\n“This is a brutal regime that is attacking its own people, and we are very clear that it must be held to account, and its backers must be held to account too.” (Reporting by Teis Jensen, writing by William James, editing by Andy Bruce)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:54:26.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
