First quarter 2018 earnings were positively impacted by continued growth and a lower corporate federal income tax rate, due to tax reform enacted at the end of 2017.\n\"We are pleased to report strong and consistent performance for the first quarter of 2018,” said Ronald L. Haan, President and CEO of the Company. “Revenue growth, primarily higher net interest income, along with a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate and continued expense management resulted in a 29 percent increase in net income compared to the first quarter of 2017. Continued growth in our balances of loans and bond financing to businesses, along with the recent increases in interest rates have positively affected our net interest income. While net interest income grew by 13%, our core operating expenses, excluding problem asset costs, increased by only 2%.”\nMr. Haan concluded: \"Our commitment to operating a well-disciplined company that delivers superior financial services to the communities of Western Michigan has again produced strong and consistent financial performance for our shareholders. We are grateful for all of our team members and for their integrity, their caring and their professionalism in all of our interactions with customers.”\nOperating Results\nNet interest income for the first quarter 2018 totaled $14.2 million, an increase of $665,000 from the fourth quarter 2017 and an increase of $1.6 million from the first quarter 2017. Net interest margin was 3.34 percent, up 9 basis points from the fourth quarter 2017, and up 8 basis points from the first quarter 2017. Net interest income for the first quarter 2017 benefitted from a payoff of a loan that had been on nonaccrual, resulting in recognition of $267,000 in interest income that had been deferred, compared to $56,000 in such income recognized in first quarter 2018.\nAverage interest earning assets for the first quarter 2018 increased $49.3 million from the fourth quarter 2017 and were up $150.8 million from the first quarter 2017. This growth was the primary contributor to the improvement in net interest income.\nNon-interest income decreased $278,000 in the first quarter 2018 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and decreased $99,000 from the first quarter 2017. These changes were primarily due to fluctuations in gains on sales of mortgage loans. Gains on sales of mortgage loans in the first quarter 2018 were down $160,000 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and down $287,000 from the first quarter 2017. While overall mortgage volume was down in the first quarter 2018, the reduction in gains in the first quarter was also significantly impacted by the Bank holding more of first quarter 2018 production in portfolio. The Bank originated $16.1 million in portfolio mortgage loans in the first quarter 2018 compared to $20.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $9.1 million in the first quarter 2017. The Bank originated $5.1 million in mortgage loans for sale in the first quarter 2018 compared to $12.0 million in the fourth quarter 2017 and $17.0 million in the first quarter 2017.\nNon-interest expense was $11.4 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $11.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $10.9 million for the first quarter 2017. The largest component of non-interest expense was salaries and benefit expenses. Salaries and benefit expenses were down $234,000 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and were up $195,000 compared to the first quarter 2017. The increase compared to the first quarter 2017 was due to annual merit and inflationary increases in salaries as well as higher costs associated with medical insurance, partially offset by lower variable based compensation from mortgage production and investment services volume. The decrease from the fourth quarter 2017 was due to additional costs related to annual incentive awards recognized in the fourth quarter 2017.\nNonperforming asset expenses increased $256,000 compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and increased $366,000 compared to the first quarter 2017. The first quarter 2017 total was unusually low due to net gains on sales of foreclosed properties of $149,000, while net losses were incurred on sale in the first quarter 2018 and fourth quarter 2017. Additionally, writedowns on other real estate totaled $280,000 in the first quarter 2018 compared to $45,000 in fourth quarter 2017 and $64,000 in first quarter 2017. Other categories of non-interest expense were relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter 2017 and the first quarter 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, “H.R.1”, formerly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act”, was signed into law. This new tax law, among other items, reduced the Company’s federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Since the enactment took place in December 2017, the Company revalued downward its net deferred tax assets in its reporting periods ended December 31, 2017 resulting in a $2.5 million increase to federal income tax expense in the fourth quarter 2017.\nFederal income tax expense was $1.2 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $4.5 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $2.0 million for the first quarter 2017. The effective tax rate was 17.6 percent for the first quarter 2018, compared to 67.1 percent for the fourth quarter 2017 and 30.6 percent for the first quarter 2017. The effective tax rate in the first quarter 2018 reflects the impact of the lower federal corporate tax rates from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate reflects the $2.5 million expense to revalue the Company’s net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nAs a result of the consistent improvements in nonperforming loans and past due loans over the past several quarters, the continued low historical loan loss ratios, and net loan recoveries experienced in the first quarter 2018, a negative provision for loan losses of $100,000 was recorded in the first quarter 2018. Net loan recoveries for the first quarter 2018 were $175,000, compared to fourth quarter 2017 net loan recoveries of $166,000 and first quarter 2017 net loan recoveries of $234,000. The Company has experienced net loan recoveries in each of the past thirteen quarters. Total loans past due on payments by 30 days or more amounted to $1.6 million at March 31, 2018, up 39 percent from $995,000 at December 31, 2017 and up 13 percent from $915,000 at March 31, 2017. Delinquency as a percentage of total loans was 0.12 percent at March 31, 2018, well below the Company’s peer level.\nThe allowance for loan losses of $16.7 million was 1.26 percent of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.26 percent of total loans at December 31, 2017, and 1.32 percent at March 31, 2017. The coverage ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans continued to be strong and significantly exceeded 1-to-1 coverage at 51.5-to-1 as of March 31, 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's nonperforming loans had declined to $324,000, representing 0.02 percent of total loans. This compares to $395,000 (0.03 percent of total loans) at December 31, 2017 and $401,000 (0.02 percent of total loans) at March 31, 2017. Other real estate owned and repossessed assets were $5.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $5.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $12.1 million at March 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets, including other real estate owned and nonperforming loans, have decreased by $6.9 million, or 55 percent, from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018.\nA break-down of non-performing loans is shown in the table below.\nDollars in 000s Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sept 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Commercial Real Estate $ 121 $ 385 $ 440 $ 436 $ 252 Commercial and Industrial 201 4 4 6 127 Total Commercial Loans 322 389 444 442 379 Residential Mortgage Loans 2 2 58 206 2 Consumer Loans --- 4 19 22 20 Total Non-Performing Loans $ 324 $ 395 $ 521 $ 670 $ 401 Total non-performing assets were $5.5 million, or 0.30 percent of total assets, at March 31, 2018.

Year end assets typically increase due to year end seasonal inflow of business and municipal deposits. Total loans were $1.33 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $5.2 million from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $59.4 million from $1.27 billion at March 31, 2017.\nCommercial loans increased by $44.8 million from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, along with an increase of $21.5 million in our residential mortgage portfolio, partially offset by a decrease of $6.9 million in our consumer loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans increased by $21.1 million while commercial and industrial loans increased by $23.8 million during the same period.\nThe composition of the commercial loan portfolio is shown in the table below:\nDollars in 000s Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Sept 30,\n2017 Jun 30,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Construction and Development $ 81,948 $ 92,241 $ 84,659 $ 82,317 $ 78,910 Other Commercial Real Estate 447,922 449,694 445,703 432,223 429,898 Commercial Loans Secured\nby Real Estate\n529,870\n541,935\n530,362\n514,540\n508,808 Commercial and Industrial 477,088 465,208 418,838 435,218 453,311 Total Commercial Loans $ 1,006,958 $ 1,007,143 $ 949,200 $ 949,758 $ 962,119 Bond financing to commercial customers increased by $25.9 million from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. This financing combined with the loan portfolio led to a total growth rate of 7% from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018.\nTotal deposits were $1.56 billion at March 31, 2018, down $18.1 million from $1.58 billion at December 31, 2017 and were up $127.7 million, or 9 percent, from $1.43 billion at March 31, 2017. The decrease in total deposits from December 31, 2017 was primarily in demand deposits (down $48.1 million) as municipal and business customers deployed their seasonal increase of year-end deposits in the first quarter 2018. Money market deposits, savings deposits and certificates of deposit were all up in the first quarter 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. The Bank continues to be successful at attracting and retaining core deposit customers. Customer deposit accounts remain insured to the highest levels available under FDIC deposit insurance.\nThe Bank's risk-based regulatory capital ratios were higher at March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017 due to earnings growth, and continue to be at levels comfortably above those required to be categorized as “well capitalized” under applicable regulatory capital guidelines. As such, the Bank was categorized as \"well capitalized\" at March 31, 2018.\nAbout Macatawa Bank\nHeadquartered in Holland, Mich., Macatawa Bank offers a full range of banking, retail and commercial lending, wealth management and ecommerce services to individuals, businesses and governmental entities from a network of 26 full-service branches located throughout communities in Kent, Ottawa and northern Allegan counties.
