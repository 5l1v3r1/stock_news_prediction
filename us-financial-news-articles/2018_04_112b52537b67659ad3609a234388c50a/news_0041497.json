I thought I was rolling the ball well and felt really good with my irons on the range this morning, so got some stuff to happen.” Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T02:56:01.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
