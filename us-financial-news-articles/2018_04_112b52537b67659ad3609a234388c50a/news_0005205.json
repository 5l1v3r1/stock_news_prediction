Turkey and its Syrian militia allies captured Afrin town last month, leading the YPG to declare a new phase of guerrilla war in the northwest. \nXelil said the shift in tactics away from direct confrontation meant fewer fighters were needed in the northwest. \n“The number has reduced a lot,” he said. “The surplus number will head to the other areas to strengthen the defence of these areas,” against Islamic State and “any other threat”. \n“After Afrin, Daesh has revived and has started to expand in the region, and has benefited a lot from the vacuum,” Xelil said. “This is a danger we are thinking about, and we are tying to fine the appropriate means to take measures against the expansion of Daesh,” he said. \nPresident Donald Trump agreed in a National Security Council meeting on Tuesday to keep U.S. troops in Syria a little longer but wants them out relatively soon, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.
