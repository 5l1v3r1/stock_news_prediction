He said the herd had been growing sharply over the last two years, would likely hold steady in 2018 and would decline in 2019.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture said in its latest report Argentina’s herd would shrink this year due to the weather and a larger than normal slaughter.\nPastures have been depleted in one of Argentina’s main cattle producing areas in Chacabuco, in the north of Buenos Aires province, according to Guillermo Voisin, the president of the area’s rural society.\n“What is coming is very challenging ... but before the cows get too thin it is better to sell them,” Voisin said.\nWriting by Caroline Stauffer; Editing by Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T20:14:08.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
