The stock had fallen 9.5 percent this year through Monday’s close. \nGlenn Welling’s Engaged Capital said it intends to discuss with the company ways to improve capital allocation, improve operations and corporate governance. \nApogee cut its full-year profit and revenue growth forecast in December, citing lower-than-expected volume and pricing.
