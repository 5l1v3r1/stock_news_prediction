Average value of each grant is $2,400 and will be offered to 10 U.S.-based non-profit organizations \"doing good\" on a national or regional level for 2018.\nLaunched in 2000, the PR Grant™ was designed to help raise awareness of selected charities to traditional media, to the public, as well as to potential \"halo\" sponsors and donors.\nStarting in 2013, the PR Grant was re-named after the company co-founder, the late Dr. J.L. Simmons, PhD, who passed away in 2003. Now the Neotrope PR Grant program is known as the \"J.L. Simmons Non-Profit PR Grant.\"\nAs part of this in-kind grant program, Neotrope is providing news dissemination through its Send2Press® Newswire service, and social media marketing for the selected applicant charities.\n\"We are very proud to have helped so many worthy causes raise awareness with this program the past 17 years,\" says Christopher Laird Simmons, Neotrope CEO. \"When my late father and I first launched the PR Grants in 2000 we felt we could help out an organization or two with our services and expertise, over writing a tiny check that wouldn't pay for a month of coffee and muffins.\"\nThere is no fee to apply. Applications are being accepted through July 1, 2018. Complete grant information can be found on the PR Grants website: https://prgrants.com/ .\nAbout Neotrope:\nSince 1983 Neotrope® has delivered services to raise organization awareness including brand identity, marketing, public relations (PR), and social media services. Based in California, Neotrope is also an entertainment publishing company involved in books, music, software, sound design, video and more.

Other PR industry firms have since copied the name, but ours is the original.\nWith this cause-related marketing grant program, Neotrope has been honored to help many worthy causes in past years, including: The C Diff Foundation, Children Awaiting Parents, Geek Club Books, Guardian Angels Medical Service Dogs Inc., Move for Hunger, Special Equestrians, Starlight Children's Foundation, World Savvy and dozens more (full list available on grants website).\nPR Grant recipients are selected by Neotrope / Send2Press staff based on qualified applications filled out and submitted by U.S. based non-profit organizations. Choices for grant recipients are both subjective, and based on overall activities and actual need, as well as best fit for support from the marketing team.\nAdditional information regarding the Neotrope 2018 J.L.
