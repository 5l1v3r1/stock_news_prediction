Giuliani previously served as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Trump's long-time lawyer Michael Cohen is currently under investigation by the Southern District. \nAccording to the New York Times, the probe of Cohen has become more worrisome for the White House than the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and alleged collusion by the Trump campaign. \nTrump considered Giuliani for an administration post when he won the 2016 election but did not end up choosing him for a job. \nGiuliani was a federal prosecutor in Manhattan in the 1980s. He was mayor of New York City during the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. \nGiuliani Partners, a security and management consulting firm founded by Giuliani, and representatives for Giuliani did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests to comment. \n-- CNBC'S Brian Schwartz contributed to this report", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T00:39:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
