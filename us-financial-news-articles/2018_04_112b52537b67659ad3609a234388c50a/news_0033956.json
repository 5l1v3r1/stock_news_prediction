The complaint was seen by Reuters.\nIn an emailed response to a request for comment, Ernst & Young, which is based in London, said, “Ernst & Young is committed to a workplace free of discrimination and harassment of any kind. New information was brought to our attention on April 13, 2018, which we are thoroughly investigating.\n“The individual who is the subject of the charge has been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of our investigation. We take all allegations of sexual harassment seriously. Once we conclude our investigation, strong disciplinary actions will be taken against anyone we determine to have violated our policies and/or our Code of Conduct.”\nMartinkat could not immediately be reached for comment, and Reuters could not determine if he had an attorney.\nCasucci said in the complaint that she reported the assault to the company’s diversity and inclusiveness officer in 2016, after she learned that another woman had been subjected to inappropriate sexual conduct, and decided she needed to take action to protect women at the company.\nCasucci said in the complaint that Ernst & Young did not take action against Martinkat, but asked her to speak to an outside employment defense lawyer it had hired, and refused to promise that the interview would not be used in litigation.\nCasucci said she was forced to “rebuild her entire book of business from scratch” to avoid working with Martinkat.\n“Ms. Casucci’s career trajectory and earning potential have been adversely impacted, while (Ernst & Young) has made sure that Mr. Martinkat’s career has not been affected at all,” the complaint said.\nReporting By Brendan Pierson in New York\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T02:44:01.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
