Yet only about half of patients respond well to existing treatments.\n“The new genetic variants discovered have the potential to revitalize depression treatment by opening up avenues for the discovery of new and improved therapies,” said Gerome Breen of King’s College London, who worked on the research team.\nThe study - published on Thursday in the journal Nature Genetics - was a global effort, with data covering more than 135,000 patients with major depression and around 344,000 controls as comparisons.\n“This study has shed a bright light on the genetic basis of depression, but it is only the first step,” said Cathryn Lewis, another King’s College London expert who worked on the team.\n“We need further research to uncover more of the genetic underpinnings, and to understand how genetics and environmental stressors work together to increase risk of depression.” Reporting by Kate Kelland, editing by Gareth Jones, Larry King", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T18:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:30:08.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
