We improved lead times, reduced past-due orders, won new business for differentiated products and realized improvements in our financial performance,\" said Tim Timken, chairman, CEO and president. \"This year is about executing a strategy to gain advantages beyond the market recovery and set us on a path to grow. We're focused on improving the mix of products we sell, driving fair market pricing and gaining advantages from our unique set of assets. Our financial results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect the impact of this work.\"\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nFirst-quarter net sales increased $71.4 million or 23.1 percent year over year, and $39.4 million or 11.5 percent sequentially.\nShip tons were approximately 300,000, an increase of 7.1 percent over the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 4.9 percent sequentially, due to strong end-market demand. Prior-year and sequential gains were from increased volume, higher prices, and improved product mix. Surcharge revenue of $90.7 million increased 55.6 percent from the prior-year quarter as a result of a 21 percent increase in the No. 1 Busheling Index and higher volumes. Compared with the fourth-quarter 2017, surcharge revenue increased 16.9 percent.\nEBIT (1) was $2.8 million, compared with an EBIT (1) loss of $1.4 million for the same period a year ago and an adjusted EBIT (1) loss of $10.3 million for fourth-quarter 2017.\nEBIT (1) improved both year over year and sequentially due to raw material spread as a result of the rising No. 1 Busheling Index, and better price/mix. Included in first-quarter EBIT (1) is $3.7 million of non-recurring legal costs and employee benefit claims. Melt utilization was 77 percent for the quarter driven by improved demand across all end markets, compared with 71 percent in first-quarter 2017 and 68 percent in fourth-quarter 2017.\nSECOND-QUARTER 2018 OUTLOOK\nShipments are expected to be between 5 percent and 10 percent higher than first-quarter 2018 from improving end markets. Net income is projected to be between $8 million and $18 million. EBITDA is projected to be between $30 million and $40 million. Raw material spread is expected to be a headwind of about $6 million.\nOther Guidance\n2018 capital spending is projected to be $40 million.\nThe company will host a conference call at 9 a.m. ET on Friday, April 27, to discuss its financial performance with investors and securities analysts.

These are important financial measures used in the management of the business, including decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of performance.
