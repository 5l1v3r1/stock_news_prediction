Archie Bradley replaced Corbin after Kemp walked with one out in the eighth inning, the only other runner off Corbin.\nCorbin had two hits, including one of three Arizona doubles, and Paul Goldschmidt, Deven Marrero and Ketel Marte had RBIs when the D-Backs (5-1) scored in each of the first three innings. They equaled the best start in franchise history, done five times.\nThe Diamondbacks have won a franchise-record nine straight regular-season games against the Dodgers (2-5) while sweeping the last three regular-season series, although the Dodgers swept them in the 2017 NLDS.\nDodgers left-hander Alex Wood (0-1) gave up six hits and three runs in six innings. He struck out five and did not walk a batter.\nCorbin, who had one of three Arizona doubles, is 2-0 for the first time since 2013, when he won his first nine decisions while making the NL All-Star team. He missed the 2014 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery that spring.\nCorbin threw first-pitch strikes to 16 of the first 18 batters he faced while beating the Dodgers for the first time since Sept. 11, 2013,\nBrad Boxberger pitched around two walks in the ninth inning for his second save.\nJarrod Dyson doubled past first base to open the first inning, took third on a groundout and scored on Goldschmidt’s groundout to third base.\nChris Owings doubled to lead off the second inning, stole third with one out and scored on Marrero’s sacrifice fly to right field to make it 2-0.\nCorbin doubled to start the third inning, took third on Dyson’s sacrifice bunt and scored on Marte’s one-out single for a 3-0 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:11:33.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
