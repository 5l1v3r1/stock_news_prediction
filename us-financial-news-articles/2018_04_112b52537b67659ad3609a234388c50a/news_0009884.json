EDF at all times optimizes its power generation fleet ... and operates under the close supervision of market regulator CRE,” the utility said in a statement.\nA CRE spokeswoman said the regulator monitors wholesale markets to prevent insider trading and market manipulation.\nShe said that currently six investigations are under way, but declined to comment on the UFC study.\nUFC energy specialist Nicolas Mouchnino said that market data show that a fall in nuclear power output in Germany and Britain typically leads to an increase in wholesale market prices, but that in France nuclear power output typically falls as wholesale prices drop.\n“EDF adjusts the capacity utilization of its nuclear fleet in order to boost its profitability, to the detriment of consumers,” he said.\nThe UFC report also said that since 2015, cross-border power exchanges with Germany have been “dysfunctional”.\nIt said this was because when wholesale prices are lower in Germany, relatively little power is imported into France, while when power prices are slightly cheaper in France, exports toward Germany are massive.\n“There is a need for an investigation into this activity,” Mouchnino said.\nFrance’s interconnectors are operated by EDF grid unit RTE.\nAdditional reporting by Benjamin Mallet; Writing by Geert De Clercq; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T21:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:00:37.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
