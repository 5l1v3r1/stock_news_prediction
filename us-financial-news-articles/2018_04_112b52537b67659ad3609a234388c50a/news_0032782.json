(“Alamo”), recently participated as a “chairperson” of the “Patient Impact” tract panel discussions at the eyeforpharma 2018 meeting held in Philadelphia April 10-11. The annual gathering of more than 800 senior-level pharmaceutical executives encouraged inspiring and forward-thinking leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to share ideas, lessons learned, and case studies on how they have transformed insights from patients and customers into healthcare innovations.\nAs part of his role, Marchesini provided an opening address to the attendees that set up lively discussions on how to “strengthen relationships through partnerships and collaborations” and ways industry leaders can “demonstrate the impact of the clinical educator on adherence.” In these discussions, Marchesini and fellow presenters shared the importance of using real patient insight to influence decision making and promoting a patient-centric culture within their organizations.\n“Being a part of the Patient Impact section of the eyeforpharma 2018 meeting was both an honor and a valuable learning experience,” says Marchesini. “The speakers representing the very best of pharma, biotech, patients, patient advocates, and industry partners provided a great perspective and thought provoking discussions. I am proud to represent a company that thinks about the world from a patient perspective and brings this thinking to every client we have the privilege to support.”\nDuring his time with Alamo, Marchesini has utilized his more than 25 years of pharmaceutical leadership experience to guide the organization from inception more than seven years ago through today.
