( https://bloom.bg/2q89KMt )\nCompanies including U.S. auto parts retailer Pep Boys, internet company Mozilla and German bank Commerzbank AG have suspended advertisement on the platform.\nSandberg also said a tool that allowed a researcher to gain access to personal information of up to 87 million users, complied with a privacy agreement the company signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2011.\nHer comments followed reports that the FTC was investigating the company over a possible violation of that agreement, which demands it to get user consent before sharing their information.\n\"While it's clear that investor sentiment has been materially impacted by (the) Cambridge Analytica revelations, we believe FB is acting proactively and aggressively to tighten its privacy controls and increase the level of transparency into its practices,\" Wells Fargo analyst Ken Sena said.\nZuckerberg said on Wednesday he accepted blame for the data leak and should have done more to audit and oversee third-party app developers like the one that Cambridge Analytica hired in 2014.\nAsked in the interview whether Zuckerberg was still the right person to head Facebook, Sandberg endorsed him: \"I believe deeply in Mark. Mark had a vision for what social services and social sharing could be, and that vision remains really important.\"\nZuckerberg will testify about the scandal next week in front of committees in the U.S. House and Senate.\nFacebook shares closed up 2.7 percent at $159.35.\n(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee, Sonam Rai and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; editing by Bernard Orr and James Dalgleish)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T03:30:38.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
