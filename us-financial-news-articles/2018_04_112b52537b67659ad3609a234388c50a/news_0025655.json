These may include cover versions of songs, samples, remixes or medleys.\nLoudr will relocate to Spotify’s offices in New York, the company said in a blog post.\nSpotify, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month, has made at least ten small, usually technology focused acquisitions in recent years to improve its service.
