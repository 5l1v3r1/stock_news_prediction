Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi speaks following a talk with Italian President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace in Rome, Italy, April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi \n“We see only one solution to resolve this stalemate, this solution concerns Silvio Berlusconi. He should step to one side and allow the creation of a government of change,” said Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star that won the most votes at the March 4 ballot. \nA second round of consultations with parties held by President Sergio Mattarella ended on Thursday with no appreciable shift in position by any of the groups, leaving the political stalemate intact. \nThe 5-Star says it could govern with Berlusconi’s senior coalition partner, the far-right League, but the League has so far ruled out abandoning Berlusconi to hook up with 5-Star.
