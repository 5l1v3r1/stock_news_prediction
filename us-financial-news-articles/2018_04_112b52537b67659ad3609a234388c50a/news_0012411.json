An index measuring output prices remained high at 57.3 in March, down from 58.4 a month before.\nInflation was 1.4 percent last month, official flash estimates due on Wednesday are expected to show according to a preliminary Reuters poll, still well below the ECB’s 2 percent target ceiling.\nEuro zone economic growth has already peaked, another Reuters poll found last month, but the ECB will probably decide this summer to slash its bond purchases if things develop as expected, policymaker Ewald Nowotny said last week.\n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from IHS Markit and customers need to apply for a licence.
