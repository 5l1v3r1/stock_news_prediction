Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from conclusions, forecasts or projections expressed in such statements, including, among others, risks relating to a failure to achieve the anticipated benefits expected from the acquisition, and the failure to successfully integrate the acquisition, as well as those risks discussed in our various public filings at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov , including in our interim Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with, and subsequent reports on Form 6-K furnished to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and as applicable, the Canadian Securities Administrators.
