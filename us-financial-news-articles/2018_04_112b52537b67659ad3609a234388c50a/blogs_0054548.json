Here are his reasons why.\n• Though earnings are coming in quite nicely for growth stocks this quarter, valuations are stretched.\n• Outsized gains in technology shares, specifically, reduce the relative attractiveness of growth over value at this juncture.\n• Three sectors that appear particularly attractive here are financials, health care and energy. Energy was once a major laggard but has made a comeback in the last months.\n• Health-care names investors may want to consider include Merck and Pfizer , two value companies with improving margins, improving revenue growth with a rising dividend.\nDisclosure: Morganlander's firm owns shares of Merck and Pfizer; he does not personally own these names.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:37:08.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
