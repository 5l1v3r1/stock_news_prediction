As Fortune’s Aaron Pressman explained, Qualcomm is under pressure to revive its shrinking, but crucial, core mobile business .\nOne of Qualcomm’s plans to revitalize its overall business includes its $ 47 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors , which makes computer chips for Internet-connected devices and autonomous vehicles. But that deal has faced a couple of roadblocks.\nQualcomm said on Thursday that it is withdrawing and refilling the acquisition notice related to NXP Semiconductors “at the request of the Ministry of Commerce in China.” By doing so, Qualcomm is pushing its acquisition deadline to July 25 from April 25, so that China could potentially approve the deal.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nThe semiconductor giant is essentially caught in the middle of the current trade war between China and the United States, and Chinese regulators told Bloomberg News on Thursday that it is seeking unspecified additional concessions from Qualcomm before it clears the deal.\nMeanwhile, Qualcomm is still recovering from a proposed hostile takeover by chipmaker Broadcom that President Donald Trump squashed in March via an executive order that cited unspecified national security concerns. If Broadcom were to have bought Qualcomm for about $117 billion, the deal would have created an enormous mobile computer chip giant worth more than $200 billion.", "external_links": ["https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-19/china-says-qualcomm-needs-more-remedies-for-nxp-deal-approval", "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-18/qualcomm-cutting-jobs-to-live-up-to-promise-of-slashing-costs"], "published": "2018-04-20T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T05:29:45.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
