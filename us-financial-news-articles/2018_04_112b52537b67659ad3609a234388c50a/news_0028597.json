Paris, one of the most visited cities in the world, is its biggest single market, with around 65,000 homes listed.\n$1 = 0.8088 euros Reporting by Myriam Rivet; Writing by Matthias Blamont; Editing by Dominique Vidalon/Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T17:30:06.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
