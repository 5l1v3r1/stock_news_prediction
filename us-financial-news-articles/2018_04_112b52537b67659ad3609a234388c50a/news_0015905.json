As executive vice chairman, Greg’s extensive industry knowledge, strategic insight, and strong relationships will continue to play a critical role in supporting the long-term success of the business,” said Eastman. “I have full confidence that TAP’s market leadership will continue to grow and flourish with Craig at the helm.

Today, TAP is an industry leader with a growing portfolio.

The foundation is built for continued success under his highly experienced leadership,” said Adler. “I imagine TAP’s next chapter will see even more success than its last. On a personal level, my new role as executive vice chairman will allow me to focus on an area of work that I’m extremely passionate about: discovering fresh opportunities, new brands, and untapped segments for TAP.”\nTAP is a leader in the growing $10-plus billion Jeep and truck accessory market.
