He had six hits that day.\nStrickland (1-0), who recorded his first blown save of the season, got the win.\nThe latest heroics came well after Beede and Diamondbacks starter Patrick Corbin left with no-decisions.\nBeede, the Giants’ first-round pick in 2014, got off to a shaky start, allowing a two-run double to A.J. Pollock four batters into the game after he walked Ketel Marte and gave up a single to Goldschmidt.\nThe 24-year-old right-hander settled down after that, keeping the Giants within 2-0 through four innings by allowing just three hits. He walked five and struck out three.\nThe Giants finally got to Corbin after five shutout innings. Gorkys Hernandez led off the sixth with a pinch-hit single. Singles by Austin Jackson and Brandon Belt loaded the bases before Corbin walked McCutchen to force in a run.\nBuster Posey’s sacrifice fly later in the inning tied the game at 2-2, and Hunter Pence’s run-scoring flyout put San Francisco in front 3-2.\nCorbin was charged with three runs on five hits in 5 1/3 innings. He walked two and struck out nine.\nArizona drew even at 3-3 in the seventh on back-to-back doubles by Jarrod Dyson and Marte.\nThe Giants took a 4-3 lead as the result of a double steal in the eighth, with McCutchen taking third base and then continuing home on a throwing error by Diamondbacks catcher Alex Avila.\nJackson and Posey had two hits apiece for the Giants, who evened the series after taking a 2-1 loss Monday night.\nDyson and Goldschmidt collected two hits apiece for the Diamondbacks, who had won their previous two games.\nThe Giants out-hit the Diamondbacks 8-6.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T13:47:47.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
