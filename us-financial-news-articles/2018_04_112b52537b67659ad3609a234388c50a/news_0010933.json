But I thought for me the probability of the type of football that I can play at City will suit me the best,” De Bruyne told BBC’s Premier League show. \nThe move has paid off with De Bruyne, who leads the league’s assist charts this campaign, on the verge of winning his third trophy at City in as many seasons.
