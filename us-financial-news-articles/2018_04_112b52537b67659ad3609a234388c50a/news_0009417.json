REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo \n“This is the most disgusting thing that has ever happened in the history of the company,” UFC president Dana White told website MMA Junkie (www.mmajunkie.com). \nRussian lightweight contender Khabib Nurmagomedov is due to face Max Holloway in a showdown for McGregor’s belt, which he won in 2016 but never defended, and White has said the winner of Saturday’s bout during UFC 223 at the Barclays Center will be crowned undisputed champion. \nEarlier in the week, Nurmagomedov confronted Artem Lobov, the 29-year-old McGregor’s Russian friend, team mate and sparring partner, in a hotel in New York, an incident which may have provoked the Irish fighter. \nWhite subsequently told reporters at the venue that Lobov would not be allowed to fight Alex Caceres as scheduled on Saturday.
