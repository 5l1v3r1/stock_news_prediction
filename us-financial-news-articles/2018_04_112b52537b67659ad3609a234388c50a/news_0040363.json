Robert Herjavec is always willing to shell out cash for valet parking. Mark Cuban splurged on a private plane. \nBut for “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary, the luxury item on which he’s willing to spend a pretty penny is certainly unique. \n“My underwear cost $120 each,” O’Leary tells CNBC Make It. \nO’Leary says he buys his boxers from Zimmerli of Switzerland, a company that has been hand crafting underwear since 1871. \n“They’re made from Egyptian cotton,” O’Leary says. “I love them.” \nO’Leary also admits to getting $80 haircuts. \n“I don’t have that many, so I want them to have a personal relationship with every hair,” he says. \nIt’s all about looking and feeling his best. \n“I invest in looking great all the time, and the way I do it is [paying for] great clothing, great shoes and a haircut every 10 days,” he explains. \nHowever, there are some things he refuses to spend money on. \n“Do I pay $2.50 for a coffee? Never, never, never do I do that,” O’Leary tells CNBC Make It. “That is such a waste of money for something that costs 20 cents. I never buy a frape-latte-blah-blah-blah-woof-woof-woof for $2.50.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:27:02.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
