In doing so, the EU Commission expects that they could generate a total of 6.5 billion euros of additional investment attracting private and public investors. \nThe plan mimics the strategy used for a wider investment plan for Europe that has spurred in about three years funding of 274 billion euros from an initial guarantee of 33.5 billion euros of EU public money, according to EU data. \nThe venture capital plan is also aimed at increasing the size of European venture funds that on average raise 56 million euros, one third of their U.S. counterparts, EU Commission data showed. \nThe small size of European venture funds has often prevented large investors, like insurers and pension funds, from investing in them. \nAs a result, emerging companies have fewer financial resources in Europe to tap into and fewer chances to expand. “In venture capital, size matters”, the EU Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen said. \nBy making funds bigger, the EU hopes to increase the number of start-ups reaching the “unicorn” status of more than $1 billion market valuation, which at the end of 2017 were only 26 in the EU compared to 109 in the U.S. and 59 in China, EU figures show. \nFunding will concentrate in companies operating in sectors like information and communication technologies, energy efficiency, life sciences, and medical technologies. \nTo reduce the fragmentation of funding and establish a genuine border-free market for venture capital, the EU foresees that only projects that cover at least four EU countries are eligible for investment under the new venture capital scheme. \n($1 = 0.8118 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:31:51.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
