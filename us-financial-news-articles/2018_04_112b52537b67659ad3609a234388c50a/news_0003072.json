Arcadia, which produced revenues for 2017 of $47.4 million, provides its home care services to approximately 2,300 consumers through 26 offices in 10 states. Addus closed the transaction on April 1, 2018, for a purchase price of $18.5 million, with funding from the delayed draw term loan portion of its credit facility.\nDirk Allison, President and Chief Executive Officer of Addus, commented, \"We are pleased to announce this transaction, which strengthens our presence in eight states in which we currently operate, including a number of our most attractive markets. In addition to these states, which include Arizona, California, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, the transaction will take us into two new states: Florida and Wisconsin. With a trailing EBITDA purchase multiple of 5.5x to 6.5x, we expect this transaction will be accretive to our 2018 financial results.\"\n\"This purchase continues our strategy of acquiring providers that strengthen our presence in our current markets. Along with our pending Ambercare transaction, which we expect to close in our second quarter, this transaction reflects our growing acquisition pipeline, which we expect will continue to help us expand our market share and diversify our client base in targeted markets. With a strong financial position and substantial cash flow from operations, we believe we are well-positioned both to fund our organic growth and produce additional accretive acquisitions during 2018.\"\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
