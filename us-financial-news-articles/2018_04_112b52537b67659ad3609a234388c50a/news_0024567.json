They're going to keep on getting better at this. And we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this too,\" Zuckerberg said. \n\"I have more confidence that we're going to get this right,\" he added. \nIn his prepared congressional testimony, Zuckerberg said content from one Russian agency that tries to spread misinformation reached about 126 million people on Facebook during a two-year period around the 2016 election. An additional 20 million people may have seen content from the Internet Research Agency on Instagram, a platform Facebook owns, he said. \nZuckerberg said Facebook did not identify election meddling until right around the time of the November 2016 vote. But he expressed confidence in Facebook's ability to identify problems earlier. \n\nThe revelation that the personal data of up to 87 million people may have been misused by consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has sparked backlash and dominated much of the hearing. Asked if that pool of people overlapped with the 126 million people who saw content from the Russian agency, he said Facebook is \"investigating that\" and thinks it \"is entirely possible that there will be a connection.\" \nZuckerberg highlighted efforts to identify misinformation and remove \"tens of thousands\" of fake accounts sharing content related to elections in France and Germany, as well as a special Senate election in the United States. By later this year, Facebook will have 20,000 people reviewing content, he said. \nFacebook also plans to verify advertisers running political and issue ads as soon as later this year, Zuckerberg said. It plans to voluntarily comply with part of the Honest Ads Act, legislation introduced in the Senate that aims to increase transparency in political advertising online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T23:27:26.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
