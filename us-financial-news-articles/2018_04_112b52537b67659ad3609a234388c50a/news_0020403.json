He said he had been particularly concerned about the takeover of German robotics maker Kuka ( KU2G.DE ) by a Chinese firm in 2016 given the sensitive technology involved. \nGerman concerns were stoked by news last month that Chinese grid operator State Grid Corporation of China STGRD.UL tried to buy a 20 percent stake in German grid operator 50Hertz, and moves by China’s Geely GEELY.UL to quietly build up a 10 percent stake in carmaker Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ). \nThe German economy ministry is also reviewing a Chinese bid for aerospace supplier Cotesa, a move which could lead to Berlin blocking the sale. \nMaassen said foreign investment could help secure jobs and profits in Germany. “But one also has to see that certain direct investments in certain technologies can also create a domestic security risk,” he said. \nAllowing European firms in the sectors of critical infrastructure, resources, sensitive technologies and classified information to fall under foreign control “comes at the cost of technological advances and security, and public order in the European Union,” he said. \nKarl Wendling, a senior official with the German Economy Ministry, said Chinese acquisitions of German firms had stabilised at a high level, around $14 billion, a huge increase from the $530 million value of deals seen in 2015. \nChinese investment in other European countries, including the Balkans, has also risen in the same period. \nNo comment was immediately available from the Chinese embassy in Berlin. \nThe European Union, under pressure from Germany, France, and Italy, is working to complete a new screening mechanism to better control Chinese and other foreign takeovers of sensitive technologies by the end of the year, he said. “We support foreign investment, but we’re not naive,” Wendling said. \nMaassen said the issue was particularly worrying in China’s case, since private Chinese firms were required to share data with the Chinese government, and had to set up party committees that gave the Chinese government control over company decisions.
