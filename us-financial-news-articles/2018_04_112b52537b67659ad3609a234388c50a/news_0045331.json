Comprising 59 of the French artist’s nearly 160 extant oil portraits, many of them masterpieces, the show is the largest-ever gathering of his portraits, and the first to focus exclusively on them.\nCézanne Portraits\nNational Gallery of Art\nThrough July 1\nOrganized by John Elderfield, chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, with Mary Morton, head of the Gallery's department of French paintings, and Xavier Rey, director of the museums of Marseille, the canvases in this beautiful show span Cézanne’s career and are installed chronologically and thematically on blue- or rose-colored walls in a suite of seven skylighted galleries. As the natural light changes, Cézanne’s shimmering forms and crystalline colors—especially his infinite range of blues—pulse and breathe and shift in hue. The painted subjects—family and friends, adults and children, laborers, peasants, his dealer and Cézanne himself—come alive and beckon you to come closer.\nThe exhibition opens with early rugged, tonal works from the 1860s, inspired by Spanish and Dutch old masters and the modernists Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet. Some of these—cake-icing-thick—are painted with a palette knife and heavily impastoed, proof that Cézanne was among the original expressionists.\nCézanne’s ‘Woman With a Cafetière’ (1890-95) Photo: RMN-Grand Palais (Musée d’Orsay) Here is Cézanne’s first portrait—of himself—an intense study in browns and yellow-greens, punctuated by hot reds, as if Cézanne were smoldering beneath the somber surface. By 1875, wallpaper patterns in one self-portrait take on abstract lives of their own; in another that year, his palette brightens and twinkles, as Impressionistic brushstrokes free themselves from descriptive contours and sculptural mass.\nThese first portraits alert us to the fact that Cézanne was always an extremely inventive, intuitive and emotionally driven, as well as metaphoric, painter. In “The Artist’s Father, Reading L’Événement” (1866), the son appears to solve his Oedipus complex. Paul places the older Cézanne—a wealthy banker who wanted Paul to follow in his footsteps—in an imposing armchair, in front of one of the artist’s still lifes and a view into his studio. The chair envelops the father and rotates, as if backing away and attempting to dump him—suggesting throne, cloud, monument and headstone.\nCézanne’s ‘Madame Cézanne in a Red Armchair’ (1877) Photo: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Among the many highlights is a grouping of four unique, monumental depictions of “Madame Cézanne in a Red Dress” (all 1888-90). In the largest and greatest of these, the interior lists; the artist’s wife, though seated in a golden chair, floats like a balloon, buoying the space. She rises and glides forward like a goddess. The portrait is almost surreal. A flower held in her lap flutters cinematically, like a Futurist bird, as a set of Cubist andirons shatters the interior.\nIn the next gallery is “Boy in a Red Waistcoat” (1888-90). It’s a swaggering fusion of adolescent sexuality and pathos not seen again until Balthus ; a portrait in which his hip is cocked like a gunslinger’s, but his small, youthful face betrays the fragility of a porcelain doll. Further on is the breathtaking “Woman With a Coffee Maker (Cafetière)” (c. 1895), a stunning, life-size, three-quarter portrait of a woman in a blue dress. Like “Madame Cézanne,” though seated, she appears to rise up and to hover magically above her chair—as if she and her large working hands are uneasy when at rest. A synthesis of Madonna and peasant, she is pensive and stern yet humble and sturdy. Though guarded, there is something erotic and tender about her; her pleated bodice expands, opening her chest like an accordion, as wallpaper flowers become volumetric, lift off and dance.\nCézanne’s ‘The Artist’s Father, Reading L’Événement’ (1866) Photo: National Gallery of Art, Washington Cézanne is often presented as rather cerebral and dry, unfeeling. “Cézanne Portraits” magnificently challenges these textbook notions about the painter, whom both Matisse and Picasso referred to as the father of modern art. The individual portraits are commanding, but the show has unexpected, exponential power.\nCézanne’s ‘Boy in a Red Waistcoat’ (1888-90) Photo: National Gallery of Art, Washington It reveals that Cézanne developed tremendously as a painter. He moved from predominantly dark and heavy realism through lighter, brighter and freer paint-handling, arriving, in the late work, at nearly abstract patchworks of vibrant color—thus charting a course from tonal expressionism, into Impressionism and then Post-Impressionism. He simplified his forms into almost pure geometry; and he fractured and flattened his spaces—inspiring Cubism and abstraction. But “Cézanne Portraits” also reveals that he always had numerous impulses, which he indulged at different times for different metaphoric purposes.\nCézanne’s ‘The Gardener Vallier’ (1906) Photo: National Gallery of Art, Washington In the last gallery is a suite of very late portraits of “The Gardener Vallier.” In some, dissolving figure and ground, presaging the abstractions of Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Cézanne weaves him and his surroundings into a nearly flat and abstract decorative membrane of tessellating colored light, like leaves rustled by wind. In others, channeling Rembrandt and Courbet, it’s as if Cézanne returns to his own expressionistic roots; fusing portrait and landscape, Cézanne transforms his gardener into a dense, luminous mountain of foliage, rock and earth.\n—Mr. Esplund writes about art for the Journal.
