A source said that Apple filed a complaint, which was one factor behind the 2016 probe.\nThe antitrust division is looking into whether or not carriers colluded in stifling technology that allows customers to switch providers without having to change out their SIM card.\nEarlier, The New York Times reported that AT&T and Verizon were being investigated. The newspaper also reported that the Justice Department has demanded information from GSMA, a mobile communications industry group.\nSources told the Times that the investigation was opened five months ago following complaints from one device maker and one wireless carrier.\nGSMA, AT&T, Sprint and the Justice Department's antitrust division declined to comment to CNBC.
