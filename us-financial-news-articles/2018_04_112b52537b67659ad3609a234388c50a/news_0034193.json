(NYSE:WBT), a leading global provider of commercial foodservice equipment, today announced that it has completed the previously-announced acquisition of Avaj International Holding AB (“Crem® International” or “Crem”) for total consideration of approximately SEK 1,800 million, or approximately $224 million USD equivalent.\nCrem International is a global leading manufacturer of professional coffee machines with more than 50 years of experience in the market and sales in more than 80 countries. Crem is headquartered in Solna, Sweden, and has three manufacturing sites in Åmotfors, Sweden, Gandia, Spain, and Shanghai, China. These plants are supported by three R&D centers and six sales offices. Crem develops, manufactures and markets coffee machines under three brands: Coffee Queen®, Expobar® and Spengler for use in offices, restaurants, cafes and coffee shops, catering and convenience stores. Crem offers the broadest range of professional coffee machines, including manual and automatic espresso and filter coffee machines as well as instant, liquid, freestanding and other machines.\nIn 2017, Crem International generated sales of approximately SEK 767 million, or approximately $90 million USD equivalent.
