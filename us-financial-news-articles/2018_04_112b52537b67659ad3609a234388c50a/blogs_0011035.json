The logs could shed light on conditions in the area where the troops operated.\nOpposition party lawmakers had asked about the records last year while grilling Inada over another set of logs about security conditions in South Sudan, where Japanese troops had joined a peace-keeping mission. An investigation found that handling of those logs broke some laws and Inada, under fire for other missteps as well, resigned last July .\n\"Cover-ups are the basic nature of the Abe cabinet. The entire cabinet should resign,\" Kyodo news agency quoted opposition Democratic Party upper house lawmaker Hiroyuki Konishi as telling the panel at which Onodera appeared.\nThe fresh revelation coincided with the army's launch on Wednesday of a central command station to oversee Japan's five regional armies, operated separately after World War Two to avoid too much control by the military.\nThere was no need to worry about civilian control of the military, Onodera told reporters on Wednesday before the Iraq logs disclosure. \"Civilian control is thoroughly implemented, unlike under the pre-war constitution,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T08:06:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
