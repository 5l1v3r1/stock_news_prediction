We felt that our capabilities, plus the fact that there’s a consortium of three other media companies, helps us do that collectively and more effectively than any of the independent companies.’ Krishan Bhatia, executive vice president of business operations and strategy at NBCUniversal \nNBCU is joining rivals Viacom Inc. VIA, -0.56% , Turner TWX, -0.50% and Fox FOX, -0.27% in their effort to advance TV ad targeting, the company said. \nViacom, Turner and Fox joined forces over a year ago to start building OpenAP, a system intended to standardize the precise categories ad buyers can purchase in TV. That way, an advertiser who wants to reach people in the market for a minivan doesn’t have to deal with different data approaches at different networks when trying to identify which shows best reach their audience. \nThe OpenAP consortium is asking media companies to pay $2.5 million for an “equity” membership, which includes a board seat, in addition to $1.5 million a year with a five-year commitment, according to people familiar with the matter. Altogether, that’s a $10 million buy-in. A membership that does not include a board seat still costs up to $1.5 million a year.
