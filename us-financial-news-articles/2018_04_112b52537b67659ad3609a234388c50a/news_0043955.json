Our request for cumulative voting brought the warring factions back to the negotiating table and we are very pleased with the results.” \nThe board’s endorsement of a closed list of candidates came after shareholders with a combined 32.8 percent stake in BRF agreed to jointly vote for 10 new board members. \nThe list endorsed by the board includes the nomination of Pedro Parente and Augusto Marques da Cruz Filho as chairman and vice chairman, respectively, the filing said. \nIn a statement accepting the nomination as a candidate to chair the board, Parente, who is chief executive of Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said he would resign as chairman of financial exchange operator B3 SA Bolsa Brasil Balcao if elected. \nThe other nominees in the list unveiled by BRF are Dan Ioschpe, Flávia Buarque de Almeida, Francisco Petros Oliveira Lima Papathanasiadis, José Luiz Osório, Luiz Fernando Furlan, Roberto Antonio Mendes, Roberto Rodrigues, and Walter Malieni Jr., the filing said.
