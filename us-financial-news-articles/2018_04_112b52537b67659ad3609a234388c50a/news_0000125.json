The ISM number brought back that prices are higher,” di Galoma added. \nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to a reading of 59.3 last month from 60.8 in February. \nMachinery manufacturers said U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports announced last month were “causing panic buying, driving the near-term prices higher and leading to inventory shortages for non-contract customers.” \nManufacturers of miscellaneous products reported that new tariffs were causing concern across the supply chain. \nBenchmark 10-year note prices gained 5/32 in price to yield 2.726 percent, down from 2.744 percent on Friday and the lowest since Feb. 6. \nThe next major economic catalyst will be Friday’s closely watched jobs report for March. \nThe U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February, at 313,000 jobs, though economists anticipate March’s gains may be more modest. \n“We’ve looked at the 14 occasions where payrolls were up over 250,000 in a given month and when you look at the following month, there’s almost an immediate return to trend,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak about the economic outlook at an event in Chicago on Friday.
