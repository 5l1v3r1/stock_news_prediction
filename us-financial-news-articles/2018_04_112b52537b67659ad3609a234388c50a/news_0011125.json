So the ability of the equity markets to push significantly lower is going to be limited,” said John Brady, senior vice president at R.J. O’Brien & Associates in Chicago.\n“We’re going to need brand new, bad news on trade for the equity markets to push lower.”\nChina’s state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday that the country will win any trade war with the United States.\nWall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index eased to a two-week low at 19.21 points.\nAt 13:09 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.15 percent at 24,542.21. The S&P 500 rose 0.85 percent to 2,667.22 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.7 percent at 7,091.65.\nThe S&P and the Dow were on track to post their first three-day gains in about a month.\nTen of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 2,2 percent rise in the S&P energy index as oil prices rose.\nFacebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Netflix - collectively known as the “FANG” group - were up between 1 percent and 3 percent.\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen “any meaningful impact” on usage or ad sales since the data privacy scandal.\nAmazon rose 3.2 percent after being repeatedly hammered this week by Trump’s attacks on the online retailer.\nAdvanced Micro Devices jumped 3.8 percent after Stifel upgraded to “buy”, while Micron Technology fell 6.44 percent after UBS started coverage with a “sell” rating.\nThe S&P 500 showed five new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 51 new highs and 25 new lows.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.85-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq, for a 1.80-to-1 ratio.
