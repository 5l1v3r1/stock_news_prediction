FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THIS RESTRICTION MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF UNITED STATES SECURITIES LAW.\nCALGARY, Alberta, April 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crown Point Energy Inc. (TSX-V:CWV) (\" Crown Point \" or the \" Company \") is pleased to announce that it has filed today an amended and restated preliminary short for prospectus in each of the provinces of Canada, other than Québec, with respect to an offering (the \" Rights Offering \") of rights (\" Rights \") to acquire common shares of the Company (\" Common Shares \") for minimum gross proceeds of US$8 million (the \" Minimum Offering \") and maximum gross proceeds of US$12 million.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Rights Offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Company's previously announced acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Apco Austral S.A. (the \" Acquisition \"), provided however that if the Acquisition is not completed by May 30, 2018 (or such other date as may be agreed to by the vendor and the Company) as a result of certain previously announced legal proceedings in Argentina in respect of the Acquisition (or otherwise), the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to accelerate and fund the Company's 2018 exploration and development program.\nOn or before closing of the Acquisition (if applicable), the Company intends to enter into a new credit facility (the \" New Credit Facility \") with one or more lenders for a loan of up to US$14 million to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition. Banco de Servicios y Transacciones S.A. (\" BST \"), an Argentine financial institution and a related party of the Company, has delivered to the Company an amended commitment letter confirming that, subject to the Acquisition being completed on or before May 30, 2018 and certain other conditions being satisfied, up to US$14 million will be available to the Company under the New Credit Facility for the purposes of funding a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition and that BST and/or one or more lenders sourced by BST will provide such amounts to the Company.\nPursuant to the Rights Offering, each registered holder of Common Shares as at the close of business on the record date fixed in connection with the Rights Offering will receive one (1) Right for each Common Share held. Each Right will entitle an eligible holder thereof to acquire 1.21569322 Common Shares at a price of US$0.36470797 per Right (representing a subscription price of US$0.30 per Common Share). The Rights Offering will include an additional subscription privilege under which holders of Rights who fully exercise their Rights will be entitled to subscribe for additional Common Shares, if available, that were not otherwise subscribed for under the Rights Offering. The record date and the expiry date for the Rights Offering will be determined at the time of filing by the Company of a (final) short form prospectus in connection with the Rights Offering.\nIn connection with the filing of the amended and restated preliminary prospectus, the Company and Liminar Energía SA (\" Liminar \"), a company partially controlled by Pablo Peralta, one of the Company's directors, have entered into an amended and restated standby purchase agreement (the \" Standby Purchase Agreement \") pursuant to which, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, Liminar has agreed to fully exercise its basic subscription privilege and partially exercise its additional subscription privilege to the extent necessary to subscribe for not less than 26,666,667 Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds of not less than US$8 million in connection with the Rights Offering. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of the Standby Purchase Agreement, the Minimum Offering will be fully backstopped by Liminar.\nThe Rights Offering is subject to certain conditions including, but not limited to, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, including the final acceptance of the TSX Venture Exchange, and the completion of the Minimum Offering. Further details concerning the Rights Offering, including the details of the Standby Purchase Agreement, the proposed terms of the New Credit Facility and matters related to the Acquisition, are contained in the Company's amended and restated preliminary short form prospectus available on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.\nThis press release is not an offer of securities of the Company for sale in the United States. The Rights and Common Shares issuable on exercise of the Rights have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Rights and Common Shares may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an applicable exemption from such registration.
