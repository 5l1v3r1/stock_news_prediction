Col. Daniel Davis, a senior defense fellow for Defense Priorities, told CNBC.\n\"There is little chance Kim Jong Un will give up his nuclear weapons, which means the best option for the U.S. is to manage and deter North Korea, as we have successfully done for decades.\"\nDavis, who served as an advisor to the Second Republic of Korea Army during his military career, noted that despite Kim's purported nuclear weapons arsenal, the status quo on the Korean peninsula favors the United States and not North Korea.\n\"The U.S. is in a dominant negotiating position because no matter what happens in these discussions, the overwhelming superiority of our conventional and nuclear capabilities ensures the security of America and our allies Japan and South Korea,\" Davis said.\nSimilarly, another expert compared the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea to a recurring scene of frustration in \"Peanuts\" cartoons.\n\"Historically, every time Charlie Brown runs for the football, Lucy pulls it away,\" Thomas Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, previously told CNBC. \"It would be a remarkable thing if Lucy didn't pull the football out from Charlie Brown this time, but it's one of those things where I'll believe it when I see it.\"\nNorth Korea is Lucy in this case.\nUnder third-generation North Korean leader Kim, the reclusive state has conducted its most powerful nuclear test, launched its first-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and threatened to send missiles into the waters near the U.S. territory of Guam.\nWhat's more, the acceleration and frequency of testing show not only Kim's nuclear ambitions but also that the nation has developed an arsenal. (Click on the graphic to expand.)\nSince 2011, Kim has fired more than 90 missiles and conducted four nuclear weapons tests, which is more than what his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung, launched over a period of 27 years.\nThe North's arsenal includes short- and medium-range ballistic missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile is the most powerful rocket the North has tested to date.\nThe missile, also known as KN-22 by the U.S., is believed to have a range capable of hitting the entire continental United States, according to estimates from the Missile Defense Project .\nIn 2017 alone, Kim launched 24 missiles and carried out North Korea's largest nuclear test.\nAs it stands, North Korea remains the only nation to test nuclear weapons in this century.\nOn Sept. 3, the rogue regime carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, saying it detonated an advanced hydrogen bomb designed for a long-range missile.\nThe bomb is estimated to have had an explosive yield of 120 kilotons, which equates to a blast created from 265 million pounds worth of TNT, according to Norsar , a Norwegian geoscience research foundation.\n\"Kim Jong Un has repeatedly emphasized that nuclear weapons were a fundamental part of his national security and his nation's survival, and they even put nuclear weapons into their constitution,\" Lisa Collins, a fellow with the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.\n\"It's a little surprising and difficult for me to believe that they would change that stance overnight,\" Collins added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T19:32:01.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
