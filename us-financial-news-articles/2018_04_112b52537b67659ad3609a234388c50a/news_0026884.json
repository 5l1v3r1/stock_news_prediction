The Russian parliament is often used to send assertive messages to foreign states, but these do not always translate into concrete measures.\nLarge-scale restrictions on U.S. goods and services would hurt American firms but could also cause significant disruption in Russia, where consumers flock to McDonald's restaurants, fly on vacation in Boeing jets, and use Apple phones.\nThe draft law, according to a text seen by Reuters, is aimed at protecting Russia's interests and security in the face of \"unfriendly and unlawful acts by the United States of America and other foreign states\".\nRussian currency and stock markets, preoccupied with the threat of U.S. military action in Syria and the fallout from Washington's new sanctions, did not react to the draft legislation.\nIt is to be discussed in the lower house next week.\nTobacco and alcohol The proposed measures are in retaliation for the White House's imposition of the toughest set of sanctions on Russia since Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014, which dragged relations to their lowest point since the Cold War.\nMoscow reacted then with counter-sanctions banning a wide range of food imports from Western countries.\nRussia imported $12.5 billion worth of U.S. products in 2017, according to official customs data. That included aircraft, machinery, pharmaceutical and chemical products.\nThe draft legislation would give authorities the power to impose bans or restrictions in multiple areas of trade with the United States if they deemed that Washington was threatening Russia's interests.\nThe sectors listed in the draft which could be subject to bans or restrictions include U.S.-made software and farm goods, U.S. medicines that can be sourced elsewhere, and tobacco and alcohol.\nIt gives the government the power to ban cooperation with the United States on atomic power, rocket engines and aircraft making, and to bar U.S. firms from taking part in Russian privatisation deals.\nThe provision of auditing, legal and consulting services by U.S. firms could also be subject to bans or restrictions, and curbs could be imposed on U.S. citizens working in Russia.\nWestern companies, including Ford Motor Co, PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola's bottler Coca-Cola BC, have also invested billions of dollars since the fall of the Soviet Union to set up local production in Russia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T14:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T13:50:57.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
