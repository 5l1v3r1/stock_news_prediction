Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 15, 2018 Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo celebrates with a trophy on the podium after winning the race as Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen look on REUTERS/Aly Song \nEven if Mercedes were back on top of the constructors’ standings, the world champions were beaten for the third race in a row at the Chinese Grand Prix — a first for the V6 turbo hybrid era that started in 2014. \n“It’s inevitable in all sports that at some point, the winning becomes harder or stops,” commented Christian Horner, Ricciardo’s team boss, as the celebrations continued. \n“Mercedes still have a quick car. It’s incredible that after three races they haven’t won a Grand Prix yet,” added the Briton, whose team won four successive double titles between 2010 and 2013. \nThe sheer depth of talent and resources at Mercedes’ disposal, and the fact that there are 18 races still to run in this gruelling 21-round season, means it is too early to trumpet a changing of the guard. \nGloomy pre-season predictions, based on testing form, that Lewis Hamilton and his Anglo-German team would run away with this championship can be laid to rest, however. \n“It certainly does look like the tide has turned... in this turbo-hybrid era,” commented 1996 world champion Damon Hill after Ferrari swept the front row in qualifying for the second race in succession.

We are the second, or third fastest team at the moment so we have some improving to do, but that’s not impossible.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin,  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T17:55:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
