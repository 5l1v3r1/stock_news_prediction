The transaction was expected to close “in several months”. \n“The real estate portfolio of S Immo complements the Immofinanz portfolio in the office and retail areas. The transaction is therefore expected to strengthen the market position of both companies and create synergies for the management of the properties,” it said. \n“In the event of a future combination of the two companies, the increased size would lead to a stronger position on the capital market. Opportunities for the realisation of substantial synergies in financing and overhead costs would also be possible.” \nIn Austria stakes above 30 percent trigger a mandatory takeover offer to other shareholders. \nS Immo shares extended their gains on Wednesday afternoon after the deal was announced. By 1354 GMT they were up 4.3 percent at 16.82 euros. Immofinanz shares were down 2.8 percent at 2.128 euros. \nImmofinanz said the situation with its stake in CA Immo was unchanged while it evaluates strategic options.
