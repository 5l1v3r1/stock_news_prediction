Their lack of oversight and poor management is offensive. #DeleteFacebook.\" \nCalSTRS, which manages $224.4 billion in assets , owns $650.4 million in Facebook shares as of year-end 2017. \nAilman's tweet comes as Facebook struggles with the news that Cambridge Analytica, a political analytics firm, was able to collect data on millions of people's profiles without their consent. The news was followed by a steep decline in the company's stock and raised concern it could be hit with government regulation. \nFacebook did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \nIn an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Ailman said: \"They have to deal better with their privacy issues. We've been unhappy about the governance [in Facebook] because as shareholders we have almost no say, because [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg just controls that thing.\" \n\"While Silicon Valley loves to have one person in charge, we think there are drawbacks,\" he said. \nFacebook's stock rose more than 2 percent on Thursday after Zuckerberg told reporters he has not seen a noticeable change in user behavior amid the scandal. Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify in front of Congress on April 11.
