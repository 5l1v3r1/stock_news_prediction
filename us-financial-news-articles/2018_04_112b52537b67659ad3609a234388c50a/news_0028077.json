REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo \nThe group, which was one of the biggest acts of the 1980s with hits such as “The Power of Love,”“Hip to Be Square” and “If This Is It,” had been scheduled to play at least 10 dates this year. \nLewis, 67, said in a statement on the band’s website that he experienced severe hearing loss earlier this year. \n“The lower frequencies distort violently making it impossible to find pitch,” Lewis added. \nThe singer said doctors believe he may be suffering from Meniere’s disease, an inner-ear disorder that causes vertigo, ringing in the ear and permanent hearing loss. \n“I can’t perform until I improve,” Lewis said about his doctors’ advice after seeking treatment from three different clinics. \n“Needless to say, I feel horrible about this, and wish to sincerely apologise to all the fans who’ve already bought tickets and were planning to come see us,” Lewis added. \nHuey Lewis and the News were scheduled to headline at least six concerts this spring and summer. They were also scheduled to perform at the Outside Lands Music Festival in San Francisco as well as open for Jimmy Buffett in Boston and Las Vegas.
