For this year, the International Monetary Fund predicts Britain will move ahead of Japan and Italy in the rankings.\nBritain's preliminary GDP data rely heavily on estimates by ONS staff and only contain about 40 percent of the data in the final estimate.\nOfficial data last week had already shown a big fall in retail sales in March, and earlier on Friday housebuilders reported a sharp drop in new housing starts in the first three months of 2018.\nEarlier this week surveys from the Confederation of British Industry showed only a partial recovery in industrial orders and retail sales in the first part of April, raising the possibility of a further underlying slowdown in growth.\nWeather has not been the only factor weighing on the British economy. Growth has slowed since June 2016's Brexit vote, especially in consumer-facing sectors as households' disposable income has been eroded by a jump in inflation caused by the post-referendum fall in the pound.\nExporters have benefited from a weaker pound and strong global growth, but there has been less of a rise in business investment than typically - something economists link to long-term doubts about Britain's trade prospects after Brexit.\nLast month Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a provisional transition deal to maintain the status quo for 21 months after Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\nBut in the longer term she plans to accept reduced access to Britain's main European export markets in return for the chance to independently negotiate trade deals with faster-growing countries further afield that currently account for only a small share of British exports.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:01:12.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
