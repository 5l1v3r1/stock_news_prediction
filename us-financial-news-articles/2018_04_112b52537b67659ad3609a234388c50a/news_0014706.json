Lopez Obrador has strongly criticized the move, threatening to scrap the reform or at least review contracts awarded under it.\nUrzua sought to downplay fears that the energy overhaul, which was based on a change in the constitution, would be overturned.\n“The (auctions) wouldn’t necessarily be canceled, but they could be halted. Maybe there would be a slower pace,” he said.\nUrzua, who served as Mexico City’s finance minister for part of Lopez Obrador’s 2000-2005 mayoralty of the capital, added that he was “sure that the great majority of the contracts awarded” had not been tainted by corruption.\nLopez Obrador has also rattled business leaders by threatening to scrap a $13 billion new airport for Mexico City, which the government says is already nearly one-third complete.\nUrzua said foreign investors were not very worried about the airport, noting that its major investors are Mexican.\n“But they are worried about the energy sector,” he said.\nUrzua said he has already held meetings with representatives from over 50 major investors in Mexico, including BlackRock, Pimco, Credit Suisse, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley.\nTo eliminate public sector waste and corruption, Urzua said the Lopez Obrador administration would centralize all purchasing of goods and services in the federal government.
