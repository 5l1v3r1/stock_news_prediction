Amazon closed Thursday at $1,517.96 and was up 9.5 percent in premarket trading Friday to 1,661.99.\nAmazon said Thursday evening that revenue jumped 43 percent in the first quarter. Net income more than doubled to $1.6 billion the company said.\nSchachter's new target (up from $1,750) is the highest on Wall Street, according to TipRanks.com , which rates him as one of the top analysts in the space. He rates the stock outperform.\nThere's only one thing that could stop Amazon, Schachter wrote: the government.\n\"Our primary concern remains regulatory risk and the growing potential for political interference,\" he said. \"AMZN's continued success is sure to attract more attention from governments around the world than ever before.\" show chapters ", "external_links": ["https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/ben-schachter"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:50:16.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
