The deal — struck by Iran, Britain , China , France , Germany , Russia , and the United States — under Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama .\nTrump on Jan. 12 gave the three European nations an ultimatum to \"fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal\" or he would refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. Key U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh \"waivers\" to suspend them.\nTrump sees three defects in the agreement: a failure to address Iran's ballistic missile program; the terms under which international inspectors can visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites; and \"sunset\" clauses under which key limits on the Iranian nuclear program start to expire.\nAt a news conference with Trump on Tuesday, Macron said he wanted \"to work on a new deal with Iran\" to limit Iran's nuclear program in the short term and long term, restrain its ballistic missile activities, and curb what the West sees as its destabilizing behavior in the Middle East.\nThose were the issues that Macron's office on Sunday reiterated that the French president wants to work on with Iran's president.\n— CNBC's Matthew J.
