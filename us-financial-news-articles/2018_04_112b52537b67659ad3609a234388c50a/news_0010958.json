The RBI previously gave a go-ahead to PNB to spread the provisions for the fraud-related losses over four quarters, banking sources have said. \nThe state-run bank index was trading 2.1 percent higher by 0559 GMT, while the overall bank index rose 1.2 percent. The main Mumbai market index rose 1.3 percent. \nSentiment was also positive ahead of the RBI’s monetary policy announcement due later in the day with traders expecting the central bank to sound less hawkish, thereby pushing back rate hike fears.
