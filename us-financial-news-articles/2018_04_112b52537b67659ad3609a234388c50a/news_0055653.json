Anglo American’s diamond unit De Beers said in January that it aims to create an industry wide blockchain to track gems each time they change hands starting from the moment they are dug from the ground.\nCompanies in other sectors have also been seeking to adapt blockchain help simplify and reduce the costs some of their most data processes.\nSupply chain management is one of the areas where businesses believe blockchain holds the most promise, as it involves numerous parties and is still very manual.\nIBM is also working with large food retail companies on a blockchain platform to help track food supply chains and improve safety.
