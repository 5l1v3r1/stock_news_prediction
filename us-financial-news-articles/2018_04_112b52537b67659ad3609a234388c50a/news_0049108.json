Soccer Football - Premier League - Arsenal v West Ham United - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - April 22, 2018 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger REUTERS/Toby Melville \nHe was instrumental in hiring Wenger at Arsenal in 1996 and after more than two decades in charge, the Frenchman has announced that he will step down at the end of the season. \n“He is going to be 69 in October and he is extraordinarily fit. He has a very active mind and great knowledge of the game,” Dein told Sky Sports. \n“Over the last few years I know for a fact that he has been approached by some of the biggest clubs in the world - I think Real Madrid, Paris St Germain, the England national team wanted him at one stage. \n“There will be no shortage of offers.” \nWenger, 68, has led Arsenal to three Premier League titles and seven FA Cup triumphs but the club have faded in recent years and lie sixth in the league table.

REUTERS/Phil Noble \nDein still believes Wenger is Arsenal’s greatest ever manager. \n“I think it was so aptly and eloquently put by Richard Scudamore, the chairman of the Premier League, earlier this week. His legacy is not just for Arsenal, but for global football,” Dein said. \n“His style of play, his mannerism, the way he has conducted himself, his integrity, his honesty, the way he handles players, his concern for youth development,” Dein added. \n“His results speak for themselves over the years. He has been enormously successful and will undoubtedly go down in history as the greatest Arsenal manager ever.” \nArsenal’s only chance of claiming silverware this season and sealing Champions League qualification is by winning the Europa League, in which they host Atletico Madrid in the semi-final first leg on Thursday.
