There is nothing on Team Wilder’s side to prevent me from fighting you next. \n“Thanks Anthony, I can’t wait to meet you in the ring.” \nThe WBC title is the only one remaining on Joshua’s radar after he added the WBO championship to his WBA, IBF and IBO titles by defeating New Zealand’s previously unbeaten Parker on Saturday by unanimous decision.
