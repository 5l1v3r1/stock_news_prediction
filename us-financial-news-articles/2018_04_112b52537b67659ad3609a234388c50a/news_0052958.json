Earnings for the segment almost tripled from a year earlier.\nIncome from the refining and marketing segment, known as downstream, weakened due to lower refining margins and plant availability.\nGearing, the ratio between debt and Shell's market capitalisation was slightly lower from the end of 2018 at 24.7 percent by the end of March.\nBrent crude oil prices in recent months have risen to $75 per barrel, their highest since late 2014.\nPrices averaged around $67 a barrel in the first quarter, up nearly 25 percent from a year earlier.\n(Reporting by Ron Bousso; editing by Jane Merriman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:53:47.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
