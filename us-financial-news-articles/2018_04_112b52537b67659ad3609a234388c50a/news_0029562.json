It comes after President Xi Jinping announced on Friday that the country would grant foreign firms greater economic freedom in the southernmost province.\nKnown for its sandy beaches and resort-lined coast, Hainan is the headquarters of China’s aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA. This week, the province hosted the Boao Forum - Asia’s equivalent of Davos.\nThe document said that the government would set up an investment fund to support the building of a free trade port in Hainan by 2025, with the aim that the system will become “mature” by 2035.\nIt will also phase out sales of traditional oil-fuelled vehicles for greater environmental conservation in Hainan, and encourage foreign firms to participate in the building of the free trade port.
