First quarter revenues and gross margins were in-line with our expectations. At the same time, we continued to invest as planned to bolster our Automotive Electronics platform as well as to launch our next generation SentriX Security Provisioning Platform, initially directed at the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market,” said Anthony Ambrose, President and CEO of Data I/O Corporation.\n“Our strong financial position has enabled us to make planned and increased investments in research and development (R&D) and marketing to support the Company’s two secular, long term growth opportunities. The increased operational spending is calculated and strategic in nature with the intent to further extend our lead as the partner of choice on a global scale for device programming and security provisioning technology.\n“Data I/O has made impressive progress toward the development of leadership positions in both automotive electronics and secure programming. We believe we are in the early stages of expansion in the former market as market leaders suggest electronic content and flash memory per vehicle could grow from approximately 50 gigabytes today to 1 terabyte by 2025 – or a 20-fold increase. This progression began a few years ago and our ability to capitalize on it is reflected in our record financial performance in 2016 and 2017. Our investments in UFS programming capability and other planned enhancements to our products are designed to capture this growth opportunity in automotive electronics.\n“While significant runway for growth remains within the automotive electronics sector, we also have been building out our SentriX platform where we are incurring expenses now and expect revenue contributions to gain meaningful traction next year. We view security provisioning as a second strong market opportunity for Data I/O that complements and reinforces growth in the automotive sector. Our SentriX platform is an end-to-end security provisioning solution for OEMs of any size and volume that provides a cost-effective and integrated method to enable hardware based security from product design through manufacturing. Validating the importance of our approach, during the first quarter we announced numerous partnerships with global silicon powerhouses, security specialists and ecosystem leaders that make our solution unique to the industry and essential for safeguarding the embedded IoT supply chain.”\nFinancial Results\nNet sales in the first quarter of 2018 were $7.6 million, up 5.6% as compared to $7.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in sales was primarily a result of prior quarterly bookings and orders received within the three months ended March 31, 2018, particularly for automotive electronics equipment to end customers.\nGross margin of $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased 6% as compared to $4.2 million in the prior year period. For the 2018 first quarter, gross margin as a percentage of sales was 57.9%, an improvement as compared to 57.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales compared to the previous year first quarter was primarily due to favorable product mix as well as higher order volume and improved factory utilization.\nTotal operating expenses in the first quarter of 2018 were $4.1 million, an increase of 21% from $3.4 million in the 2017 period. Spending on research and development to support the Company’s two primary business lines increased nearly 22% in the first quarter of 2018 to $1.9 million from $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. This includes the full impact of engineering resources that were hired in the fourth quarter of 2017. SG&A expenses increased from $1.8 to $2.2 million, reflecting the Company’s increased business development efforts in promoting our new Security Provisioning solution and higher variable sales commissions, as well as participation in additional trade shows and other brand awareness spending. Operating income was $344,000 for the first quarter of 2018, down from $804,000 in the 2017 period.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 was $130,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with net income of $979,000, or $0.12 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Included in non-operating income for the first quarter of 2018 is currency loss of $176,000 compared to $32,000 in prior year first quarter that also included $211,000 for gain on sales of non-core Internet domain assets.\nBookings in the first quarter of 2018 were $6.2 million, compared to $8.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Backlog at March 31, 2018 was $2.7 million, compared to $4.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nData I/O’s financial condition remains strong with a cash position of $16.8 million at March 31, 2018, down from $18.5 million at December 31, 2017. The reduced cash level at March 31, 2018 as compared to December 31, 2017 resulted from annual payments for accrued annual incentive compensation and pension payments relating to 2017. Net working capital of $20.1 million at March 31, 2018 increased by $600,000 from $19.5 million at December 31, 2017.
