But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Chico’s said it doesn’t expect sales through Amazon to be material to 2018 results. The company generated $2.28 billion of sales in its last fiscal year.\nShares in Chico’s, which rose premarket after the announcement, were down 4.8% in afternoon trading.\nSome companies, including Nike Inc., have tried to avoid adding their wares to the site, believing their brands are powerful enough without the help. But Nike reversed course last year and decided to add its sneakers and clothes to the site after being one of Amazon’s biggest holdouts.\nSears Holdings Corp. , facing declining appliance sales, also began selling its Kenmore appliances through Amazon last year.\nAmazon last week said it would increase the price of its Prime membership program to $119 from $99.\nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T23:28:14.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
