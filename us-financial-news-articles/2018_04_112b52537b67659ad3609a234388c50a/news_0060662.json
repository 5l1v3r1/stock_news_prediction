The oil production at plateau rates is expected to be above 20 kbbl/d net to OMV and was anticipated to be reached early in the next decade.\nThe Umm Lulu field’s early production started in the fourth quarter of 2016. Its oil production plateau was also anticipated to be reached early in the next decade and it is expected to deliver 20 kbbl/d net to OMV.\n“OMV’s share of the reserves, for the period of the concession agreement, would amount to approximately 450 million barrels oil for the two main fields, with upside potentials from the satellite fields Bin Nasher and Al Bateel,” it said.\nOMV’s capital expenditure over the contract term is estimated at approximately $2 billion, of which around $150 million is to be spent annually during the first five years.\nReporting by Rania El Gamal; editing by Jason Neely and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-29T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T18:24:50.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
