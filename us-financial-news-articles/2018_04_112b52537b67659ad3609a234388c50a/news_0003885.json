I am eager to embark on my next adventure, in the role of Chief Financial Officer of Rocket Lab, an orbital launch provider based in Huntington Beach, California. I wish MaxLinear much continued success.”\n“Over the last seven years, starting in 2011, Adam played a key role as a part of our executive leadership team as we grew from a sub $100 million revenue company in 2011 to one that generated $421 million in revenues in 2017,” commented Dr. Kishore Seendripu, Chairman and CEO of MaxLinear. “Adam’s tireless efforts in this journey, both internally and externally, are greatly appreciated. He leaves a remarkable legacy and has built a highly competent and resilient finance, accounting, corporate development, IT & facilities team. At a personal level, I will miss working with Adam, who has been a great CFO and a close business advisor. On behalf of MaxLinear’s employees and the Board of Directors, I wish Adam great success in his new endeavor.”\n“Adam will continue to support us in the transition process as we recruit a new CFO to build upon the great foundation that Adam has laid out over the last seven years,” commented Dr. Kishore Seendripu, Chairman and CEO.
