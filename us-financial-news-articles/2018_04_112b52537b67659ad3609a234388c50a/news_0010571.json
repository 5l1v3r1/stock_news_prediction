Once rendered obsolete by the space demands of hulking desktop computers and printers, the quaintly compact desks with enclosed storage were stockpiled in attics and used-furniture store rooms. But the stars have aligned to bring these almost-antiques back to relevance.\n“These vintage pieces are more modern than a desk these days,” said Los Angeles architect Raun Thorp. As more people store documents on a cloud and reduce their computer hardware to a laptop, big working surfaces have become the relics. “Secretaries are like a tiny multiuse building in a room,” said Ms. Thorp, who noted that their height can bring an unexpected dynamism to a room.\nThe modest scale of most vintage models, neither very deep or wide, makes them especially versatile. Richmond, Va., designer Janie Molster said of the chinoiserie-style piece she bought in her 20s, “I have used it in a bedroom, dining room, living room, kitchen and currently my foyer.” The secretary’s lower drawers can store linens, photo albums or clothes; shelves above, usually enclosed by glass doors, can house books or display anything from pottery to Matchbox cars. Rachel Cannon, a designer in Baton Rouge, La., recently tucked one in a stair landing to create a miniature home office. Kari McIntosh, a designer in San Mateo, Calif., used a contemporary West Elm model in a nursery-cum-office in her own two-bedroom apartment. \nJanie Molster bought this chinoiserie-style secretary when she was in her 20s. “The shelves have showcased silver baby cups and porridge bowls; brown-and-white transferware plates; and now, vintage paper mâché plates and boxes,” said the Richmond, Va., designer. Photo: Jordan Rodericks Slots, shelves and drawers (and secret compartments, if you’re lucky) store vestiges of pre-digital life such as staplers and pens, and, brilliantly, the desk fronts close up, “hiding contents elegantly,” said New York designer Phillip Thomas, who placed a 1950 green-blue lacquered French number in a corner surrounded by floor-to-ceiling glass windows. Mr. Thomas favors antique and 20th-century versions, he said. “I am drawn to their history, the fine materials and the craftsmanship.” \nThat 20th-century pieces are still around testifies to their quality, said Anna Brockway, co-founder of vintage site Chairish, which was hosting 110 secretaries for $1,000 or less in early April. “They’re a great example of a category of brown furniture becoming relevant again,” she said, referring to the traditional wood furniture of the 20th and late 19th century that has fallen out of fashion. “When a piece is the right choice and you match it with accessible pricing, it becomes a hit.”\nBeyond practicalities, secretary desks can charm. “They seem to embrace you a little,” said retired businessman George Entin, whose Atlanta designer Melanie Millner found an 18th-century mahogany beauty, now in his study. “You sort of fall in love with them.” \nFrom left to right: Antique Philadelphia Empire Quervelle Carved Flame Mahogany Secretary, $2,450, 1stdibs.com; Early 20th Century Secretary, $395, chairish.com; Reproduction 19th Century French Iron Secretary, $1,850, rh.com More in Design \nThe Vintage Desk That Perfectly Suits Modern Technology April 5, 2018 Why Kitchen Islands Are Ruining America’s Kitchens April 3, 2018 Design-Pro Tricks to Beautify Your Home for $100 or Less March 30, 2018 Copy the Paint Colors of the Rich and Famous March 29, 2018 Old-School Gardening: The 8 Most Reliable Flowers and Veggies to Grow From Seed March 24, 2018", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T23:32:48.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
