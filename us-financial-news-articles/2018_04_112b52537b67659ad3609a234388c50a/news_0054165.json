Infinity was launched last quarter.\n“We see opportunities in Infinity but sometimes these deals take a lot more time,” Shwed said. “Each deal is a few million dollars but is spread out over a few years.”\nCheck Point earned $1.30 per diluted share excluding one-time items in the first quarter, up from $1.20 a year earlier. Revenue grew 4 percent to $452 million.\nIt was forecast to earn $1.28 a share on revenue of $452 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n“The global cyber threat landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated. Attacks are now in their 5th generation, while 97 percent of enterprises are not prepared for these attacks and remain primarily focused on protections for 2nd or 3rd generation attacks,” Shwed said.\nFor the second quarter, Check Point forecast revenue of $445-$475 million and adjusted EPS of $1.25-$1.35. Analysts estimate revenue of $476 million and adjusted EPS of $1.35.\nReporting by Tova Cohen; Editing by Steven Scheer and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:20:50.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
