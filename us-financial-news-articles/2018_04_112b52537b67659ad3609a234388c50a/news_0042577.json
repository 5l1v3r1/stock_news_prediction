REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo \nSteinhoff, which runs chains such as Britain’s Poundland, Mattress Firm in the U.S. and Conforama in France, is fighting for its survival after discovering holes in its accounts. The company’s shares have lost more than 90 percent of their stock market value and assets have had to be sold to raise cash. \n“The group has been engaging with its creditors across the debt clusters to create a window of stability and to develop a restructuring plan,” the company said in a website presentation as it began a shareholder meeting in Amsterdam, where the firm is registered. \nSteinhoff’s total borrowings stand at 10.4 billion euros ($12.7 billion), racked up in an acquisition spree over the last decade. \nNewly appointed finance head Philip Dieperink said the company had sufficient cash to meet its immediate needs but had technically breached some debt agreements and remains in a “tough position”. \nSteinhoff is trying to renegotiate its debt and will likely sell more assets as part of any restructuring plan, Dieperink said. \nShares in Steinhoff were up 1.9 percent at 2.61 rand in Johannesburg, valuing it at roughly 11 billion rand. Just four months ago, it was worth more than 200 billion rand ($16.5 billion).

Where was the supervisory board?,” said Armand Kersten of the VEB. \nSteinhoff’s chairwoman Heather Sonn said no current or proposed board members were implicated in the accounting irregularities, which date back to at least its 2015 accounts. \nThe company has reported its former chief executive Markus Jooste to the South African police over suspected corruption. Jooste was an instrumental figure in the company’s rapid growth into a multinational vying with the likes of IKEA. \nFormer chairman and biggest shareholder, Christo Wiese, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, resigned shortly after the scandal broke. \n“Typically when in a burning building you run out. Some stayed. We are happy some stayed in the burning building to help,” Sonn told investors at the meeting. \n“We want to uncover the truth, show the world what has happened, prosecute any wrongdoing and reinstate trust in the company.” Writing by Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T19:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T14:42:00.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
