India have never played a floodlit match.\nSouth Africa were initially reluctant to play their 2016 test under lights at Adelaide, fearing the hosts would have an unfair advantage.\nThe Proteas lost by seven wickets.\nAustralia and India play their second test at the new Perth Stadium in Burswood, across the Swan river from the city’s traditional test venue, the WACA.\nThe series continues with the Boxing Day test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from Dec. 26 and wraps up in the New Year at the Sydney Cricket Ground (Jan. 3-7).\nThe Gabba in Brisbane, which usually hosts the first test of the Australian summer, has been relegated to the Jan. 24-28 series-opener against Sri Lanka, who will tour the country for the first time in six years.\nCanberra’s Manuka Oval will then host its first test match from Feb. 1 when the home side meet Sri Lanka in their second and final fixture.\nIndia’s tour will kick off with a three-match Twenty20 international series in November after Australia start the home summer with four limited overs matches against South Africa.\nThe hosts will also play India in three ODIs in January.\nThe schedule, which will see test cricket played in February for the first time in over 20 years, has been structured to avoid clashing with the domestic ‘Big Bash’ T20 competition, which has proved a bigger drawcard for local fans than some test matches in recent seasons.\n“This will be a win for fans, with reduced overlap with the Big Bash,” Sutherland said.\nFixtures: Nov. 4 - Australia v South Africa, Perth Stadium, ODI Nov. 9 - Australia v South Africa, Adelaide Oval, ODI Nov. 11 - Australia v South Africa, Bellerive Oval, Hobart, ODI Nov. 17 - Australia v South Africa, Carrara Stadium, Gold Coast, T20I.
