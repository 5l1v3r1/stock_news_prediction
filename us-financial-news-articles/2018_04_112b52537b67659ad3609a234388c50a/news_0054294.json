Financial statements, exhibits, and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures attached to this release include the details of the Company’s results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders of $17.9 million, or $0.21 per common share, which included a $24.1 million non-cash charge due to the impairment of an operating property. Funds From Operations of the Operating Partnership (“FFO”), as defined by NAREIT, of $43.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share. Increased Same-Property Net Operating Income (“NOI”) 1.5% compared to the same period in the prior year. Generated aggregate rent spreads on 58 comparable new and renewal leases of 2.3%, or 8.2% excluding one new anchor tenant that did not require the Company to spend any capital and one strategic anchor renewal. Generated $63.0 million in gross proceeds from the disposition of two non-core shopping centers and used these proceeds to pay down the Company’s revolving line of credit. Completed one Redevelopment, Repurpose and Reposition (“3-R”) project, Burnt Store Marketplace (Punta Gorda, FL), with a projected annualized return of 11.5% on incurred costs of $8.9 million. Subsequent to quarter end, recast the Company’s unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the size by $100 million to $600 million and extending the maturity date.\n“We started 2018 with another quarter of strong operations and execution on our stated objectives,” said John Kite, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We were able to meet our asset disposition goal in the first quarter and continue to look to market select assets to further reduce leverage. We generated another high return on a completed 3-R project and are working to deliver on our remaining initiatives, including our Big Box Surge.”\nFinancial & Portfolio Results\nFinancial Results\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was $17.9 million, compared to net income of $5,000 for the same period in 2017. First quarter 2018 results included a $24.1 million charge for an operating property impairment due to changes during the quarter in facts and circumstances underlying the Company’s expected future hold period of this property.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, FFO, as defined by NAREIT, was $43.5 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share, compared to $43.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share, for the same period in the prior year.\nPortfolio Operations\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company owned interests in 115 operating and redevelopment properties totaling approximately 22.5 million square feet and 2 development projects currently under construction totaling 0.7 million square feet. The owned gross leasable area in the Company’s retail operating portfolio was 94.6% leased as of March 31, 2018, and the Company’s total portfolio was 94.2% leased.\nSame-property NOI, which includes 102 operating properties, increased 1.5% in the first quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. The leased percentage of properties included in the same-property pool was 94.6% at March 31, 2018, compared to 95.1% in the same period in the prior year, while the economic occupancy percentage for the same periods were 93.3% and 94.0%, respectively.\nThe Company executed leases on 65 individual spaces totaling 417,830 square feet during the first quarter of 2018, including 58 comparable new and renewal leases for 391,348 square feet. Cash rent spreads on comparable new and renewal leases executed in the quarter were (2.2%) and 3.1%, respectively, for a blended cash rent spread of 2.3%. Excluding one new anchor tenant lease that did not require the Company to expend any capital and one strategic anchor renewal, new and renewal leases were 16.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for a blended cash rent spread of 8.2%. The blended leasing spread on a GAAP basis, which includes periodic contractual rent increases over the term of the lease, was 5.3%.\nSeveral tenants opened in the first quarter, including the following anchors: Aldi at Bolton Plaza (Jacksonville, FL), Nordstrom Rack at Portofino Shopping Center (Houston, TX) and Skechers Outlet at Eastern Beltway (Las Vegas, NV).\nThe Company is making progress on its anchor space repositioning efforts (“Big Box Surge”). Gander Outdoors is taking the 30,045 square-foot space formerly occupied by Gander Mountain at Bayport Commons (Tampa, FL), and Party City is taking the 11,072 square-foot space formerly occupied by Home Consignment at Centennial Gateway (Las Vegas, NV).\nCapital Recycling\nIn the first quarter, we completed the sale of two non-core operating properties: Trussville Promenade in Birmingham, Alabama, and Memorial Commons in Goldsboro, North Carolina. These sales generated $63.0 million in gross proceeds, which were used to pay down the Company’s revolving line of credit.\nBalance Sheet\nWe continue to strengthen our balance sheet, as we have reduced our Net Debt to EBITDA from 6.92x at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 to 6.76x. We currently have only $48.7 million of term maturities through 2020, and our debt portfolio has a weighted average maturity of 5.3 years.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company successfully recast its unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing the size by $100 million to $600 million, extending the maturity date to April 22, 2022 (which can be further extended by up to two six month periods, subject to certain conditions), lowering the leverage pricing across the grid, and changing the definition of the capitalization rate from 6.75% to 6.50%, which increases total asset value and available borrowing capacity. Additional details are available in the Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 25, 2018.\nDevelopment and Redevelopment\nDuring the quarter, we completed construction on one 3-R project, Burnt Store Marketplace (Punta Gorda, FL). We invested $8.9 million into this asset to demolish and rebuild the 45,000 square-foot Publix and upgrade the center for a projected annualized return of 11.5%.\nThe Company’s 3-R program currently includes six projects under various stages of construction, with estimated combined costs ranging from $61.5 to $66.5 million and an estimated combined annualized return ranging from 8.0% to 9.0%.\n2018 Earnings Guidance\nThe Company maintains its guidance for 2018 FFO, as defined by NAREIT, in a range of $1.98 to $2.04 per diluted common share.

Funds from Operations (FFO) is a widely-used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The Company calculates FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, in accordance with the best practices described in the April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\"). The NAREIT white paper defines FFO as net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales and impairments of depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nConsidering the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance, such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our financial performance, is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity, and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions. Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. A reconciliation of net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO is included elsewhere in this Financial Supplement.\nKite Realty Group Trust\nSame Property Net Operating Income\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\n(Unaudited) ($ in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 %\nChange Number of properties for the quarter 1 102 102 Leased percentage at period end 94.6 % 95.1 % Economic Occupancy percentage 2 93.3 % 94.0 % Minimum rent $ 57,653 $ 57,128 Tenant recoveries 16,682 16,317 Other income 271 284 74,606 73,729 Property operating expenses (10,672 ) (10,517 ) Bad debt expense (364 ) (598 ) Real estate taxes (9,947 ) (9,771 ) (20,983 ) (20,886 ) Same Property NOI 3 $ 53,623 $ 52,843 1.5 % Reconciliation of Same Property NOI to Most Directly Comparable GAAP Measure: Net operating income - same properties $ 53,623 $ 52,843 Net operating income - non-same activity 4 11,554 13,987 Other income (expense), net 1,234 (107 ) General, administrative and other (5,945 ) (5,470 ) Impairment charge (24,070 ) (7,411 ) Depreciation and amortization expense (38,556 ) (45,830 ) Interest expense (16,337 ) (16,445 ) Gains on sales of operating properties 500 8,870 Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 80 (432 ) Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders $ (17,917 ) $ 5", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a8gmz2B7wtlg4rOne2YLhyY3_QdLZDzJkltQ9tk-vOUeWWP9bThYk0tq0H0XX2MV4Vmr4S0GavWFN9w_oO5lEl3-d0yCC3luMGVXg__n7gs="], "published": "2018-04-26T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T02:13:22.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
