But they quickly pulled back to trade up 1.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.\nAmazon.com surged 7.9 percent to a record high after surprisingly strong quarterly results. It also pulled back to a 5.1 percent gain, which was still the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.\n“One thing you are seeing this earnings season is that profits have been good and investors feel like the environment is as good as it gets, there is not that much upside or catalysts going forward, so they are taking profits,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nAt 12:04 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 35.60 points, or 0.15 percent, at 24,286.74, the S&P 500 was up 2.23 points, or 0.08 percent, at 2,669.17 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 3.42 points, or 0.05 percent, at 7,122.10.\nSix of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher with the defensive utilities and real estate sectors gaining just more than 1 percent.\nThe telecoms sector, also considered as a proxy for government bonds, was up 1.92 percent.\nSprint surged 8.8 percent after Reuters reported that its merger talks with fellow wireless carrier T-Mobile had made progress, with a deal possible as early as next week. T-Mobile was up 1.7 percent.\nThe energy index was the biggest loser with a 1.13 percent drop. Most of that was due to Exxon tumbling 3.6 percent after its profit missed estimates due to weakness in its chemical and refining operations.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and for a 1.19-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\nThe S&P index recorded 14 new 52-week highs and six new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 43 new highs and 42 new lows.
