Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih speaks during an interview in Washington, DC, U.S. March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Valerie Volcovici \nThe Western-backed, Saudi-led coalition has said the Iran-aligned Houthis attacked the tanker off Yemen’s main port city of Hodeidah on Tuesday. \n“The terrorist attack ... will not affect economic activity or stall oil supplies,” Falih said on his official Twitter account. \nSaudi oil industry sources said that oil operations and shipments were proceeding as normal and that oil security around oil facilities inside the kingdom had not been raised further. \n“It was a minor attack. There was no impact, but the question is will it continue?” one source said. \nThe tanker was the vessel Abqaiq, the EU naval force said on Wednesday. \nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in a civil war in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. \nThe Houthis, who control most of northern Yemen, have launched a flurry of missiles at Saudi Arabia, including the capital Riyadh, in the past few days. Saudi authorities said they had intercepted the missiles but debris killed one person. \nThe alliance, which includes other Sunni Muslim states, has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting Houthis but has often hit civilian areas, although it denies ever doing so intentionally. \nOne air strike killed 12 civilians including seven children in Hodeidah on Monday.
