But then he just kept going. He didn’t need to keep going ... because I had already backed out.”\nVerstappen, who blamed Hamilton for the collision, has taken Formula One by storm since making his debut as a 17-year-old with Toro Rosso in 2015.\nHe is now seen as a champion-in-waiting whose speed, aggression and racecraft have won him many admirers but also led to run-ins with some of his rivals, most notably Ferrari pair Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen.\nHamilton was heard using a profanity in reference to Verstappen as he watched replays of the incident in the cool down room before the podium celebrations.\nWhen asked about it later in the news conference, race winner Vettel, seated alongside, came to his title rival’s defense.\n“We’ve all been in that situation, we fight someone, we go sometimes wheel-to-wheel, it’s close and you have a lot of adrenalin going. It’s a human reaction,” said the German, also a four times champion.\nEditing by Alan Baldwin/Peter Rutherford\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:12:24.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
