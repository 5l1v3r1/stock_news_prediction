He predicts Costco's cash position will rise faster than previous years due to the benefits from corporate tax reform.\n\"While the most recent dividend was paid in May of last year, we believe there is potential for the company to accelerate this timeline given our estimate of a 14% FCF [free cash flow] benefit from tax reform and the company's strong underlying cash flow,\" he wrote. \"We expect this combination to drive cash levels near $7.5bn by the end of the fiscal year, which is roughly in-line with the level achieved when the 2015 payment was made.\"\nThe company's stock rose 2.4 percent Monday after the report.\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:39:21.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
