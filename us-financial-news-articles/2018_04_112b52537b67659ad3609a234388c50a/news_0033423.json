That should help to ease some of the inflation pressure which has hurt the spending power of many households.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said women's clothing prices rose at a slower than usual pace in March.\n\"Alcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures, with tobacco duty rises linked to the Budget not appearing this March, thanks to its new autumn billing,\" ONS head of inflation Mike Hardie said.\nThe fall in inflation means it is highly likely that wage growth in real terms has by now returned.\nOverall wage growth in the three months to February was steady at 2.8 percent - just behind the rate of inflation over the period. The Bank of England expects wages to grow more quickly than inflation later this year.\nThe ONS figures pointed to less pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices.\nManufacturers increased the prices they charged by 2.4 percent compared with 2.6 percent in February, slightly stronger than the consensus forecast of 2.3 percent but still marking the weakest rate of increase since November 2016.\nAmong manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many of them imported - was 4.2 percent higher than in March 2017, up from an increase of 3.8 percent in February. The ONS said the increase reflected a rise in the price of crude oil.\nThe ONS also said house prices in February rose by 4.4 percent year-on-year across the United Kingdom as a whole compared with 4.7 percent in January, the weakest increase in seven months.\nPrices in London alone contracted by an annual 1.0 percent - the first drop in the official measure of house prices since September 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T13:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T12:42:19.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
