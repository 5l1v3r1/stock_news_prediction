REUTERS/Paul Childs \nAuckland ace Webster took three sprints to stun Mancunian maestro Kenny in the nerve-shredding 2014 final but needed only two to despatch Jack Carlin, the Scottish world silver medallist, at the Anna Meares Velodrome. \nRaw pace rather than tactics has been Webster’s forte but it took gut-busting grit to hold off the rising 20-year-old, who roared home in the second run only to be denied a decider by the length of a wheel rim. \nHaving already celebrated the team sprint gold with Edward Dawkins and Ethan Mitchell on Thursday, the 26-year-old Webster collected his fourth Commonwealth title and sixth medal dating back to Delhi in 2010. \n“I knew from when I woke up — it felt like I was in a good space,” he said after hoisting his bike in triumph in front of ecstatic New Zealand fans. \n“I had recovered really well from the keirin (on Friday), and then throughout my early stages of the warm-up I felt like my legs and head were in the same place.” \nThe event was turned on its head earlier in the day when home world champion and raging favourite Matthew Glaetzer was dumped out of the preliminaries by Malaysian rank outsider Muhammad Sahrom, the slowest of the final 16 qualifiers.
