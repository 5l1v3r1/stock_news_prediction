The company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by U.S. manufacturers, including SolarWorld, which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports.\nLast month, SunPower asked the Trump administration to exempt a segment of its solar panel imports from new tariffs, saying that would benefit its plan to expand its U.S. panel manufacturing.\nThe SolarWorld facility in Hillsboro, Oregon, will be retrofitted to produce SunPower’s panels but will continue to make SolarWorld’s legacy products as well.\nSolarWorld, which is a division of Germany’s SolarWorld AG , called the outcome “ideal” for its hundreds of employees in Hillsboro.\nSunPower shares were up 92 cents, or 11 percent, at $9.23 in mid-day trade on the Nasdaq. The stock hit a high of $9.75 earlier in the session, its highest since late 2017. SunPower is majority owned by France’s Total SA.
