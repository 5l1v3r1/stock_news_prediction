Operating margin was flat at 7.4 percent.\nThe company’s income from continuing operations rose to $624 million in the first quarter, from $497 million a year earlier.\nIncome from continuing operations attributable to Raytheon common stockholders was $2.20 per share, compared with $1.73 per share, a year earlier.\nNet sales rose 4.5 percent to $6.27 billion.
