We delivered exceptional performance across all three of our segments and were especially pleased with the completion of our Cayan acquisition during the quarter. These outstanding results and expectations for the remainder of the year provided us with great momentum and have allowed us to increase our financial outlook for 2018,” said M. Troy Woods, chairman, president and chief executive officer of TSYS.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018 vs. 2017:\nTotal revenues were $987.2 million, a decrease of 16.7%. The decrease is the result of adopting ASC 606. (1) Net revenue (non-GAAP), which excludes reimbursable items, interchange and payment network fees, was $935.5 million, an increase of 12.3%. Net income attributable to TSYS common shareholders was $141.8 million, an increase of 34.0%. Diluted EPS were $0.77, an increase of 35.2%. Adjusted earnings (non-GAAP) were $207.6 million, an increase of 36.3%. Adjusted diluted EPS (non-GAAP) were $1.13, an increase of 37.6%. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) was $330.9 million, an increase of 15.2%.\n(1)\nOn January 1, 2018, TSYS adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” using the modified retrospective transition method. The most significant impact of adopting ASC 606 in 2018 is primarily the result of gross versus net presentation of interchange and payment network fees. In 2018, these fees collected on behalf of the payment networks and card issuers are presented “net” of the amounts paid to them, as opposed to the “gross” presentation for certain of these fees in 2017. Revised 2018 Outlook\nTSYS’ revised 2018 guidance is as follows:\nRevised 2018\nFinancial Outlook\nRange (1)(2)\nPercent\nChange\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Revenue: Total revenues (GAAP) $3,900 to $4,000 (21%) to (19%) Net revenue (non-GAAP) $3,700 to $3,800 9% to 12% Earnings per share: Diluted EPS (GAAP) $3.00 to\n$3.10 (5%) to (2%) Adjusted diluted EPS attributable to TSYS common shareholders (non-GAAP) $4.25\nto\n$4.35\n26%\nto\n29%\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding 184 (2) The estimated impact of the adoption of ASC 606 (1) on TSYS’ revised 2018 Outlook is as follows:\nTotal revenues\n($1,640)\nto\n($1,615)\nNet revenue\n($69)\nto\n($62)\nDiluted EPS\n($0.04)\nto\n($0.03)\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n($0.04)\nto\n($0.03)\nConference Call\nTSYS will host its quarterly conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, April 24. The conference call can be accessed via live webcast on the “Investor Relations” section of TSYS’ website at investors.tsys.com where an accompanying slide presentation will also be available. The replay will be archived for 12 months and will be available approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the call.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThis press release contains information prepared in conformity with GAAP as well as non-GAAP information. It is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance understanding of its consolidated financial information as prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Each non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.\nAdditional information about non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, net revenue, adjusted earnings, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included on pages 11 to 15 in the financial schedules of this release.\nAbout TSYS\nTSYS ® (NYSE: TSS) is a leading global payments provider, offering seamless, secure and innovative solutions across the payments spectrum — from issuer processing and merchant acquiring to prepaid program management.

Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “believe,” “should,” “plan,” “potential,” “will,” “could,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding TSYS’ revised earnings guidance for 2018 total revenues, net revenue, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS, and the assumptions underlying such statements. These statements are based on the current beliefs and expectations of TSYS’ management, are based on management’s assumptions and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. A number of important factors could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements in this press release. Many of these factors are beyond TSYS’ ability to control or predict. These factors include, but are not limited to, the material breach of security of any of TSYS’ systems; TSYS’ ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve the anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits of the acquisitions, particularly the recently completed Cayan acquisition; the effect of current domestic and worldwide economic conditions; risks associated with foreign operations, including adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates, and in particular with respect to the current environment, adverse developments with respect to foreign currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union (Brexit); expenses incurred associated with the signing of a significant client; conversions of clients’ portfolios do not occur as scheduled; the deconversion of a significant client; changes occur in laws, rules, regulations, credit card association rules, prepaid industry rules or other industry standards affecting TSYS and our clients that may result in costly new compliance burdens on TSYS and our clients and lead to a decrease in the volume and/or number of transactions processed or limit the types and amounts of fees that can be charged to customers, and in particular the CFPB’s new rule regarding prepaid financial products, including its effective date; the potential for our systems and software to contain undetected errors, viruses or defects; the costs and effects of litigation, investigations or similar matters or adverse facts and developments relating thereto; adverse developments with respect to the payment card industry in general, including a decline in the use of cards as a payment mechanism; and growth rates of TSYS’ existing clients are lower than anticipated or attrition rates of existing clients are higher than anticipated. Additional risks and other factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contemplated in this release can be found in TSYS’ filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations. TSYS disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise except as required by law.\nTSYS Financial Highlights (unaudited) (in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Percent 2018 2017 Change Total revenues $ 987,170 1,184,725 (16.7 )% Cost of services 613,365 861,856 (28.8 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 185,534 155,686 19.2 Total expenses 798,899 1,017,542 (21.5 ) Operating income 188,271 167,183 12.6 Nonoperating expenses (37,642 ) (29,903 ) (25.9 ) Income before income taxes and equity in income of equity investments\n150,629 137,280 9.7 Income tax expense 18,135 43,082 (57.9 ) Income before equity in income of equity investments 132,494 94,198 40.7 Equity in income of equity investments, net of tax 10,608 12,909 (17.8 ) Net income 143,102 107,107 33.6 Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (1,261 ) (1,239 ) (1.8 ) Net income attributable to TSYS common shareholders $ 141,841 105,868 34.0 % Earnings per share (EPS): Basic EPS $ 0.78 0.58 35.7 % Diluted EPS $ 0.77 0.57 35.2 % Weighted average shares outstanding: (includes participating securities) Basic 181,612 183,880 Diluted 183,298 184,938 Dividends declared per share $ 0.13 0.10 30.0 % Non-GAAP measures:*\nNet revenue $ 935,497 832,892 12.3 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 330,922 287,237 15.2 % Adjusted earnings $ 207,586 152,265 36.3 % Adjusted diluted EPS $ 1.13 0.82 37.6 % * See reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

This non-GAAP measure presents first quarter 2018 financial results using the previous year’s foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, TSYS’ total year-to-date revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were lower 17.6% as compared to a reported GAAP decrease of 16.7%. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities and capital expenditures to free cash flow. The schedules below also provide a reconciliation of 2018 revised guidance of total revenues to net revenue and diluted EPS to adjusted diluted EPS. The tax rate used in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter and year is equal to an estimate of our annual effective tax rate on GAAP income. This effective rate is estimated annually and may be adjusted during the year to take into account events or trends that materially impact the effective tax rate including, but not limited to, significant changes resulting from tax legislation, material changes in the mix of revenues and expenses by entity and other significant events. TSYS believes that non-GAAP financial measures are important to enable investors to understand and evaluate its ongoing operating results. Accordingly, TSYS includes non-GAAP financial measures when reporting its financial results to shareholders and potential investors in order to provide them with an additional tool to evaluate TSYS’ ongoing business operations. TSYS believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are representative of comparative financial performance that reflects the economic substance of TSYS’ current and ongoing business operations. Although non-GAAP financial measures are often used to measure TSYS’ operating results and assess its financial performance, they are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation. TSYS believes that its provision of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with important key financial performance indicators that are utilized by management to assess TSYS’ operating results, evaluate the business and make operational decisions on a prospective, going-forward basis. Hence, management provides disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures to give shareholders and potential investors an opportunity to see TSYS as viewed by management, to assess TSYS with some of the same tools that management utilizes internally and to be able to compare such information with prior periods. TSYS believes that inclusion of non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional information to help them better understand its financial statements just as management utilizes these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand the business, manage budgets and allocate resources.
