REUTERS/Joshua Roberts “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!” Trump said on Twitter.\nTrump is expected to meet with Kim in weeks, and said in an interview on Thursday that he was considering five locations for his summit with the North Korean leader, although he has said multiple times that the talks may not happen.\nThe Peace House is in the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, on the border between the two countries. It is the same site as the one that hosted Kim’s historic meeting last week with the South Korean president.\nThe choices of a venue for the Trump summit also include neutral third countries like Singapore, but U.S. officials have been skeptical that Kim would be willing to travel far.\nLast week the leaders of North and South Korea met and pledged to end hostilities and work toward the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, seeming to increase the likelihood of the Trump-Kim summit. A war between North and South ended in July 1953 in a truce rather than an official peace treaty.\nOn Friday, Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, a goal that the United States also seeks as it tries to prevent North Korea developing a nuclear weapon that could reach the United States.\nA senior adviser to Moon told Reuters last week that Seoul had a “comprehensive road map” that it was sharing with Washington before the summit between Trump and Kim.\nIf Trump meets with Kim at the DMZ, it will not be the first time the White House had planned a trip to that border. On a 12-day trip to multiple Asian countries in November, Trump visited South Korea, but a surprise visit to the DMZ was scrapped due to weather issues.\nReporting by Makini Brice; Editing by and Jeffrey Benkoe and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T15:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:12:45.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
