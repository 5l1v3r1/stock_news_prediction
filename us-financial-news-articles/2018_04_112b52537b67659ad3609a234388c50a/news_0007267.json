Under the U.S. plan, companies have until May 22 to object to the proposed tariffs and the government has at least 180 days after that to decide whether to move ahead. \nBy Lingling Wei Kenan Machado \nBEIJING—China retaliated swiftly to the Trump administration’s latest proposed penalties on Chinese goods, announcing 25% tariffs on critical American exports, including soybeans, airplanes and autos. \nChina’s cabinet, the State Council, said Wednesday that the tariffs will cover 106 categories of products and will affect $50 billion of Chinese imports of U.S. products. The tariff rate and the sum of goods targeted mirror the proposal unveiled by the Trump administration Tuesday to punish Beijing for what it says are unfair practices to acquire American technology. \nNeither the U.S. nor Chinese tariffs take effect immediately. The Chinese government didn’t specify when its penalties would be imposed. A Finance Ministry statement said that authorities are watching how the U.S. implements its proposed trade actions. ‘Frankly speaking, we’re facing huge challenges today.’ Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao told reporters at an official briefing following the release of the plan \nThe Chinese plan makes good on warnings that Beijing would respond to U.S. trade actions with proportional measures. In a key difference, Beijing has targeted the biggest American exports to China: soybeans SK8, -4.31% and airplanes BA, +2.60% . Many of the other goods on the list—including sorghum and beef—intentionally affect the U.S. Farm Belt, where voters supported President Donald Trump, according to people familiar with the plans for retaliation. \nBy contrast, the Trump administration plan levies 25% tariffs on a broader range of goods—1,300 categories in all—such as dishwashers, medical equipment and machine tools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T14:17:23.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
