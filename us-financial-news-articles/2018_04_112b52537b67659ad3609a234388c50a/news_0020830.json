German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends a joint a news conference with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \n“I made very clear that a Nord Stream 2 project is not possible without clarity on the future transit role of Ukraine,” she told a joint news conference in Berlin with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. \n“So you can see that it is not just an economic issue but there are also political considerations,” she added. \nNord Stream 2, planned to run from Russia through the Baltic Sea to Germany, would double the existing Nord Stream pipeline’s annual capacity of 55 billion cubic metres.

Germany, along with other beneficiaries in northern Europe, has so far backed the project. \nMerkel said she spoke by telephone to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. \n“I also said to President Putin yesterday: it cannot be that through Nord Stream 2, Ukraine has no further importance regarding the transit of gas,” she added.
