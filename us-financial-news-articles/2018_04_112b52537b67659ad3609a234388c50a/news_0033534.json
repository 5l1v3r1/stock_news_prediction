Including these figures, total wind investment stood at 51.2 billion euros in 2017, an all-time high. \nThis was primarily driven by project and company acquisitions, which more than doubled to 14.4 billion euros last year, compared with 6.8 billion in 2016. \n“Sector maturity and technology competitiveness have brought in more investors as equity partners in projects, in particular from the financial services industry. These partnerships are key for power producers who need to recycle capital to finance new assets,” WindEurope said. \nIt added infrastructure and pension funds, asset managers and other financial service companies owned more than a third of the capacity that was bought or sold last year, up from 27 percent in 2016. $1 = 0.8090 euros Reporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T09:28:51.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
