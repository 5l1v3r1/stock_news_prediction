REUTERS/Hazir reka/File Photo/File Photo \nThe six Turkish nationals were arrested in Kosovo last week at Turkey’s request over alleged links to schools financed by the Gulen movement, which Ankara blames for a failed 2016 coup. \nOn Friday Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj sacked his interior minister and country’s secret service chief for failing to inform him about the arrests. Haradinaj has also ordered a separate investigation. \nAvdullah Hoti, head of the lawmakers from the opposition party the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) that initiated the emergency session in the 120-seat parliament, said he was “shocked” by the arrests of the six - teachers and managers at schools. \n“Instead of being interviewed by authorities in Pristina, they were urgently deported to Turkey,” Hoti said. \nAnkara accuses the six of being recruiters for a network run by the U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, and said they had helped people accused of connections to the network to leave Turkey. Ankara blames Gulen and his movement for the coup attempt in 2016. Gulen denies involvement. \nHuman Rights Watch criticised the Kosovo authorities over the arrests saying the six men “were sent to a country where they face a serious risk of torture”.
