(NYSE: FIX), a leading provider of mechanical services including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, piping and controls, today announced net income of $16.7 million or $0.44 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $7.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company reported revenue of $464.9 million in the current quarter, as compared to $380.6 million in 2017.\nBrian Lane, Comfort Systems USA’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are very pleased to report strong first quarter increases in earnings and revenue, both on an absolute and same-store basis. Our quarterly earnings per share increased by $0.07 per diluted share due to a discrete tax item. Even without that discrete tax benefit, we are reporting a significant increase in first quarter profitability.”\nThe Company reported negative free cash flow of $1.4 million in the current quarter, as compared to positive free cash flow of $5.3 million in 2017. Backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $1.08 billion as compared to $948.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and $863.0 million as of March 31, 2017.\nMr. Lane continued, “Our backlog continues to build, with strong new construction activity in many of our most profitable markets. This quarter marks the first time that our backlog has exceeded $1.0 billion. Service profitability improved compared to a year ago, and cash flow is very good for a first quarter, especially in light of our revenue growth.”\nMr. Lane concluded, “We remain optimistic about underlying trends, including for the remainder of this year, and we continue to be deeply grateful to our fantastic team members who are executing at a high level across the United States.”\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a webcast and conference call to discuss its financial results and position in more depth on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time.

The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “intend,” “foresee,” “should,” “would,” “could,” or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historic in nature.
