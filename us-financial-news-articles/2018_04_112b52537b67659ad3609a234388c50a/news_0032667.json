This stemless total shoulder system provides the surgeon with an approach that results in increased exposure to the glenoid, minimizes bone removal, and is designed for patients with painful and/or severely disabled shoulder joints resulting from arthritis, traumatic events or AVN.\n\"This truly is a revolutionary stemless total shoulder, which combines the concept of anatomic restoration with an aspherical head design that more closely replicates patient anatomy but also allows improved joint access for ease of preparation of the glenoid,\" said Dr. Anthony Miniaci, MD.\nThe OVOMotion™ Shoulder Arthroplasty System is cleared for use in conjunction with the novel Arthrosurface Inlay Glenoid System and according to a comparative study published in the Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery, the inlay glenoid (socket) design was far superior to the onlay alternative with respect to the biomechanical stability.\nSteve Ek, CEO said, \"The OVOMotion™ Shoulder Arthroplasty System is intended to be the first of a three-element modular stemless system that will ultimately allow surgeons to intra-operatively choose between stemless, traditional and reverse options.\"\nAbout Arthrosurface\nArthrosurface, Inc. is a global orthopedic medical technology business providing a broad portfolio of essential products and instrumentation used to treat upper and lower extremity orthopedic conditions caused by trauma, injury and arthritic disease.
