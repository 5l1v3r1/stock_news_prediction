Revenue rose to $196 million from $191 million.\nThe revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in its global trading services business as reduced volatility in key commodity products led to lower trading volumes.\n($1 = 0.72 pounds)\nReporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Maju Samuel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T15:08:02.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
