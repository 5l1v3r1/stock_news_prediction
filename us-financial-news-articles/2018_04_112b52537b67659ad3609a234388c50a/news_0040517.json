Vendors have been cleared from parts of Bangkok, Jakarta, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Mumbai over the last year.\nDuring evictions, their equipment is often confiscated or destroyed. In some cases, they are prosecuted and left facing ruin.\n“We’ve seen crackdowns in a lot of the bigger cities that have global city aspirations,” said Sarah Orleans Reed, Bangkok coordinator at WIEGO, a global non-profit that helps informal workers.\n“It’s seen as a ‘Singaporisation’ of these cities, because the goal is to have empty sidewalks,” she added.\nStreet-food vendors prepare food in Kuala Lumpur, April 13, 2018, Thomson Reuters Foundation/Michael Taylor ‘POVERTY DISPLAYED’ Besides fresh food, Asia’s street vendors sell a variety of items including cigarettes, SIM cards for mobile phones, electronics, craft goods, toys and clothes.\nHawkers use vans, motorcycles, rickshaws, bicycles, carts, tables and chairs, or even a simple piece of cardboard laid out on pavements to transport and sell their wares. Favored locations are any public area popular with pedestrians.\nSome do pay fees to local authorities for licenses to operate in designated zones. But the vast majority do not, and trade illegally with few protections.\nFalling between the cracks of regulation, they are often harassed and targeted for bribes by criminals or corrupt officials and police, while facing the constant threat of eviction and prosecution, urban experts said.\n“Nobody likes to see poverty displayed,” said Alison Brown, professor of urban planning and international development at Cardiff University in Wales.\n“In the history of modern urbanization, we’ve got many examples of moving and tidying away poorer people,” said Brown, who has studied street vendors for almost 20 years.\nSome government authorities may also be keen to discourage large gatherings of people in public spaces, fearing they could become a hotbed for opposition supporters, she added.\nBecause most hawkers move around a lot, operate at different times of day and hide from officials, reliable data on their number and contribution to economies is scarce.\nStreet selling - often a means to earn a living for socially marginalized groups like young people, migrants and women in some countries - is rarely included in government statistics and policy.\nHEALTHY FAST FOOD Over the decades, hawkers have played a crucial role in the growth of Asia’s urban areas, becoming a vital part of their local economies, researchers said.\nThese armies of street sellers attract tourists, keep the cost of living low by providing cheap goods and healthy fast food, and support supply chains, they added.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Poorer residents often lack access to cooking facilities at home, and cannot afford to shop at supermarkets or eat at high-end restaurants.\n“People prefer the freshness, proximity, interpersonal relations and quality of what you get on the street,” said IIED’s Vorley.\nAlthough few urban areas in Asia do a good job of managing street vendors, Suri of Cities Alliance noted some successes.\nIndonesian cities like Solo in Central Java are starting to accommodate vendors and are recognizing their key role in the economy and as custodians of the local cuisine, he added.\nIndia has created a national association of street vendors, which could be replicated across Asia, researchers said.\nIn addition to giving hawkers representation, the Indian association boosts the income and profile of its members by organizing food festivals in urban areas involving vendors and their different local cuisines from around the country.\nOver the decades, Singapore has moved street-food stalls to regulated and more hygienic centers, but Cardiff University’s Brown said the island city-state’s small size, relatively wealthy hawkers, and tightly controlled political system and urban development make that difficult to replicate elsewhere.\nELITIST PLANNING Street vendors need help to create groups that give them a voice, enabling them to become part of city decision-making and to campaign for more rights, researchers said.\nLocal associations for specific areas, like a bus station or town square, could also help manage and clean those spaces with vendors’ involvement.\nUrban planners and real-estate businesses should consider street vendors in their spatial planning and development projects, while new infrastructure - like transport systems - must also take street traders into account, researchers said.\nDesignated zones are a good option, but should be located where there is high footfall with well-maintained infrastructure, such as bridges, lighting and toilets, to attract customers, they added.\nImaginative use of urban spaces - like pedestrianised night markets - can also work well, they said.\nReed at WIEGO said other cities around the world that are serving as a model for Asia’s mega-cities are now trying to attract small businesses and vendors, and create street markets.\n“They’re all trying to enliven their cities,” she said. “Asian cities have this tremendous asset that provides so many services, beyond employment and tourism, that make the city more livable and affordable.”\nReporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Megan Rowling.
