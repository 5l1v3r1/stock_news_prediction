In the 1960s, Becker proposed that every human's decisions are based on the economic costs and benefits of his or her actions.\nshow chapters The longest-running study of genius kids reveals what it takes to be highly successful      8:23 AM ET Fri, 10 Nov 2017 | 01:09 Through Becker's lens, indulging in fun would be unproductive and come at a cost. But Zuckerberg does not agree with this notion.\n\"If you're framing [sense of purpose] as 'doing stuff that's fun leads you to your demise,' I think there is a lot of research that would suggest the opposite,\" Zuckerberg says.\nAnd he's right. Research shows that having a sense of purpose leads to an overall healthier life, as doctor and Cornell researcher Dhruv Khullar recently wrote in The New York Times .\nIn a Q&A on Facebook several years ago , Zuckerberg explained how he strikes a balance between being productive and fulfilling his own well-being.\n\"To me, happiness is doing something meaningful that helps people and that I believe in with people I love,\" he said. \"I think lots of people confuse happiness with fun. I don't believe it is possible to have fun every day. But I do believe it is possible to do something meaningful that helps people every day.\"\nshow chapters Multi-billionaire tech investor: Here's what the next Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates will see in A.I.      12:59 PM ET Mon, 25 Sept 2017 | 01:49 Earlier this year, Zuckerberg underscored Facebook's responsibility to converge happiness and well-being on the platform.\n\"The research shows that when we use social media to connect with people we care about, it can be good for our well-being. We can feel more connected and less lonely, and that correlates with long-term measures of happiness and health,\" he said.\nDubner's interview with Zuckerberg preceded much of the controversy the Facebook CEO is currently enduring in light of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and a leaked Facebook memo .\nIn the interview, Dubner addressed the very fact that people could \"doubt the do-gooder\" part of Zuckerberg's happiness rhetoric. In turn, Zuckerberg returned to Dubner's question: \"Do you believe that people can make good decisions for themselves?\"\n\"I deeply do,\" Zuckerberg says.\nLike this story?
