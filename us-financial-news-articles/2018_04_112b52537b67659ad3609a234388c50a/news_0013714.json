But it continued to say men aged 20-45 with “orthodox manners”, “good character” and no political problems or infectious diseases were encouraged to register to donate sperm by May 23. \nDonors are entitled to up to 5,500 yuan ($870) in cash for their trouble, the posting said. \nChina’s birth rate is one of the lowest in the world and has become a concern for the government, which dropped its decades-old one-child policy in 2015. \nOfficial encouragement to mate comes as the Communist Party tightens its grip in many aspects of society - from the economy to politics. \nThe Peking University Third Hospital could not be immediately reached for comment, outside of business hours on a public holiday.
