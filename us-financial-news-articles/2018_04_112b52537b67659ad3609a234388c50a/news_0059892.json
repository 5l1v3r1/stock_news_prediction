After that it will fall as long as budget agreements remain the same and current economic forecasts prove true, the source said.\nThat means it will be well below the 2 percent quota demanded by the military alliance.\nThe figures could add another layer of complication to talks between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Trump on Friday in Washington. The two leaders also differ on trade and a multinational nuclear deal with Iran.
