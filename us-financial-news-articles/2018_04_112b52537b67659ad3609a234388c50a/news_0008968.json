(Nasdaq: ZEUS) , a leading national metals service center, today announced that effective April 2, 2018, it has acquired the assets of Berlin Metals LLC, based in Hammond, Indiana. Terms in the all-cash deal were not disclosed.\nWith approximately $50 million in annual sales, Berlin Metals was founded in 1967 and is one of the largest North American service centers processing and distributing prime tin mill products and stainless steel strip in slit coil form. The Company is also a supplier of galvanized, light gauge cold rolled sheet and strip; and other coated steels in coil form, to customers in the building products, automotive, and specialized industrial markets.\n“This acquisition adds new products and markets, both of which are central to our growth strategy,” said Olympic Steel’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Siegal. “Berlin Metals also has a growing stainless steel business, compounding our organic growth in these products. With minimal customer overlap, this is a perfect complement to existing operations.”\nThe purchase includes four coil slitters operating from a 120,000 square foot facility in Hammond. Berlin Metals will continue to operate under its well-known brand and the management team, including President Roy Berlin, will remain at the Company. The business will be included in Olympic Steel’s Specialty Metals Flat Products reporting segment, which is led by President, Specialty Metals Andy Markowitz, and is expected to be accretive to 2018 earnings.\nForward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
