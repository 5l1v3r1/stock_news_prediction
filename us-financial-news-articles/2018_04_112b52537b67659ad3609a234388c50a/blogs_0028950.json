Gartner last week projected worldwide IT spending this year would reach $3.7 trillion , a 6.2% increase over 2017. The gains are being driven by corporate spending on digital transformation efforts, Gartner said.\nYet, for many older firms, that process comes with added headaches, according to the PointSource survey.\nOn a daily basis, it found, older firms are far more likely to waste take longer tracking down and sharing data, or other digital assets, across their organization – as a result of insufficient or incompatible technologies, or a lack of staff training in the latest tools.\nOlder firms are also more likely to be wrestling with aging and often highly-customized IT systems that predate cloud-era capabilities, an issue not faced by younger, cloud-native competitors.\nTyson Food Inc. recently told CIO Journal about ongoing efforts to consolidate disparate IT systems and deploy new technologies, which the 83-year-old meat producer hopes will enable it to move faster, better predict demand and spur innovation.\nLikewise, Patrick Benson, CIO of golf and country club operator ClubCorp Holdings Inc., founded in 1957, told CIO Journal in February that legacy IT systems at different clubs across the country caused lengthy delays in modernization efforts, including some with membership data stored on paper forms.\nShare this: CLOUD IT IMPLEMENTATION LEGACY APPLICATIONS Previous The Morning Download: You Can Keep Your Data Next The Morning Download: Defense Department's Massive Cloud Contract Creates a Storm", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T23:57:47.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
