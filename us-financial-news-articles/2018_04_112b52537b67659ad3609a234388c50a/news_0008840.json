As of now, expectations are the 193,000 jobs to be added, according to a Reuters poll. \nAny reading above that headline figure could strengthen the case for rate hikes and push U.S. Treasury yields, as well as European equivalents, higher. \nThe yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries was 1.5 bps lower at 2.815 percent in European trade, and the gap over the German equivalent was at 230 bps, just a few basis points below the one-year high hit in March.
