The study team assessed widow/widower status, cognitive functioning test scores and other factors such as bereavement, education, remarriage, health status, race and living family members.\nThe cognitive functioning score was based on several tasks, including immediate word recall, delayed word recall, counting backwards from 20, and ability to name objects, data and current president and vice president.\nThe analysis found that 2,742 adults overall experienced widowhood, and in the oldest age group - over age 70 - the majority of individuals were widowed by the end of the study period.\nCognitive scores for widows/widowers were consistently more than half a point lower than for peers who were not widowed. Further, every additional year of widowhood decreased individuals’ cognition score by a quarter of a point. The decline occurred regardless of remarriage status or the spouse’s condition before death, the researchers note.\nThe loneliness associated with widowhood may be a major part of the cognitive decline, and having living siblings, adult children and friends can provide that social interaction to prevent some decline, said Anna Sundstrom of Umea University in Sweden, who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“Widowhood has a deep negative impact on both mental and physical health,” Sundstrom said in an email. “The growth of the aging population worldwide may bring with it an increasing number of lonely elderly.”\n“There are also things you can do now to protect your cognition as you age,” said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer’s Association in Chicago, who wasn’t involved in the study.\nThe Alzheimer's Association offers a resource called 10 Ways to Love Your Brain ( bit.ly/2xXvEE4 ) listing lifestyle habits that help stave off cognitive decline. For instance, healthy eating, exercise, sleep, education and social activity help the brain to age slower, Fargo said.\n“It’s easy to fall into a fatalistic attitude that our cognition will get worse as we get older, but we can do things now to keep it as healthy as we can,” he said in a telephone interview.\n“Now is the time to start,” Fargo added. “Don’t wait until something negative such as widowhood happens. These are lifelong habits that you can’t start too soon.”\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2vtMD4i American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, online March 26, 2018.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T18:19:55.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
