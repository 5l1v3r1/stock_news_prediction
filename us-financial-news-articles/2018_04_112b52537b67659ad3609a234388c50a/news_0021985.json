Kang was also charged with wire fraud.\nThe wire fraud conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20-year prison term.\nIn 2015, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed related civil charges against both defendants. That case remains pending, court records show.\nThe cases are U.S. v. Kang et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 18-cr-00184; and CFTC v Kang et al in the same court, No. 15-05551.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T22:51:04.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
