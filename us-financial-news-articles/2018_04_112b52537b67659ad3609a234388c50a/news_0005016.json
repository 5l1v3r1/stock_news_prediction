I think you can see the Tiger effect in plenty of the tournaments that he’s been at, from ticket sales to the amount of people viewing on TV. \n“We’ll see it this week. I would love to see him play well, just hopefully I can play a little bit better.” \nDespite being without a PGA Tour title since 2013 and with his last major victory now a decade gone, Woods presence at Augusta National is still one that should make his fellow competitors nervous. \nWoods has posted 11 top five finishes, including four wins, on a course that was once tweaked to “Tiger Proof” the layout. Staring down Woods on a final day was a golfing nightmare and, while his invincible aura may have faded, the thought of a Tiger back-nine charge on Sunday is as much an unpleasant one for his rivals as it is a potential thrill for fans. \n“I think when it comes to Tiger ... everyone wants to see him win and play the way he did before,” said Australia’s former world number one Jason Day. \n“Everyone’s kind of chomping at the bit for him to kind of get here and see how he’s moving and everything. Tiger’s Tiger, but I think the biggest thing for me is I can’t beat myself. \n“I think on my good day I’ve got a good chance of beating him. I honestly believe that. You got to have that self belief. \n“You can’t come into an event thinking that, well, Tiger’s going to win, I’m going to play for second place.” (Editing by Nick Mulvenney)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T03:32:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
