REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nDaimler could buy “a couple of percent” in Volvo Cars, Manager Magazin said on Thursday, without citing sources. \nVolvo declined to comment and a Daimler spokesman said: “This is pure speculation which we will not comment on.” \nThe chairman of Volvo owner Geely, Li Shufu, stealthily built a $9 billion stake in Daimler by the end of February, seeking to forge an alliance with the German carmaker as a way to counter the threat from new competitors such as Tesla ( TSLA.O ), Google ( GOOGL.O ) and Uber.[nL8N1QD5P5 \nDaimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche has welcomed the Geely chairman as a new shareholder and said any industrial alliance will depend on whether current China partner BAIC ( 1958.HK ) agrees.
