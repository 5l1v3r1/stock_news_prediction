After 8 weeks of treatment with MN-001, the serum triglyceride level was reduced in 14 out of 15 subjects. Pre-treatment mean serum triglycerides was 328.6 mg/dL and post-treatment mean serum triglycerides was 192.9 mg/dL. MN-001 significantly reduced mean serum triglycerides by 135.7 mg/dL, resulting in a 41.3% reduction (p=0.02).\nThe data from the 15 subjects who completed 8 weeks of treatment was re-analyzed after excluding one outlier (subject 5019 RM with an extremely high triglyceride level of 1288 mg/dL before treatment which was reduced to 300 mg/dL after treatment). After 8 weeks of treatment with MN-001, the serum triglyceride level was reduced in 13 out of 14 subjects. Pre-treatment mean serum triglycerides was 260.1 mg/dL and post-treatment mean serum triglycerides was 185.2 mg/dL. MN-001 significantly reduced mean serum triglycerides by 74.9 mg/dL, resulting in a 28.8% reduction (p=0.00006).\nThere were no clinically significant safety or tolerability issues during the study.\nMN-001 (tipelukast) significantly reduced mean serum triglycerides, a primary endpoint, during the study. Having achieved the most important endpoint of the study, MediciNova has discontinued enrollment and will stop the study in order to accelerate further development of MN-001.\nYuichi Iwaki, MD, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, \"We are thrilled with the results of this study, which showed a large reduction in triglycerides. Based on the results of this study along with the triglyceride data we have from prior clinical studies of MN-001 in other indications, we believe that MN-001 has potential to benefit a wide range of patients with hypertriglyceridemia, not limited to those with NASH and NAFLD.”\nAbout the Trial\nThe Phase 2a trial is a multi-center, proof-of-principle, open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MN-001 in subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with hypertriglyceridemia. Eligible subjects consisted of males and females ranging in age from 21 to 65 years old, inclusive. To be eligible, subjects must have had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of NASH or imaging study confirmed NAFLD and an elevated serum triglyceride (>150 mg/dL) during the Screening Phase.\nAbout MN-001\nMN-001 (tipelukast) is a novel, orally bioavailable small molecule compound thought to exert its effects through several mechanisms to produce its anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic activity in preclinical models, including leukotriene (LT) receptor antagonism, inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDE) (mainly 3 and 4), and inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). The 5-LO/LT pathway has been postulated as a pathogenic factor in fibrosis development and MN-001's inhibitory effect on 5-LO and the 5-LO/LT pathway is considered to be a novel approach to treat fibrosis. MN-001 has been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote fibrosis including LOXL2, Collagen Type 1 and TIMP-1. MN-001 has also been shown to down-regulate expression of genes that promote inflammation including CCR2 and MCP-1. In addition, histopathological data shows that MN-001 reduces fibrosis in multiple animal models.\nAbout MediciNova\nMediciNova, Inc. is a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company founded upon acquiring and developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs with a primary commercial focus on the U.S. market. MediciNova's current strategy is to focus on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and substance dependence (e.g., alcohol use disorder, methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence) and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). MediciNova’s pipeline also includes MN-221 (bedoradrine) for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and MN-029 (denibulin) for solid tumor cancers. MediciNova is engaged in strategic partnering and other potential funding discussions to support further development of its programs.
