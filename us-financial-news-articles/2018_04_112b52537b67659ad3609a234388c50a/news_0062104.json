REUTERS/Carlos Barria “I think it sends the right message,” Trump told a news conference when asked if pulling out of the Iran deal would send the wrong message to Pyongyang. “You know in seven years, that deal will have expired and Iran is free to go ahead and create nuclear weapons.”\nTrump declined to say whether the United States would pull out of the nuclear deal before a May 12 deadline for a decision, saying: “We’ll see what happens.”\nBut he expressed his dissatisfaction with the pact.\n“That is just not an acceptable situation. They’re not sitting back idly. They’re setting off missiles, which they say are for television purposes. I don’t think so,” Trump said, adding, “That doesn’t mean we won’t negotiate a real agreement.”\nReporting by Roberta Rampton; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Tim Ahmann\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T22:00:29.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
