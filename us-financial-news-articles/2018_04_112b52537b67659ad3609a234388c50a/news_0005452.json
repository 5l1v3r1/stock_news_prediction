It’s the biggest stage. \n“Yeah, I’m excited about it.” \nFollowing Woods’ group out will be a threesome featuring reigning champion Sergio Garcia, another hot favourite in American world number two Justin Thomas, winner of the last major, the PGA Championship, and amateur Doc Redman. \nTwice Masters champion Bubba Watson, who arrives in Augusta in top form after winning the WGC Match Play Championship, is part of a marquee group of major champions that includes Swede Henrik Stenson, the 2016 British Open champion, and Australian Jason Day, the 2015 PGA Championship winner. \nAmong the late starters is a high profile trio featuring 2013 Masters champion Adam Scott of Australia, four time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland and big-hitting Spaniard Jon Rahm. \nPhil Mickelson, winner of five majors, including three Green Jackets, will be partnered with two players looking to make a major breakthrough in fellow Americans Rickie Fowler and Matt Kuchar. \nTwo players among the last group of the day could make an impact on the leaderboard, with Briton Justin Rose, runner-up for the Green Jacket twice in the last three years, and American world number one Dustin Johnson, eager to claim another major.
