Protestant churches are also growing fast. \nThe Global Times also verified as genuine circulating images of a notice from a community in Henan’s Anyang city that asked all religious believers to register with the authorities, citing an unnamed neighbourhood committee employee. \n“The higher religious department met with communities and asked us to make the census,” the employee told the paper. \nLegislation on religious affairs that came into effect in February has raised official oversight of religious education and practice, and introduced harsher punishments for practices not sanctioned by the authorities. \nDirect party control of religion is also being strengthened in a sweeping government reshuffle announced last month that brought religious affairs under the direct control of the United Front Work Department, in charge of co-opting non-party groups to support its interests.
