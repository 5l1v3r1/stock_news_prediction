Related Coverage U.S. not conducting air strikes in Syria 'at this time' - Pentagon \nWhen asked about the explosions, an Israeli spokeswoman declined to comment. \nIsrael has struck Syrian army locations many times in the course of the conflict, hitting convoys and bases of Iranian-backed militias that fight alongside Syrian President Bashar al Assad’s forces. \nU.S. President Donald Trump said earlier on Sunday there would be a “big price to pay” after medical aid groups reported dozens of civilians, including many children and women, were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town. \nThe United States launched a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base a year ago in response to the killing of dozens of civilians in a sarin gas attack in an opposition-held town in northwest Syria. The gas attack was blamed on Assad. \nThe U.S. missile strike was against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. \nThe Syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical attack. Russia, President Bashar al-Assad’s most powerful ally, called the reports fake.
