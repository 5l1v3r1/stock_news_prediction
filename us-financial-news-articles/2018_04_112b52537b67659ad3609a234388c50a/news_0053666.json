World number one Rafael Nadal eased into the Barcelona Open quarter-finals after dispatching compatriot Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-1 6-3 and winning a record-extending 40th consecutive set on clay.\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis - ATP - Monte Carlo Masters - Monte-Carlo Country Club, Monte Carlo, Monaco - April 22, 2018 Spain's Rafael Nadal in action during the final match against Japan's Kei Nishikori REUTERS/Eric Gaillard The top seed, who has won the tournament 10 times, will meet Slovak Martin Klizan, who had dumped Novak Djokovic out in the second round, on Friday after powering past Garcia-Lopez in a quick-fire first set.\nHe raced into a 4-1 lead in the second but was slowed down when he surrendered his serve, although he soon broke back to finish off his opponent.\n“When I was 4-1 a set up I lost a little intensity but in general I played well,” Nadal told a news conference.\n“I felt good from the start, playing with more intensity than yesterday and playing with more ease and comfort in every sense.”\nSecond seed Grigor Dimitrov survived an almighty scare against outsider Malek Jaziri to edge into the last eight, beating the Tunisian 7-5 3-6 7-6(8) following a nail-biting tiebreak.\nJaziri, ranked 88th in the world, hit back after surrendering the first set to comfortably take the second and he looked poised to cause the latest high-profile exit in Barcelona after Djokovic’s defeat and Kei Nishikori’s withdrawal through injury when he went 4-2 up against the second seed in the third.\nFILE PHOTO: Tennis -
