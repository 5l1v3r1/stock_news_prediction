(Nasdaq:EXPO) today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018.\n“Exponent continued its strong momentum from 2017 into the first quarter of 2018. We delivered double-digit revenue growth and expanded margins, while executing on our strategy to position the company for future growth. Our first quarter results benefited from positive market trends across several industries, practices and geographies, as well as the ongoing human factors project, which we have previously discussed,” commented Dr. Paul Johnston, Chief Executive Officer.\n“We are experiencing increased demand from the consumer products industry. As technologies become increasingly more complex, the need to better understand the interactivity between sophisticated products and their users grows. Recent projects include assessing virtual reality technologies, evaluating performance of autonomous vehicles, and developing artificial intelligence solutions in both proactive and reactive engagements. We are deploying additional resources in geographies outside the United States including expanding our capabilities in Asia and Europe to reach new demand pockets and continue to grow our brand globally,” concluded Dr. Johnston.\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\nTotal revenues in the first quarter of 2018 grew 15% to $96.5 million as compared to $84.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Revenues before reimbursements increased 13% to $90.7 million as compared to $80.5 million in the in the same period one year ago.\nNet income was $20.3 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $16.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, in the same period of 2017. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2016, Exponent adopted a new accounting standard 1 for the classification of tax adjustments associated with share-based awards. The tax benefit realized in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.9 million, as compared to $6.0 million in first quarter of 2017.\nInclusive of the tax benefit, Exponent’s consolidated tax rate was 9.4% in the quarter, as compared to 4.8% for the same period last year. For comparison purposes, excluding the tax benefit, Exponent’s tax rate decreased to 26.8% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 39.4% in same period last year, due to the new Tax Legislation 2 .\nEBITDA 3 increased by 25% to $23.5 million as compared to $18.7 million in the same period one year ago.\nIn the first quarter, Exponent paid $6.7 million in dividends and closed the period with $178.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.\nIn a separate press release today, Exponent announced a $0.26 quarterly dividend payment and reiterated its intent to continue to pay quarterly dividends.\nBusiness Overview\nExponent’s engineering and other scientific segment grew 13% year over year and represented approximately 79% of the Company’s first quarter net revenues. During the quarter, this segment had notable performances in its human factors, vehicle engineering, electrical engineering and polymer science practices. We continued to see strong demand for our services related to product recalls including assignments from the consumer products and automotive industries. Proactive services continued to expand as companies seek Exponent’s interdisciplinary advice throughout the product life cycle, consistent with the increased importance placed on understanding how users interact with complex technologies.\nExponent’s environmental and health segment grew 10% year over year and represented approximately 21% of the Company’s first quarter net revenues. Exponent’s scientists were engaged in human health and environmental assessments and advised clients with regulatory issues around the world. Exponent’s chemical regulation and food safety practice expanded its proactive services as society remains concerned about chemicals affecting ecosystems and human health. Consultants from this segment also continued to support the large human factors project.\nBusiness Outlook\n“Our outlook reflects positive momentum in the business, as well as the expected deceleration of the ongoing human factors assessment project in 2018. We are improving our expectations for the full year 2018. We now expect revenues before reimbursements to grow in the mid- to high- single digits and EBITDA 3 margin to decline by approximately 50 to 100 basis points, as compared to 2017. As previously discussed, we continue to believe that Exponent’s consolidated income tax rate will be approximately 22% to 23% for 2018, after including the estimated tax adjustments associated with share-based awards. This tax rate range is approximately ten percentage points lower than it would have been as a result of the new Tax Legislation, 2 ” commented Richard Schlenker, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n“On May 31, 2018, we will promote Dr. Catherine Corrigan, our current President to the role of CEO and President. I am extremely honored to have led Exponent for the past nine years, and as Chairman I look forward to supporting Catherine as I am certain that she is the right person to lead our firm into the future,” stated Dr. Johnston.\n“Exponent holds a unique market position and will continue to leverage its experience and superior reputation in reactive services to drive growth in our proactive services around the world. As we look ahead, we are confident in Exponent’s strategy to uncover growth opportunities across practices, industries and geographies. We are focused on positioning the company for long-term success, delivering strong financial results and creating value for our stakeholders.

EBITDAS is a non-­GAAP financial measure defined by the Company as EBITDA before stock-­based compensation. The Company regards EBITDA and EBITDAS as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and EBITDAS provide meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results. Generally, a non­-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These measures, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute or superior to, operating income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of the measures to GAAP is set forth below.\nAbout Exponent\nExponent is an engineering and scientific consulting firm providing solutions to complex problems.
