He stopped 27 shots in the loss.\nMason, who had played just one game in nearly three months, made 36 saves as the Jets reached the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history.\nPaul Byron pulled Montreal within 3-2 at the 3:19 mark of the third period by pouncing on a rebound for his 20th goal on the season, and then Kerby Rychel deflected a point shot at 10:15 of the third period to make it a 3-3 game. It was Rychel’s first goal of the season.\nWinnipeg regained the lead just 24 seconds later when Sami Niku netted a goal in his NHL debut, on his first career shot on goal, but again the Habs drew even when Alex Galchenyuk potted a power-play goal with 1:42 remaining in regulation.\nPatrik Laine’s 44th goal of the season on the power play opened the scoring at the 12:25 mark of the first period. Laine fired a one-timer from just beyond the left circle for his 20th man-advantage marker of the campaign, tops in the NHL.\nNikolaj Ehlers doubled the Winnipeg lead with his 29th of the season at 14:19 by finishing a give-and-go passing play with Paul Stastny.\nJack Roslovic made it a 3-0 game with a goal very similar to Laine’s at 15:58 of the second period, but the Canadiens roared back.\nArtturi Lehkonen was on the spot for a loose puck in the slot and whipped a shot past Mason with 59.3 seconds remaining in the middle frame to put the hosts on the board.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:29:56.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
