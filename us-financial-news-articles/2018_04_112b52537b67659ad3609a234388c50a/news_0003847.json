(Nasdaq: ENT) (“Global Eagle,” the “Company” or “we”), a leading provider of media, content, connectivity and data analytics to markets across air, sea and land, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2017. For the fourth quarter 2017, Global Eagle recorded revenue of $160 million; incurred a net loss of $134.4 million, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges described below; and generated Adjusted EBITDA* of $19.7 million. For the 2017 fiscal year, Global Eagle recorded revenue of $619 million; incurred a net loss of $357.1 million, primarily due to non-cash impairment charges described below; and generated Adjusted EBITDA of $68.0 million. The Company also announced last week that Searchlight Capital Partners completed the funding of its previously announced investment in Global Eagle.\n“Global Eagle had an improved finish to the year,” said Jeff Leddy, Global Eagle’s Executive Chairman. “Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA both grew on a year over year basis in the fourth quarter of 2017. The foundation we have built over the past year is beginning to drive measurable improvements in results. Our new world-class leadership team, improved operational execution and continued innovation, along with Searchlight’s investment in our company, position us well for future success.” Mr. Leddy continued, “I am proud of the steady progress we made in 2017, and am confident in our path ahead.”\nDuring 2017, Global Eagle built positive momentum across the organization. The Company integrated its air, sea and land Connectivity businesses, generating network and technology synergies. Global Eagle also initiated the integration, optimization and enhancement of its operations and technical teams. Key accounts became reference customers across all businesses. In the fourth quarter, the Company benefitted from a sequential improvement (versus the third quarter of 2017) in the Media & Content segment’s gross margins and broad growth across the Connectivity segment’s service revenue.\n“We have executed well on our objectives to integrate our Connectivity businesses and enhance operational delivery and improve our internal processes,” commented Paul Rainey, CFO of Global Eagle, “We see compelling opportunities to further integrate prior acquisitions, which we believe will continue to lower our cost structure. In 2018, we expect these improvements to lead to accelerating organic revenue growth and strong Adjusted EBITDA growth, along with an improvement in cash-flow generation.”\nFourth Quarter Summary\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $160 million, a 1.8% increase over the prior-year period. This increase was primarily driven by growth in service revenue in our Connectivity segment due to new aircraft, vessel and site additions. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $134.4 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $106 million related to our Connectivity business units, including one of our joint ventures. The decline in the Company’s market capitalization during the quarter triggered a reassessment of our impairment analysis. This resulted in, among other things, an increased discount rate in our impairment model, which in turn negatively impacted the fair value of two of our Connectivity businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $19.7 million, which was a slight increase over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA benefitted from growth in our Connectivity segment’s service revenue as mentioned above.\nFiscal Year 2017 Summary\nTotal revenue for the fiscal 2017 was $619 million, a 16.9% increase over the prior year. The increase over the prior-year period was driven by the acquisition of Emerging Markets Communications (“EMC”) in late July 2016, which generated revenue for the entire 2017 year (versus only a partial 2016 year), and growth in service revenue in our Connectivity segment due to aircraft, vessel and site additions, which was partially offset by a revenue decline in our Media & Content segment. Net loss for the fiscal 2017 was $357.1 million. During the year, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $184 million related to our Connectivity business units, including one of our joint ventures. Net loss in 2017 also increased versus 2016 due to higher full-year interest expense in 2017 and higher audit-related and professional fees incurred in 2017 related to our delayed 2016 audit. Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal 2017 was $68.0 million, a $10.5 million increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by the acquisition of EMC in late July 2016, which generated Adjusted EBITDA for the entire 2017 year, and growth in service revenue in our Connectivity segment due to aircraft, vessel and site additions, which was partially offset by a revenue decline in our Media & Content segment.\nWebcast\nGlobal Eagle will host a live webcast later today Monday, April 2, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. ET (2:00 p.m. PT).

Lopez\nVice President, Investor Relations\n+1 310-740-8624\ninvestor.relations@geemedia.com\npr@geemedia.com\n* About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as a measure of our performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other measures of our cash flows or liquidity. Further, we note that Adjusted EBITDA as presented herein is defined and calculated differently than the “Consolidated EBITDA” definition in our senior secured credit agreement, which Consolidated EBITDA definition we use for financial-covenant-compliance purposes thereunder and as a measure of our liquidity. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable measure under GAAP, please see the table entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measure” at the end of this release.\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our financial performance and operating trends, including period to period comparisons, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long term operational plans. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is one of the primary measures used by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors to establish the funding targets for (and subsequent funding of) our Annual Incentive Plan bonuses for our employees and executives. We believe our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors both because it allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and because our management frequently uses it in discussions with investors, commercial bankers, securities analysts and other users of our financial statements.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before (a) interest expense (income), (b) income tax expense (benefit) and (c) depreciation and amortization (including relating to equity-method investments) and loss on disposal and impairment of fixed assets, and we then further adjust that result to exclude (1) change in fair value of financial instruments, (2) other (income) expense, including primarily, when applicable, (gains) losses from investments and foreign-currency-transaction (gains) losses, (3) goodwill impairment expense, (4) stock-based compensation expense, (5) strategic-transaction, integration and realignment expenses (as described below), (6) auditor and related third-party professional fees and expenses related to our internal-control deficiencies (and the remediation thereof) and delays in our 2016 audit process, (7) excess content expenses (as described below), (8) securities class-action expenses (as described below), (9) losses on significant customer bankruptcies (as described below) and (10) restructuring expenses pursuant to our September 2014 integration plan (when applicable in the period). Management does not consider these items to be indicative of our core operating results.\n“Excess content expenses” includes the additional purchasing costs that we incurred in 2017 to procure movie content for our customers, notwithstanding that we could have procured equivalent content under our (preferential-pricing) output arrangements with major studios. We incurred these additional costs because we could not timely identify and measure our movie-content expenditures and procurement during the period due to weaknesses in our control environment.\n“Losses on significant customer bankruptcies” includes (1) our provision for bad debt associated with the bankruptcies of Air Berlin and Alitalia (two of our Media & Content customers) in 2017, together with (2) the costs ( e.g ., content acquisition fees) that we incurred to maintain service to those customers during their bankruptcy proceedings in order to preserve the customer relationship.\n“Securities class-action expenses” includes third-party professional fees and expenses associated with the securities class-action lawsuits filed against us in 2017.\n“Strategic-transaction, integration and realignment expenses” includes (1) transaction-related expenses and costs (including third-party professional fees) attributable to acquisition, financing, investment and other strategic-transaction activities, (2) integration and realignment expenses and allowances, (3) employee-severance, retention and relocation expenses, (4) purchase-accounting adjustments for deferred revenue, costs and credits associated with companies and businesses that we have acquired through our M&A activities, (5) service-level-agreement penalties incurred during our Eagle-1 migration and setup in its new orbital slot in 2017, and (6) claims at companies or businesses that we acquired through our M&A activities for underlying liabilities that pre-dated our acquisition of those companies or businesses. In respect of clause (6) in this definition, we include ( i.e ., exclude from net income (loss)) any estimated loss contingencies and provisions for legal settlements relating to those liabilities.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release may constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
