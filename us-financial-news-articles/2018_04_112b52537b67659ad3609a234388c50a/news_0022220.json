Nevertheless, the probe has become a thorny issue for the president. \nAfter the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided the offices of Trump’s personal lawyer on Monday, based partly on a referral by Mueller, Trump called the investigation “a disgrace” and suggested he may consider firing the special counsel. \nOn Wednesday, four senators announced they would merge two different proposals to protect the office of the special counsel. The original bills were introduced last summer. \nIf passed, the legislation would allow the special counsel to be fired only “for good cause” by a senior Justice Department official, with a reason given in writing; provide recourse if the special counsel was fired without good cause; and preserve the staffing and materials of a pending investigation. \n“We need to ensure not only that Special Counsel Mueller can complete his work without interference, but that special counsels in future investigations can, too,” Democratic Senator Chris Coons, one of the sponsors of the bill, said in a statement. Related Coverage Nationwide protests planned if Trump fires Mueller or Rosenstein \nIt was unclear whether the proposed law would pass. \nOn Tuesday, the Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said that while he thought Mueller should be allowed to continue his probe, he did not think legislation to protect him was necessary. \nMcConnell’s spokesperson declined to comment on Wednesday. \nIt also remains unclear whether the proposal could pass the House or that Trump would approve it. \nSpokespeople for McConnell and the White House did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comments.
