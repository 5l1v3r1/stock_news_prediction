And there have been gains in the trust of people and businesses,” said Paul Noumba Um, World Bank country director for South Africa.\n“That said, inequality, poverty and unemployment are big challenges. South Africa is the most unequal economy in the world today,” he told a news conference in Johannesburg.\nThe World Bank’s predictions are more pessimistic than those of the finance ministry, which is targeting growth of at least 1.5 percent in 2018, and ratings agencies such as S&P Global.\nThe World Bank forecast growth of 1.8 percent next year and 1.9 percent in 2020 but said that would be insufficient to meaningfully reduce poverty or dent the 27 percent unemployment rate ZAUNR=ECI.\nUnder Zuma’s watch, unemployment rose and the economy stagnated as businesses were reluctant to invest, and South Africa has consistently failed to achieve the government’s growth target of 5 percent.\nSebastien Dessus, the World Bank’s program leader for South Africa, said reaching 5 percent growth was not realistic in the near term. He highlighted better education, fighting corruption and restoring policy certainty in mining as factors which could boost the economy.\nWorld Bank country director Noumba Um said that if South Africa could achieve 3 percent growth, “that would be a significant achievement.”\nEditing by James Macharia and Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:57:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
