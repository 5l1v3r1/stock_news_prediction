In a bid to appeal to regulators and to attract a broad range of suitors, the European assets have been split into two alternative bundles, only one of which would be sold, the sources said. \nJapan’s Taiyo Nippon Sanso ( 4091.T ) is also still in the auction and expected to bid for the European operations, while the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) is expected to join a bidder as a co-investor, the sources said. \nLinde, Praxair and the bidders declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. \nLinde and Praxair are hoping they can strike a deal before a Oct. 24 deadline, which is dictated by German financial market regulations. \nEU antitrust regulators have set a deadline of Aug. 9 to decide whether to give their go-ahead. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also not yet cleared the transaction. \nThe exact size of asset sales has not yet been finalised in negotiations with antitrust regulators. \nBut broad lines have become clear: Linde and Praxair are planning to divest assets with about $800 million in combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, sources said, adding they expect them to sell at an enterprise value of 10-12 times that, broadly in line with peers’ valuations. \nAir Liquide and Air Products have antitrust-related limitations to participate in the auction but may scoop up small parts, the sources said. \nFinding buyers for the assets would smoothe the regulatory path to clearance for the merger. It comes in the wake of Bayer ( BAYGn.DE ) agreeing to large divestitures to peer BASF ( BASFn.DE ) to get the antitrust nod for its planned acquisition of Monsanto. \nLinde and Praxair had said last year that either party could walk away or seek to renegotiate the merger agreement if divestitures reach more than 3.7 billion euros in total revenues or 1.1 billion euros in combined core earnings (EBITDA). \n($1 = 0.8037 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T18:57:00.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
