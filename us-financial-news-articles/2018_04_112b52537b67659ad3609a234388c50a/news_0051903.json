U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is welcomed by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at a NATO foreign ministers meeting at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels, April 27, 2018\nThe meeting, a preview to the leaders' summit in July, will discuss Russia's role in Ukraine and Syria , as well as plans for increasing security along Europe's southern frontier. Pompeo, known as a loyal supporter of Donald Trump with hawkish world views, will also press members of the alliance to increase their military budgets to meet a target of 2 percent of economic output on defence every year by 2024.\nMeanwhile in Washington, Germany's Angela Merkel will no doubt hear a similar message on defence spending from Trump himself. She will be there for an altogether shorter and more matter-of-fact encounter than the lavish state visit accorded to France's Emmanuel Macron , who for now at least appears to be Trump's favoured partner in Europe.\nMerkel has few illusions about what the trip can achieve. Like Macron, she will press Trump not to rip up the 2015 Iran nuclear accord by reimposing sanctions on May 12, and she will make a last-minute push for Europe to be exempted from U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs due to kick in on May 1.\nHowever on Iran, there is a growing expectation that Trump will push ahead with the sanctions regardless; and on trade, Merkel will make clear that Germany wants it to be as free as possible but will not hesitate to respond if the U.S. goes down a more protectionist route.\nBritain's Q1 growth figure due out at 0830 GMT will largely be seen through the prism of whether it makes an interest rate hike in May - now pretty much a 50-50 bet - more or less likely.\nThe UK economy probably slowed in the first three months of 2018, due in part to the heavy snowfalls of February and March . The Bank of England was expected to ignore any weather-related weakness in the numbers and press ahead with an interest rate hike in May.\nBut last week BoE Governor Mark Carney said economic data had been mixed, causing investors to rethink their assumptions. A reading weaker than the expected quarterly growth of 0.3 percent in Friday’s figures would add to the shift in expectations away from a May rate hike.\nMARKETS\nIs this a Berlin Wall moment? Only time will tell but pictures of North Korea’s Kim Jong Un walking across the DMZ and shaking hands with his South Korean counterpart are among the things lifting market mood this morning. German Chancellor Angela Merkel walks back to her hotel after going out for a walk and dinner shortly after arriving in Washington,, April 26, 2018\nKorean shares are at one-month highs and the won jumped half a percent to the dollar. Asian stocks in general are up 0.8 percent. But there are a few other factors too that are bolstering markets. The Bank of Japan for instance removed the time horizon for achieving its 2 percent inflation target , moving to an open ended commitment and cutting its inflation forecast for the year to 1.3 percent. “Advertising is an important and very profitable bucket of revenue for Amazon and is also growing at a fast rate. They are just getting started here” D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte\nThen there is tech. U.S. shares closed one percent higher on Thursday on back of a 9 percent jump in Facebook and forecast- beating results from other tech firms and chipmakers. Amazon meanwhile rose strongly in aftermarkets after a 43 percent surge in revenue. That helped tech stocks rebound off two-week lows. Asian tech is doing great too – Baidu the latest to beat forecasts , following on from Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors earlier.\nTen-year U.S. bond yields meanwhile have retreated off 3 percent after goods orders data showed the economy is growing steadily but not firing from all cylinders. The final reading of U.S. Q1 GDP is due later today. The Russian central bank meets and is unlikely to cut rates as was previously expected due to the possible impact of new sanctions on inflation.\nThe dollar is set for its biggest weekly gain since early February after a steep run up to 3-1/2 month highs against a basket of the most traded currencies. With ECB chief Mario Draghi signalling accommodative policy will continue and warning the bank would not hesitate to act in event of “unwanted or unwarranted tightening in conditions” the single currency fell to a fresh 3-1/2 month low to the dollar of $1.211.\nDraghi also batted away the recent softness in euro zone data but today’s French data showed the euro zone’s second biggest economy grew just 0.3 percent in Q1, the slowest rate since Q3 2016, more or less confirming the recovery has come up against a wall.\nBets are sure to grow that the ECB will have to push back the timing to end its bond buying. Anyway, with the ECB and BOJ out of the way, attention will turn to next week’s Fed meeting. No change is expected. In terms of other data, there is German unemployment and UK Q1 GDP – the latter may provide direction to sterling which has slumped below $1.40 to six week lows as bets on a May rate rise have been pared right back.\nEuropean equities are set to end the week with a flourish. The STOXX600 is up 0.1 and on track for its fifth week of gains in a row, rivalling last September’s winning streak and the FTSE is up marginally as well.\n— A look at the day ahead from European Economics and Politics Editor Mark John and deputy EMEA markets editor Sujata Rao.
