He said IBM's stock slid 7 percent on Wednesday after its earnings beat because half of the company has the wrong tech.\nForty-seven percent of IBM's business is \"right,\" he acknowledged: it focuses on the cloud, blockchain, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\nBut IBM's incumbent businesses have money managers worried, so much so that they think IBM's spending patterns could stymie its growth trajectory.\n\"These money managers are all about identifying companies with the best growth prospects,\" Cramer said. \"As far as they're concerned, IBM's big dividend is a big red flag. It's a sign that the company doesn't have the opportunities or the DNA, perhaps, to invest in the future, even as IBM spends a fortune on R&D.\"\nThe collapse of Acacia Buchachon | Getty Images The major averages may be having a strong week , but CNBC's Jim Cramer also noticed a big collapse that needed to be addressed: the pain in the stock of Acacia Communications .\nShares of Acacia lost 35 percent of their value on Monday after the Commerce Department ruled to ban U.S. companies from selling components to Chinese phone equipment company ZTE for seven years.\n\"Here's what drives me nuts about this story. We've known this was a risk all along, people,\" the Cramer said.\nAcacia, an optical networking equipment maker, came public in 2016. In 2017, the company got roughly 70 percent of its sales from just five companies, with nearly a third coming from ZTE.\n\"Do not get me wrong, it is fine to speculate in high-risk stocks — you know I think that way, although I haven't liked Acacia for quite some time — but if you're going to take that kind of chance, at the very least, you need to be aware of the risks you're facing,\" Cramer said.\nWith that in mind, Cramer went over the warning signs he saw over the years that culminated in Acacia's massive Monday drop.\nBucking Wall Street's bank thesis Getty Images Bank customers use ATMs at a Chase Bank branch in New York City. Cramer sees a thesis building that loan growth is stagnant , loan demand is collapsing and the banks are unwilling to lend — and he isn't buying it .\n\"That's the downbeat consensus investors have cobbled together over the last few days after hearing from all the big banks and no one's bothering to dispute it,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"That's why the bank stocks have stalled and are going lower.\"\nThis is happening despite the pervasive narrative that the U.S. economy is growing , stimulated by the government's tax overhaul and increasing consumer spending, Cramer said.\nAnd in the latest earnings reports from Citigroup , Bank of America and J.P. Morgan , the big banks forecast low-single-digit loan growth, which Cramer saw as steady and responsible.\nCyrusOne CEO talks limited China risk Scott Mlyn | CNBC Gary Wojtaszek, CEO, CyrusOne The real estate investment trust stocks may be struggling, but Gary Wojtaszek, the president and CEO of data center REIT CyrusOne , told CNBC he's seeing strength on the horizon.\n\"The only thing we can control is our execution, and as you saw in the fourth quarter, we continue to put up really big numbers,\" he told Cramer on Wednesday , highlighting his company's 31 percent rise in revenue. \"Over time, people are going to recognize that that'll eventually pay off.\"\nCyrusOne, which boasts clients like Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle, has been expanding globally as well, recently acquiring the largest private data center company with operations in London and Frankfurt.\nBut Wojtaszek wasn't worried about heightened tensions between the United States and China, either.\n\"A lot of the stuff that they're talking about are not really that data-focused, and so I don't really think it's going to hit us,\" the CEO said. \"[Chinese data center operator] GDS is a company we bought. They're up dramatically. We've more than doubled our return on that investment in a couple months.\"\nRevance Therapeutics CEO on competing with Botox Competing with a biotechnology giant like Allergan doesn't spook Revance Therapeutics co-founder, President and CEO Dan Browne, whose company is developing injectable therapies that compete with Allergan's flagship product, Botox.\nBrowne told Cramer on Wednesday that his competing treatment, which is slated for release in 2020, could eventually reach the heights that Botox has reached under Allergan's control.\n\"This has been a passion for Revance for 15 years,\" the CEO said. \"We think with scale, we'll have the same margins as the existing commercial leader, the market leader in the Botox brand.\"\nBrowne was also confident in keeping his development-stage biotechnology company afloat until the flagship product's 2020 launch.\n\"Look, I don't think you're ever as funded in biotech as much as you want to be, but I think at this point, we're very well capitalized, we see a number of catalysts that as we go forward,\" Browne said. \"Whether we partner, whether we don't partner, [we feel] that we'll be able to raise the capital we need to launch this product.\"\nLightning round: Stop the waterworks and invest in AWK In Cramer's lightning round , he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks:\nAmerican Water Works Company : \"Always liked it. Good growth. Consistent company. Nothing the matter with that. I'd say it's a buy. It's been a buy since we started the show.\"\nKratos Defense & Security Solutions : \"Now, Kratos has been in a crossfire. There's longs and shorts. We recommended it lower. It's a battleground stock. I don't want to be in a battleground. Sell.\"\nDisclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Citigroup and J.P.
