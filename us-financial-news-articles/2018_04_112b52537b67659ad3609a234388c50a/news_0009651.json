(Nasdaq: WSBC) (\"WesBanco\"), a diversified, multi-state bank holding company, and First Sentry Bancshares, Inc. (OTC Pink: FTSB) (\"First Sentry\"), a bank holding company with total assets of approximately $0.8 billion and headquartered in Huntington, WV, jointly announced today the consummation of WesBanco's acquisition of First Sentry, as well as the appointment of Geoffrey Sheils as WesBanco's Market President for Huntington and the surrounding area. Todd F. Clossin, President and Chief Executive Officer, of WesBanco and Geoffrey S. Sheils, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Sentry, made the joint announcement.\nThe merger, which was previously announced on November 13, 2017, was approved by all appropriate regulatory agencies, and, on February 9, 2018, by the shareholders of First Sentry. Under the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, First Sentry's shareholders are to receive 1.5869 shares of WesBanco for each share of First Sentry common stock held. In addition, First Sentry's Chairman of the Board, Robert H. Beymer, will become Chairman of the Huntington market advisory board for WesBanco, which will be comprised of the First Sentry board members to help ensure a smooth transition in the local market.\nTodd Clossin, President and Chief Executive Officer of WesBanco, stated, \"We are pleased to welcome the customers and employees of First Sentry to the WesBanco family. We look forward to providing our newest customers with a broader array of banking services, including expanded commercial and mortgage lending capabilities as well as trust and wealth management services. This merger fits perfectly with our strategic growth plans as it combines two institutions with solid credit quality and a strong focus on client service and community banking.\"\n\"We are excited to become part of the team at WesBanco, and believe this partnership will benefit our customers and community,\" said Geoffrey Sheils, former President and Chief Executive Officer of First Sentry Bancshares and WesBanco's new Market President. \"This merger provides our customers with enhanced products and services that have long been strengths of WesBanco, as well as new and expanded opportunities for our employees. WesBanco's nearly 150 year history of demonstrated success as a community bank makes WesBanco the ideal partner for First Sentry.\"\nRobert H. Beymer, Chairman of the Board of First Sentry Bancshares, added, \"We welcome WesBanco as our new partner in the community, and look forward to the additional resources and services which will greatly benefit our clients, employees, and community.\"\nFormer branches of First Sentry Bank will continue to operate under the First Sentry Bank name until later in the summer of 2018, when they will be transitioned to WesBanco Bank in conjunction with the data processing and signage conversion. Subsequent to the conversion date, First Sentry customers will continue to conduct their regular banking transactions at First Sentry Bank's former banking locations.\nWesBanco's merger with First Sentry, which enhances WesBanco's position in the attractive Huntington, WV MSA and bridges its existing Charleston, WV and southeastern Ohio markets, creates a multi-state bank holding company of approximately $10.6 billion in total assets providing banking and wealth management services through 177 financial centers in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.
