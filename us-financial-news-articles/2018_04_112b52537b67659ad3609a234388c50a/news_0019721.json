McCullers labored throughout with his control, issuing six walks over 3 2/3 innings, with half of that total coming in his final frame of work, including two in succession on eight pitches to open the fourth.\nKepler, Byron Buxton and Joe Mauer all reached via walks against McCullers, and all three came around to score. Shortstop Ehire Adrianza plated Kepler with an RBI single; Buxton followed when Brian Dozier reached on an infield hit. Mauer came home as Eddie Rosario cleared the bases with a triple, pushing the Twins to a 5-1 lead. Three batters later, Kepler hit his second home run on the season and McCullers was gone after throwing 95 pitches, just 48 for strikes.\nBut Twins starter Kyle Gibson squandered the run support, allowing four of the five batters he faced in the fifth inning to reach base as the Astros (9-4) initiated their comeback. Jose Altuve, Evan Gattis and Max Stassi recorded run-scoring hits, with Gattis greeting reliever Trevor Hildenberger with a two-run single on the first pitch of their confrontation. Gibson departed having allowed five runs on seven hits and four walks with four strikeouts over 4 1/3 innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:20:15.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
