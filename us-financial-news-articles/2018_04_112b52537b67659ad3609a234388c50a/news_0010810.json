REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo \nMothercare, a popular British high street name, has been trying to revive its business that has come under pressure from weak footfall across retail destinations and tough competition from online sellers. \nThe company has devised strategies on new store formats, online business and better product offering to turn around its business after years of slowing sales. \n“We have made positive progress but it is essential that we have the most effective leadership in place to meet our ambitions,” Chairman Alan Parker said in the statement. \nWood was formerly group president of U.S.-based Kmart Holding Corp. Wood, with his track record for turning around and growing retail businesses, has also worked with Britain’s largest supermarket group Tesco ( TSCO.L ), Mothercare said. \nIn March, the company warned that its full-year profit would likely come in at the lower end of its already slashed guidance and that its lenders had agreed to defer testing of financial covenants.
