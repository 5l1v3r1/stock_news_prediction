In recent years, however, campaigners for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights have become increasingly vocal.\n“It’s appalling, it’s a shame ... Kenyans will view the film whether it has been banned or not, they will find a way to view it,” Lorna Dias, a lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights activist, told Reuters.\n“In fact, Ezekiel Mutua has probably created enough of a platform to make even the least interested people curious.”\nThe ban coincides with a landmark case brought by gay rights campaigners to repeal Kenya’s law on gay sex on the grounds that it deprives sexual minorities of basic rights.\nThe film is adapted from an award-winning short story “Jambula Tree” by Ugandan writer Monica Arac de Nyeko.\nThe film board used a hashtag, #KFCBbansLesbianFilm, that immediately sparked a barrage of supportive tweets from Kenyans who decried homosexuality. In 2015, the board banned the film “Fifty Shades of Grey”.
