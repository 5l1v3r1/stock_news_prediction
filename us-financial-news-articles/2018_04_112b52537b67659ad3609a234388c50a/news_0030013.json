Tesla employs thousands of workers in Fremont where it makes its Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles.\nTesla, which has been under pressure to ramp up the production and delivery of its Model 3 electric sedan, disputed each of Reveal's findings in the report, including with a company blog post on Monday.\nTesla Chief People Officer Gaby Toledano, and its Vice President for Environment, Health and Safety, Laurie Shelby, gave interviews to Reveal suggesting that any past safety problems at the company have been resolved through a mix of employee training programs and process improvements. Shelby said she was confident the company was accurate in its reporting of worker injuries.\nAs part of this investigation, reporters Will Evans and Alyssa Jeong Perry spent months collecting and evaluating Occupational Safety and Health Administration injury and illness records, as well as workers' compensation, fire and 911 call records.\nDozens of current and former Fremont factory workers, including safety experts, were interviewed, and internal Tesla records obtained from sources.\nMusk tweeted on Friday, \"Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\"\nRead the full Reveal report here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T06:10:22.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
