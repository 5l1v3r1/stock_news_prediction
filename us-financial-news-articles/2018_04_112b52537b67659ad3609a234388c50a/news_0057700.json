File Photo: President of InterGlobe Aviation Limited Aditya Ghosh holds a memento during the company's listing ceremony at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in Mumbai, India, November 10, 2015. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui\nThe airline’s board will in the coming months consider naming Gregory Taylor, an airline sector veteran, as its president and chief executive officer, pending approvals.\nTaylor - who had an earlier stint with IndiGo and also worked in senior management roles at United Airlines and US Airways - will join IndiGo initially as a senior adviser, reporting to the airline’s co-founder Rahul Bhatia.\nBhatia is taking the role of interim CEO, the airline said in a statement.\nGhosh has resigned as a director of InterGlobe effective April 26, the airline said.\nNeither the airline nor Ghosh cited a reason for his departure, but the statement quoted Ghosh saying he would embark on his “next adventure” some time in the near future. It did not elaborate.\nFounded in 2006 by travel entrepreneur Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal, a former chief executive of U.S. Airways, low-cost IndiGo has grown rapidly to become India’s largest airline with a market share of 39.7 percent as of end-March.\nGhosh, a trained lawyer, joined the company in 2008.\nIndiGo has also placed a series of aggressive orders for Airbus ( AIR.PA ) jets to become one of its leading global customers. It operates more than 1000 flights daily.
