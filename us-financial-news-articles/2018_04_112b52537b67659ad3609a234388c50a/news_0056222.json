(Nasdaq:MRUS), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative bispecific antibody therapeutics (Biclonics®), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a corporate and clinical update.\n“The momentum that we have built throughout 2017 continues to yield meaningful progress for our pipeline of potential best-in-class bispecific antibody candidates,” said Ton Logtenberg, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “We already have had a productive start to the year with the initiation of patient dosing in a Phase 2 combination trial of our most advanced bispecific antibody, MCLA-128, in two metastatic breast cancer (MBC) populations and we anticipate formulating a clinical development path for MCLA-128 in certain of our other solid tumor indications among gastric, ovarian, endometrial and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, we anticipate milestones for our other proprietary programs, MCLA-117 and MCLA-158, during the year.”\n“We also are committed to expanding the potential of our Biclonics® technology platform and leveraging our highly productive functional cell-based screening of numerous combinations of Biclonics®. Our functional screening has allowed Merus to forge strategic collaborations with leading biopharma companies, including Incyte Corporation and Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, as well as to expand our existing relationship with Ono Pharmaceuticals. These agreements highlight the broad potential application of Biclonics® in immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases.”\nRecent Clinical & Corporate Developments\nPatient Dosing Commenced in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial of MCLA-128 in Two Metastatic Breast Cancer Populations - Merus announced in January 2018 that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center international clinical trial to evaluate MCLA-128 in combination with current standards of care in two MBC populations, including HER2-positive MBC patients and hormone receptor positive/HER2-low MBC patients. MCLA-128 was advanced into Phase 2 following promising single-agent activity observed in heavily-pretreated patients treated in a Phase 1/2 trial.\nEntered Strategic Collaboration with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group for Three Bispecific Antibodies – In January 2018, Merus agreed to lead research and antibody generation of three bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform and granted Simcere Pharmaceutical Group an exclusive license to develop and commercialize in China those bispecific antibodies in the area of immuno-oncology. Merus has retained all rights outside of China. Simcere is responsible for Investigational New Drug Application (IND)-enabling studies and manufacturing of clinical trial materials in China, which Merus intends to use to assist regulatory filing and early stage clinical development in the rest of the world.\nMerus Entered into a New Global License with Ono Pharmaceuticals for Bispecific Antibodies Targeting Autoimmune Diseases - Merus announced in March 2018 that Ono Pharmaceuticals Co., LTD. exercised its option under an agreement executed in April 2014 to enter into a new research and license agreement utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform to generate a bispecific antibody that binds to a combination of targets designed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.\nClosed $55.8 Million in Private Placement - In February 2018, Merus closed a $55.8 million private placement of 3.1 million common shares with a syndicate of new and existing investors, including Biotechnology Value Fund L.P. and certain of its affiliates, Aquilo Capital Management LLC, Sofinnova Venture Partners L.P., and LSP Life Sciences Fund N.V. Proceeds from the offering will be used to continue to fund Merus’ product candidates in clinical and preclinical development, as well as for general corporate purposes.\nIND Accepted by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MCLA-117 and Merus Obtains Patent Issuance on MCLA-117 - Merus received FDA acceptance of its IND for MCLA-117 in February 2018 and the Company plans to open trial sites in the U.S. for its ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In March, Merus also obtained issuance of its first U.S. patent covering MCLA-117, and certain other Merus Biclonics® that engage T-cells with tumor cells by targeting CD3.\nMerus Prevailed in its Patent Challenge against Regeneron - In December 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc.’s request for a rehearing and rehearing en banc to reconsider its decision affirming that Regeneron engaged in inequitable conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office while prosecuting the U.S. Patent No. 8,502,018 (the ‘018 patent), which it had asserted against Merus. The decision to deny Regeneron’s request further validated the thorough opinions previously issued by the trial court and Federal Circuit panel on matters related to the ’018 patent.\nAnticipated 2018 Milestones\nMCLA-128, an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced Biclonics® that binds to HER2 and HER3-expressing solid tumor cells\nThe Phase 1/2 study evaluating single agent activity for MCLA-128 in gastric, ovarian, endometrial and NSCLC patients is ongoing and Merus expects to formulate its clinical development plans for certain of these indications based on emerging data from this study in the second half of 2018.\nMCLA-117, a Biclonics® that binds to CD3 and CLEC12A\nMerus is continuing its dose escalation of the Phase 1 clinical trial for MCLA-117 in Europe and the Company plans to open sites for the Phase 1 trial in the U.S. Safety and potential early activity data is expected in 2018.\nMCLA-158, an ADCC-enhanced Biclonics® designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing Lgr5 and EGFR\nMerus has received approval of a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in several European countries for MCLA-158 for the potential treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, including patients with the RAS-mutation, which represent a substantial unmet need. The Company expects to dose the first patient in the second quarter of 2018. Merus also filed an IND for MCLA-158 with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 and plans to open trial sites in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018.\nMCLA-145, a Biclonics® designed to bind to PD-L1 and a second undisclosed immunomodulatory target\nIND-enabling studies for MCLA-145, the first drug candidate co-developed under the Merus and Incyte global research collaboration, are ongoing. Merus has full rights to develop and commercialize MCLA-145 in the U.S. and Incyte is responsible for its development and commercialization outside the U.S.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was €3.8 million compared to €(0.4) million for the same period in 2016.
