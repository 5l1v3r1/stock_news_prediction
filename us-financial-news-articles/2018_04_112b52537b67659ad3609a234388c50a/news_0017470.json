(NASDAQ: SSC) (\"SSC\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that as part of its overall strategy to bolster its US-based management team, the Company has engaged an executive recruitment search firm to assist in finding a US-based Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\").\nOn April 11, SSC's Board of Directors unanimously appointed Finance Director Jason Wu to assume the role of interim CFO and principal accounting officer of the Company, effective immediately.\nMr. Jason Wu, in the interim, will be replacing former CFO, Simon Wang. Mr. Wang's resignation as Chief Financial Officer was not because of any disagreement with the Company known to any executive officer of the Company, on any matter related to the Company's operations, policies, or practices. The Company and the Board of Directors would like to thank Mr. Wang for his contributions to Seven Stars Cloud and wish him the best in his future endeavors.\nOnce the search for a new US-based CFO is complete, Mr. Jason Wu will help support the transition of the finance and accounting functions to the new CFO and then return to his position as Finance Director, based out of Beijing.\nAbout Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc.
