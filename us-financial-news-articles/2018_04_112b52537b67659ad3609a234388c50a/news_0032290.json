Initial sympathy for the new arrivals soon turned to alarm as their numbers mounted. \nThat flow has since slowed to a trickle. But Kurz won last year’s election with a hard line on immigration, pledging to cut refugees’ benefits and fight radical Islamism. \nWednesday’s bill, which now must be passed by parliament, would push to 10 years from the current six the time refugees must wait to become citizens. That will bring the requirement in line with rules that apply to most people, the government said. \nSome of the other measures were similar to those taken elsewhere in Europe - Denmark enacted measures in 2016 that included confiscating the valuables of refugees to pay for their stay. Austria would only seize cash - up to 840 euros ($1,040) - as do neighbouring Germany and Switzerland. \nOthers measures were more original. One would force hospitals to tell the government when asylum seekers will be discharged, to ensure “more effective preparation and implementation of deportations”, a government summary said. \nSeizing phones is a way to establish people’s identity or determine where they had been. But Heinz-Christian Strache, the far-right vice chancellor, said any evidence on the phones that crimes had been committed should also be handed over to the authorities. \nRights groups and the opposition called many of the measures illegal or excessive. \n“The only thing this bill achieves is to create more uncertainty and mistrust among the population,” Amnesty International said in a statement on Monday as details of the bill were emerging. \n“Displaced people are being lumped together by this government ... as cheats or as a security risk. This is not only wrong, it is also dangerous for our peaceful cohabitation,” it said.
