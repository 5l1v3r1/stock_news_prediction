Chris Van Wyk/via REUTERS \nIt is also now officially among the most endangered. \nThe “punk turtle” was this week ranked 29th on the Zoological Society of London’s Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered list, triggering calls for better protection of the reptile found in a remote part of Australia’s east coast. \n“You have to go back about 50 million years to find a closely related species,” said Marilyn Connell, a researcher at Australia’s Charles Darwin University. \n“It would be a failure if we let this animal that walked alongside dinosaurs become extinct.” A Mary River Turtle looks on in Queensland, Australia, in this 2008 photo obtained from social media.

Its distinctive hairdo is actually algae that grow on its head. \nAcademic research was hampered in 1974 when traders refused to reveal the habitat of what were then known as “Penny Turtles” after Australia outlawed the practice of keeping them as pets. \nNearly 20 years later, John Cann, a Sydney-based turtle enthusiast, rediscovered the turtle in the Mary River in Queensland. It was classified as a new species.
