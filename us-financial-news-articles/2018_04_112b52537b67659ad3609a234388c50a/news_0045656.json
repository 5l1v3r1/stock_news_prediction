IBA estimates that only 5.7 percent of the population has dealings with the banking sector. \nThe bank hopes to capitalize on its branch network - the third largest in the country - to double its balance sheet over the next two years, Ahmed said by telephone. \nA majority of households in the country of 30 million shun interest-based finance, partly for religious reasons. \nThe central bank issued a regulatory framework for Islamic banking in 2015 to address this, with rules based on standards issued by the Bahrain-based Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions. \nIBA’s current products include a mudaraba savings account, a form of investment management partnership, as well as financing products based on ijara, an installment-based leasing contract. \nIt plans to introduce wealth management products and launch new digital banking services in coming months, Ahmed added. \nIslamic banking has been offered in Afghanistan by a handful of firms through so-called Islamic windows, but there have been no full-fledged Islamic banks which are common in countries such as Malaysia, Pakistan and Bahrain. \nLenders with Islamic windows include Afghan United Bank, Ghazanfar Bank and Afghanistan International Bank.
