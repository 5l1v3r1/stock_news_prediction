The logo of Uber is seen on an iPad, during a news conference to announce Uber resumes ride-hailing service, in Taipei, Taiwan April 13, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/Files \nUber was initially set to end its services by April 8 in Singapore after a deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to rival Grab. \nLast week, Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) commenced investigation into the transaction and proposed interim measures that will require Uber and Grab to maintain their pre-transaction independent pricing. \nThe regulator said on Friday that it received a set of alternative interim measures from Grab and Uber. \n“CCCS is reviewing the parties’ submissions in relation to the interim measures directions, including the proposed alternative interim measures,” it said. \nThe firms have agreed to push back the shutdown of Uber’s app to allow CCCS’s deliberation on their representations and proposed measures, the regulator added.
