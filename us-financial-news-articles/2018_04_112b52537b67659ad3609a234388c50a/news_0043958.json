Citi declined to comment. \nMerlon produced around 7,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 from more than 50 wells in the El Fayum region, 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of Cairo, according to its website. \nEl Fayum has estimated recoverable resources of 125-150 million barrels and had produced around 18 million barrels by the end of last year. \nThe development concession was awarded in 2004 and the lease could be extended until 2040. \nInterest in Egypt’s oil and gas sector has risen in recent years following a number of large gas offshore discoveries and economic reforms in the country. \nBP is also seeking buyers for its stake in a 50-year-old onshore oil and gas business in Egypt as it focuses on newer deepwater gas fields off the country’s Mediterranean coast.
