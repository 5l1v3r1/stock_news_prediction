Uncertainty in the Italian market due to the expiration of the feed-in-tariff has created challenges with our core distributed wind business.

Continued commitment to advancing orders for our distributed wind and developing energy storage projects.\nBARRE, Vt., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northern Power Systems Corp. (TSX:NPS), a next generation renewable energy and energy storage technology company, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and 2017.\nWe are pleased to report that in 2017 we had our first break-even year with approximately $40M in revenue and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $0.8 million, including WEG related royalties. This included approximately $5.5 million in recurring revenues from our services business and the remainder of revenues were from sales of our distributed wind turbines. Wind turbine sales were driven primarily by strong sales in the Italian market in advance of an expiring Italian feed-in-tariff. As a result of regulatory and political inaction, the Italian feed-in-tariff for distributed wind that drove sales in 2017 expired on June 30, 2017 without extension. Uncertainty regarding the status of a new feed-in-tariff and prolonged delays surrounding the drafting, approval, adoption and ultimately the implementation of a new feed-in-tariff regime in Italy for distributed wind, together with uncertainty surrounding the Italian election and government, has brought sales of our distributed wind products in Italy to a standstill. Accordingly, we will be restructuring operations to maintain manufacturing activity consistent with current market conditions. We plan to commence a manufacturing run to satisfy current orders and a limited number of anticipated orders. Following the completion of this batch manufacturing run, we have determined that current circumstances dictate that it would be prudent in the context of the company’s long-term financial position to temporarily suspend full-scale distributed wind manufacturing activities until the third quarter of 2018 which is in advance of the expected implementation of the new Italian feed-in-tariff in the fourth quarter of 2018. With this transition to batch manufacturing in mind, among other measures, we have taken steps to reduce our workforce through a temporary furlough process as well as reducing the number of hours worked by certain employees. We anticipate that with the expected implementation of the new feed-in-tariff in the fourth quarter of 2018, Italy, once again, will be a robust market for our distributed wind turbines. During the manufacturing hiatus, we will continue to market and sell our distributed wind products across the globe and orders will be slotted for production commencing in the third quarter of 2018.\nDespite the significant slowdown in our distributed wind business, we continue to see increasing activity in our energy storage business. During 2016 we commenced selling our power converters into the developing battery energy storage market. In 2017, we implemented a strategy to independently develop energy storage projects in the U.S., allowing the company to sell and incorporate our power converters and related technology into new projects that we identify. Currently, we have two sites under control, one of which is under active development, and a pipeline of potential development and equipment sale opportunities.\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter Financial Highlights:\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $11.1 million, a 12 percent increase over revenue of $9.9 million reported in the prior year period.

Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income (loss) is defined as net income (loss), excluding share-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, depreciation of property, plant and equipment, interest expense, tax provision or benefit, and certain other non-cash impacts as applicable.\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, please see the table captioned “Reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA net income (loss)” included at the end of this release. The table has more details on the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and the related reconciliation between these financial measures.\nNorthern Power Systems’ management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information in assessing our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results, which could be non-cash charges or discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. This non-GAAP financial measure also has facilitated management’s internal comparisons to Northern Power Systems’ historical performance and our competitors’ operating results, as well as reflects measurements which are used by creditors and other third parties in assessing our performance.\nReconciliat ion of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA Income (Loss) For the three months ended For the twelve months ended December 31, December 31, (in thousands of dollars) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ 1,134 $ (835 ) $ 59 $ (8,949 ) Interest expense 15 19 61 113 Provision (Benefit) for income taxes (39 ) (77 ) 9 173 Depreciation and amortization 135 137 526 659 Stock compensation expense 44 97 158 519 Loss on disposal of asset 14 182 14 338 Gain on disposition of assets - (973 ) - (973 ) Impairment of goodwill - 361 - 361 Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income (loss) $ 1,303 $ (1,089 ) $ 827 $ (7,759 )\nAbout Northern Power Systems\nNorthern Power Systems designs, manufactures, and sells distributed power generation and energy storage solutions with its advanced wind turbines, inverters, controls, and integration services.
