The drill results support the continuation of the extensive Avino vein system. We delivered an 11% increase in revenue, an improvement in earnings, and maintained consistent silver equivalent production levels. Avino is celebrating its 50th year in the mining industry, and this would not be possible without the support and dedication of our teams in both Canada and Mexico.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFourth\nQuarter 2017\nFourth\nQuarter 2016\nChange\nYear 2017\nYear 2016\nChange\n(Expressed in US$)\nOperating\nTonnes Milled\n129,555\n134,668\n-4%\n541,935\n544,336\n0%\nSilver Ounces Produced\n319,678\n419,355\n-24%\n1,394,203\n1,612,060\n-14%\nGold Ounces Produced\n1,472\n2,581\n-43%\n7,935\n7,119\n11%\nCopper Pounds Produced\n1,108,800\n755,645\n47%\n4,373,166\n4,206,585\n4%\nSilver Equivalent Ounces 1 Produced\n637,012\n707,775\n-10%\n2,700,585\n2,679,334\n1%\nConcentrate Sales and Cash Costs\nSilver Equivalent Ounces Sold 2\n597,285\n644,479\n-7%\n2,245,946\n2,035,618\n10%\nCash Cost per Silver Equivalent Ounce 2,3\n$\n7.90\n$\n8.62\n-8%\n$\n8.65\n$\n8.48\n2%\nAll-in Sustaining Cost per Silver Equivalent Ounce 2,3\n$\n9.23\n$\n10.01\n-8%\n$\n10.11\n$\n10.34\n-2%\nAverage Realized Silver Price per Ounce\n$\n16.65\n$\n16.69\n0%\n$\n17.05\n$\n17.71\n-4%\nAverage Realized Gold Price per Ounce\n$\n1,278\n$\n1,194\n7%\n$\n1,268\n$\n1,258\n1%\nAverage Realized Copper Price per Tonne\n$\n6,784\n$\n5,313\n28%\n$\n6,251\n$\n4,850\n29%\nFinancial\nRevenues\n$\n8,883,647\n$\n9,048,747\n-2%\n$\n33,358,641\n$\n30,105,336\n11%\nMine Operating Income\n$\n3,363,245\n$\n2,692,056\n25%\n$\n11,383,511\n$\n10,944,536\n4%\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n1,496,381\n$\n950,770\n57%\n$\n2,653,461\n$\n1,503,531\n76%\nCash\n$\n3,371,478\n$\n11,779,718\n-71%\n$\n3,371,478\n$\n11,779,718\n-71%\nWorking Capital\n$\n16,544,762\n$\n23,306,043\n-29%\n$\n16,544,762\n$\n23,306,043\n-29%\nShareholders\nEarnings (Loss) per Share (\"EPS\") – Basic\n$\n0.03\n$\n0.02\n50%\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.04\n25%\nCash Flow per Share (YTD) 3 – Basic\n$\n0.05\n$\n0.02\n150%\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.11\n18%\n1. In 2017, AgEq was calculated using metals prices of $17.05 oz Ag, $1,258 oz Au and $2.80 lb Cu. In 2016, AgEq was calculated using $17.10 oz Ag, $1,248 oz Au and $2.21 lb Cu.\n2. \"Silver equivalent ounces sold\" for the purposes of cash costs and all-in sustaining costs consists of the sum of silver ounces, gold ounces and copper tonnes sold multiplied by the ratio of the average spot gold and copper prices to the average spot silver price for the corresponding period.\n3. The Company reports non-IFRS measures which include cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, all-in sustaining cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, and cash flow per share. These measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance, but do not have a standardized meaning and the calculation methods may differ from methods used by other companies with similar reported measures.\nFinancial Results\nThe Company generated revenues of $33.4 million during 2017; an 11% increase compared with 2016, due to the Avino Mine entering into production at levels intended by management effective April 1, 2016, and were partially offset by lower silver prices in the period. In 2015, and the first quarter of 2016, the Avino mine was in the evaluation phase and proceeds from the sale of Avino Mine Concentrate were classified as a recovery of exploration and evaluation expenditures. Higher copper prices were also a contributing factor to the increased revenue in 2017.\nMine operating income was $11.4 million during 2017, an increase of $0.5 million or 4% from\n$10.9 million in 2016. During 2017, net income increased by $1.2 million to $2.7 million or $0.05 basic and diluted per share, compared to net income of $1.5 million or $0.04 basic and $0.03 diluted per share during 2016. The primary reason for the increase is the addition of revenue from the Avino Mine.\nOperational Results\n2017 Production Highlights\nSilver equivalent 1 production - 2,700,585 oz* Silver production - 1,394,203 oz Gold production - 7,935 oz Copper production - 4,373,166 lbs\n*In 2017, we also produced and sold 73,460 silver equivalent ounces from our low grade zinc concentrate.\nSilver equivalent 1 production for 2017 increased by 1% to 2,700,585 oz compared to 2,679,334 oz in 2016. Silver production for 2017 decreased 14% to 1,394,203 from 1,612,060 oz compared to 2016. Gold production for 2017 increased by 11% to 7,935 oz compared to 7,119 oz in 2016. Copper production for 2017 increased by 4% to 4,373,166 lbs compared to 4,206,585 lbs in 2016. Total mill feed processed during 2017 was 541,935 compared to 544,336 dry tonnes during 2016, a decrease of 0.5%.\nAt the Avino mine, the silver equivalent 1 ounces produced during 2017 totalled 1,911,428 compared to 1,606,272 produced in 2016, which was an increase of 19%, mainly due to the higher grade of the mill feed resulting in an increase of 9% in concentrate produced and the grade of copper increasing by 35%. Copper production increased by 47% during the 4 th quarter. Over the year, gold production increased by 42%, copper by 4% and silver by 2%.\nAt the San Gonzalo Mine, the silver equivalent 1 ounces produced during 2017 totalled 789,157 compared to 1,073,062 compared in 2016. This represents a 26% decrease compared to 2016, and was mainly due to lower tonnage of San Gonzalo mill feed being processed using Mill Circuit 2. In 2017, Mill Circuit 2 was primarily used for processing Avino Mine material, whereas in 2016, there were some months when this Circuit was used to process San Gonzalo material in addition to Mill Circuit 1.\nCosts and Capital Expenditures\nConsolidated all-in sustaining cash costs per AgEq ounce during 2017 was $10.11 compared to $10.34 during 2016, a decrease of 2%. As we continue to transition from development mining to production mining we anticipate achieving lower production costs.\nCapital expenditures during 2017 were $12.4 million compared to $10.7 million during 2016.\nCapital expenditures primarily relate to advancing the Avino Mine which included construction of Mill Circuit 4, which is now over 90% complete, exploration at the Avino Mine, the purchasing of new mining, milling/processing and transportation equipment, as well as advancing the Bralorne Mine and exploration and mining equipment.\n1 In 2017, AgEq was calculated using metals prices of $17.05 oz Ag, $1,258 oz Au and $2.80 lb Cu. In 2016, AgEq was calculated using $17.10 oz Ag, $1,248 oz Au and $2.21 lb Cu.\nBralorne Mine\nDuring the year, the Company completed its review of potential scenarios for developing a long term mine operating plan. The original phased plan was for the future start-up of a small tonnage operation, and during the course of work being completed, our site management identified ground and safety issues in the existing 800 level portal. It was determined that the 800 level portal needed rehabilitative work, and consultants were engaged to review and develop a plan for the repairs. In view of the proposed repairs, which would have restricted mine throughput, the consultant's recommendations were to construct a new portal on the 800 level, due to the age and limiting size of the original main access tunnel. The future construction of a new 800 portal should allow earlier access to the resources below the 800 level.\nIn November, the Company received an approved Permit Amendment from The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources (\"MEMPR\"). The Permit Amendment provides a comprehensive and responsible permit, which is updated to modern environmental and permitting standards, and is an important step in the Company's strategic plan to re-open the Bralorne Gold Mine. With the receipt of this modern permit, the Company anticipates an easier and quicker transition to an amended permit that would allow for future expansion. A surface drilling program is underway, and an underground drill program is being planned to update and increase the confidence in the current resource base.\nFirst Nations Education, Training & Engagement, and Collaboration\nIn 2017, Avino continued the underground mining training for members of the St'at'imc communities, and the third training program with North Island College was completed in February 2018 in Pemberton, B.C. In addition to the training program through North Island College, Avino has been working with the Center for Training Excellence in Mining, the BC government, Thompson Rivers University, New Gold, Seabridge Gold and Sandvik, amongst others, on the development of the curriculum for a new accredited underground mining training program aligned with the Mining Industry Human Resources Council's Canadian Mining Certification Program.\nDuring 2017, Avino announced the signing of a non-binding Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with St'at'imc Eco-Resources to recognize the opportunity for collaboration and the establishment of joint ventures to allow the St'át'imc First Nations (the \"St'át'imc\") to economically participate in the development and ongoing operations of the Bralorne Gold Mine project. St'át'imc Eco-Resources Ltd. is the economic arm of the St'at'imc and is owned by 9 of the 11 St'át'imc Communities.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe financial results in this news release include references to cash flow per share, cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, and all-in sustaining cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, each of which are non-IFRS measures. Cash flow per share, cash cost per ounce, and all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce are measures developed by mining companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard of performance. However, there can be no assurance that our reporting of these non-IFRS measures is similar to that reported by other mining companies. Cash flow per share, cash cost per silver equivalent ounce, and all-in sustaining cash cost per silver equivalent ounce are measures used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance of the Company's mining operations, and are widely reported in the silver and gold mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS, and are disclosed in addition to the prescribed IFRS measures provided in the Company's financial statements and MD&A.\nAdditional information\nAvino will be holding a conference call and webcast on April 3, at 8 am PDT (11 am EDT).\nShareholders, analysts, investors and media are invited to join the webcast and conference call by logging in here\nAvino Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Webcast and Conference Call or by dialing the following numbers five to ten 10 minutes prior to the start time:\nToll Free Canada & USA: 1-800-319-4610\nOutside of Canada & USA: 1-604-638-5340\nNo pass-code is necessary to participate in the conference call or webcast; participants will have the opportunity to ask questions during the Q&A portion.\nThe conference call and webcast will be recorded and the replay will be available on the Company's web site later that day.\nQualified Person(s)\nAvino's Mexican projects are under the supervision of Jasman Yee, P.Eng, Avino Director, and the Bralorne project is under the supervision of Fred Sveinson, B.A., B.Sc., P.
