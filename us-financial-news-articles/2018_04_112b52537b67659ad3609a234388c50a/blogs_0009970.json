This has been especially useful for finding your friends in languages which take more effort to type out a full name, or where many people have the same name. In Bangladesh, for example, this feature makes up 7% of all searches. However, malicious actors have also abused these features to scrape public profile information by submitting phone numbers or email addresses they already have through search and account recovery. Given the scale and sophistication of the activity we've seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way. So we have now disabled this feature. We're also making changes to account recovery to reduce the risk of scraping as well.\" \nFacebook was not immediately available to clarify whether the statement that Facebook users \"could have had their public profile scraped this way,\" meant that it actually happened to most Facebook users. \nIn a call with media on Wednesday afternoon, CEO Mark Zuckerberg clarified further. \"It is reasonable to expect... someone has accessed your information in this way,\" Zuckerberg said. \nThis news is in addition to Facebook's claims that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica gained access to data from as many as 87 million Facebook users. Media reports had previously placed the number at over 50 million . \nCNBC's Michelle Castillo and Chloe Aiello contributed to this report.
