Ziegler got the save, the first for any Marlins pitcher this season.\nThe Marlins snapped a four-game losing streak in which they were outscored 36-6.\nPhiladelphia had a two-game win streak broken. Reliever Luis Garcia (0-1) took the loss.\nRight-hander Jake Arrieta made his Phillies debut and left with a no-decision. Arrieta, who signed a three-year, $75 million contract on March 12, lasted just four innings. He allowed three this, two walks, three runs, two earned, and struck out five.\nMarlins rookie Trevor Richards also earned a no-decision. He allowed six hits, three walks and three runs, striking out two.\nMiami opened the scoring in the first. Miguel Rojas, with just four career homers in 872 at-bats entering Sunday, pulled a solo shot to left, a line drive that cut through the wind. After Rojas’ homer, the Marlins kept their rally going with a two-run opposite-field single by rookie Braxton Lee, who sliced a curve to shallow left.\nThe Phillies got on the board in the bottom of the first, cutting Miami’s lead to 3-2. Leadoff batter Cesar Hernandez pulled a double to right, advanced on a wild pitch and scored on Carlos Santana’s sacrifice fly. Odubel Herrera then hustled his way to a double, scoring on Nick Williams’ single.\nHerrera’s speed was a factor again in the third. He beat out an infield single and ran home from first on Rhys Hoskins’ double to left-center, tying the score at 3.\nMiami’s winning rally in the eighth began when Rojas was hit by a pitch and Starlin Castro walked. Anderson then hit a 2-2 changeup to right-center to put Miami up 5-3. Holaday’s RBI single to center closed the scoring.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:16:35.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
