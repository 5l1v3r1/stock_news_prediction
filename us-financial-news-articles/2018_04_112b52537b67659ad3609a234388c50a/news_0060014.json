KCNA/via Reuters China is North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, despite Beijing’s anger at Pyongyang’s repeated nuclear and missile tests and support for strong United Nations sanctions against North Korea.\nThe tourists and four North Koreans were killed when a bus crashed off a bridge in North Korea late on Sunday, leaving two Chinese nationals in critical condition.\nOn Thursday, Chinese state television broadcast images of Kim seeing off the bodies as they were loaded onto a train for the journey home.\nThe North Korean people were “overcome with sorrow,” Kim told President Xi Jinping and other Chinese leaders.\n“It is, indeed, very sad that the close Chinese friends, who had come here with the feelings of friendship with our people, met with an unexpected accident on our land,” read his message, carried by the official KCNA news agency.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits a hospital following a bus accident involving Chinese tourists in North Hwanghae province, in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on April 24, 2018.
