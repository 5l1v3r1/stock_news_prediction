Without taking into account calendar effects, same-store sales grew a more modest 0.4 percent.\nCarrefour Brasil’s results reflect two competing dynamics in Brazil’s food retail sector. Sales are generally rising across the board as consumers drive a rebound in the country’s economy, but food prices continue to disappoint.\nIn the first quarter, food price deflation came to 4.0 percent, according to the government.\nSame store-sales at the retailer’s Atacadao cash-and-carry format, which offers final customers a wholesale experience, climbed 1.4 percent taking into account calendar effects, while same-store sales at the retailer’s more traditional formats rose a calendar-adjusted 4.3 percent.\nThe company said it was on track to reach its goal of opening 20 new Atacadao stores this year, with four new stores having opened in the first quarter.\nCarrefour Brasil also emphasized its growing electronics and e-commerce business, an increasing point of emphasis for the company.\nIt said e-commerce sales rose 103 percent year on year. The company added that sales of non-food products at Carrefour Brasil’s traditional hypermarket formats increased at a “double digit” rate, with consumer electronics selling particularly well.\n$1 = 3.41 reais Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:12:26.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
