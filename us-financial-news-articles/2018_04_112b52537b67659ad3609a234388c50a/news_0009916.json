White Sox right-hander Carson Fulmer gave up three runs, five hits and one walk while striking out five in five innings.\nThe White Sox pushed across two runs in the fifth with help from a review to take a 3-1 lead.\nThe bases were loaded with one out when Yoan Moncada sent a deep blast to the wall in left. Toronto’s Curtis Granderson leaped and the ball appear to either deflect off the wall or off Granderson’s glove.\nGranderson fell to the ground and the ball followed and landed in his glove for what was ruled to be the second out.\nHowever, on review, the ball was ruled to hit the top of the fence behind Granderson’s glove before he made the grab, and the play was ruled to be a run-scoring single for Moncada. Sanchez hit the following batter, Adam Engel, to force in another run and make it 3-1.\nThe Blue Jays tied the score in the bottom of the sixth on two run-scoring singles. Steve Pearce delivered a pinch hit to left for the first run and Kendrys Morales tied it with a liner to center.\nChicago opened the scoring in the second when Davidson lined a 3-1 pitch over the wall in left for his fourth homer of the campaign.\nRussell Martin’s grounder pushed across a run in the fourth as Toronto tied the score at 1.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:41:21.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
