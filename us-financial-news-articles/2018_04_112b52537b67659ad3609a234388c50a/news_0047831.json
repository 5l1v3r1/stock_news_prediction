Muellner is now due to retire in May.\nThe ministry has said it will only make a final decision on the Tornado replacement after a comprehensive assessment of data provided by the aircraft manufacturers.\nAirbus defence chief Dirk Hoke told German newspaper Die Welt am Sonntag this weekend that a decision to buy the F-35 would kill off plans by France and Germany to develop a new European fighter.\n“As soon as Germany becomes an F-35 nation, all cooperation with France on combat jet issues will die,” Hoke told the paper.\nLockheed officials argue that it would make sense for Germany to buy a certain number of F-35s, especially given that many of its close military allies in Europe, including Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, are also buying the jets.\nU.S. officials are legally bound to equally represent all possible U.S. bids, but experts say the F-35 would be the best option since it is already slated to carry nuclear weapons beginning in the early 2020s.\nGermany has committed to having that capability as part of its responsibilities to the NATO alliance.\nThe Eurofighter would still need to be certified to carry nuclear bombs, a process that could take until 2030 or longer, and might force Germany to extend the life of some Tornado jets at great cost, according to U.S. military experts.\nAn Airbus spokesman said the company was confident that Eurofighter could be certified by 2025.\n“We do not advocate for a particular U.S. platform, but we encourage Germany to consider a suitable platform that is interoperable and survivable in the context of the modern threat environment,” said U.S. Air Force Colonel Alex Walford, air attache at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
