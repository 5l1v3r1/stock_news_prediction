This means that we don’t have the strategic requirement of formalizing partner relationships with such companies, as some corporate venture programs do. Our focus is on building strong relationships and helping to spur on the development of the ecosystem,” business development chief Emilie Choi wrote in a blog post . \nChoi noted that Coinbase might even invest in companies that appear to be its competitors. In some cases, she said, this might be because “there might be nuance to the way these startups are building out its products.” In others, “we may be comfortable investing in companies that are potentially competitive, because it’s in everyone’s interest to see the ecosystem innovate.” \nAccording to Business Insider , Coinbase Ventures will for now refrain from investing in security tokens. This is one type of token issued in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs). \nCoinbase is rapidly expanding into a financial services giant within the cryptocurrency market. Last month it introduced a new cryptocurrency index fund , allowing people to invest in virtual coins such as Bitcoin through the fund, rather than buying them directly.
