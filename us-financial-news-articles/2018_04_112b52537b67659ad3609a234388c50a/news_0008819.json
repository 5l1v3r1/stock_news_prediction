Clinical research has shown that electrical stimulation of the tongue, translingual neurostimulation, activates two major cranial nerves – the trigeminal nerve and the facial nerve. Electrical stimulation of these cranial nerves creates a flow of neural impulses that are then delivered directly into the brain stem and cerebellum. PoNS Treatment combines the use of the PoNS device with physical therapy. The Company has completed its clinical trials for balance disorder in patients with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury and plans to submit applications for marketing authorization in the US and other jurisdictions for the PoNS device in the first half of 2018. Additional trials in multiple sclerosis, stroke and cerebral palsy have shown promising results and provide support for pursuing additional indications for use.\nAbout Helius Medical Technologies, Inc.\nHelius Medical Technologies is a medical technology company focused on neurological wellness. Helius seeks to develop, license and acquire unique and non-invasive platform technologies that amplify the brain’s ability to heal itself.\nThe Toronto Stock Exchange has not reviewed and does not accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of the content of this news release.\nCautionary Disclaimer Statement:\nCertain statements in this news release are not based on historical facts and constitute forward-looking statements or forward-looking information within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian securities laws.\nAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this news release are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
