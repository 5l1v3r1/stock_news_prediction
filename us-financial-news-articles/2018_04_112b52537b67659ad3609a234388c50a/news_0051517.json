The same technology includes e-commerce safety features providing additional fraud protection when shopping online.\nIn making today’s announcement, Mr Petty emphasized, “I want Zicix Smart Card clients to know that their cards can be safely used to preload personal cash or when receiving direct deposits; they can be totally comfortable using their cards in all financial aspects of life. They can even earn, collect and redeem points from retailer’s loyalty programs and manufacturer’s coupons.”\nAbout Zicix Corporation (ZICX:OTCMKTS US).
