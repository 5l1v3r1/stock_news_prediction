Minnesota found the net with six of its first 22 shots, most goals in a home playoff game in franchise history.\nGame 4 is Tuesday night, also on the Wild’s home ice.\nMikael Granlund, Zach Parise, Matt Dumba, Eric Staal, Greenway and Marcus Foligno produced the Minnesota goals. Except for Parise, who scored for the third time in the series, it was the first goal for the others in this postseason.\nGreenway, a 21-year-old left winger, had played in six games in the regular season.\nMikko Koivu and Nick Seeler both provided two assists for the Wild.\nThere was no scoring in the third period and there were no penalties in the final 29 minutes of the game.\nBlake Wheeler and Tyler Myers scored for Winnipeg, which had dominated stretches of the first two games at home. Even in this game, the Jets finished with a 31-29 advantage in shots on goal.\nSnow blanketed the region in the day prior to the game, but a fired-up crowd of 19,175 turned out and liked what it saw.\nWild goalie Devan Dubnyk made 29 saves.\nJets goalie Connor Hellebuyck stopped 16 of 22 shots through two periods. Steve Mason replaced him for the third period and stopped all seven shots he faced.\nThe Jets scored first on Wheeler’s power-play goal at 4:50 of the first period after the second Minnesota penalty. It marked the first opening-period goal in the series for either team.\nThe Wild then scored twice on first-period power plays.\nMinnesota pulled even just after the midway mark of the opening period when Granlund scored on a five-on-three advantage.\nParise worked himself free enough near the crease to bat in the puck for a 2-1 Wild lead at 17:50.\nMinnesota scored four times on nine second-period shots.\nDumba’s goal just 3:32 into the second period gave the Wild a 3-1 cushion, but Myers answered with an unassisted goal slightly more than three minutes later.\nStaal and Greenway posted Minnesota goals in a 20-second span late in the second period. Foligno got into the act less than 3 1/2 minutes later.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T10:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T16:29:45.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
