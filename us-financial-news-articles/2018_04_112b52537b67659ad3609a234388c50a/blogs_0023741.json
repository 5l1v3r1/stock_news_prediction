Companies are increasing their opposition to the Trump administration’s plans to levy tariffs on Chinese goods, reports the WSJ’s Bob Davis. The coalition lobbying against the duties has doubled to 107 trade groups, covering large swaths of the American economy.\nThe group wants the Trump administration to drop its plan to impose tariffs on as much as $150 billion of imports from China in response to what Washington calls violations of U.S. intellectual property rights. Instead, the trade associations urge the U.S. to lead an international coalition opposed to Chinese practices that would include “clearly defined objectives, deadlines and immediate negotiations with China.”\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is seeking to blunt domestic opposition to its trade policies with a relief package for farmers affected by the U.S. trade spat with China, write Bob Davis, Siobhan Hughes and Jesse Newman. The aid package, which could climb into the billions of dollars, is still being developed.\nFarm groups however say they aren’t looking for a handout and would rather have unimpeded trade with China. “Farmers are more interested in negotiation [with China] than mitigation,” said Davie Stephens, vice president of the American Soybean Association and a farmer who raises crops near Clinton, Ky. “Let’s get an agreement where tariffs don’t have to be implemented.”\nTHE DAY AHEAD \nFastenal Co. is set to release earnings today.\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE \nLevi’s CFO turns to robots to help keep the books.
