Los Angeles has 94 points and sits third in the Pacific Division standings, although the Ducks have a game in hand.\nThe finish ended yet another entertaining affair between the Southern California rivals. Anaheim has a 17-4-4 record in the last 25 regular-season meetings.\nKings defenseman Drew Doughty opened the scoring at the 6:01 mark of the first period. After Doughty gained the puck at his point position, a huge lane opened up for him because Ducks forwards Ryan Kesler and Andrew Cogliano collided with each other. Doughty worked his way all the way to the low slot before ripping a high shot past Gibson, who was screened by Tanner Pearson.\nKings captain Anze Kopitar’s assist on the goal marked his career-high 90th point on the season. Kopitar has netted 16 points in his last 11 games.\nNick Ritchie finally put a puck past Quick with 3:05 remaining in the second period to tie the game. Ondrej Kase won a puck battle along the end boards before sending a pass to Francois Beauchemin at the point. Beauchemin’s long shot was denied but Ritchie buried the rebound opportunity to net just his ninth goal of the season but third in the last eight games.\nKase ended up with a pair of assists for the Ducks, who reached the 40-win mark for the fifth consecutive season.\nIt became very tight checking after the second intermission. Quick was the bigger story in the first half, but Gibson came up with clutch saves against Adrian Kempe and Pearson in the final 45 seconds or regulation time.\nQuick stopped 31 shots for the Kings.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-03-31T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:30:09.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
