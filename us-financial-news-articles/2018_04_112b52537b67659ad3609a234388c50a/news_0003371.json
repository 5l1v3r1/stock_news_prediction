Our partnership with the $8 billion distribution company UNFI sets us up for broader distribution into channels that are in line with our health conscious products. We believe our platform, with a low-overhead and high-margin royalty model, will allow us to create significant shareholder value in the coming years.”\nMr. Sklar added, “Breathe is the only household cleaning aerosol line that is approved by the EPA’s Safer Choice Program globally and is currently on shelves at all Wegmans Food Markets, a 93-store grocery chain known for its innovation.”\nSubsequent Events\nReverse stock split – On February 20 th , 2018, a previously announced thirty-for-one reverse stock split took effect, reducing the number of shares from 72.5 million shares to 2.4 million.\nStock issuance – On February 26 th , 117.3 million shares were issued to officers and directors for services rendered, and 30.3 million shares were issued to various service providers, bringing the total number of shares as of March 18 th , 2018 to 150.0 million.\nMarketing team assembled - On February 23 rd , the Company introduced its Brand Advisory Board (BAB), whose members include David Dreyer (Marketing), Xanthe Wells (Creative), Lisa Becker (Public Relations) and Kendra Bracken-Ferguson (Digital and Social Media).
