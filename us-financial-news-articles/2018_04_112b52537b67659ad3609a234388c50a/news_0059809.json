Sources said it sought to cut production to between 1.6 and 1.7 million tonnes per season over three years.\nThe marketing board’s actions run counter to international efforts to stop growing cocoa in protected forests.\nLast year, Ivory Coast and major chocolate companies from Mars to Hershey to Barry Callebaut pledged to eliminate the production and sourcing of cocoa from these forests.\nStamping out deforestation in the cocoa supply chain is just one of the commitments made by the world’s chocolate makers to make the industry more sustainable, along with finding ways to end child labour and boost farmers’ incomes.\nChocolate-makers, trading companies and grinders have invested hundreds of millions of dollars into certified and sustainable cocoa production. The programmes are designed to improve quality and yields through good agricultural practices free from pesticides, chemicals and child labour.\nAlthough the programmes have helped millions of Ivorian small-scale growers, who farm between one and five hectares of cocoa each, the CCC says they have contributed to overproduction.\n“The chocolate industry pushes us to overproduce with these programmes, and this negatively affects prices. We want to control our output, and that means stopping these programmes,” a senior source at the CCC told Reuters.\nOver ninety percent of Ivory Coast’s cocoa beans are of the top-quality good fermented grade. Industry sources say more than 400,000 tonnes of last season’s top grade cocoa was produced on certified and sustainable farms.
