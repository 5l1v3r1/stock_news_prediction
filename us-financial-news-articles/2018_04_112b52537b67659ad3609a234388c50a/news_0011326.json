Manny Pina’s two-run single in the fourth inning gave the Brewers a 4-3 edge, while Arcia finished off a two-run second with his first extra-base hit of the year, a two-out double down the right field line.\nBrewers starter Jhoulys Chacin, who hasn’t made it through the sixth inning in any of his three starts, permitted five hits and three runs in 4 2/3 innings. He walked three and fanned one.\nMiles Mikolas lasted 6 1/3 innings for St. Louis (4-6), allowing eight hits and four runs. He issued no walks and struck out five. Mikolas was taken off the hook by the ninth-inning rally.\nThe Brewers, coming off a 2-5 homestand, started the scoring in the second. Domingo Santana followed Travis Shaw’s double off the right field wall with an RBI single just off the glove of diving shortstop Paul DeJong, and Arcia later brought Santana home.\nThe Cardinals took a brief lead in the third. Fowler’s one-out single to right scored Kolten Wong from second. After two-out walks to Tommy Pham and Matt Carpenter filled the bases, Marcell Ozuna laced a two-run single up the middle.\nSt. Louis hurt itself with failed baserunning gambles in the first two innings. Fowler led off the first with a single to left-center but tried to stretch it into a double and was thrown out. Ozuna doubled down the left field line to open the second but was gunned down at third.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T13:03:22.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
