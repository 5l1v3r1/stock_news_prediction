They are five points behind the first-place Nashville Predators with three games remaining. The Senators, eliminated from the playoffs weeks ago, played their last home game of the season.\nAndrew Copp and Kyle Connor both had a goal and an assist, while Josh Morrissey and Brandon Tanev also scored for Winnipeg. Mark Scheifele provided two assists, setting up both of Wheeler’s goals.\nMatt Duchene and Thomas Chabot each had two goals for the Senators. Ottawa’s Christian Wolanin collected his first career NHL goal.\nDefenseman Erik Karlson provided three assists in what might have been his final home game as a Senator, pending expected summer trade discussions. Mike Hoffman also furnished three helpers in a losing cause.\nJets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck stopped 32 of 37 shots for his 10th win in 12 games. Ottawa counterpart Craig Anderson stopped 34 of 40 shots.\nWinnipeg scored on 1 of 3 power plays while the Senators capitalized on 2 of 5.\nThe Jets jumped out to a 3-0 advantage in the first 12 minutes, but the Senators kept coming back.\nCopp opened the scoring 2:42 into the game as he flipped in Jacob Trouba’s rebound. Morrissey gave the Jets a 2-0 edge at 11:36 of the first period as he one-timed a slap shot past Anderson, and Wheeler scored 21 seconds later, roofing Scheifele’s pass.\nChabot’s first goal of the game, on a shot from the slot following a pass from Duchene, put the Senators on the scoreboard at 18:26 of the first. Duchene then closed the gap to 3-2 on a power play only 1:28 into the second period.\nTanev put the Jets ahead 4-2 with a short-handed marker just under five minutes later.\nChabot’s second goal, at 11:58 of the middle frame, brought the Senators within one goal again. But only 48 seconds later, Wheeler’s second marker — on another pass from Scheifele — gave the Jets a 5-3 advantage.\nWolanin brought Ottawa within one yet again at 4:47 of the third period before Connor’s power-play goal at 14:38 of the final stanza put the Jets up 6-4.\nDuchene’s power-play marker 1:17 later set the stage for one final — albeit unsuccessful — Ottawa comeback attempt.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T11:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:06:25.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
