Goldman Sachs shares rose 0.4 percent after the investment bank reported 27 percent surge in profit.\nThe results will add to optimism about first-quarter earnings growth, which is expected to be the strongest in seven years. Analysts expect S&P companies’ profit rose 18.6 percent in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nInvestors have shifted their focus from geopolitical and trade concerns, which have roiled the markets in the recent months.\nHowever, U.S.-China trade issues continue to simmer. China moved to slap a hefty temporary deposit on imports of U.S. sorghum in a preliminary antidumping ruling. Archer Daniel , a top seller of U.S. sorghum into China, was down 0.9 percent.\nThe move came a day after the United States banned American companies from selling parts and software to China’s ZTE Corp for seven years.\nA U.S.-led attack on Syria over the weekend has so far not prompted any military retaliation from Russia, easing fears over the conflict escalating.\nTesla shares fell 0.84 percent after the electric car maker temporarily suspended its Model 3 assembly line, in what it said was a planned production pause.\nData on U.S. homebuilding and industrial production are expected ahead of the opening bell.
