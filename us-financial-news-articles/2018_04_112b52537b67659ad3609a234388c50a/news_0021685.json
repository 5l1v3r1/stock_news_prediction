He’s had 6-8 weeks of nearly being there,” Waratahs coach Daryl Gibson told reporters. \n“He’s finally passed fit — he’s had a good trot last week with Sydney Uni and I think he’s ready.” \nPhipps replaces Mitch Short on the bench as the only change to the squad from last weekend’s bonus-point 50-29 win over the Sunwolves in Tokyo, an attacking display that Gibson felt had left room for plenty of improvement. \n“Defensively we’re still conceding far too many tries, particularly putting a lot of pressure on ourselves through our own poor ball control at times, and that’s something we talked about,” Gibson added. \n“We’re steeling ourselves for what’s going to be a really physical encounter.” (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T10:05:02.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
