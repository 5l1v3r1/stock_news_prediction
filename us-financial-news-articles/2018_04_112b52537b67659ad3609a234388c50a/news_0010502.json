The stricter amortisation requirement that was introduced a month ago is important to slow this development,” FSA Director General Erik Thedeen said in a statement on the watchdog’s annual mortgage report.\nThe watchdog has introduced a number of regulations in recent years to cool an overheated housing market including higher mortgage risk weights for banks, a loan-to-value cap and recently, tougher mortgage repayment requirements.\nAfter double digit annual price growth in recent years, house prices dipped late in 2017, but most analysts expect the downturn to be mild and relatively shortlived.\nReporting by Simon Johnson and Niklas Pollard\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:18:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
