Morgan Stanley said it expects a delay of up to three years for Celgene’s key multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.\nOil prices rallied after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had lied about not pursuing nuclear weapons and had expanded its nuclear weapons knowledge after signing a 2015 deal with global powers. U.S. President Donald Trump has until May 12 to decide whether to restore sanctions on Iran.\nOil has risen this month to the highest since late 2014, driven by concerns over potential disruptions to Iranian crude flows.\nEven as companies’ quarterly results have come in strong, their earnings calls have raised concerns that rising commodity prices may pinch profit margins in the future.\nSome investors suggested that on balance, the strong earnings season has not been enough for U.S. stocks to break out of their recent trading range.\n“The earnings are priced in,” said Robert Phipps, a director at Per Stirling Capital Management in Austin, Texas. “There’s not a whole lot of reason to buy.

On the consumption side, personal spending in February was revised lower to 0.3 percent, instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent.\nMcDonald’s Corp shares jumped 5.0 percent after the world’s biggest fast-food chain by revenue topped analysts’ forecasts for profit and sales.\nShares of T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp sank on worries that the two companies’ $26 billion merger would face regulatory challenges.
