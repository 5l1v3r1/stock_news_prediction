REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker According to the Thomson Reuters Agriculture Weather Dashboard, average rainfall in states like Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Goiás will be between 60mm (2.4 inches) and 80mm in the second half of April.\nSome corn-growing areas in those states will have rains of 100mm in the period, the data showed.\n“There were rains in late March and early April in Paraná and São Paulo states, maintaining soil humidity,” said Paulo Molinari, an analyst with Safras & Mercados consultancy. He noted fields are developing normally in those states while in Mato Grosso and Goiás conditions are almost “perfect.”\nIn the west and northwest of Paraná, the second largest corn producing state after Mato Grosso, rains will reach 94mm in certain areas, slightly above average, the forecasts indicate.\nThe government estimates 88.61 million tonnes of corn will be harvested this cycle in Brazil. Brazil’s second corn crop, planted after soybeans are harvested, accounts for about 71 percent of all corn produced in the country.\nBecause this year some farmers planted second-corn outside the ideal window, producers in Paraná, a region normally colder than the center-west of Brazil, could face frost that is potentially damaging to the crop.\n“There is still no forecast of frosts, but the risk exists with the end of La Niña,” Molinari said.\nReporting by José Roberto Gomes; Writing by Ana Mano; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T00:55:28.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
