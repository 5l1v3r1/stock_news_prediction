MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.17 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.54 percent.\nOil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy.\n“It’s not so much ‘risk on/risk off’, as it is ‘trade war on/trade war off’ and, at the moment, we’re ‘trade-war off’,” London Capital Group’s Jasper Lawler said.\n“There’s a lot of political motivation in the tariffs in the United States, but ultimately, they won’t want a trade war, there is a general desire to boost the U.S. economy.”\nU.S. crude rose 2.82 percent to $65.21 per barrel and Brent was last at $70.68, up 2.96 percent on the day.\nXi’s comments also lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen.\n“The main driver was the speech by China’s President overnight that helped to calm some concerns about a looming trade war,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.53 percent versus the greenback at 107.35 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.4158, up 0.21 percent on the day.\nThe dollar index fell 0.06 percent, with the euro up 0.07 percent to $1.2328.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Monday.\nThe 30-year bond last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.0238 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Monday.\nRUSSIA FALLS FURTHER Russian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The rouble plunged 3.7 percent against the dollar and touched 63.925 per dollar, its lowest since late 2016.\nStocks in Moscow calculated in U.S. dollars fell as much as 4.8 percent after dropping more than 11 percent on Monday, but shaved most of Tuesday’s loss to be down -0.8 percent.\nShares of Rusal, the aluminum giant highlighted prominently in the sanctions alongside its boss Oleg Deripaska, fell a further 8.7 percent in Hong Kong after slumping 50 percent on Monday.\nReporting by Rodrigo Campos, additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London, Swetah Singh in Bengaluru and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed in New York Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T23:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:11:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
