It has not published figures for 2017, but its 2016 loss was estimated at 50 million euros.\nLluka said the government could privatise the company in two years, once it has returned to profit.\nHis comments come after PTK board member Besa Shatri-Berisha warned the government on Monday it could lose ownership of the company to creditors. She added PTK could face bankruptcy within the next year.\nIn May last year, PTK managed to avoid bankruptcy after privately-owned mobile operator Z-mobile agreed to waive a 32 million euro fine imposed by an arbitration court in London over a breach of contract.\nThe government may also have to pay up to 400 million euros in compensation in another arbitration court case, after it failed to win parliamentary approval for a plan to sell PTK to Germany’s ACP Axos Capital Gmbh for 277 million euros in 2013.\n$1 = 0.8185 euros Reporting by Fatos Bytyci; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:15:32.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
