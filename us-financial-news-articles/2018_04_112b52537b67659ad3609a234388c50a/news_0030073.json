He attacks a lot and is a very strong player. I was very solid today and I’m very happy about that.” Reporting by Martyn Herman; Editing by Toby Davis and Clare Fallon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T18:20:41.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
