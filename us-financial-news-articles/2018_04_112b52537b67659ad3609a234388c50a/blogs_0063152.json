He has given each of us opportunities for advancement and championed our successes throughout our careers.”\n“As we have advanced across industries — news, publishing, law, business and government,” they continue, “Tom has been a valued source of counsel and support. We know him to be a man of tremendous decency and integrity.”\nThe initial signees included Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell and Maria Shriver. Since the letter was sent on Friday, Mika Brzezinski , co-host of MSNBC’s Morning Joe , added her own support by Twitter, writing , “Add me to the list.” More than 50 other women have since signed on, totaling 115 names, according to CNNMoney .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T12:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T12:26:11.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
