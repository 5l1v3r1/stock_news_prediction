REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nOil prices rose after their biggest one-day fall in almost a year on Monday, though higher Russian output and Saudi Arabia possibly cutting selling prices dragged on crude trading. [O/R] \nInvestors remained cautious after China said Sunday it would raise tariffs on 128 U.S. products, threatening a deeper dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and the potential impact of a trade standoff on global growth. U.S. Treasury yields and benchmark German bunds rose as stocks on Wall Street firmed and as investors looked to Friday’s closely watched U.S. employment report for March. \nU.S. debt yields had dropped to two-month lows on Monday, boosted by safe-haven buying amid the rout in technology shares. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.45 percent as stocks on Wall Street staged a late-day rally on the turn-around in Amazon ( AMZN.O ) shares, which closed 1.46 percent higher. \nEarlier in Europe, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading shares closed down 0.45 percent. \nAfter being shut for Easter Monday and feeling the rout's impact a day later, Europe's main bourses in London .FTSE , Paris .CAC40 and Frankfurt .GDAXI closed lower. [.EU] \nTech stocks, following Monday’s U.S. downdraft, remained a pressure point in Europe .SX8P after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of Amazon.

REUTERS/Tilman Blasshofer \nReports that Apple ( AAPL.O ) intended to make more of its own parts slammed European chipmakers such as AMS ( AMS.S ) and STMicroelectronics ( STM.MI ).[.EU] \nAMS fell 2.28 percent and STM 2.97 percent. \nThe S&P 500 Information Technology index .SPLRCT has tumbled in recent weeks, ending Monday down 9.8 percent from a March 12 closing record. It rose 1 percent on Tuesday. \nThe fundamental picture of solid global growth and strong corporate earnings hasn’t changed that much, though a White House that was market friendly in 2017 has turned less so in 2018, adding a new twist to markets, said Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich. \n“If equities are going to find a solid foundation to recover some of the losses they suffered over the last two months, it’s probably going to be on the basis that companies can still demonstrate earnings and fundamental reasons their earnings story is intact,” Hatheway said, speaking in New York. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 389.17 points, or 1.65 percent, to 24,033.36. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 32.57 points, or 1.26 percent, to 2,614.45 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 71.16 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,941.28. \nSpotify ( SPOT.N ) shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an opening price of $165.90 per share, nearly 26 percent above the reference price of $132 a share set by the NYSE late on Monday. \nSpotify later pared gains but still closed 12.9 percent higher at $149.01. \nThe dollar rebounded from an early fall on concerns about U.S.-China trade tensions. \nThe dollar index .DXY, tracking it against a group of major currencies, rose 0.14 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.26 percent to $1.2268. The Japanese yen JPY= weakened 0.69 percent versus the greenback at 106.61 per dollar. \nAsia’s shares had stumbled overnight, though their moves had been small compared to Wall Street where the S&P 500 closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the European Union [.N]. \nThe slight recovery in risk appetite meant U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds and UK Gilts all saw a bit of selling too in Europe. Yields on 10-year notes US10YT=TWEB DE10YT=RR GB10YT=RR were all off two- to three-month lows. [GVD/EUR] \nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US10YT=RR last fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.7880 percent. \nU.S. crude CLcv1 rose 50 cents to settle at $63.51 a barrel and Brent LCOcv1 settled up 48 cents at $68.12.
