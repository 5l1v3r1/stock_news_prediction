MDP 0.19% in late January.\nAt the time of her departure, Ms. Wong was the highest ranking female executive at Time Inc. Her responsibilities included The Foundry, a studio that creates branded and native content for advertisers; consumer marketing; and digital advertising for Time Inc.’s brand portfolio.\nMs. Wong, 43 years old, said in an interview she has long been a Reddit user and had discussed the possibility that Time Inc. and Reddit could work together when she was at Time Inc.\n“It’s a community platform with incredible potential in terms of the way it connects people and enables intimate conversations,” she said. Her goals include increasing Reddit’s revenue, building strategic partnerships, and helping Reddit reach one billion monthly users.\nIn her new role, Ms. Wong is responsible for business strategy and growth. She’s based in a Reddit satellite office in lower Manhattan.\nMs. Wong, who helped Time Inc. increase its digital revenue and audience, has joined Reddit at a critical time. The social media platform that bills itself as “the front page of the internet” is betting on its ability to compete for ad revenue with Google, Facebook and Snapchat.\nReddit attracted 68.4 million multiplatform unique visitors in March in the U.S., up 24.6% compared with March 2016, according to media measurement firm comScore Inc. Research firm Alexa ranks Reddit as the sixth most visited website worldwide, and ranks it fourth in the U.S.\nThe company, which claims 330 million monthly global users, doesn’t report profit or revenue. Besides advertising, Reddit also generates revenue from a subscription plan called Reddit Gold that enables users to turn off ads for $3.99 a month or $29.99 annually.\nReddit is currently rolling out a desktop redesign that should be available to all viewers by early May. The company also recently introduced native mobile ads for Apple mobile devices and will extend that rollout to Android mobile devices in coming weeks. Several other new ad products are in the pipeline.\nReddit was launched in 2005 by co-founders Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, and acquired the following year by Conde Nast, a unit of closely held Advance Publications Inc. Ownership was later transferred directly to Advance. Following a $200 million venture funding round in 2017, Advance’s ownership stake was reduced to less than 40% including all employee stock options.\nWrite to Jeffrey A.
