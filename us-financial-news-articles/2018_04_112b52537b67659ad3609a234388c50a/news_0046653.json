The court gave no date for its ruling.\nArnold Subel, lawyer for Standard Bank, told the hearing the bank had found no suggestion that it was involved in any irregularity related to suspected forex manipulation and had been asking for the records for more than a year.\nThe regulator has recommended fines amounting to 10 percent of the more than a dozen local and foreign banks’ South African revenues in a scandal that has piled political pressure on local lenders.
