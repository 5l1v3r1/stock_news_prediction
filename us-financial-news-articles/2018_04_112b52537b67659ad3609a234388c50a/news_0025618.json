REBELS 22 JAGUARES 25 \nThe Jaguares came from 11 points behind at half-time to win a thrilling clash in Melbourne on Saturday with Bautista Ezcurra scoring a late winning try for the Argentine visitors. \nBoth teams scored three tries with the Rebels going over twice before half-time through Bill Meakes and Marika Koroibete to lead 14-3 at the break. \nDane Haylett Petty added a third try for the hosts soon after the break but the Jaguares fought back with scores by Sebastian Cancelliere, Ramrio Moyano and Ezcurra. \nRebels captain Adam Coleman turned down the chance to kick over a late penaty for a draw, opting instead for a scrum in search for victory. The Jaguares won a crucial turnover and held on for victory. SUNWOLVES 10 BLUES 24 \nWinger Jordan Hyland scored a brace of tries as the Auckland Blues ensured that the Sunwolves remain winless in this season’s competition with a 24-10 victory in Tokyo on Saturday. \nThe Japanese side, who defeated the Blues last season in their only previous encounter, led 10-5 at halftime thanks to Timothy Lafaele’s converted try and a Yu Tamura penalty before Hyland halved the deficit with a breakaway effort for the Blues. \nHowever, weak tackling from the hosts after the break allowed the Blues to forge 19-10 ahead on tries from Akira Ioane and replacement Dalton Papalii. \nHyland added his second try late on for the Auckland-based outfit, who will be pleased to leave Tokyo with their second victory of a slow-starting campaign. The Sunwolves have lost all seven of their matches in 2018. HURRICANES 25 CHIEFS 13 \nFlyhalf Beauden Barrett proved the catalyst for an excellent home victory on Friday for the Hurricanes that moved the Wellington-based side to the top of the New Zealand Conference. \nWith the Hurricanes holding a 10-6 lead at halftime, Barrett scored a brilliant solo try just after the break and then set up another for centre Ngani Laumape as the home side seized control of the game. \nWing Ben Lam had earlier brushed off three home defenders to score the opening try for the Hurricanes, while the only try for the visitors came from flank Lachlan Boshier.
