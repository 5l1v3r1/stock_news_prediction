Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, acting CFPB director, testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) semi-annual report to Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nMick Mulvaney, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said he should be trusted to decide matters concerning his agency and said employees were undermining his work. \n“I recognize that there may well be some (a few? A lot?) of people who work here who aren’t happy that I’m working here,” Mulvaney wrote in a memo to staff on Thursday afternoon. \n“That’s fine. I also recognize that those folks might be interested in undermining my leadership.” \nEarlier this week, Reuters reported that Mulvaney was seeking a $1 billion penalty against Wells Fargo & Co for harming customers of auto insurance and mortgage loans. \nIn recent weeks, Reuters reported that Mulvaney had dropped a case against a collection agency for payday lenders. Mulvaney’s predecessor, Richard Cordray, had hoped to collect $45 million in compensation for borrowers of the company, National Credit Adjusters. \nBoth of those stories cited sources familiar with the workings of the cases.
