That compares with a reading of 54.5 in February.\nThe March data is due at 0830 GMT.\nAn unusually cold bout of weather has been blamed for weaker-than-expected construction activity in March, and traders this week have shrugged off the data as they focus on any signs economic weakness could steer the Bank of England from its path of an expected interest rate rise in May.\n“For now, broader economic conditions still look consistent with the BoE following through with a widely expected rate hike at its next MPC meeting in May,” MUFG analysts said in a note, citing manufacturing data published earlier in the week that showed little sign of impact from March’s poor weather.\nThat predicted rate rise in May is largely baked into sterling’s price, and combined with Britain agreeing a Brexit transition deal last month and dollar weakness caused by a growing trade dispute with China have kept the pound above $1.40.\nThe British currency fell 0.2 percent at $1.4057 at 0800 GMT as the dollar gained more broadly.\nAgainst the euro, sterling was flat at 87.205 pence per euro .
