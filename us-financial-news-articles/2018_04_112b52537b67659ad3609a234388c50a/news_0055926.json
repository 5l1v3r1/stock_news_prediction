Increased government borrowing, together with inflation concerns due to rising commodity prices and bets on further rate increases from the Federal Reserve, have touched off the current bond market sell-off, with the 10-year yield currently trading around 3.03 percent.\nRoseen said the insatiable appetite for yield has spurred investors into bond funds in the face of Federal Reserve tightening. Year to date, taxable bonds have attracted $68.2 billion, while equity funds have taken in $67.3 billion, according to Lipper data.\nTrimTabs Investment Research also provided staggering figures: In the first quarter, bond mutual funds and Exchange-Traded Funds took in $74.1 billion, nearly four times the inflow of $20.6 billion “into key savings vehicles, even though bonds delivered negative returns and yields on savings vehicles continued to increase,” said David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs.\n“From a contrarian perspective, fund flows suggest borrowing costs are going to rise much more over the longer term than the conventional wisdom expects,” Santschi said.\nInvestors have also shown interest in commodity funds, which tend to do well during late-cycle recoveries. Those funds had estimated inflows of $167 million for the week, compared with estimated inflows of $1.12 billion in the previous week, according to ICI data.\nEquity funds had estimated outflows of $291 million for the week, compared with estimated inflows of $5.21 billion in the previous week. Domestic equity funds had estimated outflows of $2.42 billion, and world equity funds had estimated inflows of $2.13 billion, according to ICI.\nHybrid funds, which can invest in stocks and fixed-income securities, had estimated outflows of $1.09 billion for the week, compared with estimated outflows of $1.10 billion in the previous week, ICI said.\nThe following table shows estimated ICI flows for mutual funds and ETFs (all figures in million of dollars):\n4/18 4/11 4/4 3/28 3/21\nEquity -291 5,213 -4,499 -11,674 -13,766\nDomestic -2,416 3,776 -6,016 -12,377 -17,107\nWorld 2,125 1,437 1,517 703 3,341\nHybrid -1,089 -1,099 -930 -1,314 151\nBond 8,492 6,470 2,943 263 5,315\nTaxable 9,321 7,166 3,053 137 4,546\nMunicipal -830 -696 -110 126 769\nCommodity 167 1,120 547 -332 938\nTotal 7,279 11,705 -1,939 -13,057 -7,363 Reporting By Jennifer Ablan; Editing by Dan Grebler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T01:38:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
