(NASDAQ:JXSB) (the “Company”) reported unaudited net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $688,000, or $0.38 per share of common stock, basic and diluted, compared to net income of $760,000, or $0.43 per share of common stock, basic, and $0.42 per common share, diluted, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding at March 31, 2018 were 1,799,897 and 1,815,145, respectively. Basic and diluted average shares outstanding at March 31, 2017 were 1,784,584 and 1,805,522, respectively.\nNet income resulted in an annualized return on assets of 0.85%, compared to 0.96% during the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in net income of $71,000 during the first quarter of 2018 primarily reflected an increase of $504,000 in noninterest expense, reflecting professional fees related to the recently announced merger agreement. Partially offsetting the noninterest expense were increases of $81,000 in net interest income and $40,000 in noninterest income and decreases of $190,000 in provision for loan losses and $122,000 in income taxes.\nNet interest income increased $81,000 to $2.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 reflecting increases of $152,000 in interest income and $71,000 in interest expense, as compared to the first quarter of 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, our net interest margin was 3.44%. The ratio of interest earnings assets to interest bearing liabilities was 1.32x at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.30x at March 31, 2017.\nThe Company recorded a decrease of $190,000 in the provision for loan losses to a credit of $160,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to a provision of $30,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly and has determined the allowance for loan losses with a balance of $2.7 million, or 1.5% of total loans and 167.2% of nonperforming loans, at March 31, 2018 to be adequate. Nonperforming loans totaled $1.6 million at March 31, 2017, or 0.87% of total loans.\nThe increase of $40,000 in noninterest income to $1.1 million during the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, was primarily due to an increase of $114,000 in other noninterest income, partially offset by a decrease of $96,000 in gains on the sale of securities. The decrease in income taxes reflects a decrease in taxable income and a lower federal income tax rate.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $323.5 million compared to $325.0 million at December 31, 2017. Total deposits at March 31, 2018 were $261.5 million, compared to $252.7 million at December 31, 2017. Total stockholders’ equity decreased to $47.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $48.8 million at December 31, 2017. The Company reported a book value per share of $26.33 at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, Jacksonville Savings Bank exceeded its applicable regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 risk-based capital, and total risk-based capital ratios of 13.1%, 19.3%, 19.3%, and 20.6%, respectively.\nJacksonville Bancorp, Inc. is a Maryland chartered stock holding company.
