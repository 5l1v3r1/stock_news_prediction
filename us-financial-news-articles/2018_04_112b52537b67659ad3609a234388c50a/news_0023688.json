Olympus is a leading precision technology provider, designing and delivering innovative solutions for medical and surgical procedures, among other core businesses. Olympus' dual action lithotripsy system ShockPulse-SE®™ and CyberWand®™, currently manufactured by Cybersonics, will now be part of Olympus' urology competence. This acquisition will further enable the company to improve clinical outcomes, reduce overall costs and enhance quality of life for patients.\nIntracorporeal Lithotripsy has long proven to be an effective, less invasive method for breaking up stones in the kidney, bladder or ureter. CyberWand is a dual probe electromechanical device capable of fragmenting and aspirating calculi in the kidney, bladder or ureter. ShockPulse-SE, a dual action lithotripter, simultaneously produces both a constant ultrasonic wave and intermittent shockwave energy via a single probe to greatly reduce procedure time.\nMoving forward, ShockPulse-SE and CyberWand will be serviced and manufactured by Olympus' subsidiary, Olympus Surgical Technologies America (OSTA). OSTA specializes in innovative research and development and manufacturing of medical devices in North America. Intracorporeal Lithotripsy is integral to the current strategic growth plan for Olympus' urology business, and the integration of the design and production technology of these devices will further strengthen Olympus' position as a global leader in the urology market.\n\"We are thrilled to acquire Cybersonics' lithotripsy systems and add them to our already powerful urology portfolio,\" said Joe Doherty, President, OSTA. \"This acquisition supports one of our key strategic initiatives to drive growth in this core part of our business as we establish our design and production competence in lithotripsy, and allows us to leverage our internal manufacturing expertise to better meet the needs of medical professionals and patients.\"\n\"We have enjoyed a longstanding, mutually beneficial relationship with Olympus,\" said Geoff Bond, President, Cybersonics. \"As we look to the future, it makes sense that Olympus take over the manufacturing and design of the lithotripsy products in order to provide a seamless experience to the end customer.\"\nCustomers will experience no immediate changes in resources, services or contacts. More details on the acquisition will be available in the future.\nAbout Olympus Corporation of the Americas\nOlympus is a global technology leader, crafting innovative optic and digital solutions in medical technologies; life sciences; industrial solutions; and cameras and audio products.
