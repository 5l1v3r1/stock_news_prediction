This time, he benefited from strong run support and repeatedly got himself out of trouble. He allowed six hits and three walks while striking out four.\nCabrera exited the Tigers’ 9-7, 10-inning victory over the White Sox on Thursday with hip discomfort. He was back in the lineup for the second game of the series and knocked in the first three runs of the game.\nDixon Machado had two hits, including his sixth double this season, scored a run and drove in two more for the Tigers.\nAvisail Garcia’s sacrifice fly brought in the lone White Sox run. Lucas Giolito (0-1) gave up five runs on four hits in 5 2/3 innings.\nThe White Sox seemed poised to take the lead in the second but Fulmer wiggled out of a bases-loaded, none-out jam.\nGiolito’s control issues helped the Tigers gain a 2-0 lead the next inning. Detroit loaded the bases on a hit batsmen and two walks. Cabrera then drilled an opposite-field single to knock in Jose Iglesias and Leonys Martin.\nCabrera collected his third RBI of the game on a groundout that brought in Machado in the fifth. Machado led off the inning with a single and advanced on Jeimer Candelario’s one-out hit.\nMachado ended Giolito’s afternoon with his two-out double down the left field line to make it 5-0. That plated Victor Martinez and James McCann, both of whom were hit by Giolito’s pitches and then advanced on a groundout.\nGarcia’s sacrifice fly in the seventh off Alex Wilson ended Detroit’s shutout bid.\nThe Tigers scored the final run on James McCann’s bases-loaded walk off Juan Minaya in the ninth.\nChicago had two baserunners in the ninth but Buck Farmer retired Jose Abreu on a flyout to end the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T11:49:01.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
