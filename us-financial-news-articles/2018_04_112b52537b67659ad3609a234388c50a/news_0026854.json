We didn’t see any signs, any applications from the British side that they are not happy with the way Skripals were living in Salisbury.”\nSergei Skripal has been living in Britain since 2010 but his daughter only arrived last month, to visit her father.\nEarlier on Friday, the national security adviser to Britain’s prime minister told NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in a letter that email accounts of Yulia had been targeted in 2013 by cyber specialists from Russia’s GRU military intelligence service.\nYakovenko said he had not seen the letter.\nReporting by Alistair Smout and Elisabeth O'Leary; Writing by William Schomberg; editing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:03:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
