The 21-year-old suffered minor injuries.\nOne of the three attackers hit the 21-year-old with a belt and also tried to hit him with a glass bottle. A female witness placed herself between them and prevented any further violence.\nDeidre Berger, director of the AJC Berlin Ramer Institute for German-Jewish Relations, said the assault showed that people had lost their inhibitions against anti-Semitic violence.\n“We mustn’t close our eyes to anti-Semitism, which is becoming increasingly frequent in parts of the Arab and Muslim community,” she said. “We must not allow Jews on our streets to become fair game.”\nOfficial figures for the first eight months of 2017 showed nearly 93 percent of reported anti-Semitic crimes in Germany were linked to far-right extremism, despite predictions that a large growth in the Muslim population since Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis could fuel attacks or discrimination against Jews.\nGermany recently appointed Felix Klein to serve as the government’s first commissioner to combat anti-Semitism.\nThere has been a spate of reports of anti-Semitic bullying in schools. On Wednesday, education ministers from Germany’s federal states and the Central Council of Jews in Germany together presented material that teachers can use to inform their students about Judaism.\nHelmut Holter, education minister in the eastern state of Thuringia, said that Judaism was largely only talked about in the context of the Holocaust at school, and added that while this remained essential, education about Judaism needed to be broader to help reduce prejudices.\nReporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:17:45.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
