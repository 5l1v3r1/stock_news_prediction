Blackmon leads the NL with three homers, all in his last seven at-bats.\nShortstop Nick Ahmed drove in the only run on a fielder’s choice in the fourth inning for the Diamondbacks (2-1), who were attempting to win their first three games for the third time in franchise history, the last in 2012. Ahmed has an NL-high six RBIs.\nRight-hander German Marquez gave up four hits and one unearned run in five innings for the Rockies (1-2). Marquez struck out four and walked four. The Rockies’ bullpen gave up one hit in the final four innings.\nDavis, signed as a free agent in the offseason, converted 32 of 33 save opportunities with the Chicago Cubs last season.\nBryan Shaw (1-0), another free agent signee, pitched a scoreless seventh for the win.\nGreinke gave up five hits and one run in 5 2/3 innings in his first start of the season. The right-hander struck out nine and did not issue a walk.\nArizona second baseman Daniel Descalso singled with one out in the fourth inning and took third when shortstop Trevor Story could not handle Jarrod Dyson’s chopper in front of second base for an error.\nAhmed followed with a slow grounder to Story, whose throw to second forced Dyson, but Ahmed beat the throw to first base as Descalso scored to make it 1-0.\nThe Rockies had hits in each of the first three innings but got only one runner to second base, on DJ LeMahieu’s one-out double in the first.\nGreinke retired nine in a row after Marquez beat out a slow dribbler down the third base line to open the third inning until Blackmon’s homer leading off the sixth tied the game at 1.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T11:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:29:44.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
