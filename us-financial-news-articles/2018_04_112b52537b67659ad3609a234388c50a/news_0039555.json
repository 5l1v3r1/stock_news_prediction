We are happy to own them and run them.”\n“What we are trying to do is use the increasing demand for nickel and cobalt to our advantage and see if we can get something more than just an offtake agreement.”\n“As you probably know, the Chinese are tough negotiators, so you don’t expect them to come and offer a generous deal at the first instance. It’s a process.”\nNornickel sees potential for the battery sector to become the second-biggest target market for nickel globally, behind stainless steel. Stainless steel now accounts for slightly less than half percent of the company’s nickel sales, versus 80 percent in around 2013.\n“Batteries is something that catches the eye today. The other sectors for nickel are more traditional. They don’t experience the same exciting, double-digit growth,” Berlin added.
