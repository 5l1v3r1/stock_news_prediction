Netflix jumped 10 percent after reporting subscriber growth that topped estimates.\n“Constructive advertiser conversations, improving user growth, and positive revisions make a more compelling risk/reward” for the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note upgrading Twitter to an equal-weight. He had the stock at underweight, or an equivalent sell, for 2 1/2 years. The analyst raised his price target to $29, but said shares could hit $40 if user growth accelerated or the company found new ways to boost advertising revenue. The stock traded at $31.66 as of 2:45 p.m. in New York.\nWall Street appears to be opening up to Twitter’s stock after years of underperformance. Morgan Stanley’s upgrade is the eighth it has received since reporting a third-quarter earnings beat in October. It’s gotten one downgrade in that time as the stock surged 84 percent.\nThe options market is currently expecting a 14 percent move on Twitter’s first-quarter results, which are scheduled for next week.\n", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T00:42:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
