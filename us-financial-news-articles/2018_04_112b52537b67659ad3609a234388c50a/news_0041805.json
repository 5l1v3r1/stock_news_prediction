He has also denied wrongdoing. \nThe central bank said in January it had suspended four officers and taken disciplinary action against several others in connection with the allegations of irregularities in the 2015 government bond auction and it had initiated several legislative changes aimed at preventing irregularities arising in connection with future bond issues.
