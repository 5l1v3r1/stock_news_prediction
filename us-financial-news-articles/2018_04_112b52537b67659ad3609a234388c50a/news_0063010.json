Even though the company formally terminated relationships with those agents, employees at Panasonic “secretly continued to use those agents.”\nThe alleged payments came out the coffers of the company president’s budget.\nWithout naming individuals, the court filing said that “Executive 1” improperly certified that the company had internal controls over its financial reporting from 2005 until he was “separated from the company” in 2017.\nPanasonic’s former CEO Paul Margis was replaced by Hideo Nakano in February 2017, as part of a broader leadership shakeup.\nIn recent years, the Justice Department has offered companies leniency if they voluntarily disclose possible illegal payments to foreign officials.\nHowever, in this case, the Justice Department said the company only came forward after the SEC started investigating.\nReporting by Sarah N.
