(“ Tamarack ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX:TVE) is pleased to announce that the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “ TSX ”) has accepted the notice of Tamarack’s intention to commence a normal course issuer bid (the “ NCIB ”).\nOn March 6, 2018, Tamarack announced its intention to seek TSX approval for a NCIB. Under the NCIB Tamarack intends to acquire up to 8,600,000 common shares (“ Common Shares ”) of the Company over a period of twelve months commencing on April 6, 2018. The NCIB will expire no later than April 5, 2019. Any Common Shares that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled upon their purchase by Tamarack.\nThe Common Shares may be repurchased in open market transactions on the TSX, alternative Canadian trading systems, or by such other exchanges or marketplaces through which the Common Shares may trade from time to time. The price which the Company will pay for any such Common Shares will be the prevailing market price at the time of purchase.\nThe total number of Common Shares the Company is permitted to purchase is subject to a daily purchase limit of 139,059 Common Shares, representing 25% of the average daily trading volume of 556,237 Common Shares on the TSX calculated for the six-month period ended February 28, 2018. Notwithstanding the daily purchase limit, Tamarack may make one block purchase per calendar week which exceeds the daily repurchase restrictions.\nAbout Tamarack Valley Energy Ltd.\nTamarack is an oil and gas exploration and production company committed to long-term growth, through the identification, evaluation and operation of resource plays in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Tamarack has assembled an extensive inventory of low-risk, oil development drilling locations focused primarily in the Cardium and Viking fairways in Alberta that are economic over a range of oil and natural gas prices. Tamarack’s business remains solid and at times management believes the Company’s prevailing share price does not adequately reflect the underlying value of its assets. Due to the volatility in the stock markets and with commodity pricing, Tamarack believes that the Common Shares may, from time to time, be undervalued in the market and therefore constitute a good investment by the Company. As with all expenditures, Tamarack will remain vigilant in ensuring it retains flexibility and liquidity on its balance sheet.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
