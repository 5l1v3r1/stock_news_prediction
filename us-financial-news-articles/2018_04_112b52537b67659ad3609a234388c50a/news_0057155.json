Its shares are up 23 percent so far this year, sharply outperforming a 2 percent rise STOXX Europe Automobiles & Parts Index .SXAP.\nAutoliv has been winning a lot of new business at the expense of collapsed Japanese rival Takata in recent years, which has been at the center of the auto industry’s biggest-ever recall and filed for bankruptcy last year.\nReporting by Johannes Hellstrom and Niklas Pollard; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:05:20.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
