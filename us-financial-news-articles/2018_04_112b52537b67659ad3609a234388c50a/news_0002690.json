It was a good decision,” he added. “The win doesn’t just mean getting to Augusta. There’s a lot bigger things on the horizon.” \nSuch as, hopefully, the Ryder Cup in France this autumn. Poulter, a five-times European team member, said his win would tell captain Thomas Bjorn: “Hey, I’m here, my game is in good shape.” \nBut more immediately is the Masters, to which Poulter will go after returning to his Orlando, Florida home for a brief reunion with his family. \n“I need to unpack, have some chocolate with the kids tonight and repack for Augusta,” he said. \nCHEST-BEATING PUTT \nThe stars aligned for Poulter at the final hole in regulation play on Sunday, when Hossler grazed the hole with a birdie attempt that would have clinched victory. \n“He thought he had holed it. I thought he holed it,” said Poulter, whose 20-foot birdie putt was on a similar line. \nUsing the same putter he wielded so effectively to lead Europe to victory in the 2012 Ryder Cup, he came through in the clutch yet again to force the playoff. \n“I hit a great putt, good read and it obviously was very helpful seeing his putt,” Poulter added. \nHe punched his chest with his right fist five times in excitement after matching Hossler’s 67 after the pair tied at 19-under-par 269, three shots clear of Jordan Spieth and Emiliano Grillo. \nHossler then handed Poulter the tournament at the first extra hole, the par-four 18th, where the American hit his third shot from a greenside bunker into a water hazard. \nPoulter’s third victory on the PGA Tour followed previous wins at World Golf Championships events — the 2010 Match Play and the 2012 HSBC Champions in Shenzhen. \nHis chances of winning looked remote after he shot 73 on Thursday but rounds of 64, 65, 67 followed after he flicked what he described as a “mental switch”. \n“Last week was painful,” Poulter said. “To come here this week, I was tired, frustrated on Thursday. I didn’t play my best stuff. I packed my bags to leave on Friday.” (Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Nick Mulvenney/John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T03:43:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
