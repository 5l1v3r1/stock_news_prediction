(“ Movit ” or the “ Company ”) (TSX.V:MV.H) is pleased to announce that its shareholders have voted overwhelmingly in favour of certain matters in connection with its previously announced acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Ethereum Capital Inc. (“ Ethereum Capital ”) pursuant to a three-cornered amalgamation (“ Amalgamation ”), which will result in a reverse takeover of Movit (the “ Transaction ”).\nAt today’s annual and special meeting (the “ Meeting ”), Movit shareholders approved the continuance of the Company from British Columbia to Ontario (the “ Continuance ”), the consolidation of the issued and outstanding Movit common shares on the basis of one post-consolidation share for every 12.5 issued and outstanding shares (the “ Consolidation ”), a change of name to “Ether Capital Corporation” (the “ Name Change ”), adoption of a new by-law, and adoption of a share compensation plan.\nMovit Shareholders also elected the current directors of Ethereum Capital Inc., being Som Seif, Boris Wertz, Benjamin Roberts, John Ruffolo, Michael Conn, Liam Horne, Joey Krug, Camillo di Prata and Colleen McMorrow, to serve as the Company’s directors from the effective time of the Amalgamation. The current directors of Movit, Jeffrey N. Sharpe, Stephen D. Inouye and Jason Pamer, were elected as directors to serve until the Amalgamation.\nIn connection with the Transaction, KPMG LLP, auditor of Ethereum Capital Inc., was appointed as the auditor of the Company. There has been no reportable event (as such term is defined in National Instrument 51-102 – Continuous Disclosure Obligations ) with the Company’s former auditor, MNP LLP.\nThe Continuance, Consolidation and Name Change are to be effected prior to the closing of the Transaction. Closing of the Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions customary for this type of transaction. Subject to receipt of all approvals, the Transaction is currently scheduled to close the week of April 16, 2018.\nIn connection with the Transaction, Movit has made an application to the TSX Venture Exchange (“ TSXV ”) to voluntarily delist its common shares from the TSXV prior to the completion of the Transaction. Movit has also applied and has received conditional approval to list its common shares on the Aequitas NEO Exchange (“ NEO Exchange ”). The common shares of the Company will be listed on the NEO Exchange prior to the completion of the Transaction and will commence trading on the NEO Exchange under the symbol “ETHC” following the Company fulfilling certain standard listing conditions of the NEO Exchange including the closing of the Transaction.\nAbout Ethereum Capital\nEthereum Capital is a technology company whose objective is to become the central business and investment hub for the Ethereum ecosystem.
