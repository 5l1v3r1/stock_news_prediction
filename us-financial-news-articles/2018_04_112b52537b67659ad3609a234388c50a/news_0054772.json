REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo January-March profit for the world’s second-largest TV maker climbed 20 percent from a year ago to 1.1 trillion won ($1.02 billion), in line with the company’s guidance this month.\nRevenue rose 3.2 percent from a year ago to 15.1 trillion won.\nFILE PHOTO: LG Electronics smartphones seen inside the Class cellphone store in Beirut, Lebanon July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Aziz Taher/File Photo The TV division posted a 76.5 percent rise in profit to a quarterly record of 577 billion won, with an operating margin of 14 percent, led by sales of high-end television sets, including those with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens.\nFirst-quarter operating profit for the appliances division rose 8.2 percent from a year earlier to 553 billion won, on sales of high-margin products such as its premium-label refrigerators and washers.\nThe mobile division reported a 136 billion won loss, its fourth consecutive quarterly loss and smaller than the previous quarter’s 213 billion won loss. LG did not release a flagship model during the quarter and focused on cost-cutting.\nDuring the quarter, LG raised prices for washing machines sold in the United States by about $50 per machine, or 4 percent to 8 percent, after the imports were hit by a 20 percent tariff imposed by Washington in January.\nLG decided to absorb part of the cost of the tariff on imports, levied at a time when construction was well underway to build a new factory in the United States that will begin producing washers in late 2018.\n($1 = 1,079.7500 won)\nReporting by Joyce Lee; editing by Darren Schuettler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:36:10.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
