Fears that NAFTA could end had heaped pressure on the peso currency, and helped drive prices higher.\nHowever, official data showed on Monday that Mexican inflation cooled more than expected in March to the lowest level in over a year, bolstering analysts’ views that the bank would hold rates steady.\nBanco de Mexico Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon oversaw quarter-percentage-point hikes in each of his first two policy meetings, bringing the key rate to a nine-year high, after taking over at the bank in December.\nThe central bank said the recent drop in inflation was in line with expectations.\nIt reiterated that it expects inflation to keep falling, and chose to stick with previous inflation estimates. The bank has previously said it sees inflation getting close to its 3 percent target throughout 2018, reaching the target in the first quarter of 2019 and remaining around 3 percent for rest of next year.\nOn Thursday, the bank said it sees medium and long-term inflation around 3.5 percent.
