REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci \nThe Spanish veteran had looked doubtful for the third round of the season after fracturing his right wrist in a fall during the Argentine Grand Prix and having an operation in Barcelona on April 10. \n“Since the operation, I started feeling a bit better every day. I’ve been doing exercises to gain mobility and reduce the inflammation,” he said in a team statement. \n“Little by little I’m recovering muscle tone, and this allows me to see some progress. From here it’s difficult to know our real possibilities. \n“We’re going to a difficult track and until I’m back on my bike I won’t be able to really know my situation. But what’s clear to me at this moment is that it’s well worth it to travel and try,” he added.
