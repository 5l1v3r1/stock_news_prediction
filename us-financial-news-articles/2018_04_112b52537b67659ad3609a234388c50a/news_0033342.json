Jyske had tried and failed to divest its Nordjyske stake last year and decided instead to try to take over the whole bank rather than remain a minority owner.\n$1 = 6.0245 Danish crowns Reporting by Teis Jensen Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T14:50:03.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
