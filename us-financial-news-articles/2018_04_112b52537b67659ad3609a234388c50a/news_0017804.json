I’ve always said 2011 was a huge turning point in my career. I realised I wasn’t really ready to win major championships,” he told reporters. \n“I’m not in the lead like I was going into that day. I’m not protecting a lead. There’s not as much pressure.” \nMcIlroy needed to make a fast start on Saturday and he duly obliged, with birdies at three and four, and a tap-in at the par-three sixth, before holing a 70-foot chip shot for eagle at the par-five eighth to reach nine under par. RODE HIS LUCK \nSome good fortune buoyed him on the back nine as he sought to stay in touch with the surging Reed. \nHe parred the 13th after digging deep into the azaleas on the left side of the green to find his ball, made birdie at the par-five 15th after a wayward drive into the trees, and got a favorable bounce off a tree on his way to the birdie on 18. \n“I rode my luck a little bit,” he admitted. “Some days it’s with you and some days against you and today it was with me. \n“Now I’m in the final group and I have a chance to win another major. \n“I feel like Patrick has a three-shot lead and all the pressure is on him. All the players chasing him are pretty big time players. He’s got that to sleep on tonight. I feel like I’ve got nothing to lose.” \nReed will be going for his first major championship win, while McIlroy looks to join one of golf’s most exclusive clubs including career grand slam winners Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. \n“I can’t imagine there is going to be much chat out there between us tomorrow,” McIlroy said about his Sunday playing partner. “We’re both trying to do something special.” (Editing by John O’Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-08T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-08T04:50:11.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
