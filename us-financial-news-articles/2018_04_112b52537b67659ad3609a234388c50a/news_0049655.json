The document gave Cairo the right to veto projects higher up the Nile that would affect its water share.\nTHE 1959 AGREEMENT BETWEEN EGYPT AND SUDAN This accord between Egypt and Sudan, supplementing the previous agreement, gave Egypt the right to 55.5 billion cubic meters of Nile water a year and Sudan 18.5 billion cubic meters per year.\nBoth the 1929 and 1959 agreements have created resentment among other Nile states and calls for changes to the pact, resisted by Egypt.\nTHE NILE BASIN INITIATIVE Formed in 1999, the initiative brought together the then nine Nile Basin countries to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share substantial socioeconomic benefits, and promote regional peace and security.\nThe nine Nile Basin Initiative countries were Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Since then South Sudan has been added to the initiative.\nENTEBBE AGREEMENT Egypt froze its membership in the Nile Basin Initiative in 2010 after some upstream countries signed the Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA). Egypt has argued that the deal reallocated water shares without its approval.\nThe CFA, also known as the Entebbe Agreement, has been signed by six out of the 10 Nile Basin Initiative states. The signatories are Uganda, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi.\nEgypt wants an alternative to the agreement, which now allows other Nile basin countries to conduct projects along the river without its prior consent.\nTHE 2015 DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES Leaders from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan signed a cooperation deal in 2015 over the Grand Renaissance Dam in a bid to ease tensions. The deal was meant to pave the way for further diplomatic cooperation. The main principles in the agreement include giving priority to downstream countries for electricity generated by the dam, a mechanism for resolving conflicts, and providing compensation for damages.\nReporting by Maha El Dahan; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-24T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:46:02.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
