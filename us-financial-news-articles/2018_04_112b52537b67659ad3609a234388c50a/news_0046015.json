REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\nThe results announced Wednesday, particularly in Qualcomm’s smartphone chip business, were in contrast to those from major mobile phone components makers in Asia including TSMC ( 2330.TW ) and SK Hynix Inc ( 000660.KS ), which have warned of slower growth in their smartphone chip divisions.\nWhile revenue from Qualcomm’s modem chips business — its largest — rose 6 percent in the three months ended March 25, revenue from its licensing business plunged 44 percent, reflecting the loss of revenue due to a high-profile patent battle with Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ).\nThe results come as San Diego-based Qualcomm tries to convince shareholders it can boost earnings by cutting annual costs by $1 billion and resolving the Apple dispute.\nThe chipmaker is also awaiting approval from Chinese regulators for its proposed $44 billion (£31.57 billion) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV ( NXPI.O ).\nQualcomm on Wednesday forecast current-quarter revenue of between $4.8 billion and $5.6 billion, and adjusted earnings of 65 to 75 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $5.32 billion and earnings of 75 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nQualcomm’s quarterly net income fell to $363 million or 24 cents per share, from $749 million or 50 cents per share a year earlier.\nExcluding one-time items, Qualcomm earned 80 cents per share, ahead of analysts’ average estimate of 70 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nTotal revenue rose 4.9 percent to $5.26 billion, topping expectations of $5.19 billion.\nQualcomm’s shares rose 1 percent to $50.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday.
