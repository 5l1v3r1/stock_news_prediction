The Company’s initial loan balance of $3.0 million was paid down to $2.7 million, as agreed until the third quarter of 2017 when this retailer filed for bankruptcy reorganization and the loan was placed on nonaccrual status.

The loan also carries a $200,000 specific reserve reducing the Company’s exposure to $1.4 million. The Company continues to gather the latest information available to perform and update its impairment analysis. As more information becomes available, the Company will update the impairment analysis, which could lead to further charges to the ALLL. The Company maintains the ALLL at a level believed to be adequate for known and inherent risks in the portfolio. The methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations, both quantitative and qualitative, in establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date.\nInvestment securities, which excludes $3.9 million in stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (“FHLB Stock”), totaled $288.8 million at March 31, 2018, up 9.9% from $262.7 million at December 31, 2017 and up 9.6% from $263.6 million at March 31, 2017.

The decrease in equity from December 31, 2017 was due to a decrease in common stock of $4.0 million primarily related to repurchases made under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program and a $1.9 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income related to an decrease in the unrealized gain on securities, partially offset by an increase in Retained Earnings of $1.0 million due to the net income for the quarter less cash dividends declared.\nNet Interest Income\nThe net interest income during the first quarter 2018 was $4.7 million (a decrease of 1.5%) compared to $4.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 and the net interest margin as a percentage of average earning assets was 3.29% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.44% in the first quarter of 2017.

Much of the decrease in yields from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 can be attributed to a decrease in loans. When compared to the first quarter of 2017, average loan balances decreased $12.8 million (4.0%) from $320.1 million to $307.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe average balance of earning assets increased 2.2% from $579.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $591.9 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nAverage deposits increased $40.5 million (7.4%) from $545.9 million during the first quarter of 2017 to $586.4 million during the first quarter of 2018.

The decrease in noninterest income was predominately related to a decrease in income from the gain on sale of securities from $56,000 in 2017 to $1,000 in 2018.\nNoninterest expense decreased $80,000 (2.3%), remaining consistent at $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and 2018. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in other expenses of $81,000. Other expense includes costs such as insurance, director expenses, technology and telephone expenses, and bank charges. Also included was an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $36,000 offset by a decrease in OREO related expenses of $15,000 and a decrease in Occupancy and in Furniture and Equipment expenses totaling $20,000.\nThe fully taxable equivalent efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 increased to 64.8% from 64.4% for the first quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFederal and state income taxes decreased $210,000 (34.1%) from $616,000 in the first quarter of 2017 to $406,000 in the first quarter of 2018. The lower provision for taxes in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily resulted from the lower federal tax rate effective January 1, 2018 of 21% compared to 34% in prior year. Income before taxes also decreased $41,000 from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe first quarter earnings conference call will be held Thursday, April 19, 2018 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time (4:30 p.m. Eastern Time).

These measures include tangible book value and taxable equivalent basis. Management has presented these non-GAAP financial measures in this earnings release because it believes that they provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Company’s financial position reflected in the current quarter and year-to-date results and facilitate comparison of our performance with the performance of our peers.\nNet Interest Margin and Efficiency Ratio (non-GAAP financial measures)\nIn accordance with industry standards, certain designated net interest income amounts are presented on a taxable equivalent basis, including the calculation of net interest margin and the efficiency ratio. The Company believes the presentation of net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis using a 21% effective tax rate for 2018 and a 34% effective tax rate for 2017 allows for comparability of net interest margin with industry peers by eliminating the effect of the differences in portfolios attributable to the proportion represented by both taxable and tax-exempt loans and investments. The efficiency ratio is a measure of a banking company’s overhead as a percentage of its revenue. The Company derives this ratio by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of the taxable equivalent net interest income and the total noninterest income.\nTangible Equity (non-GAAP financial measures)\nTangible common stockholders' equity (tangible book value) excludes goodwill and other intangible assets. The Company believes the exclusion of goodwill and other intangible assets to create “tangible equity” facilitates the comparison of results for ongoing business operations. The Company’s management internally assesses its performance based, in part, on these non-GAAP financial measures.\nAdjustments made to reflect certain expenses\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded expenses related to a change in leadership as well as higher than historical income tax expense resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 31, 2017. Management believes that presenting the net income and earnings per share adjusted for these items provides investors with useful information in understanding the financial performance on a comparative basis.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained herein are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which involve risks and uncertainties.
