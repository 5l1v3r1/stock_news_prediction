Unless they repent of their sins and turn to God,” Folau wrote.\nThe comment triggered a torrent of criticism from social media users on his account, though he was also supported for his stance by some.\nFolau declared last year that he would not support the legalisation of gay marriage during a nation-wide plebiscite.\nAustralia’s parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage in December after the vote returned an overwhelming majority in favour of same sex unions.
