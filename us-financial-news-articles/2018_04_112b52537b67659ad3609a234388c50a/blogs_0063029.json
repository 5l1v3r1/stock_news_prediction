In theory, it should be able to reach speeds of 750 mph\nThe British billionaire called the venture “tremendously exciting,” touting that such pods, which go at “6, 7, 800 miles an hour” underground, will allow people to avoid traffic jams. Branson told CNBC that he hopes to build hyperloops “in a number of different countries, connecting countries, [which] will bring the world much closer.”\nIn the Middle East, Hyperloop One has planned routes in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also intends to build a route between Mumbai and Pune in India. For now, however, there’s only 10 kilometers of track being built —all of which is in India .
