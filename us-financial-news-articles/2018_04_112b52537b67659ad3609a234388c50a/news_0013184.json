It could also incentivize all automakers—U.S. and foreign—to move more of their vehicle production to the United States.\nThe issue is complicated because auto manufacturing has become a global enterprise and many foreign companies already have factories in the U.S. including BMW, Daimler, Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, Toyota, and Volkswagen. Toyota’s biggest assembly plant globally is in Georgetown, KY., where the Avalon, Camry, and Lexus ES 350 are produced.\nAnd many automakers, including the big three U.S. automakers Ford , GM , and Fiat Chrysler, produce cars in Mexico and other countries like India and Italy. It’s unclear if the Trump Administration’s efforts would affect cars produced in Canada or Mexico, which are party to the North American Free Trade Agreement along with the United States.\nOf the 17.2 million vehicles sold in the U.S. last year, 75% were assembled in North America, which includes Canada, Mexico, and the U.S.. Most of the remaining vehicles come from Japan, Korea, and Germany.\nThe plans pursued by the Trump Administration are only at a planning stage, according to WSJ .", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-looks-to-protect-domestic-car-makers-from-foreign-competition-1523037752?mod=djemalertNEWS"], "published": "2018-04-07T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T00:57:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
