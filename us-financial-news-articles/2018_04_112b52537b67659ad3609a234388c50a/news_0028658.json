A spate of turbulence in global stocks and concerns over a trade conflict with China took the dollar to ¥104.55 against the yen last month, its lowest level since November.\n“The market mood has shifted as (U.S. President Donald) Trump has seemingly backpedaled again on global trade and geopolitical tensions,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy, in a note to investors.\nOther areas of the currency market have shown increased volatility, however. Tensions between the U.S. and Russia took the dollar to its highest level against the ruble since late 2016 earlier this week, after Washington announced a fresh round of sanctions against the country last Friday. The Turkish lira, meanwhile, fell to an all-time low against the U.S. currency on concerns that a new government stimulus package would overheat Turkey’s economy.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, was recently unchanged at 83.79.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:37:50.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
