The U.S. Supreme Court will consider its legality this spring, and a decision is expected in June. \nTrump said in the proclamation that Chad had taken steps to make its passports more secure and had improved the sharing of information with the United States on known or suspected terrorists. \nChad has been an ally of the United States in fighting jihadist groups — some linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State — in the Sahel.
