Giannandrea who left a similar role this week at Alphabet’s GOOGL, -1.29% GOOG, -1.05% Google, will report directly to Chief Executive Tim Cook, the person said. \nApple AAPL, +0.59% didn’t immediately have a comment. Google confirmed Giannandrea’s departure. The New York Times had reported the hiring earlier. \nThe hire is the latest example of Apple’s work to bolster its efforts in artificial intelligence, or AI, an area of tech that is focused on developing software enabling computers to learn and improve functions on their own. The field is critical in areas like self-driving cars and voice assistants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T06:26:42.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
