We have already received very positive feedback from several airlines on our first mock-ups,” said Airbus cabin and cargo chief Geoff Pinner. \nThe first planes to get this option, in 2020, will be Airbus’s A330s—airlines will be able to have their jets retrofitted with the modules, or buy new aircraft with them in place. Airbus is also looking at the possibility of fitting the system in its A350 XWB airliner. Airbus and Zodiac's sleeper module. Airbus \nThe Australian carrier Quantas—a big Boeing (ba) customer—last month said it was considering using part of its cargo holds for sleeping berths, in order to make a proposed 8,900-mile Brisbane-Chicago route bearable. \nAccording to Agence France-Presse , Air France-KLM (aflyy) also came up with a similar idea back in late 2016, with the intention of giving more comfort to certain economy class passenger. \nZodiac Aerospace is a French company that makes aircraft components ranging from cockpit technology to waste systems. In February, it agreed to a takeover by the French aerospace giant Safran (safry) .
