Tax rates will not soon be lowered and rebuilding Hartford’s rainy day fund will take years, he said.\nHis proposed budget comes on the heels of two recent super-upgrades of the city’s general obligation debt from Wall Street agencies S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service.\nThe rating hikes came after final approval of a deal for the state of Connecticut to take over payment of Hartford’s roughly $540 million of debt.\nThe bailout, which came with state oversight and was approved by the legislature, helped Hartford, the state capital, avoid the need to file for bankruptcy.\nBut the deal has faced threats from Republican lawmakers, who said the agreement opens the door for other struggling Connecticut cities to seek similar deals.\nRepublican leaders in the state House and Senate said they would try to strip other municipal aid from the state to Hartford.\n“I don’t want anyone to undermine our city as a way of getting at me,” Bronin said in Monday’s statement. “I cannot let Hartford’s future become the casualty of a political fight.” (Reporting by Hilary Russ Editing by Tom Brown)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:10:15.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
