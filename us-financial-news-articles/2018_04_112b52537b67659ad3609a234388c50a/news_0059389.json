The CFTC regulates CDS indices, while the SEC has authority over single-name CDS.\nRepresentatives for Hovnanian, GSO and Solus declined to comment on whether the two agencies had made inquiries about the controversial deal.\n“[Hovnanian] is confident that it has acted properly at all times related to its financing transactions with GSO,” a spokesman for the New Jersey-based homebuilder told IFR.\n“Our policy is to cooperate fully with all requests by regulators.”\nDOCUMENT CHANGES Critics of the Hovnanian deal have been pushing for ISDA to amend the terms of its standard derivatives contracts to prevent the proliferation of similar cases in the future.\nEarlier this month, ISDA’s board of directors ordered consultations on possible changes to the documents.\nSpeaking with reporters on the sidelines of the conference, ISDA’s chief executive Scott O’Malia said the CFTC statement was a welcome development to the discussion his organization and market participants are having about potential changes.\n“This really puts the spotlight on it,” O’Malia said.\n“It will be useful in terms of having that discussion ... and as the board indicates in its statement, we are committed to doing that. We have to let that process run and at the end of the day hopefully we get some good reforms.”\nLawyers have said a number of approaches are possible, including linking a credit event to a deterioration in the financial profile of the company or raising the default threshold required to trigger a credit event.\nAs part of the deal with GSO, Hovnanian has agreed to miss only a small payment it owes to one of its subsidiaries to trigger payments on its CDS. It was not at risk of immediate default when it agreed to the deal.\nThe lawyers cautioned, however, that a definitive solution to manufactured credit events may be hard to come by, as the committees charged with determining whether a default has occurred cannot take a view on the “intention” behind a default.\n“The market is not always able, just through objective tests, to plan for anything that can happen,” said Powers.\n“Regulators can look past the objective transactions and make sure the market remains fair for all the players.”\nThis story will appear in the April 28 issue of IFR Magazine.; Reporting by Davide Scigliuzzo; Editing by Matthew Davies\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:29:31.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
