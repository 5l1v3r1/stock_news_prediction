She sold Desilu to Gulf & Western in 1967, and it was rebranded Paramount Television. Paramount became part of CBS nearly four decades later.\nAccording to the complaint, Paramount had applied for 16 \"Desilu\" trademarks but abandoned its applications, and CBS had not objected when Hensley applied for his trademark.\nDesi Arnaz died in 1986, and Ball in 1989.\nThe case is Desilu Studios Inc v CBS Studios Inc, U.S. District Court, Central District of California, No. 18-02961.
