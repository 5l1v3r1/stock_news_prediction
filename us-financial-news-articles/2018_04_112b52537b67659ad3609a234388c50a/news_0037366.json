It also has a museum and 13 restaurants and bars.\nDubai hopes the QE2 will boost tourism in the most visited city in the Middle East, which welcomed over 15 million tourists in 2017. Officials say they are targeting 20 million by 2020.\nPCFC Hotels spent an additional $100 million renovating the liner and has plans to convert Mina Rashid into a complex of luxury residences and a yachting marina.\n“Although we kept everything as it was in 1969, you also have the most advanced technology in the tourism industry in Dubai,” said Kenneth Todd, director of sales at PCFC Hotels.\n“For example, you can control everything with your phone, including check-in, room key, lights and TV,” he said while showing reporters a duplex suite.\nCunard’s Queen Mary 2, the world’s largest ocean liner, was also docked at Mina Rashid on Wednesday and sounded its horns to mark the occasion.\nReporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi and Tarek Fahmy; Editing by Ghaida Ghantous and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:15:16.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
