Gawker has been inactive since late 2016.\nUnivision Holdings Inc, the media company best known for its Spanish-language broadcasters, bought many Gawker assets, including the Deadspin sports website and feminist blog Jezebel for $135 million in 2016.\nThiel had funded former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan’s lawsuit against Gawker after it published a video of him in a sexual encounter.\nHogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, won a $140 million judgment against Gawker, forcing the website into Chapter 11. He later settled for $31 million.
