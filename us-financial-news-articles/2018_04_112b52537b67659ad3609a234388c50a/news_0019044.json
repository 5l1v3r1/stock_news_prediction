The charges relating to the two additional universities came in a superseding indictment unsealed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court.\nMerl Code, a consultant for Adidas, and Christian Dawkins, who worked at a sports management company, have also been accused of taking part in the bribe schemes related to Louisville and Miami.\nAll three defendants pleaded not guilty to the original indictment, in which they were charged with conspiracy. The new indictment additionally charges all three men with wire fraud.\nLawyers for the defendants could not immediately be reached for comment. Representatives of the universities and of Adidas also could not be reached.\nProsecutors said in the new indictment that in 2015, Gatto conspired to funnel about $40,000 to the parents of a student athlete to induce him to attend North Carolina State University and eventually to sign a sponsorship deal with Adidas upon entering the National Basketball League. They said the payment was made through a coach at the university, who was not named.\nIn 2016, prosecutors said, Gatto conspired to funnel at least $90,000 to the mother of a high school player to induce him to attend the University of Kansas and eventually sign a deal with Adidas.\nThe new accusations are part of a wide-ranging case over alleged corruption within the National Collegiate Athletic Association that has ensnared coaches and others.\nThose charged include Chuck Person, a former NBA star who became associate head coach at Auburn University; Anthony “Tony” Bland, from the University of Southern California; Lamont Evans, from Oklahoma State University and formerly the University of South Carolina; and Emanuel “Book” Richardson, from the University of Arizona. They have pleaded not guilty.
