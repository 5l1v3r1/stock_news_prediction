The law, which comes ahead of a general election, covers news outlets, digital publications and social media.\n- India withdrew plans to temporarily or permanently cancel government accreditation of journalists found to be spreading fake news, with Prime Minister Narasimha over-ruling the initial announcement by the information and broadcasting ministry. The accreditation is required to access government offices, news conferences and seminars and serves as security clearance at many other events.\n- In Singapore, a parliamentary committee has been reviewing possible measures to prevent “deliberate online falsehoods”. An eight-day hearing - the longest in Singapore’s history - drew to a close on March 29. The committee will prepare a report on possible new legislation in May, after parliament’s mid-term break, its chairman, Charles Chong, told the final session.\n- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has “lost trust” in news site Rappler and barred it from covering his official events, his spokesman said in February. Duterte has called Rappler a fake news outlet, making no secret of his annoyance at its reporting, which has heavily scrutinised his polices and the accuracy of his statements. Additionally, anti-fake news legislation, which would impose fines and prison terms of up to 20 years for spreading false information, is under consideration in the Philippines.\n- Thailand already has a cyber-security law under which the spread of false information carries a jail sentence of up to seven years, and the military government strictly enforces lese majeste laws that shield the royal family from insult.\n(This version of the story corrects name in paragraph six)\nEditing by Raju Gopalakrishnan, Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T15:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:24:10.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
