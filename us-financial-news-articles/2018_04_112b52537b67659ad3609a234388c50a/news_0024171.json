The Japan Core Alpha Equity Fund lost 7 percent. \nCEO Ellis had said in February that recent market moves had affected the group’s investment performance in some areas, particularly for momentum strategies. \nHowever, some long-only and long-short plays generated returns. The GLG European Long Short Fund, for example, made a gain of 3.8 percent. \nAfter a pullback in the company’s shares after full-year results, analysts described the net inflows reported on Thursday were exceptionally strong. \n“Today’s update reaffirms the strength and diversification of the group’s investment and distribution franchise and should, we think, prove a catalyst for a more constructive approach,” Credit Suisse said in a note. \nAssets rose mainly in “alternative risk premia”, an automated investment style, but also thanks to the launch of a $400 million European credit product and modest flows into computer-driven and discretionary long-only funds. \nMan Group also announced its intention to buy back up to $100 million of shares and said it continues to review potential acquisition opportunities.
