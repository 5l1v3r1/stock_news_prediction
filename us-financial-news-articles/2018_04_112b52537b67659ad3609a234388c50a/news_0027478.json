CANADIAN FRUSTRATION \nThere was also Canadian frustration in the 3,000m steeplechase where Conseslus Kipruto led Abraham Kibiwott and Amos Kirui to a sixth successive Kenyan sweep of the Commonwealth podium. \nOlympic and world champion Kipruto waved his compatriots home after the final jump as Matthew Hughes threatened to get amongst them, the Canadian throwing himself over the line in a desperate attempt to pip Kirui. \n“I’m absolutely gutted,” said Hughes. “The Kenyans just come in here and do whatever they want and no one ever tries to mess with their plans. \n“I tried to get in the lead there with the 250m to go, I just couldn’t get myself over the line.” \nJamaica, which failed to win a single one of the four individual sprint titles, again enjoyed success in some unlikely events. \nFedrick Dacres and Traves Smikle took a 1-2 in the men’s discus but it was Danniel Thomas-Dodd who sprung the biggest surprise of the evening by hurling a personal best 19.36m with her final throw to relegate Adams to silver. \n“Today I left my heart out there, it was a great fight,” said the twice Olympic and four-times world champion. \n“Danniel deserved to win today, she threw a massive throw. She’s young, she’s strong, she’s in shape...” \nEarlier, England’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson won heptathlon gold with a score of 6255, while Canada’s Alysha Newman got one of the biggest cheers of the night when she cleared a Games record 4.75m at the first attempt to win the pole vault. \nThat cheer might have gone to Gold Coast golden girl Sally Pearson had the world 100m hurdles champion not been forced to drop out of the Games with an Achilles injury. \nIn her absence, Nigeria’s Oluwatobiloba Amusan put together a brilliant display of high hurdling to power to victory in 12.68 seconds.
