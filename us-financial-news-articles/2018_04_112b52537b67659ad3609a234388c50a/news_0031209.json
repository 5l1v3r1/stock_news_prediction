We convinced him it was necessary to stay,” Macron said in an interview broadcast by BFM TV, RMC radio and Mediapart online news.\n“We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the long term.”\nThe United States, Britain and France said they only hit Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and the strikes were not aimed at toppling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or intervening in the civil war.\nLimiting the strikes to these specific targets was not necessarily Trump’s initial plan, Macron said.\n“We also persuaded him that we needed to limit the strikes to chemical weapons (sites), after things got a little carried away over tweets,” he said.\nWhile it is unusual for a French president to present himself as driving U.S. policy in military matters in the Middle East, Macron and Trump have developed a friendly relationship over the past year.\nMacron invited Trump to assist to Bastille day celebrations last year and will travel to Washington on a state visit later this month.\nSaturday’s strikes on Syria were the first major military operation since Macron’s election in May last year.\nHe reaffirmed that there was proof of chemical attacks, adding: “We had reached a point where these strikes were necessary to give back the (international) community some credibility.”\nMacron said that failing so far to get the red lines respected had led Russian authorities to think of Western powers that “these people from the international community - they are nice, they are weak”.\n“He (Russian President Vladimir Putin) has understood it’s not the case anymore.”\nMacron added that Russia, which backs Assad politically and militarily, had made itself complicit in the Syrian government’s actions.\n“Of course they are complicit. They have not used chlorine themselves but they have methodically built the international community’s inability to act through diplomatic channels to stop the use of chemical weapons,” he said of Russia.\nThe French president nevertheless said he wanted to engage in dialogue with all parties involved, including Moscow, in order to find a political solution for Syria. There are no changes to his planned trip to Russia next month, he said.\nMacron had warmer words for Turkey. “With those strikes we have separated the Russians and the Turks on this. The Turks condemned the chemical weapons.”\nMacron added that the strikes on Syria had been “perfectly carried out”.\n“All of our missiles reached their target,” he said.\nMacron, criticised by the far-left and far-right and part of the conservatives over the attacks, said France, Britain and the United States had “complete international legitimacy to act.” (Reporting by Laurence Frost, Michel Rose, Marine Pennetier Writing by Ingrid Melander Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-16T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T09:51:13.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
