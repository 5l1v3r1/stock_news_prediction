Sarksyan had previously been president for a decade.\nThe South Caucasus nation’s parliament is due to pick a new prime minister on May 1. So far, only Armenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan, who has led the street protests, has been nominated to the post.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan; writing by Polina Devitt; editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T22:47:12.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
