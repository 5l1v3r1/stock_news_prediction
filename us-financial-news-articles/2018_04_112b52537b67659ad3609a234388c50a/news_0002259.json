I was arrested without reason, and as a result my family had nothing to eat and had to collect trash to survive. To this day, I have no land or house.”\nMitr Phol said in a statement emailed to Reuters it had invested in Cambodia in “a good faith partnership” with the government and got temporary concessions in compliance with all local and national laws and with assurances from authorities that “all temporary concession areas had been processed legally and transparently”.\nIt said it had withdrawn from the project in 2014 due to a combination of factors including political tensions along the Thai-Cambodia border, business risks, adverse agricultural conditions and negative publicity.\nMitr Phol said after it withdrew from the project, it had recommended that the Cambodian government return land “to the affected communities”.\nSeng Loth, a spokesman at Land Management Ministry, which was responsible for the government’s involvement in the project, said when contacted by Reuters he was in a meeting and too busy to comment.\nGovernment spokesman Phay Siphan said he could not comment and referred queries to the Land Management Ministry.\nCambodia has awarded big concessions to foreign companies, mainly from China, Vietnam and South Korea, to operate mines, power plants and farms, in order to attract foreign investment.\nRights groups have said some concessions have led to forced evictions and land disputes.\nReporting by Prak Chan Thul in PHNOM PENH and Patpicha Tanakasempipat in BANGKOK; Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T12:48:59.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
