As opposed to iced coffee, where espresso is cooled with ice and generally mixed with other things like milk and syrup, cold brew coffee uses a whole different brewing process. \nThe lengthy process supposedly brings out different characteristics of the grounds , compared with traditional hot brewing techniques. Cold brew coffee is supposed to be smoother and less bitter, with more of a floral profile. Due to that lack of bitterness, it’s easier to drink black and sugar-free. \nDunkin’ Donuts has been offering cold brew coffee since August 2016, but with the seasons changing, it’s clearly decided that now is a good time to remind people about it.
