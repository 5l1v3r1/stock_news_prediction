Haniger is 5-for-8 with a pair of solo homers this season.\nEdwin Encarnacion hit two homers and drove in three runs for the Indians (1-2), who will continue a season-opening six-game road trip at the Los Angeles Angels on Monday.\nEncarnacion led off the fourth inning with a bases-empty homer off Leake to give Cleveland 2-0 lead in the fourth inning, after Bradley Zimmer singled in a run in the second inning.\nThe Mariners tied it at 2 with three doubles in the fifth inning off Cleveland starter Trevor Bauer. Catcher David Freitas doubled the inning and scored on a Jean Segura double to deep right field.\nAfter Haniger was hit by a pitch with two outs, Kyle Seager hit a bad-hop double to drive in Segura. Seager’s hard grounder toward first base kicked over first baseman Yonder Alonso’s head. Seager and Segura had two hits apiece.\nEncarnacion hit a two-run homer off right-hander Juan Nicasio to make it 5-4 in the eighth inning.\nLeake (1-0) gave up two runs five hits in seven innings as the Mariners (2-1) took two out of three games from the defending AL Central champions, who won a major league-high 102 games last year.\nEdwin Diaz pitched the ninth for his second save. He struck out the side for the second time in as many appearances.\nAlonso had two hits for Cleveland.\nLonnie Chisenhall singled and Roberto Perez walked with one out before Zimmer’s RBI single in the second inning for a 1-0 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:45:09.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
