REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\nThis could allow Deutsche Telekom to consolidate the combined company on its books, even if it does not have a majority stake in the combined company, one of the sources added. Deutsche Telekom owns more than 63 percent of T-mobile, while SoftBank owns 84.7 percent of Sprint.\nDeutsche Telekom and T-Mobile are also in the process of finalising the debt financing package they will use to fund the deal, the sources said.\nThere is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the sources cautioned. The companies came close to a merger agreement in November before SoftBank’s chief executive officer, Masayoshi Son, pulled out of the talks at the last minute.\nThe sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Sprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Liana B.
