The company did not disclose any details on the second offer. \nFidessa said it would put off the meetings on April 5 to approve Temenos’ offer to explore the possible new offers. \n“Discussions with the third parties are ongoing and there can be no certainty that a formal offer from either will be forthcoming or as to the terms of any such offer,” Fidessa said. \nShare in Fidessa, which have risen over 12.4 pct since Temenos’s offer on Feb. 21, were up 11.3 percent at 1300 GMT. \nTemenos shares fell 2.6 pct to 111.40 Swiss francs ($116.25). \n($1 = 0.7108 pounds)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T16:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:19:45.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
