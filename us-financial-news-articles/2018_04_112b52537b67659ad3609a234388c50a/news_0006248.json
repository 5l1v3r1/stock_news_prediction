There is no uncertainty that an Indian team might or can lose and it will be all doom and gloom thereafter. \n“This is what draws fans to the IPL every single day year after year,” said Majumdar whose new book, ‘Eleven Gods and a Billion Indians’, will be released by India and Royal Challengers Bangalore captain Virat Kohli on Saturday. \nSponsors are naturally keen to play ball. \n“As sponsor, and we spend money for publicity,” Mahesh Gupta, chairman of Kent RO Systems, told Reuters. \n“IPL is a platform which has the widest reach and quickest reach. It gives you the best return on investment. So we invest there.” \nThe water purifier brand has come on board as the title sponsor of Kings XI Punjab franchise and plans to spend 500 million rupees (£5.5 million) on promotion during the IPL. \nGupta said the sponsors are aware of the past scandals but believe the league had adequately addressed those concerns. \n“There were issues and they were rightly examined. In any event you’d have good people and bad people but the good people have outnumbered the bad. \n“Small issues cannot affect a bigger brand. It (IPL’s brand value) has not been affected. It’s become stronger and stronger and I think this season, with change in the broadcaster, it is looking even more attractive.” \nIPL’s commercial success has inspired several franchise-based leagues even in other sports, while consolidating cricket’s stranglehold over young athletes. \n“It has made franchise cricket a lucrative career option. Not playing for India isn’t the end of the world anymore,” explained Majumdar. \n“Playing well in the IPL allows a cricketer to be a star, get endorsements, get real serious money. It turns him into an overnight celebrity of sorts.” \nChennai return to take on Mumbai Indians in Saturday’s tournament opener featuring two IPL heavyweights who share five titles between them. \nRajasthan mark their comeback against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Monday with both teams forced into a late leadership change following Australia’s ball-tampering controversy in South Africa. \nFormer Australia captain Steve Smith stepped down as Rajasthan skipper while David Warner relinquished Hyderabad captaincy following the scandal. \nCricket Australia have banned both of them for 12 months, while they have also been barred from this year’s IPL. \nAjinkya Rahane will lead Rajasthan instead, while New Zealander Kane Williamson will skipper Hyderabad as the lone foreigner leading an IPL team in the April 7-May 27 tournament.
