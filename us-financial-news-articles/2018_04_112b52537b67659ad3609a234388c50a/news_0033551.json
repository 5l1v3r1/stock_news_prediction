(NASDAQ:SEAC) today reported fourth quarter fiscal 2018 revenue of $22.9 million and U.S. GAAP income from operations of $1.2 million, or $0.04 per fully diluted share, compared to fourth quarter fiscal 2017 revenue of $23.8 million and U.S. GAAP loss from operations of $24.5 million, or $0.69 per basic share.\nThe Company’s U.S. GAAP fourth quarter fiscal 2018 results included non-GAAP charges of $2.1 million, which consisted primarily of severance and other restructuring costs of $1.1 million, stock-based compensation of $0.5 million and amortization of intangible assets from prior acquisitions of $0.6 million, while fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results included $22.3 million of non-GAAP charges, which also include a $23.7 million impairment on our goodwill and a ($4.1) million recovery on loss contract. Non-GAAP income from operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.3 million, or $0.10 per fully diluted share, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 non-GAAP loss from operations of $2.1 million, or $0.06 per basic share.\nFor the full fiscal year ended January 31, 2018, the Company reported revenue of $80.3 million and a U.S. GAAP loss from operations of $5.4 million, or $0.15 per basic share, compared to revenue of $83.8 million and a U.S. GAAP loss from operations of $54.1 million, or $1.55 per basic share, in the same period in the prior fiscal year. The Company posted non-GAAP income from operations for fiscal 2018 of $3.9 million, or $0.11 per fully diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP loss from operations of $20.8 million, or $0.60 per basic share, for the same period of fiscal 2017.\nEd Terino, Chief Executive Officer, SeaChange, said, “We are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. We exited fiscal 2018 in a much stronger financial position with improved customer delivery capabilities and a product portfolio that meets evolving customer needs. We continue to see three significant trends developing in the digital media industry: video platform deployments in the cloud; increased video delivery via mobile devices; and a more personalized video consumption experience. Our core products and new innovations will better enable us to take advantage of these opportunities in the rapidly changing digital media industry, as we encounter changing business models accompanied by volatility in customer buying cycles. While we continue to focus on our core customer base of video service providers, we are expanding our “go-to-market” initiatives to adjacent market segments, such as wireless carriers, content owners and Internet Service Providers. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to drive overall revenue growth, increased profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal 2019.”\nPeter Faubert, Chief Financial Officer, SeaChange, said, “The fourth quarter marks our second consecutive quarter of operating profitability, evidence that our initiatives to reduce costs and return the Company to profitability and positive cash flow have taken hold. SeaChange’s fourth quarter and fiscal year results reflect the progress we have made in our restructuring efforts, as evidenced across all our key metrics – revenue, gross margin and non-GAAP EPS. During this fiscal year we generated more revenue from higher margin software license product revenue, improving our gross margin. Our continued discipline in controlling operating expenses, along with sequential and year-over-year improvement in our GAAP and non-GAAP gross profit margin, resulted in our return to profitability and positive cash flow for the year.”\nFaubert added, “Looking ahead to fiscal 2019, we remain focused on profitability and positive cash flow, while we continue to invest in innovative solutions for customers, even as the implementation of the new revenue accounting standard is likely to decrease by approximately $1 million to $3 million the amount of revenue we expect to recognize in Fiscal 2019.”\nSeaChange ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 with cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities of approximately $52 million, and no debt outstanding, an increase compared to approximately $39 million as of January 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nSeaChange anticipates first quarter fiscal 2019 revenue to be in the range of $13 million to $15 million, U.S. GAAP operating results to be in the range of a loss from operations of $0.19 per basic share to $0.15 per basic share, and non-GAAP operating loss to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.11 per basic share. For the full fiscal year 2019, revenue is expected to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million, U.S. GAAP operating results to be in the range of a loss from operations of $0.06 per basic share to operating income of $0.09 per fully diluted share and non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $0.10 to $0.25 per fully diluted share. Beginning February 1, 2018, SeaChange has adopted FASB Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The implementation of this new accounting guidance will impact the timing of revenue recognition this year.\nThese GAAP estimates are subject to a number of variables that are outside of management’s control, including the size of restructuring expenses, which are influenced by the timing of certain non-U.S. restructuring activities, and stock price fluctuations.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 results at 5:00 p.m. ET today, Monday, April 16, 2018.

We discuss non-GAAP income (loss) from operations in our quarterly earnings releases and certain other communications as we believe non-GAAP operating income (loss) from operations is an important measure that is not calculated according to U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP income (loss) from operations in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets, supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our Board of Directors, determining a component of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance and evaluating short-term and long-term operating trends in our operations. We believe that the non-GAAP income (loss) from operations financial measure assists in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage the business, to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace, and to establish operational goals. We believe that the non-GAAP financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision-making.\nNon-GAAP income (loss) from operations is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP. This non-GAAP financial measure may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies. We expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the financial adjustments described above in arriving at non-GAAP income (loss) from operations and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring.\nIn managing and reviewing our business performance, we exclude a number of items required by U.S. GAAP. Management believes that excluding these items is useful in understanding the trends and managing our operations. We provide these supplemental non-GAAP measures in order to assist the investment community in seeing SeaChange through the “eyes of management,” and therefore enhance the understanding of SeaChange’s operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:\nRecovery on Loss Contract. We entered a fixed-price customer contract on a multi-year arrangement, which included multiple vendors. As the system integrator on the project, we are subject to any cost overruns or increases with these vendors resulting in delays of acceptance by our customer. Delays of customer acceptance on this project result in incremental expenditures and require us to recognize a loss on this project in the period the determination is made. As a result, we recorded an estimated charge of $9.2 million in fiscal 2016. Subsequently, because of changes in the scope of the project and negotiations with the fixed-price customer, we recorded adjustments since fiscal 2016 totaling $4.7 million to reduce this provision. We believe that the exclusion of this line item amount allows a comparison of operating results that would otherwise impair comparability between periods.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets. We incur amortization expense of intangible assets related to various acquisitions that have been made in recent years. These intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. We believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for the Company’s newly-acquired and long-held businesses.\nStock-based Compensation Expense. We incur expenses related to stock-based compensation included in our U.S. GAAP presentation of cost of revenues and operating expenses. Although stock-based compensation is an expense we incur and is viewed as a form of compensation, the expense varies in amount from period to period, and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management, such as the market price and volatility of our shares, risk-free interest rates and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards.\nChange in Fair Value of Earn-outs. The change in the fair value of earn-outs payable to the former shareholders of the businesses we acquire is considered by management to be non-recurring and therefore, impairs comparability among periods.\nProfessional Fees - Other. We have excluded the effect of legal and other professional costs associated with our acquisitions, divestitures, litigation and strategic alternatives because the amounts are considered significant non-operating expenses.\nSeverance and Other Restructuring Costs. We incur charges due to the restructuring of our business, including severance charges and facility reductions resulting from our restructuring and streamlining efforts and any changes due to revised estimates, which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations.\nLoss on Impairment of Long-lived Assets. We incur losses on impairment of long-lived assets when it is determined that an impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets.
