The transaction also foresees a full price adjustment mechanism without time limit. Should Sulzer sell the shares for a lower price, it will be fully compensated,” it said.\n$1 = 0.9684 Swiss francs Reporting by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T11:23:03.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
