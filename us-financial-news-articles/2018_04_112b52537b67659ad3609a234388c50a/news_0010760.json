The S&P 500 gained 21.65 points, or 0.82 percent, to 2,666.34, and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.36 points, or 0.59 percent, to 7,083.47.\nMSCI’s emerging market index rose 0.86 percent.\nSigns the United States is looking to resolve the trade dispute with China lifted the dollar but limited an advance in oil prices because crude is dollar-priced and a stronger greenback makes oil purchases in other currencies more expensive.\nWhite House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said he expects the United States and China to work out differences and trade barriers likely “will come down on both sides.”\nThe dollar index rose 0.36 percent, with the euro down 0.35 percent to $1.2234. The Japanese yen weakened 0.60 percent versus the greenback at 107.44 per dollar.\nJoe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solution in Washington, said the dollar was boosted by a view that “Washington and Beijing might broker a trade deal that doesn’t torpedo global commerce or damage the world economy.”\nU.S. crude settled up 17 cents to $63.54 per barrel and Brent gained 31 cents to settle at $68.33.\nTreasury yields rose as investors awaited Friday’s closely watched U.S. jobs report, which will be evaluated for accelerating jobs gains and wage pressures.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.8302 percent.\nIn Europe, most government bond yields were up 2 to 6 basis points. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bund yield was trading at 0.524 percent, up 3 basis points on the day.\nGold prices fell as the apparent willingness to resolve a trade dispute reduced demand for bullion as a place to park money. The stronger dollar also crimped gold as it is more expensive for users of other currencies.\nU.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down $11.70 at $1,328.50 per ounce.\nMany suspect Washington will likely back down on some fronts after Beijing threatened tariffs on soybeans, the top U.S. agricultural export to China. Threats to such exports are a powerful weapon for Beijing given the potential impact on Iowa and other farming states that backed Trump in the presidential election.\nU.S. soybeans and corn regained ground, following losses of around 2 percent the previous day.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T09:26:40.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
