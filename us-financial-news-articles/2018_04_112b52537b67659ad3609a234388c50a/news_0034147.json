It has also mirrored the United Nations’ sanctions list, which covers 80 people and 75 entities.\nFinance ministers of the world’s seven most industrialized countries (G7) said separately on Wednesday that, despite international sanctions, North Korea still had access to the global financial system through “a network of agents, front and shell companies, and complex ownership structures”.\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-19T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T18:08:44.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
