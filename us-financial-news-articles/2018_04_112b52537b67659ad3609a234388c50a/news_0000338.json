With the latest additions — a Triple Melt Burrito and Triple Melt Nachos — Taco Bell is closing in on having 20 new items for only a buck.\n\"Back in 2017 we boldly shared our commitment to roll out 20 new $1 items in 2018 and are thrilled to share we're halfway there thanks to our latest menu additions launching this week,\" said Marisa Thalberg, chief brand officer at Taco Bell, in a statement.\nRead more from USA Today:\nSnacking alert: Taco Bell launches a line of tortilla chips \nScrutinized Tesla brags Model 3 electric car production could beat Ford's Model T \nAlaska Airlines ending several California routes \n\nThe menu's expansion shows the lengths that fast-food makers are going to try to compete at the lowest end of the market. Food that costs $1 generally leaves little room for profit, but purveyors typically count on customers to order higher-margin items like soft drinks to round out their meals.\nThose dollars can add up in a hurry, too, for a chain like Taco Bell, based south of Los Angeles in Irvine, Calif.\nIn this round, Taco Bell, a unit of Yum Brands , is also testing a crispy chicken taco in Oklahoma City and the Beefy Crunch Burrito in Chattanooga, Tenn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T17:09:49.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
