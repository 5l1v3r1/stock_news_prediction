Violence has spread throughout the country and now involves most of the nation’s ethnic groups.\nThe United Nations did not say which armed force carried out Saturday’s attack. Staff from another aid group, CARE International, were robbed at gunpoint while traveling in the vicinity on the same day, according to the statement.\nBoth rebels and the government forces stand accused of targeting humanitarian workers and sometimes deliberately blocking access to relief and hijacking food and other aid.\nNoudehou called for the release of seven other aid workers detained by rebels since March 25 when they were detained in the Central Equatorial region, near the Uganda border.\nThe staff from a local aid group, the South Sudan Health Association, were detained as they were delivering supplies to health centers serving thousands of people, the U.N. said.\nLam Paul Gabriel, a spokesman for rebel group SPLA-IO, said the group had detained the workers because some of them were government spies.\n“We are willing to release them (aid workers) but not all of them, those found to be (government) agents will be detained.”\nWriting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:57:51.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
