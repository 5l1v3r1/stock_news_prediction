The Wall Street Journal Good morning. New public-company disclosure rules tracking employee pay are underscoring the incentive behind supplanting domestic manufacturing with global supply chains, writes the WSJ’s Theo Francis. U.S. toy manufacturers Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. serve as an example for that.\nHasbro, which sells Transformers, as well as Star Wars and My Little Pony figures, paid a typical worker about $74,000 last year. Meanwhile, for Mattel — maker of American Girl dolls, Ghostbusters action figures and Barbies — the figure was closer to $6,300.\nThe numbers for Hasbro and Mattel highlight two distinct business models, at least for now. More than three-quarters of the 35,280 people who work for Mattel are employed outside the U.S. Most work in manufacturing plants, many of them in low-wage regions in Asia, including China. Mattel said in its proxy filing that its median employee is a factory worker in Malaysia.\nBy contrast, Hasbro, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., said it employed about 5,400 people on Dec. 31, or not quite a sixth of Mattel’s head count. A little more than half worked in the U.S. Hasbro makes little itself and therefore doesn’t own the factories that make its toys and doesn’t employ the workers operating those factories, even if it pays them indirectly through its contract manufacturers. That means the lower-wage factory employees don’t pull Hasbro’s median wage down.\nTHE DAY AHEAD \nJPMorgan Chase & Co. , Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. are among the companies slated to report earnings today.\nCFO JOURNAL EXCLUSIVE \nBrexit dampens job market in the City of London.
