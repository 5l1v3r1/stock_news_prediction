The most commonly detected hormone was pregnenolone, which was in five supplements.\nPeople who accidentally take adrenal or steroid hormone may experience symptoms like weight gain, hair loss, depression, acne, and stretch marks as well as a potentially life-threating shutdown of the adrenal glands, Akturk said.\nNone of the products tested mentioned any thyroid or steroid hormones on their labels or on ingredient lists included with packaging materials, the study found.\nThe study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how hormones hidden in dietary supplements might cause health problems.\nIt’s also not clear what dose of these hormones, over what period of time, might lead to side effects, said Dr. Pieter Cohen, a researcher at Cambridge Health Alliance and Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.\n“There is no question that if you take too much hormones they can have serious adverse effects,” Cohen said by email.\nBut the amounts in the supplements tested in the study might be too small to cause problems, Cohen said. Because the exact effect isn’t clear, patients should avoid these products, Cohen advised.\n“My recommendation is to stick to the vitamin and mineral supplements that a physician recommends,” Cohen said. “If someone is feeling generally fatigued or low energy but doesn’t yet feel the need to see a physician, I would recommend trying to eat healthier, get additional exercise and get some extra sleep as the next best step rather than looking for a solution in a bottle of supplements.”\nSOURCE: mayocl.in/2Hv9uhs Mayo Clinic Proceedings, online March 1, 2018.\n ", "external_links": ["https://mayocl.in/2Hv9uhs"], "published": "2018-04-25T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T00:23:35.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
