(Nasdaq:FTD) (“FTD” or the “Company”), a premier floral and gifting company, today announced financial results and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJohn C. Walden, FTD’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We ended the year with financial results in-line with our previously stated expectations. Our team is making significant progress on the key tenets of our multi-year strategic plan, announced in January 2018, which aims to rebuild FTD’s winning customer brands, recreate a network of strong florist partners, gain supply chain efficiencies and extend our business in complementary non-floral categories. Consistent with our strategic plan, we expect our operational results will not reflect meaningful benefits from the plan in the near term, as we invest in new capabilities and test new consumer offers in order to reverse negative trends from prior years. We are currently working on amending our financing arrangements to support these business investments and our long-term plan. Looking ahead, we continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to improve our business performance, generate growth, and reclaim FTD’s heritage as the world’s floral innovator and leader.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nConsolidated revenues were $278.1 million of 2017, a slight decrease of 0.9% compared to $280.7 million of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in Consumer segment revenues, partially offset by an increase in the International and Provide Commerce segment revenues. Foreign currency exchange rates had a $2.6 million favorable impact on consolidated revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet loss was $153.5 million of 2017, compared to net loss of $86.4 million of 2016. Net loss includes after-tax non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets of $169.8 million and $84.0 million s of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Also included in the net loss is a net tax benefit of $13.8 million related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This benefit results primarily from the application of the reduced U.S. federal tax rates to the deferred tax balances, which is offset somewhat by the transition tax net of allowable foreign tax credits.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $15.6 million, or 5.6% of consolidated revenues, of 2017, compared to $29.8 million, or 10.6% of consolidated revenues, of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the tables in this press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nConsolidated revenues were $1.08 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 3.4% compared to $1.12 billion in the year ended December 31, 2016. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted consolidated revenues by $8.1 million in 2017. The remaining change was primarily due to a decrease in Consumer segment revenues.\nNet loss was $234.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $83.2 million for the prior year. Net loss includes after-tax non-cash goodwill, intangible asset, and other long-lived asset impairment charges of $260.3 million and $84.0 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $79.8 million, or 7.4% of consolidated revenues, for 2017, compared to $119.8 million, or 10.7% of consolidated revenues, for the prior year.\nSegment Results\nProvide Commerce Segment: Provide Commerce segment revenues of 2017 were $140.7 million, a 1% increase compared to $139.0 million of 2016. A 7.5% increase in consumer orders was partially offset by a 6.1% decrease in average order value. Average order value decreased $2.26 to $34.83 due to a shift in product mix and was partially offset by lower discounts on products. Within the Provide Commerce segment, fourth quarter 2017 revenues for the Personal Creations business increased 10.1%. ProFlowers and Gourmet Foods revenues decreased 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively, compared to the prior-year quarter. Provide Commerce segment operating income was $6.1 million of 2017 compared to operating income of $13.1 million in the prior-year quarter.\nProvide Commerce segment revenues of $530.9 million for 2017 were relatively flat compared to $529.7 million for 2016. Average order value of $45.41 and consumer orders were essentially flat compared to the prior year. Within the Provide Commerce segment, 2017 revenues for the Gourmet Foods business increased 6.1% and revenues for the Personal Creations business increased 5.7%, while revenues for ProFlowers decreased 5.0% compared to the prior year. Provide Commerce segment operating income was $27.8 million, or 5.2% of segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $40.5 million, or 7.6% of segment revenues, for the prior year.\nConsumer Segment: Consumer segment revenues of 2017 decreased 12.8% to $61.5 million, compared to $70.5 million of 2016. This decline was primarily due to a 12.1% decrease in consumer orders and a $0.69, or 1.0%, decrease in average order value to $70.36. Consumer segment operating income was $3.2 million, or 5.2% of segment revenues, of 2017, compared to $7.9 million, or 11.2% of segment revenues, for the prior-year quarter.\nConsumer segment revenues for 2017 decreased 11.4% to $258.1 million, compared to $291.3 million for 2016. This decline was primarily due to a 10.8% decrease in consumer orders and a $0.53, or 0.7%, decrease in average order value to $71.23. Consumer segment operating income was $18.7 million, or 7.2% of segment revenues, for year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $30.2 million, or 10.4% of segment revenues, for the prior year.\nFlorist Segment: Florist segment revenues of 2017 increased 1.4% to $40.5 million, compared to $39.9 million of 2016 primarily due to an increase in products revenues. Florist segment operating income was $10.7 million, or 26.5% of segment revenues, of 2017, compared to $11.7 million, or 29.3% of segment revenues, of 2016. Average revenues per member increased 9.2% to $3,875 of 2017, compared to $3,550 for the prior-year quarter.\nFlorist segment revenues for 2017 decreased 0.7% to $165.7 million, compared to $166.9 million for 2016. Services revenues decreased due to lower order-related revenues and lower fees associated with online and other services. Products revenues for 2017 increased slightly, primarily due to an increase in sales of fresh flowers and other floral, plant and gift products to the Company’s floral network members, which was partially offset by a decrease in technology system sales. Florist segment operating income was $46.5 million, or 28.0% of segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.4 million, or 29.0% of segment revenues, for the prior year. Average revenues per member increased 5.9% for 2017 compared to the prior year.\nInternational Segment: International segment revenues of 2017 increased to $39.6 million, compared to $35.9 million of 2016. On a constant currency basis, International segment revenues increased 3.0%, or $1.1 million, due to a 2.4% increase in consumer orders and a 0.4% increase in average order value. International segment operating income was $4.8 million, or 12.1% of segment revenues, of 2017, compared to $3.9 million, or 10.9% of segment revenues, for the prior-year quarter. On a constant currency basis, International segment operating income increased $0.6 million, or 14.5%, of 2017 compared to the prior-year quarter.\nInternational segment revenues for 2017 decreased 4.4% to $146.0 million, compared to $152.7 million for 2016. On a constant currency basis, International segment revenues increased 0.9%, or $1.3 million. International segment operating income was $16.8 million, or 11.4% of segment revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.1 million, or 12.5% of segment revenues, for the prior year. On a constant currency basis, International segment operating income decreased 7.6%, or $1.5 million.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $52.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $76.2 million for the prior year. Free Cash Flow was $48.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $63.3 million for the prior year. Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the tables in this press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial measures.\nCash and cash equivalents were $29.5 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $81.0 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $192.0 million of principal indebtedness outstanding, before reduction for deferred financing fees, compared to $280.0 million at December 31, 2016. Such indebtedness includes $140.0 million outstanding under a term loan and $52.0 million outstanding under revolving loans. The reduction in debt for the 2017 period primarily reflects reduced cash holdings in addition to use of cash from operating activities to pay down debt. See Financing Activities section below regarding the current status of the outstanding indebtedness.\nFinancing Activities\nAs previously announced on March 19, 2018, based on FTD’s performance for the 2018 Valentine’s Day period and its outlook for 2018, as the Company works to implement its strategic plan announced in January 2018, the Company anticipates that it may not comply with the net leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants in its credit agreement as of March 31, 2018. The Company has entered into a Forbearance Agreement and Second Amendment to its credit agreement with its lenders which includes an agreement by the lenders to forbear from exercising remedies available to them with respect to certain defaults until May 31, 2018. The Company remains in discussion with its lenders regarding amendments to its credit agreement in order to enable the Company to be in compliance with the financial covenants under such agreement. The Company cannot give any assurance that these discussions will be successful.\nSteven D. Barnhart, FTD’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, “As a result of changes in the business and as we begin to execute our strategic business transformation plan, we do not expect that we will be in compliance with our debt covenants in all quarters of 2018, based on the current credit agreement, which was entered into nearly four years ago. We continue to work diligently with our lenders to amend our existing credit agreement, and we intend to pursue a refinancing well ahead of its maturity in September 2019. However, these covenant issues have required us to include a going concern disclosure in our financial statements issued today. Notwithstanding this accounting conclusion, under the terms of the forbearance agreement with our lenders, we believe we have the ability to continue making timely scheduled quarterly principal and interest payments under our existing credit agreement, and to meet our other current financial obligations due to vendors. In addition, we believe that we would not be required to include this going concern disclosure if we were able to reach an agreement with our banks that would provide adequate covenant relief, after giving consideration to our operations and strategic plans over the remaining term of our current credit agreement, or if we were able to refinance the credit agreement.”\nBusiness Outlook\nTaking into account the full year impact of 2018 year-to-date results, and the Company’s expectations for balance of year results, FTD expects that its results for the full year will be near the low end of its previously communicated guidance range for consolidated revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. The previously communicated ranges were as follows:\nConsolidated revenues of down 2% to an increase of 2% as compared to 2017 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $52 million to $62 million Capital expenditures of approximately $35 million to $40 million\nIn connection with the outlook provided above, please note that the seasonality of the Company's business impacts the quarterly pattern of its profitability and cash flows from operations.\nThe Company is not providing 2018 guidance for net income, the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA, and similarly cannot provide a reconciliation between its forecasted Adjusted EBITDA and net income metrics without unreasonable effort due to the unavailability of reliable estimates for certain items, including transaction-related costs, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets, and discrete tax items. These items may vary significantly between periods and could materially impact future financial results.\nConference Call\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call today, April 2, 2018, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

Statements containing words such as “may,” “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “projections,” “business outlook,” “estimate,” or similar expressions constitute . These include, but are not limited to, statements about the Company’s: ability to continue as a going concern, repay indebtedness and invest in initiatives; expectations about future business plans, prospective performance and opportunities, including potential acquisitions; future financial performance; revenues; segment metrics; operating expenses; market trends, including those in the markets in which the Company competes; liquidity; cash flows and uses of cash; dividends; capital expenditures; depreciation and amortization; impairment charges; tax payments; foreign currency exchange rates; hedging arrangements; the Company’s products and services; pricing; marketing plans; competition; settlement of legal matters; and the impact of accounting changes and other pronouncements. Potential factors that could affect these include, among others, the factors disclosed in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company’s other filings with the Commission ( www.sec.gov ), as updated from time to time in our subsequent filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, information under the captions “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors.” Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these , which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof. Such are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual performance and results to predicted. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision to these that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, the Company may not provide guidance of the type provided under “Business Outlook” in the future.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as measures of certain components of financial performance. The Company’s definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as set forth below, may be modified from time to time.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows for a period-to-period comparison of the Company’s operating performance by removing the impact of the Company’s capital structure (interest expense on outstanding debt), asset base (depreciation, amortization and impairment charges), tax consequences, other non-operating items, and stock-based compensation. The Company further emphasizes the importance of Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure by utilizing the Adjusted EBITDA measure as a basis for determining certain incentive compensation targets for certain members of the Company’s management. The Adjusted EBITDA measure also is used as a performance measure under the Company’s senior secured credit facility and includes adjustments such as the items defined above and other further adjustments, which are defined in the senior secured credit facility.\nManagement believes that Free Cash Flow provides a relevant measure of the Company’s financial performance and ability to generate cash in order to repay debt obligations, repurchase shares, and fund acquisitions or other business initiatives.\nManagement believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of the Company’s historical operating results and trends in its underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how the Company evaluates its businesses.\nIn addition to the use of these non-GAAP measures by management for the purposes outlined above, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are measures widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate the financial performance of the Company and its competitors.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not determined in accordance with GAAP and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A limitation associated with the use of Adjusted EBITDA is that it does not reflect depreciation and amortization expense for various long-lived assets, impairment charges, interest expense, income taxes, and other items that have been and will be incurred. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of the Company’s results. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditures and other investing activities, and Free Cash Flow does not reflect certain other expenditures, and these measures should not be considered by themselves as measures of the Company’s operating performance or cash generation capacity. An additional limitation associated with Adjusted EBITDA is that the measure does not include stock-based compensation expenses related to the Company’s workforce. A further limitation associated with the use of this non-GAAP financial measure is that it does not reflect expenses or gains that are not considered reflective of the Company’s core operations. Management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of its depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, interest and income tax expenses, capital expenditures, stock-based compensation, and other items within its financial press releases and SEC filings, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.\nA further limitation associated with the use of these measures is that the terms “Adjusted EBITDA” and “Free Cash Flow” do not have standardized meanings. Therefore, other companies may use the same or a similarly named measure but exclude different items or use different computations, which may not provide investors a comparable view of the Company’s performance in relation to other companies. Management compensates for this limitation by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures: net income/(loss), directly ahead of Adjusted EBITDA; and Cash Provided by/Used for Operations, directly ahead of Free Cash Flow, within this and other financial press releases and by providing reconciliations that show and describe the adjustments made. In addition, many of the adjustments to the Company’s GAAP financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring in nature and will be reflected in the Company’s financial results for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company also presents certain results for the International segment on a constant currency basis. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained consistent period-over-period. The Company’s International segment operates principally in the U.K. Management monitors sales performance on a non-GAAP basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into U.S. dollars. Management calculates constant currency by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period.\nDefinitions\n(1) Segment operating income/(loss) . The Company's chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income/(loss) to evaluate the performance of the business segments and to make decisions about allocating resources among segments. Segment operating income/(loss) is operating income/(loss) excluding depreciation, amortization, litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains, transaction-related costs, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets. In addition, stock-based and incentive compensation and general corporate expenses are not allocated to the segments. Segment operating income/(loss) is prior to intersegment eliminations and excludes other income/(expense), net. Please refer to the tables in this press release for a reconciliation of segment operating income/(loss) to net income/(loss).\n(2) Consumer orders . The Company monitors the number of consumer orders for floral, gift, and related products during a given period. Consumer orders are individual units delivered during the period that were originated through our consumer websites, associated mobile sites and applications, and various telephone numbers. The number of consumer orders is not adjusted for non-delivered orders that are refunded on or after the scheduled delivery date. Orders originating with a florist or other retail location for delivery to consumers are not included as part of this number.\n(3) Average order value . The Company monitors the average value for consumer orders delivered in a given period, which is referred to as the average order value. Average order value represents the average amount received for consumer orders delivered during a period. The average order value of consumer orders within the Provide Commerce, Consumer, and International segments is tracked in their local currency, the U.S. Dollar for both the Provide Commerce and Consumer segments and the British Pound for the International segment. The local currency amounts received for the International segment are then translated into U.S. dollars at the average currency exchange rate for the period. Average order value includes merchandise revenues and shipping or service fees paid by the consumer, less discounts and refunds (net of refund-related fees charged to floral network members).\n(4) Average revenues per member . The Company monitors average revenues per member for floral network members in the Florist segment. Average revenues per member represents the average revenues earned from a member of the Company's floral network during a period. Revenues include services revenues and products revenues, but exclude revenues from sales to non-members. Floral network members include retail florists and other non-florist retail locations that offer floral and gifting solutions. Average revenues per member is calculated by dividing Florist segment revenues for the period, excluding sales to non-members, by the average number of floral network members for the period .\n(5) Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) . The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income/(loss) before net interest expense, provision for/(benefit from) income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, transaction-related costs, litigation and dispute settlement charges and gains, restructuring and other exit costs, and impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets.\nLitigation and dispute settlement charges and gains include estimated losses for which the Company has established a reserve, as well as actual settlements, judgments, fines, penalties, assessments or other resolutions against, or in favor of, the Company related to litigation, arbitration, investigations, disputes, or similar matters. Insurance recoveries received by the Company related to such matters are also included in these adjustments.\nTransaction-related costs are certain expense items resulting from actual or potential transactions such as business combinations, mergers, acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, financing transactions, and other strategic transactions, including, without limitation, (i) transaction-related bonuses and (ii) expenses for advisors and representatives such as investment bankers, consultants, attorneys, and accounting firms. Transaction-related costs may also include, without limitation, transition and integration costs such as retention bonuses and acquisition-related milestone payments to acquired employees, in addition to consulting, compensation, and other incremental costs associated with integration projects.\n(6) Free Cash Flow . The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures, plus cash paid for transaction-related costs, cash paid or received for litigation and dispute settlement charges or gains, and cash paid for restructuring and other exit costs.\nContacts\nInvestor Relations:\nKatie Turner\n646-277-1228\nir@ftdi.com\nMedia Inquiries:\nAmy Toosley\n858-638-4648\npr@ftdi.com\nFTD COMPANIES, INC.
