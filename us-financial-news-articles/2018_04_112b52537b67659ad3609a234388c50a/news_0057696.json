Because there is no offense per se on human trafficking.”\nA 2016 study by the Justice Centre showed one in six migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong were victims of forced labor.\nSome 29,500 people are living in modern slavery in Hong Kong, according to the Global Slavery Index 2016 by the charity Walk Free Foundation.\nReporting by Beh Lih Yi @behlihyi, Editing by Jared Ferrie; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
