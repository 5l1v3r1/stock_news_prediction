He walked two and struck out eight.\nDarvish also had one of the Cubs’ seven hits, a double. He and Almora, who also doubled, had Chicago’s only extra-base hits.\nThe Cubs, who also won the series opener 1-0 on Thursday, out-hit the Brewers 7-4.\nSuter was pulled after five effective innings, having given up two runs and five hits. He walked one and struck out three.\nBrewers pitchers allowed three or fewer runs for the ninth time in their last 10 games.\nDomingo Santana doubled for the Brewers, who lost a second straight after having won eight in a row.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:30:54.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
