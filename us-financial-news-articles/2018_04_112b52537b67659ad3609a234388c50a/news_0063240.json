The man approached a group of journalists who had been corralled by police onto a street corner, stood for a moment and then blew himself up, the official said.\nSecurity forces scattered for cover at the site of a suicide attack in Kabul on Monday.

But more years of war between the Western-backed government and an array of insurgent groups has made Afghanistan one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with hundreds killed.\n“This is one of the bloodiest and darkest days in the history of Afghan media,” said Najib Sharifi, head of the Afghanistan Journalists Safety Committee, who confirmed the number of journalists killed in the attack.\nIt was also one of the deadliest days for journalists anywhere. According to Reporters Without Borders, the worst single attack on journalists occurred in the Philippines in 2009, when a private militia killed 57 people, including 32 journalists, during a political campaign on the island of Mindanao.\nWithin minutes of the Kabul bombings, the Taliban, which last week announced the start of its spring fighting season, warning of attacks on foreign troops and Afghan security forces, denied any involvement in it. Later, in a statement issued by its Amaq news agency, Islamic State said it had carried out the attacks.\nWho, or what group, actually carried out the attack was far from certain, though.\nIslamic State’s local affiliate is known to claim responsibility for some attacks in Afghanistan it doesn’t carry out, while the Taliban, the country’s largest insurgency, often denies its role in bloodshed if it deems civilian casualties too high.\nBoth groups, however, appear to be turning to ever more ferocious , high-profile attacks in Kabul and other Afghan cities to offset growing pressure they’re under from U.S. and Afghan government forces in the countryside.\nThe government of President Ashraf Ghani condemned the bombings as an attack on freedom of the press.\nHours after the Kabul bombings, an Afghan reporter for the British Broadcasting Corp., Ahmad Shah, was shot and killed in an attack in eastern Khost province, the broadcaster said, giving no other details. No one claimed responsibility.\nThere was bloodshed elsewhere in Afghanistan on Monday. In the southern province of Kandahar, a suicide car bomber targeted a NATO convoy in the district of Daman, killing 11 children who had rushed to the vehicles from a nearby school, local authorities said. The U.S.-led NATO force issued a statement late Monday saying eight service members, all Romanian, were wounded in the attack. No group claimed responsibility.\nAt the Wazir Akhbar Khan Hospital, where some of the casualties of the Kabul attacks were taken, relatives of the victims lined up to donate blood or scanned lists of the dead and wounded taped to the facade of the main building. Others vented their rage, some at the Taliban but most at the government.\nRelatives, colleagues and friends of AFP chief photographer Shah Marai, who was killed in the second suicide attack, carried his coffin in his village, Guldara, a district of Kabul province, in Afghanistan on Monday.

No!” he yelled. “They’re all living abroad. It’s just poor people’s sons who are getting killed every day.”\nA man who was injured in a bomb blast is taken to a hospital in Kabul on Monday.

He warned the photographer, he said, against getting too close to the bomb site, saying “What’s more important? Photos or your life?”\n“Photos,” Mr. Marai answered.\n—Preetika Rana in Hong Kong contributed to this article.\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T09:09:05.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
