REUTERS/Tony Gentil/File Photo \nItaly held an inconclusive election on March 4 and efforts since then to put together a government have got nowhere, with the 5-Star adamant in its rejection of the League’s longstanding partners, including former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. \nHowever, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio hinted at a possible solution after talks with the head of the Italian upper house senate, who is acting as a mediator between the parties.
