Accordingly, we extended the term of the Original Warrants to July 21, 2018 and reduced the exercise price of the Bonus Warrants to $0.40 to match the Original Warrants, so that essentially both sets of warrants have the same terms (collectively the “ Existing Warrants ”). The Original Warrants and Bonus Warrants are, therefore, cancelled and replaced with the Existing Warrants.\nThe Existing Warrants entitle the holder to acquire one common share at $0.40 per share prior to 5:00pm (Vancouver time) on July 21, 2018. However, under the Program, if an Existing Warrant holder exercises his or her Existing Warrants prior to March 30 th , 2018 – NOW EXTENDED TO April 6 th , 2018 (the “ Expiry Date ”) then they can do so at the reduced price of $0.25 per share and the warrant holder will also be granted an additional incentive warrant exercisable at $0.40 per share for 6 months from the date of issuance. There is a total of 14,620,745 Existing Warrants eligible and listed for trading on the CSE.\nComputershare issued and delivered via registered mail new warrant certificates for the Existing Warrants to all warrant holders. The certificates for the Original Warrants and Bonus Warrants are cancelled.\nIn addition to the Existing Warrants, there are 664,166 currently-outstanding broker warrants issued to agents (the “ Broker Warrants ”). The Broker Warrants are also included in the Program, however, they are not listed on the CSE and the Brokers would not have received a replacement certificate from Computershare. Brokers want to exercise their warrants under the Program need to exercise directly through Tower One.\nThe mechanism for Existing Warrant holders to exercise their Existing Warrants under the Program is as follows:\nSurrender the warrant certificate representing the Existing Warrants to Computershare by hand or courier at:\nComputershare Trust Company of Canada, 510 Burrard Street, 3rd Floor Vancouver, BC, V6C 3B9\nThe warrant certificate must be submitted together with: a duly completed and executed exercise form on the back of the warrant certificate, specifying the number of Existing Warrants that the holder intends to exercise; and a certified cheque, bank draft or money order in Canadian dollars, payable to or to the order of “Tower One Wireless Corp.” in an amount equal to $0.25 multiplied by the number of Existing Warrants that the warrant holder intends to exercise. All warrant certificates surrendered for full exercise of Existing Warrants will be cancelled by Computershare and will be of no further force or effect. Warrant holders surrendering a warrant certificate for partial exercise of Existing Warrants will received a new warrant certificate from Computershare for the balance of the Existing Warrants remaining.\nAbout Tower One Wireless Corp.\nTower One builds, owns, and leases a portfolio of wireless infrastructure assets to wireless carriers on long term contracts.
