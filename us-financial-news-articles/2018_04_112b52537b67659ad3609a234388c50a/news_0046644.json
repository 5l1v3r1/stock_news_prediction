REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo The company attributed the revenue decline to a new accounting standard and held its full-year profit forecast steady. Excluding the accounting changes, revenue would have been $38.9 billion.\nAnalysts expected revenue of $39.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nShares of the Dallas-based company fell more than 3 percent to $34.05 after the bell.\nThe company, which owns satellite television service DirecTV, lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers, fewer than the 257,000 customers analysts had expected them to lose, according to research firm FactSet.\nAs more viewers seek to cut pay-TV packages, AT&T added 312,000 customers to its DirecTV Now streaming service.\nThe Time Warner deal, which would give AT&T access to content like HBO’s “Game of Thrones” and Warner Bros’ “Justice League,” reflects AT&T&rsquo;s effort to compete for advertising dollars against Alphabet’s ( GOOGL.O ) Google and Facebook ( FB.O ).\nAT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson surprised investors last week when he said during trial testimony that the company would introduce a new video service called AT&T Watch, a package of TV channels without sports, for $15 per month.\nReporting by Sheila Dang in New York and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Scott Malone\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-26T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T23:23:17.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
