Initially, the program was supposed to be expanded this year to include workers as well as non-workers, but instead the monthly payouts to these individuals will end in 2019. \nThe basic income experiment was proposed as a solution to the unemployment rate in Finland, which reached a 17-year high of 10% in 2015 . The payouts were designed to support citizens while encouraging them to find work, since the country’s other welfare benefits don’t apply to people once they are employed. \nBut in December, the Finnish parliament passed a bill that requires jobseekers to work 18 hours minimum for three months , making unemployment benefits contingent on finding some work. \n“Right now, the government is making changes that are taking the system further away from a basic income,” Kela researcher Miska Simanainen told the Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet . \nWhile 70% of Finns supported the idea of basic income , surveys show that number drops to 35% when respondents are told that already-high income taxes would have to increase in order to cover the cost of the program. \nMany participants reported lower stress levels shortly after the payments began, but researchers emphasize that the short duration of the program prevents them from drawing definitive conclusions about its effects. Kela will follow up with the Finns who participated for ten years , in order to identify the long-term effects of the program. \nThe idea of universal basic income has some powerful supporters in the U.S. as well, including many leaders in Silicon Valley from Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to Facebook’s Mark Zuckerburg .
