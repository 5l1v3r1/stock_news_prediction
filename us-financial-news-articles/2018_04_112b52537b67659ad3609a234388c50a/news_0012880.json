Apple also removed a number of other low-quality apps from the App Store in 2017, including those that were clones of other apps that already existed in the store. \nHowever, the removal of old apps wasn’t the only reason for the decline. Appfigures notes that just 755,000 apps were released for iOS last year, a 29% drop from 2016. In contrast, 1.5 million apps were released for Android last year, marking a 17% year-over-year increase.
