The Israeli military estimated Friday’s turnout at around 20,000. \nRefugees comprise most of the 2 million population of Israeli-blockaded Gaza, an enclave ruled by the Islamist movement Hamas which calls for Israel’s destruction and is designated by Western states as a terrorist organization. \nMany of those killed were militants, said Israel, which stationed sharpshooters on the frontier to stop Palestinians attempting “any breach of the security infrastructure and fence, which protects Israeli civilians”. \nWAR OF WORDS David Keyes, an Israeli government spokesman, accused Hamas of having instigated violent protests along the border. \n“This is a travesty for the Palestinian people that the Hamas government is encouraging its people to attack Israel, it is encouraging its people to commit acts of violence,” he said. \n\nA Palestinian protects himself from inhaling tear gas at the Israel-Gaza border during a protest demanding the right to return to their homeland, in the southern Gaza Strip April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa Hamas’s Gaza leader, Yehya Al-Sinwar, spoke at a protest encampment to praise those who turned out to confront the “enemy who besieges us”. He said the demonstrations would continue, telling the crowds: “We will uproot the borders, we will pluck out their hearts, and we will pray in Jerusalem.” \nEarlier, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem urged protesters to keep the rallies peaceful. “Maintaining the peaceful nature of the protests will strike all fragile Zionist propaganda,” Qassem said in a statement. \nIsrael’s response to the protests has drawn international criticism, with human rights groups saying it involved live fire against demonstrators posing no immediate threat to life. \nThe demonstrators have revived a longstanding demand for the right of return of Palestinian refugees to towns and villages which their families fled from, or were driven out of, when the state of Israel was created. \nThe Israeli government has ruled out any right of return, fearing that the country would lose its Jewish majority. \nPalestinian youths burned Israeli flags and planted Palestinian banners on dirt mounds beside tented encampments as others arrived on large trucks carrying piles of more tyres to burn. Others launched stones with slingshots. \nWith Israeli tear gas rising into the air, Palestinian youths used T-shirts, cheap medical masks and perfume to try and protect themselves. Israel tried to douse the burning rubber with jets of water directed over defensive dirt mounds on its side of the border. \nA U.N. human rights spokeswoman urged Israel to exercise restraint against the Palestinian protesters. “We are saying that Israel has obligations to ensure that excessive force is not employed. And that if there is unjustified and unlawful recourse to firearms, resulting in death, that may amount to a wilful killing,” Elizabeth Throssell said in Geneva. \nIsrael says it is doing what it must to defend its border and that its troops have been responding with riot dispersal means and fire “in accordance with the rules of engagement”. \nThe Palestinian deaths have elicited scant concern in Israel, which has been the target of thousands of rocket strikes from Gaza over the past few years. \n\nSlideshow (4 Images) Palestinian militant groups have also dug tunnels under the border fence to smuggle weapons, and to launch attacks. \nAdditional reporting by Eli Berlzon and Amir Cohen on the Gaza border, Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; writing by Stephen Farrell and Ori Lewis; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T09:55:44.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
