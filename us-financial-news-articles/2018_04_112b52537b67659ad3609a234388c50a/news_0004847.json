REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo For the first three months of the year, sales volume totaled about 321,900 vehicles, up 8.7 percent from the same period a year ago.\nToyota aims to sell 1.4 million vehicles in China in 2018, nearly 9 percent more than it sold last year. Toyota insiders have described the target as a stretch goal, in part because of production constraints and other hurdles.\nToyota’s forecast for 2018 is relatively more upbeat than the previous few years, partly as it expects to launch later this year a couple of potentially high-volume subcompact sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) — two China-market versions of the subcompact Toyota CH-R crossover SUV.\nThe CH-R hit showrooms in the United States in April last year.\nReporting By Norihiko Shirouzu; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T13:59:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
