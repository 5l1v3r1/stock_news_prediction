One security technique to help protect against that involves using “data diodes” which allows one-way transfers of data throughout a network and physically prevents data from coming into the network, Mr. Zornio said.\n“The real danger is that you take over a refinery and cause an explosion or take over a power plant and shut it down or damage it irreparably,” Mr. Zornio said.\nEmployees are often the weakest link and training the workforce about how to identify phishing emails is important, he said.\nThe company has boosted its investment in cybersecurity technologies, trainings, staff and certifications by about 50% annually for the past three or four years, Mr. Zornio said. Investing in cybersecurity is crucial, but it won’t guarantee that a company will never be attacked.\nStill, being more secure than a competitor could prove to be extremely beneficial, he said. “If you’ve got an alarm system, your door is locked and you’ve got a German Shepherd barking loudly, (the attackers) are going to go to your neighbor,” he said.\nSuzette Kent, federal chief information officer, said corporate CIOs should “take these alerts seriously.” She recommends a so-called pulse check with the corporate security team and corporate leadership.\n“As CIO, you want to provide some assurance that your team is able to ingest and respond to these types of alerts with minimal disruption,” said Ms. Kent, formerly principal at Ernst & Young, who was appointed federal CIO earlier this year .\n“You also want to level-set with leadership when these alerts are critical, their potential impact on core services, and of course, to escalate quickly when you need additional resources to mitigate those risks,” she continued.\n \nShare this: CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE CYBERSECURITY EMERSON PETER ZORNIO RUSSIA SUZETTE KENT Previous The Morning Download: The Corporate Network Becomes the Cyber Battlefield Next CIOs Face Growing Challenges of User Data Governance", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T23:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T03:56:06.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
