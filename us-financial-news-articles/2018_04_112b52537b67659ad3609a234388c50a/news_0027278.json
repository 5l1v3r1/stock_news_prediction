It won’t be easy - it’s not an easy issue, none of this is,” a senior government official said ahead of the meeting.\nBritish Columbia premier John Horgan told reporters on Saturday he wanted to protect his province against “the catastrophic consequences” of a pipeline leak.\nHe wants Ottawa to refer the matter to the Supreme Court but the Liberals are not interested, saying it is already clear the federal government has jurisdiction over the project.\nHorgan’s office says he plans to speak to reporters at 11 am, suggesting he will not be talking for long to Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley. Trudeau is set to face the media at 1 p.m. (Reporting by David Ljunggren Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T20:17:27.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
