The real challenge is, are these impairments completely done or will there be more to come,” one said.\nBayet said 12.5 billion naira of the impairment was for a road project leading to its cement plant in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar which had taken too long to construct. The rest covered restructuring costs associated with merging its Nigerian operations, and its loss-making assets in South Africa, where the firm had changed its management team.\nHe said core profit doubled to 58 billion naira in 2017.\n($1 = 314.50 naira)\nReporting by Chijioke Ohuocha; Editing by Jane Merriman and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T12:29:06.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
