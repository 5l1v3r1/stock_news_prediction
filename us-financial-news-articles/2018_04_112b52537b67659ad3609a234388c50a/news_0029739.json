The final pact was a compromise between groups and countries including the European Union, China, and other Asia and Pacific nations that pushed for reductions in emissions by as much as 70% and the U.S., Argentina, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, among others, that pushed for lower targets. \nOf the 173 IMO-member states, only the U.S. and Saudi Arabia, objected to the draft IMO agreement that was circulated late Thursday and seen by The Wall Street Journal. They didn’t explain their objections.\n“The text may not be satisfactory to all but it represents a strong middle ground,” said Kitack Lim, the IMO’s secretary-general. “This compromise is a solution that should be able to keep everyone on board.”\nShipping contributes about 3% of total annual carbon dioxide, or CO2, world-wide emissions, about the same as an economy the size of Germany, according to an IMO study. But vessel emissions are projected to increase by between 50% and 250% by 2050 as global trade grows and carriers add capacity without any action to intervene. \nThe IMO reductions would aim to cut carbon emissions to half the 2008 carbon dioxide levels.\nThe emission cuts will also affect thousands of exporters world-wide. Brazil, for example, exports large amounts of iron ore to China and fears strong caps will push up freight rates, helping rival Australia, whose iron exports sail half the distance to China.\nSlow steaming, in which ships purposely throttle back to slower speeds, is also an anathema for countries exporting perishable goods like cherries from Chile and meat from Argentina.\n‘ The plan is far from perfect, but the direction is now clear—a phaseout of carbon emissions. ’ \n—Veronica Frank of Greenpeace. Some countries with big shipping registries like the low-lying Marshall Islands, that want to stop the effects of climate change, led the call for strong cuts. \nShipping executives warned that some operators won’t be able to afford the cost of the emission cuts and may face bankruptcy or abandon operations altogether.\nThe carbon cost comes on top of an estimated $40 billion bill for the industry to cut sulfur emissions, either by using cleaner fuels or by installing a device that treats a ship’s exhaust before releasing it. The deadline for the sulfur cuts in Jan. 1, 2020.\nEnvironmental groups like Greenpeace said the IMO deal is a first step, but more needs to be done.\n“The plan is far from perfect, but the direction is now clear—a phaseout of carbon emissions,” Greenpeace adviser Veronica Frank said in a statement. “The initial deal will be revised in 2023 and reviewed again in 2028, giving opportunities to strengthen the targets.”\nWrite to Costas Paris at costas.paris@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T00:04:52.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
