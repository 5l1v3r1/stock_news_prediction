You can’t transact with it. If you transact with it, your bank accounts are going to be shut.”\nVirtual currencies raise concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others, the RBI said on Thursday.\n“If the government stands firm on their decision then we will have to eventually pivot our business model from crypto-fiat to crypto-crypto hence omitting the fiat part in totality,” said Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, a cryptocurrency exchange.
