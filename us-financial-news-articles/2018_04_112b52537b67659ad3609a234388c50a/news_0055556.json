I can’t be managed,” he wrote later. West’s manager, Scooter Braun, did not reply to a request for comment.\nIn the last several days, West has said he would release four new albums in June.\nWest, who in 2015 said he was considering running for the White House, has also returned to the presidential theme, tweeting simply “2024” and “When we become president we have to change the name of the plane from Air Force one to Yeezy force one.”\nWest’s representatives did not return a request for comment, but his wife, Kim Kardashian, addressed him directly on the social media platform after he tweeted a photo that was apparently taken inside the couple’s Southern California home.\n“Ummm babe. We had a rule to not show our home on social media! Soooo can we now allow KUWTK filming in the home?,” Kardashian wrote on Wednesday, referring to the TV show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.” (Reporting by Jill Serjeant Editing by Scott Malone)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:15:24.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
