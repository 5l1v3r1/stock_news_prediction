The judge said the law appeared to reserve that power only for humans.\nThe court ruled that Slater was entitled to attorneys' fees in the case and sent it back to the district court to determine the amount.\nNaruto snapped the photos with an unattended camera while Slater was on a trip to Sulawesi, Indonesia. Slater later argued that his company, Wildlife Personalities Ltd., owned worldwide commercial rights to the photos.\nU.S. District Judge William Orrick said in a ruling in 2016 that \"while Congress and the president can extend the protection of law to animals as well as humans, there is no indication that they did so in the Copyright Act.\"\nPETA appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit.\nFollowing oral arguments, Slater and PETA announced in September that they had reached a settlement under which Slater agreed to donate 25 percent of any future revenue from the images to charities dedicated to protecting crested macaques in Indonesia.\nLawyers then asked the 9th Circuit to dismiss the case and throw out Orrick's decision.\nBut the appeals court refused, saying a decision in this \"developing area of the law\" would help guide lower courts and considerable public resources had been spent on the case.\nKerr said Monday the 9th Circuit ruling would not affect the settlement.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T23:41:22.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
