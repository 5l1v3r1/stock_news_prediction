The supply of new industrial real estate in the U.S. edged closer to total demand in first quarter, according to brokerage CBRE Group Inc. CBRE -1.32% WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes that developers completed more than 216 million square feet of new warehouse space in the quarter, a growth pace that brings the overall market closer to equilibrium . There hasn’t been much sign of prices leveling off from rapid growth trends, however, although the real estate group noted sharp increases in availability in some big markets from the fourth quarter to the first, including Atlanta and Dallas. CBRE sees an overall “strong supply pipeline” of warehouses in development. But the group expects rapid economic growth and the continued big expansion in e-commerce to absorb that capacity and more for the rest of the year.\nThe highly contentious steel supply chain between China and the U.S. increasingly runs through Vietnam. On the coast near Ho Chi Minh City, dozens of factories have been following a simple and lucrative business model by importing import steel from China, galvanizing it and then exporting it —often to the U.S. The WSJ’s Chuin-Wei Yap, Scott Patterson and Bob Tita report the companies have used the blueprint to make Vietnam one of the fastest-growing suppliers of steel to the U.S. That also places the country in the line of fire in a simmering U.S.-China trade war, with U.S. officials arguing Chinese suppliers are transshipping goods to dump their steel at prices that undercut American producers. Vietnam and other Southeast Asian nations may get hit by sanctions aimed at China, although one analyst warns “you’re going to get into a quagmire” if that happens.\nBananas have been on a supply chain roller-coaster this year, but U.S. consumers aren’t seeing that at local supermarkets. Retailers have been keeping prices for the fruit steady at stores, even as wholesale prices have been going, well, bananas on a pullback in global supplies , highlighting the pricing complications in perishables’ supply chains. The WSJ’s Lucy Craymer writes wholesale banana prices hit a record high during the first quarter, soaring 15.5% in the first two months of the year. Production has been limited by events including floods and mudslides in Costa Rica and Guatemala and a plantation workers’ strike in Honduras. Store owners are loath to raise prices to consumers, however, because they believe the fruit helps drive foot traffic. And the slimmer supplies push retailers to get more of their inventory on shelves faster so they don’t have to eat the losses.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES Photo: Bloomberg News New technology may start creating different patterns for inventories in apparel supply chains. Some factories in southern China are working with software that’s aimed at making the very fastest of fast fashion , offering custom-made clothing and shoes. The WSJ’s Natasha Khan reports the business model is being called “click, buy and make,” and aims to sharply curtail the time from purchase to shipping in a field that’s both notoriously inefficient and extremely sensitive to rapidly-changing tastes. Spencer Fung, who runs Hong Kong’s Li & Fung Ltd. , one of the largest supply-chain managers in the global garment industry, said new technologies could ultimately mean that more companies would be able to place small orders and avoid being stuck with extra inventory. Production costs remain a concern, but companies say advancements in automation will help them stitch together the leanest of lean supply chains.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Just look at the average size of orders—it’s been going down for years. It went from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. And it will keep going down until it approaches a unit of one. ’\n—Spencer Fung of supplier Li & Fung Ltd., on the impact of technology on apparel orders.\nNumber of the Day 17.1% Year-over-year change in container imports into California’s Port of Long Beach in the first quarter.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. wholesale prices rose broadly in March .
