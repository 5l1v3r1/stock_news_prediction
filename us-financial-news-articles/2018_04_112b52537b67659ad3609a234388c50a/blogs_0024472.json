I then swam upstream for a while to a lovely spot, took an hour for lunch, swam back downstream to the lake and straight back to our campsite at my normal rate. My total time away was exactly 3 1/2 hours.”\nSophie asks, “How far did you swim?”\n“I don’t know any of the distances involved,” answers Randall, “but I do know my average speed downstream relative to land was 1.2 miles an hour and my average speed upstream relative to land was 0.6 miles an hour.”\nSophie says, “Since I know your normal swimming speed, that’s all I need to know.”\nHow far did Randall swim and how fast does he swim in the lake? \n \nBatting Order \nThe players in the initial lineup of the Sluggers have jerseys numbered 1 to 9. Players in even-numbered batting positions have even-numbered jerseys, and each player’s jersey number is different from his or her batting order position. Players next to each other in the batting order have jersey numbers that differ by more than one. The Sluggers’ opponents have the same situation but a different batting order.\nWhat are the batting orders of the two teams?", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T22:24:42.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
