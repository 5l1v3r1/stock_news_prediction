The company’s sprawling production chain is also centered in China.\nLast month, Cook told attendees at a conference in Beijing that he hoped that China and the U.S. could resolve their differences on trade.\n“The countries that embrace openness do exceptional and the countries that don’t, don’t,” he said. “It’s not a matter of carving things up between sides. I’m going to encourage that calm heads prevail.”\nA trade war could place Apple in the Chinese government’s cross-hairs. A Communist Party newspaper last month listed the iPhone maker among the American companies that would be “most damaged” if a trade war erupted.\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment after regular business hours.\nCook was among the guests on Tuesday evening at the first state dinner of Trump’s presidency, a formal fete for French President Emmanuel Macron . The Apple chief was accompanied by Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment and government affairs and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T08:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T08:51:36.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
