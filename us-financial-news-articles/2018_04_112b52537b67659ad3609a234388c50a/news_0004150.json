Boxing - Anthony Joshua vs Joseph Parker - World Heavyweight Title Unification Fight - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 31, 2018 Anthony Joshua in action with Joseph Parker Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge \nThe 2012 Olympic champion, taken to 12 rounds for the first time in his professional career after 20 previous knockouts, added Parker’s WBO belt to his own WBA Super, IBF and IBO titles. \nThe three judges scored it 118-110, 118-110 and 119-109 to Joshua, leaving only Deontay Wilder’s WBC title still to conquer. \n“Wilder. Let’s go baby, let’s go,” shouted Joshua from inside the ring to raucous cheers from the 78,000 crowd packing Cardiff’s Principality Stadium, also namechecking Tyson Fury as another possible opponent. \n“Do I want to become undisputed heavyweight champion of the world? IBO, WBO, IBF, WBA...I’m not into the hype, I’m about business. So let’s get the business done.

And that secured me another world title belt,” he added. \n“I know the bookies say I might get a knockout...but forget the hype, Joseph Parker is a world champion. So I knew he was going to be determined. So this does become a boxing match, not a fight. \n“Joseph Parker stated this would be war, I stated this would be boxing finesse. I stuck to my word and I controlled it behind the jab, the counter-punches.” \nThe 26-year-old New Zealander, who had been led into the ring by Samoan chiefs under a barrage of strobe lights before Joshua walked in to the sound of ‘Paid in Full’ and ‘Another One Bites the Dust’, was gracious in defeat. \n“Today I got beaten by a better champion, a bigger man,” he said. \n“I’m going to come back stronger. No regrets, take it on the chin. Better man on the day. \n“I would love to have another go.” Reporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Ed Osmond/Peter Rutherford", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T02:16:48.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
