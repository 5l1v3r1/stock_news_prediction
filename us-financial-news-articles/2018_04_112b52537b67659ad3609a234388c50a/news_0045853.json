Its commercial air division saw first-quarter revenue grow to $13.7 billion, a 5 percent increase from last year. The business delivered 184 airplanes.\nMuilenburg told CNBC in February that the company expects to be \"building more than 900 airplanes a year\" by 2020 â€” a rate of about one aircraft every 10 hours.\n\"We see air traffic growing and passenger traffic gro w ing at about 6 percent to 7 percent a year, and that's feeding airplane growth throughout the world,\" Muilenburg said at the time.\nIn-line with that forecast, Boeing now expects to increase production of its 767 aircraft to 3 per month by 2020. The commercial air division added 221 net orders in the first quarter. It has a backlog of 5,800 aircraft, valued at $415 billion.\nBoeing's defense and space division saw revenue increase by 13 percent from the same time last year but its order backlog fell to $50 billion, from $63 billion a year ago. The business won a new contract from Kuwait for 28 F-18 fighter jets, as well as made further progress on its delayed KC-46 program and completed the first power-on test of its Starliner spacecraft for NASA's commercial crew program.\nThe global services division saw $3.9 billion in revenue, with growth largely coming from Boeing's commercial services business, the company said.\nBoeing also raised its estimate for full-year operating cash flow to a range of $15 billion to $15.5 billion. Previously, the company expected $15 billion in cash flow.\nBoeing's stock stumbled through the first-quarter of 2018, falling about 3 percent. The potential for a trade war between the U.S. and China cast doubt on Boeing's business overseas, although some analysts expect the company's tariff troubles were overblown. Boeing's stock is coming off a stellar run through 2017, when it gained about 108 percent.\nCEO Dennis Muilenburg: Boeing will build over 900 planes a year by the end of the decade show chapters Boeing CEO: Will build over 900 planes a year by the end of the decade 10:36 AM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 07:16", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:42:31.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
