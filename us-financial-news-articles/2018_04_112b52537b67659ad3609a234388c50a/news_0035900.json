REUTERS/Willin Rodriguez \nIn a statement, the Puerto Rican Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, said “technical personnel” were working to determine a cause and expected to restore service in 24 to 36 hours. \nPuerto Rico’s smaller islands of Culebra and Vieques, as well as a pair of microgrids on the main island, were unaffected. \nPREPA has struggled to escape the headlines since Hurricane Maria wiped out power to all of Puerto Rico last Sept. 20. \nMaria, the worst storm to hit the island in 90 years, devastated Puerto Rico’s grid and thousands were still without power at the time of Wednesday’s blackout. \n“This is another example of why Puerto Rico’s energy infrastructure needs to incorporate new forms of power,” Governor Ricardo Rossello said on Twitter, adding that he is “committed” to reforms to transform the island’s energy sector. \nSeparately on Wednesday, the island’s federally-appointed financial oversight board unveiled a framework for reform that breaks with Rossello’s vision, pushing pension cuts and labor reforms while hinting at layoffs. \nPREPA has suffered several blackouts since Maria and has been in bankruptcy since last July, owing some $9 billion to mutual funds, hedge funds and other investors. \nIn October, Rossello canceled a $300 million contract awarded by PREPA to a tiny Montana-based company amid political backlash. \nThree months later, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers discovered undistributed hurricane relief materials in a PREPA warehouse, sparking Rossello to order a separate investigation.

REUTERS/Willin Rodriguez? \nA U.S. Congressional committee in March announced its own probe into potential corruption at PREPA, including reports that some officials accepted bribes to restore power to exotic dance clubs ahead of schedule. \nRossello is planning to privatize PREPA over the next 18 months, as Puerto Rico navigates a $120 billion bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. government history. \nIn the short-term, though, the grid remains vulnerable ahead of a new hurricane season beginning this summer. \nFalling revenues, a loss of staff and constant leadership turnover have contributed to an outdated fleet of equipment, which was exposed by Maria’s winds of up to 155 miles per hour. \nCompounding that, most of the island’s generation is done in the south and trekked through miles of wires to the bulk of the population in the north. \n“We need to have power to the north to avoid this kind of chain reaction every time we have a power problem,” said Tomas Torres, executive director of the nonprofit Institute for Competitiveness and Sustainable Economy for Puerto Rico. \n[Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2jYDF9s ]] \nThe latest outage came as Major League Baseball’s Cleveland Indians and Minnesota Twins squared off in San Juan on Wednesday night, part of an effort by MLB to bring attention to and raise money for Puerto Rico.
