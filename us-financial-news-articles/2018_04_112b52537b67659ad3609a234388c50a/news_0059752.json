The Senate is working on its own bill, and there is strong support on both sides of Capitol Hill to hammer out a final version before the agency’s current legislative authority expires at the end of September.\nApart from the aviation sections, the bill includes provisions requiring communities, in conjunction with federal emergency management officials, to better prepare for natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes and wildfires\nMomentum for a multiyear FAA extension picked up after GOP leaders agreed to strip out controversial proposals seeking to transfer the agency’s air-traffic control functions into a nonprofit corporation. Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, the retiring Republican chairman of the House Infrastructure and Transportation Committee, called it “a good bipartisan bill” aiming to “make necessary reforms to improve American competitiveness and safety in aviation.” The legislation seeks to establish policy priorities and provide long-term stability for the FAA for the first time since 2012.\nSome of the most closely watched provisions were cheered by drone industry proponents, particularly language promoting the start of limited package-delivery operations beyond the sight of ground operators. Without FAA authority to approve such nascent services on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. “risks relinquishing its role as the world’s leader” in drone innovation, according to the Small-UAV Coalition, a leading industry trade group.\nAs in previous years, the House rejected Democratic efforts to give the FAA greater authority to regulate cargo shipments of lithium batteries by mandating more-stringent safeguards than international standards. Rep. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the transportation panel, said existing restrictions on the agency entail “following the lowest common denominator” and amount to “an accident waiting to happen.”\n“This long-term reauthorization brings the certainty our aviation industry needs to make important improvements as we continue rebuilding our infrastructure,’ said House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) in a statement. \"We look forward to working with the Senate to get this initiative to the president’s desk.”\nReflecting the legislation’s broad scope, lawmakers offered more than 110 amendments, and the bill covers everything from passenger rights to futuristic studies of the feasibility of large cargo planes eventually being flown by a single pilot on board, with a second pilot monitoring from the ground.\nUnder the bill, all flight crews would be required to have specific training to deal with sexual misconduct by travelers as well as to identify suspected sex trafficking involving passengers. In addition, large and medium-size airports would have to set aside private rooms for nursing mothers; and carriers would be prohibited from ordering ticketed passengers to give up their seats and leave an aircraft once they had properly boarded.\nWhile more-sweeping passenger-rights amendments died in committee, the final version mandates individual airlines to prominently inform ticket holders what services they can expect in the event the carrier experiences widespread computer-system problems.\nGiven the FAA’s growing focus on safely integrating commercial drones into the nation’s airspace, lawmakers called for accelerated development of low-altitude traffic-control systems to manage such flights. The bill also sets the stage for further debates on how such proposed air-traffic management networks would be financed.\n—Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T23:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T04:10:41.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
