A staggering amount of 73 rotary rigs have been placed since January 2018,\" said Benjamin Lu of Phillip Futures in a note on Tuesday.\n\"As such, we expect a softening in crude oil prices as markets adjust from a bullish streak,\" he added.\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to publish weekly U.S. fuel inventory data later on Tuesday while official government data, including on production, is due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford and Kenneth Maxwell)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T14:21:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
