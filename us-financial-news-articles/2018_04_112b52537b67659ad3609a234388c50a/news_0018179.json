It has been trading near five-month lows. \nThe Abu Dhabi index was flat as Abu Dhabi National Energy Co gained 2.0 percent, continuing a strong three-week uptrend. \nUnion National Bank rose 2.2 percent to 3.79 dirhams after SICO Bahrain upgraded the stock to “buy” from “neutral” with a target of 4.5 dirhams, saying the bank had the cheapest valuation, adjusted for return on equity, in its Gulf Cooperation Council universe, along with a dividend yield of 5.6 percent. \nThe Qatari index was down 0.5 percent, weighed down by banks and insurance stocks. Al Ahli Bank was down 1.9 percent and Qatar General Insurance & Reinsurance slipped 0.6 percent. \nSaudi Arabia’s index was flat in quiet trade; Saudi Paper fell 1.9 percent after its board proposed a capital decrease to 240 million riyals ($64 million) from 450 million riyals to extinguish accumulated losses of 210 million riyals.
