We got to do a better job late in games and not give up a shot like that that’s something he can easily make.” \nThe result at least gives the Cavaliers hope as they head to Indianapolis for Game Three on Friday and Game Four on Sunday. \nBut they have a long road ahead as they attempt to reach the NBA Finals for the fourth consecutive year, and perhaps another match-up against the Golden State Warriors. \nGolden State won the championship in 2015 and 2017, with Cleveland taking out the 2016 title. \nThe Cavs have been far from invincible this season, posting a 50-32 regular-season record to earn the fourth seed for the postseason.
