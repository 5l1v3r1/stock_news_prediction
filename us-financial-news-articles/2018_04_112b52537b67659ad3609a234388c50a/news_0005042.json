Trump has previously criticized automakers, Carrier Corp, which is owned by United Technologies Corp and Boeing Co.\nIn 2015, then-President Barack Obama criticized office supply company Staples Inc for not embracing the Affordable Care Act, drawing a quick rebuke from Republicans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\nTrump has progressively escalated his criticism of Amazon and Bezos, who also privately owns The Washington Post.\nBezos, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world's richest man with an estimated net worth of $115.6 billion, owns 78.89 million Amazon shares, worth about $110 billion at Tuesday's market close.\nAmazon shares closed up 1.5 percent at $1,392.05. The shares started the day higher but fell as low as $1,355.33 after Trump's latest Amazon-related tweet.\nOn Monday Trump attacked the company over its shipping. He criticized it last week over taxes.\n\"The post office is losing billions of dollars ... because it delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"If you look at the cost that we're subsidizing, we're giving a subsidy to Amazon.\"\nTrump offered no details about the report he cited or how he might charge the company more through USPS.\nAmazon also ships packages through providers such as FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc as well as its own experimental shipping service. Representatives of Amazon and USPS had no comment on Trump's tweet on Tuesday and could not be immediately reached regarding his latest comments to reporters.
