It has plants in South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria, and is also building a factory in Ethiopia.\n($1 = 12.4492 rand) (Additional reporting by Nqobile Dludla; Editing by Alexandra Hudson and Mark Potter)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T09:55:11.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
