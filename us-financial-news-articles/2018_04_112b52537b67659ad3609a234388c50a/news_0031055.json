The lawmakers said in their report that this was a \"view widely held\" among a number of witnesses.\nThe House of Lords committee said that the dominance of large technology firms could hamper development of AI in Britain.\n\"While we welcome the investments made by large overseas technology companies in the U.K. economy, and the benefits they bring, the increasing consolidation of power and influence by a select few risks damaging the continuation, and development, of the U.K.'s thriving home-grown AI start-up sector,\" the report said.\n\"The monopolization of data demonstrates the need for strong ethical, data protection and competition frameworks in the U.K., and for continued vigilance from the regulators.\"\nThe British lawmakers said that the government and the U.K.'s competition watchdog should \"review proactively the use and potential monopolization of data by the big technology companies.\"\nA.I. code The 181-page report explored the development of AI, the impact on jobs and society and areas such as healthcare and the military.\nOne recommendation was creating an \"AI code\" that can be adopted nationally and internationally.
