It opened in 21 countries on Wednesday and added 22 on Thursday.\nHollywood is watching to see if the film — featuring the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy — can smash the opening domestic weekend box-office record currently held by \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" That film opened to $248 million in sales in its opening weekend in December 2015.\n\"Infinity War\" is a two-part culmination of 10 years of story lines that began with Marvel Studios' \"Iron Man\" in 2008. The second installment is due to be released in May 2019.\n\"Infinity War\" reunites the Avengers gang and friends, including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) as they join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy crew — including Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Bradley Cooper — to stop an evil intergalactic despot played by Josh Brolin.\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits"], "published": "2018-04-27T19:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T11:03:06.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
