The vessels are qualified to deliver marine fuel oil and are equipped with mass flow meters, according to the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).\nVermont UM Shipping did not respond when contacted for a comment on the seizure.\nVermont UM Bunkering Pte Ltd, a now defunct Singapore-based marine fuels supplier, is a shareholder of Vermont UM Shipping, according to documents from Singapore’s Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.\nIn April 2016, the MPA stripped Vermont UM Bunkering of its operating licenses after finding discrepancies and wrongful declarations in records kept on board its bunkering vessels.\nIn November of the following year, Vermont UM Bunkering and three of its executives were charged with cheating as part of a government crackdown on short deliveries of fuel to vessels.\nIn 2015, Vermont UM was ranked by the MPA as the 18th-largest marine fuel supplier in Singapore by volume.\nIn 2017, Singapore, the world’s largest bunkering hub, became the first port to mandate the use of mass flow meters for marine fuel oil deliveries to boost transparency.
