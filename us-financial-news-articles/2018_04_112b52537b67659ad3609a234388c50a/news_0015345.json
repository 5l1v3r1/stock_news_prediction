Mills had planned to boost production of the product to meet rising demand and to reduce sugar output, since prices for the sweetener are hovering around the lowest levels in 2-1/2 years.\n“The pressure over ethanol prices in the Sao Paulo market comes from an increase on supply that is relatively larger than the increase on demand,” said Cepea/Esalq in a weekly analysis released on Monday <ESQ/ETN/ANALYS>.\nThe market research body said ethanol prices fell in other center-south states as well, such as Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.\nBut despite the drop last week, hydrous ethanol still gives around 7 percent higher returns to mills compared to sugar, the analysts said.\nLower ethanol prices in Brazil, the second largest ethanol producer behind the United States, are expected to reduce the window of opportunity for U.S. producers to export the biofuel to the Brazilian market.\nBrazil’s 2018/19 center-south cane crop officially started in April. Mills are expected to maintain crushing operations until mid-December, depending on the weather.\nAnalysts generally expect the center-south region to cut sugar production by four or five million tonnes, to around 31 million tonnes, as they earmark more cane to ethanol output.\nU.S.-based Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) said that February exports to Brazil, at 103.2 million gallons, were the highest in six years.\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T09:33:04.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
