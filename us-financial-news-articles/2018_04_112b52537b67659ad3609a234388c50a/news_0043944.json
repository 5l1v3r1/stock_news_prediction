REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Kerner was one of three current or former employees of Porsche that prosecutors were targeting when they searched offices at Porsche and its sister brand Audi ( NSUG.DE ) earlier this week, a spokesman for the Stuttgart public prosecutor’s office said. \nThose three, as well as Porsche itself, were suspected of having known that engines developed by Audi had been manipulated, Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume told staff in a memo, excerpts of which were seen by Reuters on Friday. \n“We reject these allegations and will do our utmost to clear up the matter,” Blume said in the memo, which was first reported by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag earlier on Friday. \nThe arrest occurred on Thursday, he said. \nEarlier this year, prosecutors widened an investigation of Audi, which developed a 3.0 litre V6 diesel engine that was used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models found to have been equipped with illicit software. \nReporting by Jan Schwartz; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Sabine Wolrab, Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T16:52:56.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
