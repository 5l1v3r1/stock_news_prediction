(Nasdaq:AIMC), a global manufacturer and marketer of electromechanical power transmission and motion control products, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nFirst-quarter 2018 net sales were $240.4 million, up 11.6% from $215.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the positive impact of foreign currency translation, net sales were up 5.4% from the same quarter of 2017. First-quarter net income was $9.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared with $10.3 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net income in the first quarter 2018 was $19.3 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared with $15.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, a year ago.*\nManagement Comments\n“We began 2018 with strong first-quarter results, reporting 11.6% sales growth and continued improvement in non-GAAP net income,” said Carl Christenson, Altra's Chairman and CEO. Our first-quarter performance represented the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year organic sales growth as we capitalized on organic growth initiatives and the continued strength in the industrial economy. During the first quarter, we announced our agreement to combine Altra with Fortive’s Automation & Specialty Platform (“Fortive’s A&S Platform”) to create a premium industrial company. We are preparing for the integration of the two organizations so that we are ready to hit the ground running on day one after the close of the transaction.” *\n“We are increasingly confident in the positive momentum occurring in the industrial economy,” continued Christenson. “Our bookings are strong across the vast majority of our end markets, and we are encouraged by our prospects for a strong second quarter and full year. As a result, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2018.”\nBusiness Outlook\nAltra is increasing its guidance for the full year 2018. The Company now expects full-year 2018 sales in the range of $910 to $930 million. With the announced planned acquisition of the Fortive A&S Platform, Altra now expects GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1.99 to $2.08 which includes $5.4 million of year to date acquisition related expenses, and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $2.36 to $2.49. The Company expects its tax rate for the full year to be approximately 25% to 27% before discrete items and the impact of non-deductible acquisition related expenses, capital expenditures in the range of $25 to $27 million, and depreciation and amortization in the range of $38 to $40 million.*\nReconciliations:\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Net Income*:\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net Income $ 9,001 $ 10,326 Restructuring and consolidation costs $ 943 $ 1,898 Loss on extinguishment of convertible debt - 1,797 Loss on settlement of pension plan 5,086 - Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment - 2,347 Acquisition related expenses 5,408 998 Tax impact of above adjustments (1,135 ) (2,091 ) Non-GAAP net income* $ 19,303 $ 15,275 Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share* $ 0.66 $ 0.53 Reconciliation of Free Cash Flow*:\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net cash flows from operating activities 3,664 3,022 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (6,975 ) (7,333 ) Free cash flow * $ (3,311 ) $ (4,311 ) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Income From Operations*:\nQuarter Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Income from operations $ 19,680 $ 17,662 Restructuring and consolidation costs 943 1,898 Amortization of inventory fair value adjustment - 2,347 Acquisition related expenses 5,408 998 Non-GAAP income from operations * $ 26,031 $ 22,905 Non-GAAP Income from operations as a percent of net sales* 10.8 % 10.6 % Reconciliation of Guidance for 2018 Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS (Amounts in millions except per share information)*:\nFiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2018\nDiluted earnings per\nshare Net Income $58.2 - $60.6 $1.99 - $2.08 Adjustments (1) Restructuring and consolidation costs 2.0 - 4.0 Acquisition related expenses (2) 5.4 Loss on settlement of pension plan 5.1 Tax impact of above adjustments (3) (1.8) - (2.4) Non-GAAP Net Income $68.9 - $72.7 $2.36 - $2.49 (1) Adjustments are pre-tax, with net tax impact listed separately. (2) Due to the uncertainty as to when future acquisition related expenditures will be incurred, Altra has only included in its reconciliation those costs incurred year-to-date. Altra expects to incur between $30-$50 million in acquisition related expenditures in conjunction with the planned Fortive A&S Platform acquisition. (3) Tax impact is calculated by multiplying the estimated effective tax rate for the period of 25% - 27% before discrete items by the above items with the exception of acquisition related expenses. Due to the uncertainty of these expenses being tax deductible no tax benefit is assumed.

The Company brings together strong brands covering over 40 product lines with production facilities in eleven countries. Altra's leading brands include Ameridrives Couplings, Bauer Gear Motor, Bibby Turboflex, Boston Gear, Delroyd Worm Gear, Formsprag Clutch, Guardian Couplings, Huco, Industrial Clutch, Inertia Dynamics, Kilian Manufacturing, Lamiflex Couplings, Marland Clutch, Matrix, Nuttall Gear, Stieber Clutch, Stromag, Svendborg Brakes, TB Wood's, Twiflex, Warner Electric, Warner Linear, and Wichita Clutch.\nThe Altra Industrial Motion Corp. logo is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=4038 .\n* Discussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used in this release and the accompanying slides posted on the Company's website, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income are each calculated using either net income or income from operations that excludes acquisition related costs, restructuring costs, and other income or charges that management does not consider to be directly related to the Company's core operating performance. Non-GAAP gross profit is calculated using gross profit that excludes income or charges that management does not consider to be directly related to the Company’s core operating performance. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income by GAAP weighted average shares outstanding (diluted). Non-GAAP free cash flow is calculated by deducting purchases of property, plant and equipment from net cash flows from operating activities. Non-GAAP operating working capital is calculated by deducting accounts payable from net trade receivables plus inventories.\nAltra believes that the presentation of non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP operating working capital provides important supplemental information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditional Information\nThis communication does not constitute an offer to buy, or a solicitation of an offer to sell, any securities of Fortive Corporation (“Fortive”), Stevens Holding Company, Inc.
