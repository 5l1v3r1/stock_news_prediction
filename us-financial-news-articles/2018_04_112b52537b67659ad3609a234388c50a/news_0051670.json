(NASDAQ: TREE), operator of LendingTree.com , the nation's leading online loan marketplace, today announced results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"LendingTree's strong first quarter performance was an excellent start to the year and a reflection of our team's ability to execute,\" said Doug Lebda, Chairman and CEO. \"Our mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry and we continue to make strides in our consumer experience initiatives. Our non-mortgage businesses continued to produce exceptional growth and we're encouraged by the dialogue with banks and lenders across many of our non-mortgage categories. The team is laser-focused on driving deeper market penetration as we build our momentum, positioning us perfectly to achieve our stated goals for the year.\"\nJ.D. Moriarty, LendingTree's Chief Financial Officer, added \"Our performance in mortgage has been terrific in the face of a tougher macro environment. According to Black Knight Inc., the number of borrowers who could benefit from refinancing their mortgage is down 37% since the end of last year and at the lowest level since 2008. That said, our growth is a testament to the value we deliver for lenders as the industry gets much more competitive. And thanks to the ongoing diversification of our revenue streams and the performance of our non-mortgage products, the business can continue to thrive even as interest rates are expected to move higher.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Highlights\nRevenue from mortgage products of $73.5 million represents an increase of 17% over first quarter 2017 driven by strong growth in both purchase and refinance revenues at 13% and 18%, respectively. According to Mortgage Bankers Association, originations industry-wide were projected down 4% in the comparable period. Record revenue from non-mortgage products of $107.6 million in the first quarter represents an increase of 55% over the first quarter 2017. Revenue from our credit card offerings continued its momentum, growing to $46.1 million in 1Q, up 36% over the first quarter 2017. Personal loans revenue of $26.0 million grew 53% over first quarter 2017. Home equity revenue continued to climb, growing 81% over first quarter 2017. More than 8.0 million consumers have now signed up for free credit scores and savings alerts through My LendingTree. Revenue contribution from MyLendingTree grew 76% in the first quarter compared to the prior year period as new features, such as Credit Analyzer and free credit monitoring, are driving increased engagement.\nLendingTree Selected Financial Metrics\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nQ/Q\nY/Y\n1Q 2018\n4Q 2017\n% Change\n1Q 2017\n% Change\nRevenue by Product\nMortgage Products (1)\n$\n73.5\n$\n67.7\n9%\n$\n62.9\n17%\nNon-Mortgage Products (2)\n107.6\n93.3\n15%\n69.6\n55%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n181.0\n$\n161.0\n12%\n$\n132.5\n37%\nNon-Mortgage % of Total\n59%\n58%\n53%\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n$\n12.4\n$\n(3.3)\nN/A\n$\n6.7\n85%\nIncome Tax (Expense) Benefit\n$\n23.5\n$\n(3.2)\nN/A\n$\n1.1\nN/A\nNet Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations\n$\n35.9\n$\n(6.5)\nN/A\n$\n7.8\n360%\nNet Income (Loss) from Cont.

Please see \"LendingTree's Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP\" and \"LendingTree's Principles of Financial Reporting\" below for more information.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nRecord consolidated revenue of $181.0 million represents an increase of $48.5 million, or 37%, over revenue in the first quarter 2017. GAAP net income from continuing operations of $35.9 million, or $2.41 per diluted share, was impacted by a $27.2 million tax benefit relating to employee exercising of stock options and vesting of restricted stock. Record Variable Marketing Margin of $63.0 million represents an increase of $19.5 million, or 45%, over first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA of $31.7 million increased $7.9 million, or 33%, over first quarter 2017. Included in this number is $2.3 million of unusually high expense related to payroll taxes owed upon the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units. Adjusted Net Income per share of $1.10 represents growth of 29% over first quarter 2017. During the quarter, the company repurchased 30 thousand shares of its stock at a weighted-average price per share of $362 for aggregate consideration of $11.0 million. As of March 31, 2018, the company had $116.7 million in repurchase authorization remaining.\nBusiness Outlook - 2018\nLendingTree is introducing Revenue, Variable Marketing Margin and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for second quarter 2018 and maintaining full-year 2018, as follows:\nSecond quarter 2018:\nRevenue is anticipated to be in the range of $193 - $200 million, representing growth of 26% - 31% over second quarter 2017. Variable Marketing Margin is anticipated to be $65 - $69 million, representing growth of 35% - 43%. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be in the range of $34 - $36 million, up 26% - 33% over second quarter 2017. Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects an estimated $2 - $3 million of expense related to payroll taxes owed upon the exercise of employee stock options and vesting of restricted stock units.\nFull-year 2018:\nRevenue of $770 - $790 million. Variable Marketing Margin of $270 - $280 million. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $145 - $150 million.\nLendingTree is not able to provide a reconciliation of projected Variable Marketing Margin or Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable expected GAAP results due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of the effects of legal matters, tax considerations, and income and expense from changes in fair value of contingent consideration from acquisitions. Expenses associated with legal matters, tax consequences, and income and expense from changes in fair value of contingent consideration from acquisitions have in the past, and may in the future, significantly affect GAAP results in a particular period.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nA conference call to discuss LendingTree's first quarter 2018 financial results will be webcast live today, April 26, 2018 at 8:00 AM Eastern Time (ET).

The Company's operating model is highly sensitive to the amount and efficiency of variable marketing expenditures, and the Company's proprietary systems are able to make rapidly changing decisions concerning the deployment of variable marketing expenditures (primarily but not exclusively online and mobile advertising placement) based on proprietary and sophisticated analytics. Variable Marketing Margin and Variable Marketing Margin % of revenue are primary metrics by which the Company measures the effectiveness of its marketing efforts.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA % of revenue are primary metrics by which LendingTree evaluates the operating performance of its businesses, on which its marketing expenditures and internal budgets are based and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, by which management and many employees are compensated.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share supplement GAAP income from continuing operations and GAAP income per diluted share from continuing operations by enabling investors to make period to period comparisons of those components of the nearest comparable GAAP measures that management believes better reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company's business operations during particular financial reporting periods. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share exclude certain amounts, such as non-cash compensation, non-cash asset impairment charges, gain/loss on disposal of assets, severance, litigation settlements, contingencies and legal fees for certain patent litigation, acquisition and disposition income or expenses including with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration, one-time items which are recognized and recorded under GAAP in particular periods but which might be viewed as not necessarily coinciding with the underlying business operations for the periods in which they are so recognized and recorded, the effects to income taxes of the aforementioned adjustments and any excess tax benefit or expense associated with stock-based compensation recorded in net income in conjunction with FASB pronouncement ASU 2016-09. LendingTree believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are useful financial indicators that provide a different view of the financial performance of the Company than Adjusted EBITDA (the primary metric by which LendingTree evaluates the operating performance of its businesses) and the GAAP measures of net income from continuing operations and GAAP income (loss) per diluted share from continuing operations.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. LendingTree provides and encourages investors to examine the reconciling adjustments between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures set forth above.\nDefinition of LendingTree's Non-GAAP Measures\nVariable Marketing Margin is defined as revenue less the portion of selling & marketing expense attributable to variable costs paid for advertising, direct marketing and related expenses, which excludes overhead, fixed costs and personnel-related expenses.\nEBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations excluding interest, income taxes, amortization of intangibles and depreciation.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) non-cash impairment charges, (3) gain/loss on disposal of assets, (4) severance expenses, (5) litigation settlements, contingencies and legal fees for certain patent litigation, (6) acquisitions and dispositions income or expense (including with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration), and (7) one-time items.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding (1) non-cash compensation expense, (2) non-cash impairment charges, (3) gain/loss on disposal of assets, (4) severance expenses, (5) litigation settlements, contingencies and legal fees for certain patent litigation, (6) acquisitions and dispositions income or expense (including with respect to changes in fair value of contingent consideration), (7) one-time items, (8) the effects to income taxes of the aforementioned adjustments, and (9) any excess tax benefit or expense associated with stock-based compensation recorded in net income in conjunction with FASB pronouncement ASU 2016-09.\nAdjusted Net Income per share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by the adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding. For periods which the Company reports GAAP loss from continuing operations, the effects of potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the calculation of net loss per diluted share from continuing operations because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. In periods where the Company reports GAAP loss from continuing operations but reports positive non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income, the effects of potentially dilutive securities are included in the denominator for calculating Adjusted Net Income per share. We recorded GAAP losses in the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nLendingTree endeavors to compensate for the limitations of these non-GAAP measures by also providing the comparable GAAP measures with equal or greater prominence and descriptions of the reconciling items, including quantifying such items, to derive the non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOne-Time Items\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are adjusted for one-time items, if applicable. Items are considered one-time in nature if they are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual, and have not occurred in the past two years or are not expected to recur in the next two years, in accordance with SEC rules. For the periods presented in this report, there are no adjustments for one-time items except for a $9.1 million charge to reduce the value of deferred tax assets in conjunction with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a $10 million commitment to fund the newly formed LendingTree Foundation, each occurring in the three months ended December 31, 2017\nNon-Cash Expenses That Are Excluded From LendingTree's Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income\nNon-cash compensation expense consists principally of expense associated with the grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options. These expenses are not paid in cash and LendingTree includes the related shares in its calculations of fully diluted shares outstanding. Upon settlement of restricted stock units, exercise of certain stock options or vesting of restricted stock awards, the awards may be settled on a net basis, with LendingTree remitting the required tax withholding amounts from its current funds. Cash expenditures for employer payroll taxes on non-cash compensation are included within Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income.\nAmortization of intangibles are non-cash expenses relating primarily to acquisitions. At the time of an acquisition, the intangible assets of the acquired company, such as purchase agreements, technology and customer relationships, are valued and amortized over their estimated lives. Amortization of intangibles are only excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\nSafe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThe matters contained in the discussion above may be considered to be \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
