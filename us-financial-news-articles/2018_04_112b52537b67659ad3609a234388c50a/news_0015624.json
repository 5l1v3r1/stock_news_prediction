Honest to God. Didn’t look once today,” he told reporters. “That was my plan going in. I’m nine back. Go out and just have fun.” \nThe Texan breathed life into what began as a dithering duel between Reed and Rory McIlroy. \nSpieth stacked up five birdies in a flawless first nine to close the gap to four. Birdies at 12, 13, 15 and 16 electrified the galleries and tightened up the leaderboard. \nThe birdie at the short, par-three 12th thrilled Spieth, who squandered a five-shot Masters lead going into the final nine in 2016 due in large part to a quadruple-bogey seven after splashing twice in Rae’s Creek. \n“What we did on 12 today was really cool,” he said about sinking a 27-foot putt for birdie on the devilish hole that had confounded him in each of his previous Masters. \n“I mean nobody’s going to have a great Sunday every year at Augusta National. To be able to have a chance to win this tournament five years in a row is really, really cool.” (Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T05:09:21.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
