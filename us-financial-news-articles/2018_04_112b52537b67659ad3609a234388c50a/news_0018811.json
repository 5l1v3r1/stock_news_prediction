We have good visibility in our portfolio,” the group, which makes chocolate and cocoa products for big food groups such as Nestle and Mondelez, said in a statement on Wednesday.\nChocolate makers have been grappling with sluggish global chocolate demand, but Barry Callebaut has so far bucked the trend by relying on outsourcing contracts and a thriving ‘gourmet’ business with chefs and pastry makers.\nSales volumes increased 8.0 percent in the first half of Barry Callebaut’s fiscal year 2017/18, ahead of the average 7.2 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll, helped by a strong performance in Europe and accelerating growth in the Americas.\nNet profit jumped 33 percent to 173 million Swiss francs ($180.9 million) on a recurring basis, helped in part by lower net finance costs. The figure was also slightly better than the 171 million estimate in the poll.\n$1 = 0.9561 Swiss francs Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T13:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:00:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
