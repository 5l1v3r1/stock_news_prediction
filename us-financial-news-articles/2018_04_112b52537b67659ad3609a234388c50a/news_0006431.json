Airware has filed its plans for this proposed name change with the Financial Industry and Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and has requested a new ticker symbol that better suits the new name of the Company.\nThis name change is being taken pursuant to the Company’s recent acquisition of BSSD Group, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company, doing business as Item 9 Labs, which was completed on March 21, 2018. In conjunction with the acquisition, Airware closed on a material definitive financing agreement in the principal amount of $1 million. The new symbol is under review and will be forthcoming upon confirmation from FINRA.\nBryce Skalla, Co-Founder & CEO of Item 9 Labs, commented, “We are very excited about how things have progressed over the past few weeks with the recent combination of Item 9’s high-quality, medical-grade product and Airware Labs’ proprietary delivery platform. This upcoming name change to Item 9 Labs Corp. and corresponding ticker symbol change more appropriately reflects our strategic initiative to continue to build ourselves as an industry leader in the Cannabis Bio-Medical space.”\nFollowing the completion of the corporate name and ticker symbol change, Item 9 Labs Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Bryce Skalla will serve as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Airware Labs’ Chief Financial Officer Jessica Smith will serve as Chief Financial Officer, and Airware Labs’ Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Rassás will serve as Chief Strategic Officer.\nAbout Item 9 Labs:\nItem 9 Labs is an Arizona-based cannabis consulting company with a proven record of high quality medical marijuana flower and products focused on organic cost-effective solutions for whole body health.
