Mainland China markets were closed for a holiday. \nThe top gainers among H-shares were Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd, up 5.3 percent, followed by Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd gaining 3.5 percent. \nThe three biggest H-share decliners were Sinopharm Group Co Ltd which was down 2.3 percent and PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd, which fell 1.3 percent. \nAbout 1.75 billion Hang Seng index shares were traded, roughly 89.6 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 1.95 billion shares a day. \nSo far this week, the market capitalisation of the Hang Seng index has fallen 2.1 percent to HK$19.14 trillion.
