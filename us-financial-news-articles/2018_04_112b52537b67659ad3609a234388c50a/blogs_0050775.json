It reduces the tax rate on such intellectual property to 13.125% through 2025, after which the rate rises to 16.4%. The headline corporate rate is 21%.\nThe tax break aims to give U.S. taxpayers an incentive to hold patents in the U.S. rather than abroad.\n“We know there are a number of issues here,” said Douglas Poms, international tax counsel with the Department of Treasury. “We intend to address them.”\nMr. Poms spoke at the 18th Annual New York University/KPMG Tax Lecture conference in New York City, on Wednesday. He didn’t specify when the guidance would be released or offer much detail on what it would address.\nSeveral panelists said that there was uncertainty surrounding how foreign-derived deduction eligible income is calculated. “We’re looking at that,” Mr. Poms responded.\nSome European governments have complained that the FDII tax break amounts to an export subsidy barred under the World Trade Organization’s agreement on subsidies.\nThe Treasury Department is also expected to release further guidance on other provisions of the tax overhaul, which was signed into law last December.\nShare this: U.S. TAX OVERHAUL Previous CFO Moves: Beiersdorf, Jabil Next The Morning Ledger: Beijing Ready to Respond if U.S. Curbs Chinese Investments Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte Creating an Effective Communications Program Given the complexity of modern multinational organizations and the number of stakeholders a CFO connects with, it is essential to have a disciplined communications program to convey critical messages and ensure they are not drowned out or lost in translation.
