REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nThe acquisition will help Spotify find the artists and ensure they get paid for their copyrighted work, an issue which, left unaddressed, leaves it open to lawsuits. \nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed. \nLoudr was set up in 2013 to simplify the process for musicians who publicly perform songs by other artists to identify, track and pay royalties owed to music publishers. These may include cover versions of songs, samples, remixes or medleys. \nLoudr will relocate to Spotify’s offices in New York, the company said in a blog post. \nSpotify, which listed on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month, has made at least ten small, usually technology focused acquisitions in recent years to improve its service.
