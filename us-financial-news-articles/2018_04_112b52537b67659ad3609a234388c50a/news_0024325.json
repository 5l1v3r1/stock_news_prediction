Sentiment improved towards the end of the week after policymakers said the central bank would take the necessary steps on the exchange rate.\nMexico’s peso strengthened 0.3 percent after the Mexican central bank held its key rate steady on Thursday as expected, as inflation cooled.\nBut Hong Kong’s dollar remained close to the weak end of its range even after the central bank intervened in the market for the first time since 2015 on Thursday.\nAdding to the central bank policy tightening momentum, Singapore tightened policy for the first time in six years.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1174.00 -2.88 -0.24 +1.34\nCzech Rep 1138.01 +6.23 +0.55 +5.55\nPoland 2319.88 +13.44 +0.58 -5.74\nHungary 38485.39 +155.02 +0.40 -2.27\nRomania 8912.70 -15.33 -0.17 +14.95\nGreece 811.67 +5.59 +0.69 +1.16\nRussia 1121.47 -3.62 -0.32 -2.86\nSouth Africa 49785.09 -23.86 -0.05 -5.23\nTurkey 10025.70 -209.71 -0.19 -4.60\nChina 3159.39 -20.77 -0.65 -4.47\nIndia 34214.54 +113.41 +0.33 +0.46\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.31 25.30 -0.05 +0.84\nPoland 4.18 4.18 +0.01 -0.02\nHungary 310.81 311.12 +0.10 -0.09\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.02 +0.41\nSerbia 118.06 118.06 +0.00 +0.29\nRussia 61.46 61.96 +0.82 -6.18\nKazakhstan 327.05 328.45 +0.43 +1.76\nUkraine 26.16 25.98 -0.67 +7.61\nSouth Africa 12.05 12.05 -0.02 +2.51\nKenya 100.75 100.80 +0.05 +2.33\nIsrael 3.51 3.51 +0.07 -0.84\nTurkey 4.09 4.11 +0.56 -7.27\nChina 6.28 6.29 +0.12 +3.60\nIndia 65.24 65.28 +0.07 -2.16\nBrazil 3.41 3.41 +0.00 -2.94\nMexico 18.13 18.19 +0.31 +8.38\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 316 1 .04 7 94.83 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T12:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T12:21:50.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
