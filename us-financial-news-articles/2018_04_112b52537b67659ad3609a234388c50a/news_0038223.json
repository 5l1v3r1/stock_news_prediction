He has made outstanding contributions to Nucor's strong record of profitable growth and to our company's unique culture. During Jim's tenure, he has been extremely successful in leading both the steel mill and downstream products sides of our business, and, most recently, the raw materials segment. Jim's retirement and Craig's promotion are the product of the thoughtful and orderly succession planning that has been a top strategic initiative throughout the Nucor organization in recent years. Craig is a proven Nucor leader whose 32 years of experience with DJJ have positioned him well to take on this new responsibility and allow for a smooth transition.\n\"On behalf of the Nucor family, I want to thank Jim for his leadership and commitment to making Nucor a better company. His advice, counsel and support have been key to the success of the entire Nucor team. We wish Jim a long and happy retirement.\"\nNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
