This enthusiasm for them wanting to make a deal ... We are going to hopefully make a deal.”\nStill, Trump told reporters, he would maintain pressure on North Korea and “not repeat the mistakes of past administrations.”\nOn Saturday, Trump said on Twitter that he “just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea. Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set.” South Korean President Moon Jae-in, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Kim's wife Ri Sol Ju and Moon's wife Kim Jung-sook attend a farewell ceremony at the truce village of Panmunjom inside the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, South Korea, April 27, 2018. Korea Summit Press Pool/Pool via Reuters - RC17FA95F0D0\nTrump added that he had also spoken with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to inform him of ongoing negotiations.\nA senior U.S. official said Singapore is being considered as a possible venue for the Trump-Kim summit.\nSpeaking on Saturday at a televised news conference in Sydney, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Trump’s negotiations on North Korea and said he helped bring the two Korean leaders together.\n“I have given him that credit because Donald Trump has taken a very, very strong, hard line on the denuclearisation issue and he has been able to bring in the support of the global community and, in particular, China,” Turnbull said. “North Korea’s economic relationship is overwhelmingly with China. And so China’s preparedness to impose those sanctions has been the critical change that has put the economic pressure on North Korea.”\nTurnbull said the pressure from China and the U.S. had brought Kim to the point of denuclearising the Korean peninsula.\n“What we’ve now got to do is not relent on the economic pressure until that goal is achieved,” he said.\nAustralia will send a military aircraft to monitor North Korean vessels suspected of transferring illicit goods in defiance of U.N. sanctions, he said.\nIran, facing a possible U.S. exit from its nuclear deal with world powers, welcomed the inter-Korean summit, but said Washington was not a “qualified” partner in the negotiations.\n“Iran sees (the summit) as an important step in the right direction that can contribute to lasting regional and global peace and security,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by state media.\n“The U.S. government is not a credible actor, doesn’t comply with its international obligations and doesn’t qualify to take part in arrangements between countries,” Qasemi added.

That is because such specifics can be reached only between the US and North Korea, and South Korea has only limited authority to bargain,” it said.
