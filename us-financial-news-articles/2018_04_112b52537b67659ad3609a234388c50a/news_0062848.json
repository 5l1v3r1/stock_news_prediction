I would like to say all the bad news is priced in, but it might be a little bit early to say that,\" Ellis added.\nThe scandal has already caused the early departure of CEO Craig Meller, and wiped more than 2.2 billion Australian dollars ($1.7 billion) from its market capitalization in the past two weeks alone.

It will take a long while to try and rebuild some of the investor confidence and customer trust in the organization.\"\nAMP said the \"employment and remuneration consequences\" for the individuals who were responsible for charging fraudulent fees is still being reviewed.\nIt also said it would slash fees for board directors by 25 percent for the rest of 2018 as a recognition of the \"collective governance accountability for the issues raised in the Royal Commission and for their impact on the reputation of AMP,\" according to a statement.\nGroup General Counsel Brian Salter will also depart immediately. A tough job ahead\nEllis welcomed the decision by AMP to fast track the search for a new CEO and chairman. The firm has appointed Mike Wilkins, an AMP board member and former CEO of Insurance Australia Group, as interim chairman and CEO.\n\"The big focus for Mike Wilkins will be finding an appropriate CEO to take over the reins from the departing CEO,\" Ellis said. \"It's going to be tough to find an appropriately qualified and experienced person to take such a tough role.\"\nStill, Ellis said there are some bright spots at AMP.\n\"Longer term, the underlying business is still robust and there is plenty to like about it, but it's going to be 12 months, 18 months, perhaps 2 years before I think we can see investors getting some value out of it.\"\nThe company said it would make a formal submission in response to the allegations raised at the commission by May 4.\nâ€”Reuters contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T10:20:38.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
