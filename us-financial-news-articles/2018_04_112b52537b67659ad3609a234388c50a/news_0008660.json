The aggregate amount of the special cash dividend will be approximately US$500 million.\nRecord holders of the Company's ordinary shares at the close of business U.S. Eastern Time on April 20, 2018 (the \"Record Date\") will be entitled to receive the special cash dividend. Changyou expects The Bank of New York Mellon, the depositary bank for Changyou's ADS program, to distribute dividends to holders of ADSs as of the Record Date on or about April 26, 2018.\nMr. Dewen Chen, Changyou's CEO, commented, \"We are pleased to reward our shareholders with this special dividend, which reflects our continued commitment to drive value for investors over the long term. After this distribution, we are confident that we will have sufficient capital for our business, including to fully fund our R&D, execute game strategy, take advantage of new opportunities as they arise, and maintain our leading position in the online game market, and we believe that we will continue to be able to generate strong cash flows.\"\nIn order to facilitate the distribution of this special dividend, Changyou has revised its policy for its PRC subsidiaries with respect to their distribution of cash dividends. Under the revised policy, all PRC subsidiaries in the Changyou Group will be able to distribute their cumulative available and undistributed earnings to their direct overseas parent companies in the Changyou Group. The change will result in Changyou's accrual of additional withholding income taxes of approximately $47 million for the period before December 31, 2017, which will be recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Changyou had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of US$978 million. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2017 was a net inflow of US$199 million.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.
