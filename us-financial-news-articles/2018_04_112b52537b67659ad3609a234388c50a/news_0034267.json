They join the firm’s growing national Business Litigation Practice Group as partners.\n“Stephen and Lauren are outstanding lawyers and people, and we are thrilled to have them join our team in Boston,” said Tony Froio , managing partner of the firm’s Boston office and a member of the Executive Board. “They are incredibly accomplished trial lawyers with deep roots and relationships within the Boston community and beyond that will serve our clients well. Their arrival at the firm underscores our long-standing history and commitment to recruiting top talent in Boston over the last 35 years, as we continue to strategically expand our capabilities to better serve the needs of our diverse client base in the Boston and New England markets.”\nWald has tried cases in federal, state, and bankruptcy courts, winning defense verdicts and numerous multimillion-dollar verdicts and outcomes in disputes focusing on intellectual property, telecommunications, real estate, employment, and environmental law. His diverse work has included representing the maker of the Swiss Army knife in a dispute over its worldwide intellectual property rights; Native American phone companies against attacks by AT&T, Sprint, and other major carriers; and, in a successful gender discrimination trial, the first female chemical engineer to supervise a production line at her Fortune 500 company. Notably, Wald also served as a Special Assistant Attorney General representing the Massachusetts Trial Court and its Chief Justice in connection with a hiring scandal within the Massachusetts Probation Department.\n“Robins Kaplan’s local and national platform will enable us to continue to serve our clients in their most complex business disputes,” said Wald. “We have long followed the firm’s successes and are excited to join such a well-respected group of trial lawyers.”\nCoppola represents clients in complex commercial litigation matters, with a focus on telecommunications and technology disputes, including cases arising out of the Federal Communications Act and its 1996 amendments. She has also represented entities on regulatory issues under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, state public utility commissions, and Tribal courts. Coppola has experience in a variety of other types of business disputes, including breach of fiduciary duty, licensing, and construction cases.\n“There is a tremendous amount of development and growth taking place in the Boston market, and Robins Kaplan’s litigation capabilities and strong footprint in the greater Massachusetts area provide the perfect fit for our practices,” added Coppola. “We are very much looking forward to working with Tony and his team on matters spanning both sides of the courtroom.”\nWald and Coppola join Robins Kaplan from Partridge Snow & Hahn LLP. As active members of the Boston Bar Association and Massachusetts Bar Association, they have worked closely with members of Robins Kaplan’s Boston office including Froio, current president of the Boston Bar Foundation, and partner Christopher P. Sullivan , current MBA president. Both Wald and Coppola received their undergraduate degrees from Vassar College. Wald holds a J.D. from Boston College Law School; Coppola received hers from DePaul University College of Law.\nAbout Robins Kaplan LLP ®\nRobins Kaplan is among the nation’s premier trial law firms, with more than 220 lawyers located in Bismarck, N.D.; Boston; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; Naples, Fla; New York; Silicon Valley; and Sioux Falls, S.D.
