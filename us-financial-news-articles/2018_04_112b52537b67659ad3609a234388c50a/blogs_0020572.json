Sometimes, it means you're actually good at your job but you know that you're called to do something completely different.\n\"Two things happen when we are on the verge of this,\" says Morgenstern. \"We either stifle the call or we go with the call.\"\nWhen we stifle it, Morgenstern says the delay is often fueled by fear of the unknown, fear of being too old, or fear of being unable to pay the bills.\n\"Those fears are valid and how you get unstuck is to write down all of the fears you have,\" she says. \"And then start seeing the possibility. What else might be true of what could happen?\"\nRather than thinking of the negative aspects, Morgenstern says you should start thinking of the positive aspects like more money, more time off, better fulfillment and better balance.\n\"Ask yourself the five-year question,\" she says. \"If your life or career continues on its current trajectory and you are in the same place in five years, are you OK with where you are headed?
