(the “ Company ” or “ GrowMax Resources ”) (TSX-V:GRO) announces today that it has filed its 2017 audited consolidated financial statements, including the Auditor’s Report thereon, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) relating to its 2017 year-end results.

Working capital is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. Working capital is used to assess liquidity and general financial strength. Working capital does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. It is unlikely for non-GAAP measures to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Working capital should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than current assets or current liabilities as determined in accordance with IFRS.\nJAMIE SOMERVILLE DEPARTS GROWMAX RESOURCES\nMr. Jamie Somerville, who has been the Company’s Executive Vice President, will be leaving GrowMax effective May 1, 2018.
