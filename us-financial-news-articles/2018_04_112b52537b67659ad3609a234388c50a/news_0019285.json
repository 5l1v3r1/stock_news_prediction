The Company has commenced an executive search for a replacement.\nJan-Anders Karlsson, PhD, CEO of Verona Pharma, commented, “We thank Ken for his outstanding service and many contributions to the Company. Over the past three years, he has led the acceleration of RPL554’s clinical development program into Phase 2b trials and overseen seven successful clinical trials. He played an instrumental role in establishing our U.S. presence and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nAbout Verona Pharma plc\nVerona Pharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for the treatment of respiratory diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Verona Pharma’s product candidate, RPL554, is a first-in-class, inhaled, dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and 4 that acts as both a bronchodilator and an anti-inflammatory agent in a single compound. In clinical trials, treatment with RPL554 has been observed to result in statistically significant improvements in lung function as compared to placebo, and has shown clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function when administered in addition to frequently used short- and long-acting bronchodilators as compared to such bronchodilators administered as a single agent. Verona Pharma is developing RPL554 for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and potentially asthma.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
