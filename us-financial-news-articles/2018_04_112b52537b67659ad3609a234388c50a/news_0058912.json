It was Nola’s first win in three tries against Atlanta this season.\nCloser Hector Neris struck out the side in a scoreless ninth inning to nail down the win in a non-save situation.\nThe losing pitcher was Max Fried (0-2), who allowed one run in three innings with three strikeouts.\nAtlanta starter Julio Teheran pitched only three innings before being lifted. Teheran gave up three runs on two hits and two walks, with two strikeouts.\nThe Braves scored three runs in the first inning. Freddie Freeman singled home Ender Inciarte and sent Ozzie Albies to third. Albies then stole home on the front end of a double steal. Rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. doubled in Freeman for the third run.\nBut the Phillies got the runs back in the bottom of the inning on a three-run homer from Herrera.\nThe Phillies took a 4-3 lead in the sixth when Herrera hit a solo home run to right field against Fried.\nPhiladelphia tacked on two runs in the seventh when Alfaro hit a two-run homer, his second, against reliever Chase Whitley, who had been recalled from Triple-A Gwinnett on Friday morning.\nThe Phillies added another run in the eighth when Alfaro homered off Peter Moylan.\nThe Braves made two roster moves on Friday. They activated catcher Tyler Flowers from the 10-day disabled list, where he had been since the opening weekend due to a strained oblique, and promoted Whitley. The Braves optioned pitcher Matt Wisler to Triple-A Gwinnett and designated catcher Carlos Perez for assignment.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:29:26.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
