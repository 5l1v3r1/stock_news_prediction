Good on him for doing it.”\nNew Zealand Rugby, which was recognised locally last year for its diversity and inclusivity policies, also used social media to tacitly support Weber.\n“New Zealand Rugby is committed to Diversity and Inclusion, and welcomes people from all walks of life,” NZR said in a post on its Instagram page.\n“We respect that people have different views and beliefs, however expect that any opinions and views are expressed in a respectful way.” (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Peter Rutherford/John O’Brien)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T15:10:55.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
