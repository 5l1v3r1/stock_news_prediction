They were the first such executions in over two decades and sparked protests.\nBahrain accuses mainly Shi’ite Iran of arming and funding deadly attacks against its security forces in the kingdom, a strategic island where the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet is based, charges Tehran denies.\nWriting by Ghaida Ghantous, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T20:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:05:42.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
