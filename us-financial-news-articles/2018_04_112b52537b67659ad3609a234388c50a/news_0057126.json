It also booked a gain a year earlier from the revaluation of the company's stake in Chinese partner BAIC Motor Corporation.\nCurrency exchange rate shifts had a \"slightly negative\" effect on earnings, the company said Friday.\nCEO Dieter Zetsche pointed to a 7 percent increase in vehicle unit sales in the quarter, to 807,000 vehicles worldwide. \"We are sustainably continuing along our profitable growth course and sold more vehicles than ever before in a first quarter,\" he said.\nDaimler is counting on continued strong profits to fund its investments in new technologies expected to reshape the auto industry. Those include electric and autonomous vehicles and increasing use of cars as a temporary service. The company pushed in that direction by agreeing in March to combine its mobility service division including its car-sharing business with BMW's services business.\nRevenue increased 3 percent to 39.78 billion euros ($48.2 billion) and the Mercedes division's profit rose 3 percent. Strong sales of the flagship S-Class luxury sedan and sport-utility vehicles boosted earnings at the division. The division's return on sales — a key measure of profitability — increased to 9.0 percent from 8.9 percent in the year-earlier quarter. Profits slipped however at the company's van and bus divisions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T11:57:14.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
