Seven of the eight major components increased on a year-over-year basis.\nThe Bank of Canada’s three measures of core inflation were little changed. CPI common, which the central bank says is the best gauge of the economy’s underperformance, remained at 1.9 percent.\nCPI median, which shows the median inflation rate across CPI components, stayed at 2.1 percent, while CPI trim, which excludes upside and downside outliers, edged down to 2.0 percent from 2.1 percent.\n“It was little bit lighter than expectations ... to market expectations it was a little bit more dovish than expected,” said Derek Holt, head of capital markets at Scotiabank.\nThe Bank of Canada flagged that more interest rate hikes would be coming after it held its benchmark rates steady on Wednesday, but said it did not know when or how aggressive it would need to be to keep inflation in check. It cited progress on inflation and wages.\nRetail sales grew by 0.4 percent in February as higher sales at auto dealerships and general merchandise stores outweighed widespread weakness in other sectors, Statistics Canada said.\nOverall, sales grew in just four of the 11 subsectors, representing 47 percent of retail trade. In volume terms, sales edged up 0.3 percent.\nWith additional reporting by Fergal Smith and Allison Martel in Toronto; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:51:25.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
