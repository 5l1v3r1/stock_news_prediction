The sprawling estate, which he owned with ex-wife Ivana, was recently listed on the market for $45 million. \n\"When Donald and Ivana had it, they had it decorated very lavishly,\" listing agent Tamar Lurie of Coldwell Banker told the Wall Street Journal . \nTake a look inside the mansion now. Coldwell Banker/Chris Meech \nAt 19,773 square feet, 21 Vista Drive is an impressive, waterfront estate, with eight bedrooms and 13 bathrooms. \nThere are also eight fireplaces, a five-car garage, three fully equipped staff apartments, a putting green, tennis court, swimming pool (indoor and outdoor), terrace, elevator, a three-story rotunda, private dock and a movie theater. Its architectural style, according to the listing , is described as \"Georgian Colonial.\" Coldwell Banker/Chris Meech \n\"One of the most impressive properties in the country, this magnificent Indian Harbor estate is poised on its own six acre peninsula, rimmed by the sparkling waters of Long Island Sound, re-establishing its original beauty,\" the listing from Coldwell Banker states. Coldwell Banker/Chris Meech \nThe mansion, Realtor.com reports , was built in 1939 and sold to Trump and Ivana (mother to Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric) in 1982 for $4 million. After the pair divorced in 1991, Ivana kept the estate until 1998, then sold it to its current owners for $15 million. The estate had reportedly been listed by its current owners for $54 million before they slashed the price to $45 million and ultimately took it off the market. It is now re-listed. \nThe current owners, a financier and his wife, revamped the mansion. \n\"It's much more livable and relaxed and quite elegant, but not as lavish as when Ivana had it,\" Lurie tells the Journal. Coldwell Banker/Chris Meech \nWith its $45 million price tag, the price per square foot is $2,275.83, according to the listing. \nGreenwich, a posh Connecticut town in Fairfield County, is known for attracting high-income residents. Old Greenwich ranked sixth on Bloomberg's America's 100 Richest Places to Live for 2017, with an average household income of $341,401 in 2015. Coldwell Banker/Chris Meech \nTrump, a real estate tycoon, has quite a few impressive properties in his personal portfolio, including a $100 million, New York City penthouse (lavishly decorated with gold and marble features), and his massive Mar-a-Lago estate, which he reportedly purchased for $5 million in 1988 and 10 years later, turned into a private club. The sprawling mansion consists of 128 rooms and is located in Palm Beach, Florida. \nLast year, Donald Trump reportedly put his Caribbean estate on the market and later cut the price. The listing for the mansion is still on the Sotheby's International Realty website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:15:24.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
