Beijing announced plans to hold live-fire military drills in the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday. \nChina claims self-ruled Taiwan as its sacred territory, under its “one China” policy, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring what it sees as a wayward province under its control. \nOn Thursday, President Xi Jinping presided over the Chinese navy’s largest-ever military display, state media reported, the country’s latest show of force in the disputed South China Sea. \nTsai on Friday boarded a warship off Suao on the east coast to observe the Taiwan drill, which the defence ministry said aimed to test the military’s rapid response capability to defend Taiwan.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu \n“I believe our nationals should feel very confident about our army’s determination to defend and protect our country,” Tsai, who is chief commander of Taiwan’s armed forces, said aboard the warship after the drill. \nAsked by a reporter if the event was aimed at competing with Xi, Tsai urged people “not to over-read” the situation, saying her inspection was just the first of a series. \nThe army could safeguard Taiwan, she said, adding that her trip to the southern African nation of Swaziland, set from Tuesday to April 21, would not be affected by China’s plans for live-fire drills.
