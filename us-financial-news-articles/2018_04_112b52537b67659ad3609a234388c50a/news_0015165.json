Pocock, who had a sabbatical last year, scored the last of the seven-try haul for the Brumbies. \nThe Reds made a storming start and scored through Taniela Tupou and Chris Feauai-Sautia in the opening 22 minutes but saw their 18-12 halftime lead wiped out after the interval. \nBoth sides now have three wins and three defeats from their opening six matches of the 2018 campaign. CHIEFS 21 BLUES 19 \nA late penalty try handed the Chiefs a fifth victory in six Super Rugby matches this year and extended their record-breaking dominance over the struggling Blues. \nChiefs are now undefeated in their last 14 games against the Blues — the longest unbeaten streak for any team against another in Super Rugby history — but they were behind for much of the match before securing their hard-fought success in Hamilton. \nThe Chiefs recovered from a 14-19 halftime deficit to win when referee Paul Williams awarded a penalty try in the 74th minute as the home scrum powered towards the line. \nThe home side scored the game’s first try after 12 minutes through wing Sean Wainui but James Parsons went over just before halftime for the Blues. SUNWOLVES 29 WARATAHS 50 \nNew South Wales Waratahs defeated the Sunwolves 50-29 in a try-fest at Tokyo’s Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium on Saturday as the Japanese side fell well short in their latest bid for a first win of the campaign. \nOn a chilly afternoon in the Japanese capital, the Sunwolves were let down by errors all over the park as they failed to keep pace with the Waratahs and maintained their unwanted record of never having beaten an Australian side in Super Rugby. \nDespite an up-tempo game plan from Jamie Joseph’s men, the superior quality of the Australians showed as two tries from scrum half Jake Gordon gave the Waratahs a 38-17 lead following a first half that contained seven tries. \nFour more tries followed in the second half and, despite a yellow card for captain Michael Hooper with 16 minutes remaining, the Waratahs ran out comfortable winners, closing the gap on the conference-leading Rebels to one point. HURRICANES 38 SHARKS 37 \nThe Wellington Hurricanes needed a converted try from centre Ngani Laumape five minutes after the hooter to pip South Africa’s Sharks in a thriller at McLean Park, Napier, on Friday. \nThe New Zealand conference leaders were trailing by nine points with two minutes remaining but Ihaia West slotted home a penalty before the Hurricanes pack built a platform for Laumape to romp across the line for his second try of the night. \nFlyhalf West, promoted to start after Beauden Barrett failed a late fitness test, still needed to add the conversion to give 2016 champions their fifth straight win and he nervelessly steered the ball between the posts to the delight of the crowd. \nThe Durban-based Sharks, picking up where they left off in their 63-40 win over the Blues in Auckland last week, scored four tries in a brilliant display of aggressive forward play and powerful running from the backline. LIONS 52 STORMERS 31 \nSpeedy winger Madosh Tambwe scored a record-equalling four tries — including a hat-trick in the opening 13 minutes — as the Lions recorded a convincing victory in a high tempo contest at Ellis Park. \nLionel Mapoe, Kwagga Smith, Franco Mostert and Ruan Combrinck added four more tries as the Stormers suffered a fifth defeat in this year’s campaign. \nWilco Louw, Damian Willemse and substitute Paul de Wet, playing only his second Super Rugby game, scored for the Cape Town-based Stormers, who were also awarded a penalty try in the last minute. \nThe 20-year-old Congo-born Tambwe equalled the record for the most tries scored by an individual in a Super Rugby encounter.
