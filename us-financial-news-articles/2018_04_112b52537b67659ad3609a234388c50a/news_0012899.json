Japan’s Nikkei wavered either side of flat, and South Korea edged ahead by 0.2 percent.\nCaution remained the watchword after Trump claimed on Sunday that China would take down its trade barriers because it was “the right thing to do.”\nTrump late Thursday threatened to slap $100 billion more in tariffs on Chinese imports, while Beijing said it was fully prepared to respond with a “fierce counter strike”.\nAnalysts warned the drama would be a long-running one given the lengthy public discussion period on U.S. tariff proposals meant the earliest they might be imposed was somewhere around late July or early August.\n“This is not going to happen tomorrow, and given the mercurial nature of the U.S. administration, the whole issue could well disappear before anything really happens,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global.\n“Many market participants may be starting to think that this is just a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing in the end. But..you never know, U.S. trade policy is in the hands of someone totally unpredictable.”\nHOPES FOR EARNINGS The next major hurdle will be a speech by Chinese President Xi at the Boao Forum on Tuesday.\nThe war of words took a toll on Wall Street on Friday. The Dow ended down 2.3 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 2.2 percent and the Nasdaq 2.3 percent.\nThe looming earnings season might be strong enough to provide fundamental support for stocks, with analysts tipping the fastest quarterly profit growth in seven years.\nThe latest souring of risk sentiment and a soft report on U.S. payrolls helped sovereign debt end last week on a firm note. Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasury debt dropped back to 2.786 percent, from a top of 2.8380 on Thursday.\nIn currency markets, the dollar steadied on the safe haven yen at 106.87, just short of the recent six-week peak of 107.49. The euro hovered at $1.2274, after bouncing from a trough of $1.2212, while the dollar index was a fraction firmer at 90.150.\nIn commodity markets, gold eased slightly to $1,331.90 an ounce, but stayed well within recent trading ranges.\nOil prices edged up in early trade with Brent crude futures for June rising 16 cents to $67.27 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 11 cents to $62.17 a barrel.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam and Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T09:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T11:20:19.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
