Strantz has been with Chicagoland’s multiple listing service since its inception in 2008, working with the Multiple Listing Service of Northern Illinois (MLSNI) before the merger with MAP MLS that created MRED.\nStrantz served in several positions during the last 25 years, including Manager of System Design and Help Desk Supervisor. She played instrumental roles in projects such as modernizing connectMLS and adding Cloud CMA services, helping keep MRED at the forefront of emerging technology. One of Strantz’s final efforts helped bring in Remine, a “big data” service that will allow MRED customers access to unprecedented predictive analytics.\nMRED logo\n“MLSs have gone through an amazing transition from being non-technical entities to extremely high-tech platforms and Lynn has been a crucial part of making that happen.” said MRED Chief Operating Officer Jeff Lasky. “It wouldn’t be a stretch to call her one of the founders of the modern MLS.”\nMRED’s new Chief Technology Officer Chris Haran is taking over duties previously held by Strantz.\n“It’s truly been an honor to be at MRED with some of the finest professionals I’ve ever worked with,” Strantz said. “I feel blessed to have gotten the opportunity to be a part of an organization that always strives to be better.”\n“Lynn has been a vital part of MRED during her time here, championing groundbreaking projects and helping set this company up for a long run of success,” said MRED President/CEO Rebecca Jensen. “I’m beyond thankful for her pioneering leadership and countless contributions to this team. We wish her all the best.”\nAbout MRED\nMidwest Real Estate Data (MRED) is the real estate data aggregator and distributor providing the Chicagoland multiple listing service (MLS) to more than 40,000 brokers and appraisers and over 7,300 offices.
