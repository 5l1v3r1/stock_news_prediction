WMT 1.34% on Monday said it would sell its British arm Asda Group Ltd. to rival J Sainsbury JSAIY 13.75% PLC, a deal that values the chain at about £7.3 billion ($10.1 billion) and would, if successful, create the largest player in the U.K.’s fiercely competitive grocery market.\nThe deal, under which Walmart gets a 42% stake in the combined company and almost £3 billion in cash, will free the U.S. retailer from having to drive growth in a challenging market while allowing it to benefit from greater heft.\nAsda has been one of Walmart’s most profitable businesses since it was acquired in 1999 but growth has been capped by intense competition from a resurgent Tesco TSCDY -1.63% PLC, Amazon.com Inc.—which has been pushing further into online groceries—and increasingly popular discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nThe move is part of a broader shift by Walmart to form joint ventures in competitive markets and focus investments in areas executives think will provide growth. It is also in talks to sell its controlling stake in its Brazilian operations and in advanced discussions to buy a majority stake in Flipkart Group, India’s largest e-commerce company.\nWalmart is facing its own struggles in the U.S. where rival Amazon has broadened its branded food and own-label offerings while improving delivery options, and is also grappling with slower growth in some promising international markets such as Mexico.\nSainsbury Chief Executive Mike Coupe said he met Walmart’s former international chief David Cheesewright to discuss a potential deal last year and the two sides had been in talks since. Mr. Cheesewright retired in January.\nRelated\nHeard on the Street: A Partial Brexit for Walmart Walmart Looks to Scale Back in U.K. and Brazil, With an Eye on India However, the deal will likely draw major antitrust scrutiny in the U.K. amid concerns the combined company would have too much power over food prices. The U.K. grocery market is already highly consolidated with the top four players commanding over 60%.\nThe combined company would operate 2,800 stores and command a 27% market share, according to Kantar. It made about £51 billion in revenue last year.\nSainsbury buying Asda “would represent a remarkable step-up in U.K. industry consolidation, if cleared,” said Jefferies analyst James Grzinic, adding that the two companies would have to be “willing to accept very punishing conditions to secure an approval.”\nNevertheless, Sainsbury’s Mr. Coupe said the company in seeking regulatory approval wouldn’t close any stores. He said online shopping and the rise of discounters made the industry more competitive today than when previous consolidations had required store closures. The company, whose shares rose as much as 20%, expects the deal to close in the second half of the year. Mr. Coupe didn’t rule out selling stores.\nThe deal to combine the No.2 and No.3 players marks the biggest U.K. grocery consolidation since Wm. Morrison Supermarkets PLC bought Safeway PLC in 2004 and was forced to sell dozens of stores. Industry leader Tesco more recently completed last month the acquisition of Booker Group PLC for £3.7 billion—another bid to gain heft, but that deal combined a wholesaler and a retailer rather than two retailers.\nRelated Video The retail industry is undergoing another major shift -- to e-commerce. How did we get here? Photo: Associated Press Sainsbury said buying Asda will add at least £500 million to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as it benefits from bulk buying and opening branches of Argos—which sell everything from irons to chairs—in Asda stores. Sainsbury bought Argos owner Home Retail Group in 2016 for £1.4 billion.\nThe companies plan to keep both the Sainsbury and Asda brands, which serve different customers, the former being more upmarket. The combined company will be led by Sainsbury’s chairman and CEO, while Asda’s CEO will join its board.\nThe Bentonville, Ark. company will have voting rights up to 29.9% in the combined company and two of its executives will join the board to find ways to cut costs on clothing and general merchandise as well as deploy Walmart’s technology investments at Sainsbury.\nSainsbury said the two companies will lower prices by about 10% on “many” everyday products by asking suppliers for the lowest price on products both Asda and Sainsbury currently sell.\nMarket Talk\nJ Sainsbury’s merger with Asda, Walmart’s U.K. operating arm, will help the British supermarket overcome its pricing weaknesses, Bernstein analysts say. The bank says the two supermarkets can complement each other well in a combined business. In the non-food sector, Sainsbury’s Argos can help Asda bolster its e-commerce weakness, a factor made all the more important by Amazon lurking in the background, Bernstein says. J Sainsbury shares are up 16.5% at 314.30 pence a share. (oliver.griffin@dowjones.com; @OliGGriffin) Some analysts say Sainsbury faces a long, uphill battle to get antitrust approval to buy Walmart-owned rival Asda. They would become Britain’s biggest grocer with a 27% market share. The sector is already highly consolidated with Asda, Sainsbury, current No. 1 Tesco and Morrisons combined making up some 62% of sales. Meanwhile, Jefferies thinks Asda will likely find it hard to motivate employees concerned about their future at a combined Sainsbury/Asda through the course of the antitrust review. Deal supporters might take heart from UK regulators’ late 2017 approval of Tesco buying Booker. The clearance surprised many. Sainsbury shares have jumped an early 15%. (saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com; @SaabiraC) Walmart moved into the UK in 1999 in paying GBP6.7 billion for Asda, giving the US giant a foothold in the UK as it looked to expand its reach globally. But the company has had missteps internationally, and amid what’s been a tough operating climate in England for years the company is kind of cashing out. It will receive GBP2.98 billion and own 42% of the bulked-up Sainsbury, which is merging with Asda. Walmart says the deal values Asda at about GBP7.3 billion “on a debt-free, cash-free and pension-free basis.” Not much of a return (excluding corporate earnings over the years) from nearly 2 decades of ownership.
