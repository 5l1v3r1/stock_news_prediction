On Thursday it hit a trough of $1.20965, its lowest level since Jan. 12.\nWeaker-than-expected economic data out of the euro zone has cast some doubt as to how quickly the ECB can head toward policy normalisation and weighed on the euro recently.\n“The euro zone’s economy doesn’t seem to have the type of momentum it had last year,” said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\nThe dollar, which has drawn strength from the recent rise in U.S. bond yields, held steady against a basket of six major currencies at 91.555. The dollar index had set a 3-1/2-month high of around 91.637 on Thursday.\nThe yen showed little reaction after the Bank of Japan kept its monetary policy steady as widely expected.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar held steady at 109.28 yen , having backed off slightly from a 2-1/2-month peak of 109.49 yen struck on Thursday.\nOil prices edged lower on Friday but Brent largely held gains from the previous session amid concerns that Iran may face renewed sanctions, choking off supply.\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude futures fell 0.4 percent to $74.47 a barrel, after rising 1 percent on Thursday.\nEditing by Kim Coghill and Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T14:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:34:29.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
