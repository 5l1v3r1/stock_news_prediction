City officials were not immediately available for comment on Monday.\nThe new international airport’s initial opening date in June 2012 was called off with only three weeks to spare, leaving airlines racing to reschedule their operations at the last minute.\nSince then the project has been plagued by further delays, allegations of bribery and technical issues.\nCentrally located Tegel is popular with many travellers, and Berliners voted to keep the Cold War era airport open by around 56 percent in a non-binding referendum in September 2017.\nThe new airport, under construction since 2006, will also be too small on completion, as it has an initial capacity of 27 million. The two airports currently serving Berlin, Tegel and Schoenefeld, served around 30 million in 2017.
