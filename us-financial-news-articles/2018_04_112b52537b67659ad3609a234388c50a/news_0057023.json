The building suites range in size from 10,000 sq. ft. to 43,000 sq. ft.\n“The buildings are specifically designed to accommodate small to mid-size users, which is where most of the leasing velocity occurs,” says Wagner. “We are very optimistic that the strong market fundamentals in the surrounding area are positioned for additional near-term growth.”\nAbout The Meritex Company\nThe Meritex Company is the expert in putting properties and people together, offering the flexibility and innovation of a family-owned company, with the discipline and governance of a much larger business.
