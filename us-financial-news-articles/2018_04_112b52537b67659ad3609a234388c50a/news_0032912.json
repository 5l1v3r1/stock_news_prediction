It has been stuck in a tight range around $1.22-25 since late January.\nAs uncertainty on trade loomed large, markets showed a largely muted response to other economic news.\nU.S. retail sales rebounded in March after three straight monthly declines as households boosted purchases of motor vehicles and other big-ticket items\n“Markets are focusing more on trade and political headlines than economic data. These days it is hard to tell in advance what will move markets. We just have to deal with whatever headlines that come out,” said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.\nSince last month, Trump came up with a series of raid-fire tariff proposals, some of them already in place, heightening worries they could lead to a damaging trade war and disrupt the global economy.\nElsewhere the pound pushed past the $1.43 mark, approaching a post-Brexit referendum high of $1.4346 touched in January as investors’ focus shifted to data that could cement expectations of a May interest rate increase and away from Britain’s military intervention in Syria.\nThe pound last traded at $1.4340.\nIn Asia, Chinese economic data including the first quarter gross domestic product is the main focus for the day.\nEconomists expect the Chinese economy to have expanded 6.7 percent in the first three months of 2018 year-on-year, slowing slightly from 6.8 percent in the preceding quarter.
