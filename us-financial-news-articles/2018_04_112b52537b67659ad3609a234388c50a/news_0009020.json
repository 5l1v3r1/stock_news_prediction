Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix - collectively known as the “FANG” group - were up between 1.1 percent and 3.8 percent.\n“U.S. equity markets are poised to open in the green as investors temporarily shrug off trade war fears,” Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda said in a note.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped about 500 points on Wednesday after a proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods prompted swift retaliation from Beijing. China hit back with equal measure on U.S. goods such as soybeans, autos, chemicals and some types of aircraft.\nShares of big U.S. manufacturers, grain traders and chipmakers were hit hard until mid-day.\nBut sentiment reversed after President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was involved in a “negotiation” with China rather than a trade war.\n“The bounce on Wednesday was really quite impressive, especially as there was not much of a catalyst for the turnaround given that neither the U.S. or China is backing down on tariffs and negotiations were always going to take place in the background,” Erlam wrote.\nAlso, the effective date of China’s move depended on when the U.S. action took effect, providing room for maneuver.\nEconomic data on Thursday showed that the U.S. trade deficit increased to a near 9-1/2-year high in February, but the shortfall with China narrowed sharply.\nWhile exports to China were unchanged in February, imports from the country declined 14.7 percent.\nAt 8:35 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 79 points, or 0.33 percent, with 65,148 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 12.75 points, or 0.48 percent, with 224,988 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 50.5 points, or 0.77 percent, on volume of 80,483 contracts.\nFacebook shares were up 3.7 percent after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company had not seen “any meaningful impact” on usage or ad sales since the scandal.\nWells Fargo rose 1 percent and Citigroup gained 1.5 percent following upgrades by UBS.\nAdvanced Micro Devices jumped 2.8 percent after Stifel upgraded to “buy”, while Micron Technology fell 1.5 percent after UBS started with a “sell” rating.
