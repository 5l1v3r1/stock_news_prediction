It has been upgrading its three refineries in order to produce better quality products and reduce pollution.\nPavlodar refinery has already completed its modernisation programme. Atyrau refinery plans to launch new units by June, while Shymkent is expected to wrap up a modernisation in September.\nAccording to the energy ministry, the refineries plan to increase their oil products throughput to 15.3 million tonnes this year, from 14.2 million tonnes last year.\nFuel oil production is seen declining to 2.4 million tonnes, from 3.3 million tonnes. It exports virtually all of its VGO output, but will end production of the fuel in the third quarter of this year.
