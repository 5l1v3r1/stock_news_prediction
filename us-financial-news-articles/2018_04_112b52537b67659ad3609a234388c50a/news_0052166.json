However, Brown said Mourinho’s side have delivered results in the domestic league and FA Cup.\n“Again (this season) we’re second in the league and in the final of the FA Cup... so Mourinho’s doing a good job,” the 38-year-old added.\n“Every season we’re improving and hopefully he can get us even closer to Manchester City if not win the league next season.”\nUnited sit second in the standings, 16 points behind champions City, and are guaranteed a better finish than last season’s sixth place.\nHowever, with City breaking new ground en route to their first league title under manager Pep Guardiola, Brown believes United will have to bridge the gap with smart purchases in the next transfer window.\n“I’m sure he (Mourinho) would want to improve on this season so he’s going to get some people in... even if that means some people go out as well,” Brown, who won five league titles with United, said.\n“This year you put your hand up and say they (City) were brilliant.\n“I’m guessing it will be a lot harder for them next season. Not just us (United) but other top teams will have to step up their game.” LOW EXPECTATIONS\nBrown, who made 23 appearances for England, believes that Gareth Southgate’s World Cup-bound squad could benefit from low expectations from supporters ahead of the June-July tournament in Russia.\nEngland crashed out of the last World Cup in Brazil at the group stage and suffered a humiliating defeat by lower-ranked Iceland in the last-16 at Euro 2016.\n“I don’t think everyone is saying ‘we’re going to win it’ which is probably a good thing,” said Brown.\n“Whether we can win... I’m not sure. We qualified pretty easily again. I’m guessing a lot of it is mentality. I think they will need a little bit of luck and togetherness too.” (Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru Editing by Christian Radnedge)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:30:02.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
