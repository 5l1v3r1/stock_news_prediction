His announcement was welcomed by the U.S., South Korea and China as a positive step in the run-up to an inter-Korean summit on Friday and a planned meeting between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump by June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T15:53:44.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
