The metal had closed down in the previous two sessions but is still up by around 25 percent so far this month. Most other base metals also rose but London nickel fell by as much as 2.2 percent, continuing its retreat from a three-year high of $16,690 a tonne seen on April 19 as fears of additional sanctions eased. \"In general it seems that the markets and indeed its participants all coped with the 'storm' and now it is a case of letting the prices find a new level at which they are comfortable,\" Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, wrote in a note. However, the possibility of Germany going into a recession may well see prices \"testing the downside once again,\" he added.
