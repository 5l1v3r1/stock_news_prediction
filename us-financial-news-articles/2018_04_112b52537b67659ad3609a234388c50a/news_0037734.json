The strategic purchase will add a roofing component to an already extensive portfolio of PV thermal water heating, solar energy, and battery storage installations.\nMaui Roofing has been installing roofs for consumers and businesses on the islands for decades. The company has a sterling reputation providing the highest level of craftsmanship and customer service. Like PetersenDean the organization carries the top-ranking certifications and endorsements from the industry’s leading manufacturers.\n“Maui Roofing fits right into the PD and Haleakala wheel house, given their “gold standard” reputation for quality and service, said Jim Petersen, Vice President of PetersenDean Hawaii LLC. Petersen added “We intend to start selling roofs in May 2018 across all major Hawaiian Islands and this acquisition will accelerate the process, putting us on a path to install over one-thousand new roofs on Hawaii by 2018-2019 FYE”.\nTim Leist, owner of Maui Roofing and forty-year roofing veteran, stated that he and Jim Petersen “come from a like-minded approach to installing high end roofs and putting the customer first. We have both been in this industry for decades, weathering the ups and downs with honesty and hard work.”\nThis acquisition is the second in Hawaii this year for PetersenDean following the purchase of Haleakala Solar last month. Gary Liardon, the President of the Consumer Division of PetersenDean, is heading up this transition as well as the additional acquisitions planned across the United States in 2018. “We are excited to add the Maui Roofing team to the ranks. Mr. Leist will transition to a development role with the company focusing on expanding roofing to the remaining islands.”\nAbout PetersenDean Roofing & Solar\nFounded in 1984 by Jim Petersen, PetersenDean is the largest, full-service, privately-held roofing and solar company in the United States.
