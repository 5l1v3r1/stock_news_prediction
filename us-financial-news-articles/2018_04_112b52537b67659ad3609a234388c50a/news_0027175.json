The annual shortfall in revenues to meet government spending will “grow substantially” before stabilizing in 2023, the CBO said. \nThe Treasury in particular would like to know whether it should add a new five-year TIPS issue in the second half of the year. Currently, it issues only one new five-year TIPS issue each year. \nThe Treasury will sell $16 billion of a new five-year TIPS issue on Thursday. \nThe subject of TIPS is one of the several topics in the Treasury’s latest quarterly survey of the top 23 primary dealers, or firms that do business directly with the Federal Reserve and participate in every Treasury auction. \nThe dealers’ responses to the survey are due at noon (1600 GMT) on April 23 prior to a meeting with Treasury officials on April 26-27.
