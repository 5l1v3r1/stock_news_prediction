Brazil's President Michel Temer steps off the podium at the Planalto Palace in Brasilia, Brazil April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Adriano Machado\nFederal police suspect that Temer laundered 2 million reais (£417,617.42) through real estate purchases and reforms made by family members, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported in its Friday edition, without citing its sources.\nPolice did not respond to requests for confirmation.\nAuthorities are investigating if Temer took the bribes in return for helping shape a decree regulating Brazil’s ports, and in particular to extend concessions in the port of Santos to benefit companies of close associates.\nThe decree Temer signed a year ago extended contracts for companies operating at the Santos port from 25 to 35 years with an option for renewing the concession for up to 70 years.\nTemer has repeatedly said he is innocent. In a televised statement of Friday, he said: “This is a criminal persecution disguised as an investigation,” adding that it was another attempt to remove him from power.

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino\nTemer has faced a several graft allegations since he took the presidency in 2016 following the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff, for whom he served as vice president.\nCritics say Temer orchestrated her downfall, motivated by a desire to quash Brazilian investigators’ unprecedented anti-corruption push, an allegation Temer has denied.\nPolice arrested several of Temer’s aides last month, including a former police colonel suspected of taking illegal money on the president’s behalf.\nThe federal congress voted twice last year to block Temer from standing trial in the Supreme Court on three corruption charges levelled against him.\nOnce Temer leaves office on Jan. 1, 2019, and is stripped of Congressional protections against prosecution, he may have to face those charges in lower courts.
