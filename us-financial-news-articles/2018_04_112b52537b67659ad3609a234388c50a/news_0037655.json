Testa’s portfolio is concentrated in the former, primarily in the capital Madrid, where 65 percent of its assets are located. \n“Rents rose between 8 and 9 percent in the contracts we renewed last year,” Beck said. \nSources said in February that the company aimed to float in May, and that fellow real estate firm Haya will hit the market in the same month. $1 = 0.8105 euros Reporting by Robert Hetz, writing by Isla Binnie.
