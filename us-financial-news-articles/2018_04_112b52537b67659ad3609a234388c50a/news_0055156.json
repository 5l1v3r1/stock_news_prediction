The retailer had aimed for the sale by the end of last year.\nThe group was particularly hard hit by the political fallout of its decision to hand over land for a U.S.-made missile defence system despite Chinese opposition.\nIn October, Seoul and Beijing agreed to move past the dispute.\nLotte Shopping did not elaborate on whether there was progress on the sales of its remaining five Lotte Mart operators in China.
