Ethiopia’s newly elected prime minister Abiy Ahmed attends a rally during his visit to Ambo in the Oromiya region, Ethiopia April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Tiksa Negeri \nThe 42-year-old former army officer was sworn in as premier on April 2 after his predecessor Hailemariam Desalegn resigned in February amid unrest that threatened the ruling EPRDF coalition’s tight hold on Africa’s second most populous nation.

The protests have since broadened into rallies over political rights. \nSandwiched between volatile Somalia and Sudan, Ethiopia is often accused by rights groups of using security concerns as an excuse to stifle dissent and media freedoms. Its 547-seat parliament does not have a single opposition member, with dissident parties accusing the EPRDF of rigging the last election in 2015. The ruling coalition denies the charges. \nAbiy acknowledged that the EPRDF’s efforts in developing a democratic system had so far been “insufficient”, but that it had carried out a review of “its shortcomings” and is pushing through reforms. \nAmong those who attended the event included opposition leaders Merera Gudina and Bekele Gerba, who were released in January and February respectively having been jailed on charges of incitement during the protests. \n“His speeches have been great. He seems to understand the problems that Ethiopia has been facing for a long time now,” Bekele told Reuters. “But speeches are one thing and implementation is another. We want to see changes on the ground and nothing has happened so far.” \nBekele said opposition parties still faced restrictions on political activities such as opening offices. He said Abiy should also lift the state of emergency imposed in February. \nAbiy’s meeting came a day after he visited Ambo, a town in Oromiya that has been at the heart of protests and clashes with security forces since 2015, where he promised to address grievances. \nFaced with growing unrest, Addis Ababa pledged a series of reforms in 2016 in an attempt to reduce tensions. Since January, authorities say nearly 6,000 prisoners have been freed, most of which were detained for alleged involvement in the mass protests. \nOn Wednesday, Ethiopia’s attorney general’s office said it had pardoned 114 prisoners who had been jailed on terrorism charges. Reports on Friday said several had been released.
