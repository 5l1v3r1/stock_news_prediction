(OTC PINK:SPMI) (the “Company”), a national retail brand offering consumers automobile emissions testing and safety inspections, and owner/operator of Auto Recycling of Montgomery today announced its unaudited financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“With the closing of our 2017 fiscal year, we have now posted two consecutive years of positive EBITDA 1 , which we believe demonstrates the progress made in the overall management and operation of our business,” stated Rich Parlontieri, Speedemissions President and CEO. “While much has been achieved, we’ll continue to work on operational efficiency and expense reduction in 2018,\" added Parlontieri.\nFull Year 2017 Unaudited Financial Highlights\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017 total revenue decreased $163,210 or 4.7% to $3,276,246 from, $3,439,456, as compared to 2016 year-end revenues. This decrease in revenue is directly attributed to the loss of the building lease and subsequent closing of our Salt Lake City store. Our Atlanta and St. Louis stores experienced same store sales increases of 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively.\nGeneral and Administrative expenses were down 7.2%, due to a reduction in legal, accounting, professional fees and salary expenses, while store operating expenses decreased 2.8%\nThe Company’s net profit for the year-end 2017 was $171,130, as compared to a net loss of ($220,729) for the year ended December 31, 2016. This 2017 net profit was attributed to $294,706 in other income resulting from de-recognition of certain aged accounts payable and a $76,332 gain on asset disposal, resulting from closing our Salt Lake City store. These non-recurring gains were partially offset by a $94,291 loss from our auto recycling location, which did not become operational until November 2017. Adjusting the 2017 net profit for these three items yields an adjusted loss of ($105,617) from continuing operations in 2017 or about a $115,000 improvement over 2016.\nABOUT SPEEDEMISSIONS, INC.\nSpeedemissions, Inc., based in Atlanta, Georgia, is a national brand offering our customers quick and efficient emissions testing and safety inspections as required by law.
