But for the BOJ, that’s far less trouble than a yen spike that puts it under pressure to ease further,” she said.\nThe BOJ is widely expected to maintain a pledge to guide short-term interest rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year bond yield around zero percent.\nIn a quarterly review of its projections, the BOJ is likely to keep unchanged the timeframe for hitting its price goal, now set at fiscal 2019, sources have told Reuters.\nThe nine-member board is also seen roughly maintaining its forecast made in January that inflation will hit 1.8 percent in fiscal 2019, and project inflation to stay near 2 percent the following year, they say.\nSuch optimistic estimates would reflect the BOJ’s view that robust global demand will keep the economy on course for a solid recovery, allowing companies to boost spending and raise wages.\nThe BOJ’s huge bond purchases have kept Japanese bond yields stable, even as benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields climbed above 3 percent for the first time in four years.\nThat has caused U.S.-Japan yield differentials to widen in the dollar’s favour, leaving the yen lower in a welcome boost to Japan’s export-reliant economy.\nJapanese policymakers generally favour a weak yen as it gives the country’s exports a competitive advantage overseas. It also pushes up import costs and works to accelerate inflation.\nJapan’s economy expanded an annualised 1.6 percent in the October-December quarter, marking the eighth straight quarter of gains, on robust global demand and capital spending.\nBut core consumer inflation stood at 0.9 percent in March, well below the BOJ’s target, as slow wage growth keeps consumers from increasing their spending.\nReporting by Leika Kihara; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T17:03:47.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
