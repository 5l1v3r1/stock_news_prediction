REUTERS/Simon Dawson Protesters seeking jobs, better housing, roads and hospitals frequently clash with police in a country faced with weak economic growth and near-record unemployment - but these are the first big demonstrations since Ramaphosa took power in February.\nThe unrest, dubbed “service delivery protests”, has mounted over the years.\nThe latest protests erupted on Wednesday with residents demanding that the province’s Premier Supra Mahumapelo, a member of Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress party, step down.\nRamaphosa called for calm, ordered police to exercise maximum restraint and urged the aggrieved parties to express their grievances without resorting to violence.\nHe was due to return to South Africa on Friday from London, where he is leading a delegation to a Commonwealth summit.\n“The president will return to Pretoria today, Thursday,” the president’s office said in a statement.\nSouth African media reported that a bus was set alight, vehicles stoned and roads blockaded by protesters calling for Mahumapelo to quit because of a failure to adequately deliver services. Police fired teargas to disperse the crowds.\nBotswana’s government said on Thursday it had closed exit points to South Africa’s North West province, where the two countries share a border. The troubled province lies 300 km (200 miles) west of South Africa’s commercial hub Johannesburg.\nReporting by James Macharia; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T02:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T03:50:07.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
