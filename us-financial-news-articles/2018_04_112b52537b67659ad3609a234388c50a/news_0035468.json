The government insists it will remain 100 percent state-owned but unions fear this opens the door to privatisation, as happened after similar changes to the corporate structure of France Telecom, now called Orange.\nLAST GASP FOR UNIONS? Macron has stood firm in the face of unions whose strike call - nationwide stoppages two days in every five days up to the end of June - has crippled services each time since it began on April 3.\nBehind the united front on industrial action, unions have different objectives. The CGT and Sud-Rail unions oppose open competition while the CFDT and Unsa unions above all want the government to absorb 46 billion euros ($57 billion)of SNCF debt.\nMacron said on Sunday that the state was ready to take over SNCF debt, mostly generated by investment in TGV high-speed lines. But he remained vague on how much - a stand unions have branded as insufficient.\nWhat Macron and the rest of France will be watching now is the turnout and impact of this week’s strike on Wednesday and Thursday, and in the coming few weeks.\nOpinion polls show a majority of French people are in favour of the reform, although various soundings have also showed voters want the government to take account of union demands.
