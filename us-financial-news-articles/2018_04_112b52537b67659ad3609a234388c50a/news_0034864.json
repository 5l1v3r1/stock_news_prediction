Both the peso and real had posted strong gains against the greenback on Tuesday and Wednesday. Equities also rose across the region on those days as traders bought back into risky asset that they had previously exited. But in Mexico traders continue to be spooked by the strong performance in opinion polls by Mexican leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. A late Wednesday poll by polling firm Mitofsky showed him pulling further ahead of his rivals in the run-up to the July 1 presidential election. In Brazil, markets continued to be unsettled by an extremely uncertain political outlook during an election year, with the tactics of the country's left still up in the air following the imprisonment of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the presidential front-runner who was jailed earlier in April for corruption. \"We see a technical correction after (yesterday's movement),\" said Ricardo Gomes da Silva, director of brokerage Correparti Corretora. The peso fell 0.83 percent against the dollar in morning trade, while the real fell 0.49 percent. All other major currencies in the region were down by lesser percentages. Across the region, equities markets were mixed, with no major gainers or losers. Among the biggest index movers on Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index, which had risen 0.23 percent in morning trade, was food processor BRF SA. Shares in BRF were trading up 8.6 percent on Thursday after Pedro Parente, chief executive of state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said he had accepted an invitation from major shareholders to become the company's new chairman.
