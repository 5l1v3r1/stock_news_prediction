FILE PHOTO - Boxing - Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Conor McGregor - Las Vegas, USA - August 26, 2017 Conor McGregor makes his entrance before the fight REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo \nMcGregor, who became the first Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter to hold two world titles simultaneously when he beat Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt in Manhattan in 2016, turned himself in to police late on Thursday after the violent incident at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. \nPolice charged McGregor, 29, with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief, according to Lee Jones, an NYPD spokesman. \nMcGregor, who gave up plumbing to become one of his sport’s most recognizable and divisive stars, was due to be transferred to the criminal court in Brooklyn later on Friday for an arraignment hearing, Jones said. \nScores of news photographers and multiple broadcast trucks waited for a glimpse of McGregor leaving the police station in a quiet residential Brooklyn neighborhood. \nEfforts to reach McGregor’s representatives were not successful. It was not clear who would represent him in court.

The Nevada Athletic Commission fined McGregor $25,000 after he threw water bottles at an opponent during a pre-fight news conference in 2016, the New York Daily News reported. \nUFC President Dana White said the van attack was “the most disgusting thing that ever happened in the history” of the UFC.
