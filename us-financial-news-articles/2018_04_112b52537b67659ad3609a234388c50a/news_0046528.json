The U.S. equivalent was last week at its highest level since Feb 5.\nConcerns over a potential trade war between the United States and other major economies — particularly China — had boosted demand for major government bonds in recent weeks.\nBut there were some signs over the weekend that relations may improve, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he is considering a trip to China to work on trade issues and has discussed the potential for market openings in China with Beijing’s new central bank chief.\nElsewhere, Italy’s 10-year government bond yield spread over Germany moved to its tightest level since August 2016 at 116 basis points, defying concerns over a growing political impasse as Italian parties struggle to form a governing coalition.\nLater this week, analysts will be keeping an eye on the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday for any signs on how policymakers will unwind extraordinary stimulus.
