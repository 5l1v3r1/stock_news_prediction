Prospective buyers can view the collection in person on May 6 and May 13, as well as indulge in a “Duchess-inspired” brunch. \n“We decided that during the royal wedding it was the perfect time, with all the interest in the duchess,” said collector Philip Baty. Baty, who is retired, said he and his husband plan to downsize and move to a warmer climate. \nBaty began amassing artefacts more than 20 years ago after becoming fascinated by Simpson’s glamorous lifestyle. He did not say how much he thought the auction would bring. \n“All the better jewellers, especially Cartier, designed all kinds of beautiful stuff for her. It was said that her jewellery rivalled Queen Elizabeth’s private collection of jewellery,” Baty said. \nAs the royal wedding day draws near, Baty cannot help but marvel at how times have changed since the 1936 constitutional crisis over Edward’s desire to marry a divorced woman. \n“That was the scandal of the century,” he said. “Now look at Ms. Markle. No one’s hardly said a word. They’re just proud of her and thrilled.” \nWallis Simpson died in Paris at age 89 in 1986, 14 years after the death of Edward, who was ostracized by the royal family after his abdication and marriage.
