He began working for the Trump Organization in 1997, soon rising to the rank of in-house counsel and executive vice president.\nDeals that passed through the company did so via his desk, rather than Cohen’s. (Chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, was similarly involved in the company’s finances, says Bloomberg.)\nGreenblatt was an employee of The Trump Organization for nearly 20 years. In late 2016, Trump named has as a special representative for international negotiations and assistant to the president. He most recently has served as a special envoy to the Middle East peace process.\nLike Trump, he’s a fan of using Twitter to express himself. After Palestinian official Saeb Erekat circulated a letter to foreign diplomats accusing him of being a mouthpiece for Israel , Greenblatt replied via social media, calling it “self-indulgent rhetoric.”\nSaeb Erakat's personal attack on me is a symptom of the difficulties in the path to peace. Saeb knows there’s no truth to his accusation. This outburst, like all his recent outbursts, is merely intended as a distraction from the important work that lies ahead. 1/2\n— Jason D. Greenblatt (@jdgreenblatt45) April 13, 2018\nBut this empty, self-indulgent rhetoric won’t stop us from trying. Saeb: It’s time to time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. Or, you can continue to run in circles, and get pretty much nowhere! Shabbat Shalom/Salam! 2/2\n— Jason D. Greenblatt (@jdgreenblatt45) April 13, 2018\nMueller, to date, has made no public mention of wanting to talk with Greenblatt. That’s not unusual, though, as the special counsel typically does not discuss his plans in advance with the media.\n", "external_links": ["https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-envoy-greenblatt-assailed-by-erekat-in-letter-to-foreign-diplomats-1.5994602", "https://twitter.com/jdgreenblatt45/status/984928041204895745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://twitter.com/jdgreenblatt45/status/984927997890351104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-16/cohen-isn-t-the-biggest-catch-from-trump-world"], "published": "2018-04-16T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T20:47:02.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
