It was unfair, she wrote, to let businesses “take advantage of the significant benefits of the corporate form and enjoy fundamental rights without having to shoulder attendant fundamental responsibilities.”\nThe decision came in several lawsuits filed against Arab Bank PLC by some 6,000 Israeli victims of terrorist attacks between 1995 and 2005 in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The plaintiffs alleged that the bank, based in Amman, Jordan, helped finance attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups, for instance by maintaining accounts to pay families of suicide bombers.\nRelated\nCourt Weighs Price-Fixing Case Against Chinese Vitamin C Makers In Gerrymandering Case, Texas Defends Its Legislative Districts Under earlier precedents, alien-tort plaintiffs must show defendants have an American connection; the Israeli victims argued that Arab Bank qualified because its New York branch used a U.S.-based automated clearinghouse to process currency transactions, including those for terrorists.\nArab Bank denies the allegations. But in a parallel lawsuit filed by U.S. citizens under a 1992 law allowing U.S. victims of terrorism to sue both individuals and corporations, a federal jury found the bank liable in 22 attacks perpetrated by Hamas. An appeals court threw out that verdict earlier this year, citing an error in jury instructions. The case won’t be retried as the parties reached a confidential settlement.\nIn 2005, Arab Bank paid a $24 million civil penalty after U.S. authorities found it lacked adequate safeguards to prevent terrorist financing.\nOn Tuesday, Arab Bank praised the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the Israeli plaintiffs, “which ends this litigation and affirms the bank’s belief that there is no basis to hold corporations liable under international law.”\nThe plaintiffs saw it differently. “The Supreme Court today dealt a significant blow in the fight to hold foreign corporations conducting business in the United States accountable for violations of international law that cause harm to innocent civilians world-wide,” said an attorney for the plaintiffs, Michael Elsner of Motley Rice LLC.\nIn his opinion, Justice Kennedy wrote that the Alien Tort Statute, enacted by the first Congress following ratification of the Constitution in 1789, “was intended to promote harmony in international relations” by assuring foreign nations that the fledgling U.S. would provide a remedy for international-law violations such as piracy or assaulting ambassadors.\nBut the statute found little use and was nearly forgotten by 1980, when a human-rights case gave it new life. After World War II, the Holocaust and other atrocities prompted expansion of international-law protections for individuals. The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York found that 20th-century torturers were modern analogues of pirates and slavers—the “enemy of all mankind” entitled to no shelter from liability.\nThe Second Circuit permitted a Peruvian immigrant to sue a former Peruvian police officer, also living in the U.S., for torturing a relative. After the Supreme Court declined to review that decision, human-rights attorneys began testing the limits of liability under the alien-tort law.\nAs plaintiffs’ lawyers focus shifted from individual perpetrators to deep-pocketed companies, the Supreme Court grew concerned, issuing decisions suggesting the alien-tort law had been too creatively expanded beyond its origins. Justice Kennedy’s opinion Tuesday cemented that view.\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas joined the Kennedy opinion in full, including sections where it speculated regarding the risks of corporate liability under the alien-tort law.\nFor instance, Justice Kennedy wrote, such suits could discourage U.S. corporations “from investing abroad, including in developing economies where the host government might have a history of alleged human-rights violations.”\nCongress, he added, was free to extend corporate liability under the alien-tort approach if it wished.\nJustices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch joined portions of Justice Kennedy’s opinion and voted for the result he reached.\nJustice Sotomayor’s dissent rejected the majority’s focus on the corporate nature of the defendant rather than on the character of the violation at issue. Justice Kennedy wrote that most international tribunals don’t extend liability to corporations. The Nuremberg Tribunal prosecuted German industrialists, he wrote, but not the IG Farben company itself, which made poison gas used at Auschwitz.\nThe dissenters said such examples of corporate immunity were beside the point.\nThe relevant question “is whether there is any reason—under either international law or our domestic law—to distinguish between a corporation and a natural person who is alleged to have violated the law of nations,” Justice Sotomayor wrote, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan.\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nAn appeals court threw out a verdict that found Arab Bank PLC liable in 22 attacks perpetrated by Hamas, citing an error in jury instructions, and the case was settled.
