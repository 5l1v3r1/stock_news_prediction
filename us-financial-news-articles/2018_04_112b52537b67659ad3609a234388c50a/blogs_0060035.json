Under a new accounting method including all service and support contracts, the backlog a gauge of future revenue totaled $19.5 billion in March.\nNet revenue slipped 5 percent from a year earlier due to fewer deliveries of airliners and business jets, partially offset by a 63 percent increase in defense revenue.\nWith less overall revenue to dilute fixed costs, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 26 percent to $89.5 million.\nEmbraer also reported \"other\" operating expenses of $29.7 million, driven in part by expectations of a larger write-down on its portfolio of used commercial jets.\nExecutives said the impairments were related to old ERJ-145 planes and not likely to be repeated in coming quarters, adding that \"other\" operating expenses should return to around $20 million to $25 million per quarter for the year.
