I’m ready to go home. Can we? I’m tired. I want to go home.”\nCleveland center Tristan Thompson, making his first start of the series, delivered a double-double with 15 points and 10 rebounds.

He didn’t return until 8:04 was left in the fourth quarter with the Cavaliers leading 86-78.\n“It felt like a Game 7,” James said. “It was like, your mind is thinking like, ‘OK, besides the two I played in the Finals, you start thinking like, is this it? Could this be it?’ That’s just human nature. And then the other side of my brain was like, ‘Let’s go make something happen. Let’s go, that’s what you here for. You’re here to make plays, you’re the leader.’”\nIndiana used an 18-2 run to take a 61-58 lead in the third quarter.
