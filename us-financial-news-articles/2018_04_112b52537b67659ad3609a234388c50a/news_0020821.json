REUTERS/Charles Platiau \nU.S. President Donald Trump on Monday promised quick, forceful action in response to the attack, appearing to suggest a potential military response. \n“If our alliance with our partners requires it, we will be present,” Prince Mohammed said at a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, wrapping up a three-day visit to Paris. \nEarlier, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir had told reporters that a number of countries were holding consultations on how to respond to a chemical weapons attack in Syria and called for those responsible to be held accountable.
