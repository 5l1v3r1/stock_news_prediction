Press materials of E.ON and RWE are pictured on a desk before a joint news conference of the two German utilities after unveiling plans for an asset swap deal which will break up RWE's Innogy unit in Essen, Germany March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nTheir proposed transaction comes just two years after RWE spun off its renewable, retail and network operations to form Innogy.\nE.ON said its offer for the 23.2 percent in Innogy not owned by RWE was worth 40 euros per share, including dividend payments to Innogy shareholders for 2017 and 2018.\nShareholders will have until July 6 to accept the offer, it said.\nRWE and E.ON in March unveiled comprehensive plans to break up Innogy and divide its assets, turning RWE into Europe’s second-largest wind utility and E.ON into Europe’s largest operator of gas and power networks.\nInnogy’s management and supervisory boards will publish their recommendations on the offer within the next two weeks. They have urged shareholders not to take any action until then.\nInnogy’s shares were 36.29 euros at 0851 GMT.\nThe deal, expected to close late in 2019, will result in as many as 5,000 job cuts as the future E.ON group targets 600 to 800 million euros in synergies.\nE.ON boss Johannes Teyssen has said he was hopeful the job reductions could be done without forced redundancies.
