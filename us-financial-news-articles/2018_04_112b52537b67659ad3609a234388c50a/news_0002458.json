They also said that two factors pointed to Fox coming back with a revised bid to match Comcast. \nFirst, Fox must have received approval from Disney to offer the concession, they said, and second, Sky said its independent directors remained focussed on maximising value for shareholders. \nSeparate news on Tuesday that Sky Italia had settled its long-running fight with Mediaset in the Italian pay-TV market also made Sky more valuable, they added. \nA group of high-profile British lawmakers, including former Labour party leader Ed Miliband, called last month for Murdoch to be blocked from buying Sky, despite the promises Fox had already made to ensure the independence of Sky News. \nThe four said the promises did not go far enough, given Murdoch’s record of influence. \nThe group could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday. \nFox said on Tuesday a group of politicians was seeking to influence the CMA, adding they were making “a number of unsupported and fanciful assertions”.
