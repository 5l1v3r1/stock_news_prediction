But Thompson hit a momentum-killing 3-pointer and the Golden State defense held San Antonio to one field goal over the next 5 1/2 minutes to re-establish control at 73-55.\nThompson (11-for-13) and Durant (9-for-17) combined to hit 20 of their 30 shots for the Warriors, who burned the Spurs’ defense for 54.3 percent shooting.\nSan Antonio allowed the fewest points in the NBA this season (99.8 per game) and had held Golden State to a season-low 75 in the clubs’ most recent meeting March 19 in San Antonio.\nGay had 15 points, while LaMarcus Aldridge and Bryn Forbes added 14 apiece for the Spurs, who fell into the No. 7 seed when they lost their regular-season finale at New Orleans to complete a 47-35 regular season.\nAldridge was harassed into 5-for-12 shooting.\nThompson dropped in five of his six 3-point attempts as Golden State, which struggled offensively down the stretch of the regular season with Stephen Curry nursing a knee injury, shot 10-for-22 (45.5 percent) from beyond the arc.\nMcGee finished with 15 points and Draymond Green recorded a 12-point, 11-rebound double-double for the Warriors, who swept the Spurs 4-0 in the Western finals last May en route to a 16-1 run to their second championship in three years.\nGreen’s 11 rebounds were a game-high. He shared game-high assist honors with Durant with eight.\nThe Spurs shot just 40 percent from the field.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-15T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T19:01:36.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
