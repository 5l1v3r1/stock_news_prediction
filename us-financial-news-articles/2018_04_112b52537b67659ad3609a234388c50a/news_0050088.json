Kurt Suzuki hit a liner to third base that Todd Frazier was able to knock down and prevent a run.\nAfter pinch hitter Charlie Culberson struck out, Inciarte dropped a bunt down the first base line, and Camargo raced home with the game-winning run.\nThe winning pitcher was Jesse Biddle (1-0), who pitched a scoreless inning in his major league debut.\nThe Mets scored three times in the top of the eighth to break open a scoreless game.\nAtlanta reliever Sam Freeman walked Wilmer Flores to open the eighth inning, and Jose Reyes was safe on a bunt single. Michael Conforto reached on a fielder’s choice when Atlanta second baseman Ozzie Albies made an error while trying to turn a double play. The play was originally ruled an out but was overturned after a video review and loaded the bases for Yoenis Cespedes.\nShane Carle took over on the mound and got Cespedes to fly out, but Asdrubal Cabrera followed with a two-run single to right field to give the Mets a 2-0 lead. Jay Bruce drove the third run home with a single to center.\nThe Braves got two runs back in the bottom of the eighth on a Freddie Freeman double that almost left the park. Familia then entered with two outs and struck out Preston Tucker to end the threat.\nFor the first seven innings, the game was a pitching duel between New York’s Jacob deGrom and Atlanta’s Julio Teheran.\nDeGrom allowed no runs on four hits and two walks. He struck out 10, giving him back-to-back double-digit strikeout games.\nTeheran allowed no runs on four hits and one walk. He struck out six. It was the third time in five starts that he has not received a decision.\nIt was Teheran’s second straight strong effort at SunTrust Park, where he had gone 4-10 with a 5.93 ERA in 20 previous starts. In his last two home starts, Teheran has allowed one run in 13 innings with 15 strikeouts.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-22T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:19:10.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
