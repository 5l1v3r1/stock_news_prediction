The injury-riddled Orioles (6-16) have lost eight of their last nine\nRamirez hit a solo homer and a two-run shot and finished with three RBIs. He went 2-for-4 in the win.\nCorey Kluber (3-1) earned the victory for Cleveland, allowing three runs in seven innings. He gave up two solo homers to Manny Machado - who now has eight this season - but mostly kept the struggling Baltimore offense quiet.\nAndrew Cashner (1-3) took the loss after giving up four runs in six innings.\nMachado gave the Orioles a 1-0 lead with his first homer, which came in the first.\nThe Indians took a 2-1 edge in the fourth thanks to the Ramirez solo homer plus an RBI double from Yonder Alonso.\nBaltimore answered with two runs in the bottom of that inning thanks to the second Machado homer and a Chris Davis RBI single.\nHowever, the Indians came right back with two runs in the fifth. Francisco Lindor tied it with a single, and Brantley gave Cleveland the lead for good at 4-3 with his RBI single.\nCleveland then broke the game open against Brad Brach in the ninth when Ramirez hit a two-run homer and Yan Gomes added an RBI double.\nBoth teams were affected by injuries a bit. Mark Trumbo has been out for the entire season (right quadriceps) but is going on a rehab assignment this week to Double-A Bowie and Triple-A Norfolk.\nTrey Mancini’s right knee was feeling better before the game, and manager Buck Showalter still would not commit to a return date just yet. Closer Zach Britton again threw off of a half-mound Sunday and fared well.\nFor Cleveland, Bradley Zimmer was in the original lineup playing in center field and batting ninth. Instead, an ankle sprain forced him out with Rajai Davis going into the same spot.\nAlso, Josh Tomlin (back problems) could be coming back to the rotation vs. the Cubs this week.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T22:20:31.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
