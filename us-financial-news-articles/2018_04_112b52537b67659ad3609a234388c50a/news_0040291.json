REUTERS/Darren Staples \nBritain will commit 61.4 million pounds ($87.21 million) at the summit to develop new ways of tackling plastic waste and help Commonwealth countries limit how much plastic ends up in the ocean. \n“We are rallying Commonwealth countries to join us in the fight against marine plastic,” May said. \n“Together we can effect real change so that future generations can enjoy a natural environment that is healthier than we currently find it.” \nThe statement said environment minister Michael Gove would launch a consultation later this year into the plan to ban the plastic items. It gave no details who the consultation would be with.
