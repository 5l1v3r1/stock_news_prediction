In an emailed statement he said one of the items on the agenda at the cabinet retreat is to “work hard with goal of making air quality in our cities even better”.\nThere has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VW) admitted in September 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has spread across the industry and boosted investment in electric vehicles.\nDer Spiegel said the “comprehensive” exhaust refit plan would affect a large part of the 15 million diesel cars in Germany, of which only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 emissions technology.\nThe magazine said cars in big cities such as Munich and Stuttgart where air quality is particularly poor should be fitted with so-called selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that require AdBlue injection technology.\nReporting by Gernot Heller; Additional reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Andreas Cremer and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T19:28:27.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
