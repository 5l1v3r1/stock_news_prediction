The body had 86 injury marks, including some inflicted to her genitalia with hard, blunt objects, while more minor injuries suggest she had been beaten with a stick or slapped. \nDoctors estimate that the unidentified girl was about 12, police said. \nAs the groundswell of revulsion grew, Modi assured the country on Friday that the guilty would not be shielded, but he has been criticised for failing to speak out sooner. \nBefore leaving for an official visit to Europe this week, Modi received a letter from 50 former police chiefs, ambassadors and senior civil servants upbraiding the political leadership over its weak response. \n“The bestiality and the barbarity involved in the rape and murder of an eight-year-old child shows the depths of depravity that we have sunk into,” the former officials said. \n“In post-Independence India, this is our darkest hour and we find the response of our government, the leaders of our political parties inadequate and feeble.” Deepak Khajuria arrives for a court appearance after he was arrested in connection with the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua, south of Jammu, April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nThe letter went further by blaming the BJP and like-minded right-wing Hindu groups for promoting a culture of “majoritarian belligerence and aggression” in Jammu, and in the Uttar Pradesh case it blasted the party for using feudal strongmen, who behave like gangsters, to shore up its rule. \nThe former officials said they held no political affiliation other than to uphold the values of India’s secular constitution that guarantees equal rights to all citizens. Some of the signatories have spoken out in the past also against Modi’s Hindu nationalist party accusing it of whipping up hostility towards India’s 172 million Muslims. THREATS AGAINST LAWYER \nIn 2012, voters ousted the Congress chief minister of Delhi because of the fallout from the rape case. This time, Congress was quick to realise the mood of the country, with party leader Rahul Gandhi leading the first major protest in the capital last week. \nOn Monday, Gandhi tweeted that there had been nearly 20,000 child rapes in India in 2016, and urged Modi to fast-track prosecutions “if he is serious about providing ‘justice for our daughters’”. \nThough the rape and killing of the girl in Kashmir had been known about for months, the backlash erupted after the charge sheet giving gruesome details of the crime was filed last week. \nIt alleged that the attack was part of a plan to drive the nomads out of Kathua district in Jammu, the mostly Hindu portion of India’s only Muslim-majority state. \nThe alleged ringleader of the campaign, retired bureaucrat Sanji Ram, looked after a small temple where the girl had been held and assaulted. Two of the eight on trial are police officers who stand accused of being bribed to stifle the investigation. \nAfter Monday’s initial hearing in Srinagar, the judge adjourned the case until April 28 while the Supreme Court heard a petition from the lawyer representing the victim’s family to have the trial held elsewhere due to fears for her safety. \nAhead of the trial, the lawyer said she had been threatened with rape and death for taking up the case. \n“I was threatened yesterday that ‘we will not forgive you’. I am going to tell Supreme Court that I am in danger,” said the lawyer, Deepika Singh Rawat, who has fought for a proper investigation since the girl’s body was found in January. \nThe Supreme Court is considering transferring the trial to Chandigarh in Punjab state, and has ordered security for both the lawyer and the victim’s family after her father said he too feared for their safety.
