Advantest Corp soared 2.6 percent, silicon maker Sumco Corp surged 3.6 percent and semiconductor equipment maker Screen Holdings advanced 2.8 percent.\nElsewhere, online brokerage Monex Group jumped 18 percent to a daily-limit high of 670 yen.\nThe parent company of cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc, said Coincheck expects an operating profit of 53.7 billion yen ($491 million) for the fiscal year ended March 2018, compared with 719 million yen in the previous year.\nThe broader Topix added 0.3 percent to 1,772.13.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T09:58:20.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
