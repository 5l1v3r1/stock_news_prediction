Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Manchester City - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 14, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola celebrates after the match REUTERS/David Klein \nThe combined revenues of Premier League clubs increased by nearly 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) to a record 4.5 billion pounds in the 2016/17 season. \nThe collective pre-tax profit of 0.5 billion pounds was almost three times the previous record of 0.2 billion in 2013/14, reported Deloitte. \nDeloitte found that wage costs across the league rose by nine percent to 2.5 billion pounds, a new record, but noted that growth was significantly slower than the 25 percent increase in overall revenue.
