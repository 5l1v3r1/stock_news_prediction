We are working hard to find additional accretive acquisitions to continue to scale our platform. As we look ahead to 2018, Reven will be increasingly focused on optimizing its capital structure to provide additional capacity to grow.” Mr. Carpenter continued, “As the single family home REITs enter their fifth year in the public markets, the sector has matured as an institutional asset class. This large sector remains highly fragmented, which should provide Reven with additional opportunities to grow shareholder value.”\n2017 Financial Results\nFor the year-ended December 31, 2017, total rental income increased 38.4% to $7.82 million, primarily due to the acquisition of 175 rental homes during the year.
