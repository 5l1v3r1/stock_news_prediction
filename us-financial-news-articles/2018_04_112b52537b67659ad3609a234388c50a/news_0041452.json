They have since partially recovered. \n“Facebook has done a credit to the entire industry because they brought this back out into the public spotlight,” Howe said. \nHe said he had traveled to Washington to meet regulators and would continue to do so, and that industry executives were speaking more frequently among themselves about regulations. \n“This isn’t an area that perhaps most companies or most legislators have thought a tremendous amount about,” Howe said. \nData brokers faced the prospect of tougher U.S. oversight in 2014, after the FTC in a report called for legislation that would enable consumers to more easily learn how data brokers use their data, correct it or opt out of the process. \nNo such legislation passed. \nOn Thursday, Howe published a list of principles on a corporate blog that he thinks any new legislation should follow. He did not endorse a specific bill. \nAsked about the FTC, he said in the interview: “I think the FTC has an important role to play here, and how that evolves, I’m not sure.” Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Tom Brown", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T04:09:24.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
