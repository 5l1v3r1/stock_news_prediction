On the legal side, while we informed the Libyan authorities ahead of closing, our analysis is that there was no need to obtain pre-authorisation,” a Total spokesman told Reuters.\nThe French oil and gas giant is currently in talks with Libya’s National Oil Corp (NOC) “in order to offer them the necessary reassurances on our intention to develop Waha,” he added.\nOn Monday, NOC said it was “discussing arrangements” over Marathon’s “planned sale of its shareholding in the Waha oil company concession” and that Marathon had not received NOC approval for the sale.
