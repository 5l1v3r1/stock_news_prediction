The Swedish Academy's Permanent Secretary Sara Danius and academy member Sara Stridsberg leave the Swedish Academy after a meeting, in Stockholm, Sweden April 12, 2018. Danius said to journalists that she would leave her position and the Swedish Academy immediately.

TT News Agency/Jonas Ekstromer/ via REUTERS \nThe allegations of sexual assault and harassment were made against Jean-Claude Arnault, the husband of Academy member Katarina Frostenson. \nIn an emailed comment to Reuters on Thursday, Arnault’s lawyer, Bjorn Hurtig, said his client rejected all allegations against him. \n“Jean-Claude Arnault rejects all claims of criminal activity and he rejects other allegations that have been made against him,” Hurtig said. \nState prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation into the incidents, but said last month some parts of the probe had been shelved due to a lack of evidence and the statute of limitations having passed for some of the incidents. \nHowever, prosecutors said the investigation related to some incidents was continuing. \nThe Swedish Academy severed ties with Arnault, whom it had helped financially in running a cultural club in Stockholm, in November following the allegations made against him.
