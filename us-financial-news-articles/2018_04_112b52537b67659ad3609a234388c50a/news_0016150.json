REUTERS/Paul Childs The ceremony at Carrara Stadium garnered mostly positive reviews in local media but many reports focused on the British royal family member’s wavering attention.\nPictures of Camilla thumbing through a program in the VIP box between her husband Prince Charles and Australia’s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were widely circulated on social media, prompting some users to criticize the 70-year-old for failing to show more appreciation.\nCommonwealth Games Federation President Louise Martin said the Duchess was exhausted, rather than bored.\n“She was jet-lagged, she’d just got off the plane in the morning,” Martin said at a media briefing on Thursday.\n“She did full duty right through and the only time she got a break was when she sat in the car from Brisbane down to here.\n“Then she got 20 minutes to change before she went to another reception. When you’re back to back like that, coming off a long-haul flight... and she literally hates flying. She really wanted to go to sleep.”\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T11:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T07:48:45.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
