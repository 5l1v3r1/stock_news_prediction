The team announced prior to puck drop that Ryan Suter needs surgery for a right ankle fracture sustained Saturday night at Dallas, and the defenseman will miss the remainder of the season.\nThat bad news with the Stanley Cup playoffs a week away was put on the back burner during a strong performance by the Wild at Xcel Energy Center.\nDubnyk, who was drafted by the Oilers in the first round in 2004 and spent five seasons in Edmonton, made his 400th career start a perfect night with his 29th career shutout. He has a 9-2-0 record with two shutouts against his former team.\nThe red-hot Parise provided the bulk of the offense for a Wild team that has a solid hold on third place in the Central Division.\nParise opened the scoring with an excellent individual effort 3:33 into the clash. He stole the puck from Edmonton defenseman Adam Larsson at the Minnesota blue line to earn a breakaway, and he ripped a five-hole shot from the slot to beat Oilers goalie Cam Talbot.\nParise was at it again at the 8:24 mark of the middle frame. Mikko Koivu made a nifty pass to send defenseman Jonas Brodin on an odd-man rush from inside the blue line. Brodin’s shot was denied by Talbot, but Parise picked up the rebound for his 12th goal in 17 games and 15th overall during an injury-shortened season. Parise has played just 40 games so far.\nParise is also riding an eight-game point streak in which he has amassed eight goals and 10 points.\nJoel Eriksson Ek iced the game with an empty-netter with 44 seconds remaining.\nTalbot stopped 37 shots for the Oilers, who were blanked for the ninth time this season and have lost five straight.\nThe Oilers, long eliminated from playoff contention, lost a pair of defensemen, Yohann Auvitu and Andrej Sekera, due to injury during the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T11:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:18:42.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
