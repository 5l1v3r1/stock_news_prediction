Last year, a U.S. intelligence contractor pleaded not guilty to an espionage count after being accused of leaking a classified report on Russian interference in the U.S. elections to the news outlet.\nThe Justice Department did not identify the news organisation that received the information Albury leaked. It said he worked at the time as a liaison with Customs and Border Protection at the Minneapolis airport and had a top-secret clearance that gave him access to some secret material.\nThe Justice Department said that between 2016 and continuing through August 2017, Albury disclosed national defence information classified as secret to a reporter.\nReporting by David Alexander and Mark Hosenball; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T04:16:30.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
