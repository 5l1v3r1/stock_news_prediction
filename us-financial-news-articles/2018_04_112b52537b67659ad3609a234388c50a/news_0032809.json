On Tuesday, it did not give details of size or valuation but said the domestic IPO is expected by the end of 2018 and that John Mulcahy would be appointed as chairman of the listed business. \nAustralia’s financial sector is under pressure after the Royal Commission’s ongoing probe shed light on numerous cases of misconduct. The commission’s final recommendations after year-long hearings could lead to criminal or civil prosecutions as well as greater regulation on the sector. \nAnd the Australian competition regulator said it plans to review the powers of the country’s four largest banks, amid concerns that lending caps have cut competition and high barriers to entry have stifled rivals. \nCommonwealth Bank would become the second large lender to offload its funds unit in recent times. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group sold its wealth management unit to IOOF Holdings for A$975 million in October, joining the rush of Australian banks quitting non-core and scandal-hit divisions to boost capital. \nShares of Commonwealth Bank have shed 9.4 percent in the year to date, compared with a 3.7 percent fall for the Australian benchmark index.
