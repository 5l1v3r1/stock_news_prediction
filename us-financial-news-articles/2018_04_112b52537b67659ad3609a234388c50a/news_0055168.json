As well as significantly strengthening our sales team and giving it a strategic focus on vertebral fractures, we achieved a clear improvement in our financial performance, including our best-ever year-on-year growth rate of 37% 1 ”, commented Pierre Dumouchel, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Safe Orthopaedics. “2018 has got off to a healthy start, with surgical kit sales breaking above the 10,000 mark and revenues advancing by 22% in the first quarter. Given our consistent performances in France and the recent contribution to our international growth from Germany–two countries with a direct sales force—we are actively working to acquire a direct sales force in the United Kingdom and to develop new drivers of technological growth.”\nReduction in costs and improved operating performance in 2017\nin thousands of euros - IFRS FY 2017 FY 2016 Revenues – France 1,582 1,182 Revenues – Rest of the World 1,528 1,083 Total adjusted 1 revenues\n3,110 2,265 Revenues from discontinued activities (United States) 0 100 Total revenues 3,110 2,365 Purchases used and change in inventories (1,729) (1,579) External costs (2,735) (2,820) Personnel costs (3,362) (3,633) Other operating expenses (685) (456) Operating income/(loss) before non-recurring items (5,401) (6,104) Other operating income/(expense) (33) (183) Operating income/(loss) (5,434) (6,287) Financial income/(loss) (1,141) 282 Net income/(loss) (6,575) (6,005) In 2017, revenues totaled €3,110 thousand, representing growth of 37% on an adjusted 1 basis.\nIn France, revenues rose 34% to €1,582 thousand. Through sales and marketing initiatives targeting vertebral fractures, Safe Orthopaedics doubled its market share in this segment to 8% 2 . In the fourth quarter, the sales team was expanded, bringing the total number of sales representatives to seven at December 31, 2017, up from four at year-end 2016.\nGrowth in the Rest of the World reached 41%, with revenues totaling €1,528 thousand in FY 2017. Brisk growth generated by longstanding distributors and rapid expansion in Latin America provided the driving force for this increase. A second export manager was hired in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSafe Orthopaedics successfully increased its contribution margin from 57.5% to 59.7% by achieving a richer product and country mix. It also reduced its external charges and personnel costs by 6%.\nIt thus reduced its operating loss by more than €703 thousand over the period (€5.4 million vs. €6.1 million in FY 2016).\nAfter €1.1 million in net financial expense, primarily reflecting currency effects (translation differences on the US subsidiary’s current account and trade receivables), and zero income tax expense for the period, Safe Orthopaedics’ net loss came to €6.6 million, compared with €6.0 million one year earlier.\nFirst-quarter 2018 revenues up 22% to €931 thousand\nin thousands of euros Q1 2018 (3 months)\nQ1 2017 (3 months)\nChange France 485 420 +15% Rest of the World 446 343 +30% Total revenues 931 763 +22%", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.SafeOrtho.com&esheet=51796448&newsitemid=20180426006583&lan=en-US&anchor=www.SafeOrtho.com&index=1&md5=1e94539702bce6a69762df7ab31788fe"], "published": "2018-04-27T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T12:22:04.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
