The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied.\nBrent crude oil futures were off 9 cents at $73.97 per barrel, while U.S. crude eased 19 cents to $68.21.\nIn stock markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent, with South Korea off 0.3 percent.\nJapan’s Nikkei also eased 0.3 percent as tech stocks continued to struggle with a warning on waning demand for mobile phones.\nE-Mini futures for the S&P 500 went the other way, edging up 0.1 percent.\nRising bond yields had pressured Wall Street on Friday, though the S&P 500 still managed to end the week with a slight gain.\nMore than 180 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report results this week including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Boeing and Chevron.\nTHE 3 PCT BARRIER The spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields.\nYields on 10-year Treasuries finished last week at the highest since early 2014 and at 2.966 percent were again challenging the hugely important 3 percent barrier.\nThe last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding.\n“Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin.\nTraditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added.\n“If oil helps push the 10 year yield into new terrain for this cycle, this will play at least mildly USD positive in a change of correlation.”\nIndeed, dealers cited widening yield differentials for the dollar’s broad rally on Friday.\nThe currency was last at 107.77 yen and testing major resistance in the 107.90/108.00 zone which has held solid since mid-February.\nThe dollar index edged up to 90.369, and further away from last week’s low at 89.229.\nThe euro was easier at $1.2276, having repeatedly failed to break above $1.2400 in the last couple of weeks.\nInvestors are awaiting the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday amid talk policy makers feel it is still too early to announce a timetable for winding down its bond buying.\nECB chief Mario Draghi on Friday said he was confident that the inflation outlook has picked up, but uncertainties “warrant patience, persistence and prudence.”\nEditing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T10:58:01.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
