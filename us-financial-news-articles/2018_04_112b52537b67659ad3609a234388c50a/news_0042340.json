But that has fueled inflation, making consumer price rises harder to contain than initially expected.\nBoth opposition lawmakers and allies argued this week that small businesses and residential users would be unable to keep up with spiraling utility prices.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Protesters holding candles — a show of solidarity with those who may no longer be able to afford to light their homes with electricity — approached the country’s Congress in Buenos Aires after dark, calling for price increases to be over-turned.\n“Enough with the rate hikes!” read a banner carried by a protestor.\nShares in Argentine utilities tumbled earlier today as political opposition to cuts in subsidies for gas and electricity consumption mounted, but the stocks pared losses after a lawmaker clarified future pricing policies.\nReporting by Nicolas Misculin; Writing by Dave Sherwood; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T03:42:01.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
