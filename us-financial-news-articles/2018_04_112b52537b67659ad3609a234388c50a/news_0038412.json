If they remain on banks’ balance sheets, they may need to be restructured with extra provisioning,” Fitch warned. \nBut Fitch also said exposed banks did appear to have collateral or sufficient pre-impairment profitability to cover potential losses. \nThe agency said Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Alfa, Tinkoff, Citi ( C.N ), Rosbank, UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) and Raiffeisen have non-material or no exposure to new SDNs, relative to their equity.
