Traders and analysts said new supply from these mines could put further downward pressure on prices.\nChina’s largest coal producer China Shenhua Energy lowered its sales and production forecasts recently.\nShenhua aims to produce 290 million tonnes of coal in 2018, down 1.8 percent from a year ago, Shenhua said in its annual earnings report on March 23, while sales are likely to decline 3 percent from 2017 to 430 million tonnes.
