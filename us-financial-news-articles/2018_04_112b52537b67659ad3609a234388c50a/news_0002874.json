Jeurys Familia recorded his first save with a pair of strikeouts in 1 1/3 hitless innings. It was the first time Familia recorded more than three outs in a save since he got the final four outs on June 24, 2016.\nFamilia entered in the eighth because right hander Anthony Swarzak exited with a sore left oblique.\nJose Martinez had an RBI single in the fourth while Matt Carpenter lofted a solo homer in the eighth for the Cardinals, who are 0-2 for the first time since 2016. Martinez and Yadier Molina each had two hits. Martinez is 5-for-7 on the young season.\nWacha took the loss after allowing four runs on five hits and two walks while striking out two over 4 2/3 innings.\nLeft hander Ryan Sherriff, the third of five Cardinals pitchers, made his season debut by allowing one run over one-third of an inning. Sherriff was recalled from Triple-A Memphis prior to the game to replace Brett Cecil, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained left shoulder.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:30:14.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
