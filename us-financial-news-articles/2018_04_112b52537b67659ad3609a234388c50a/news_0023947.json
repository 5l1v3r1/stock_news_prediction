(TSX: SMT) (BVL: SMT) (NYSE AMERICAN: SMTS) (\"Sierra Metals\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to report first quarter 2018 production results featuring the highest level of consolidated quarterly throughput to date.\nResults are from Sierra Metals' three underground mines in Latin America: The Yauricocha polymetallic mine in Peru, and the Bolivar copper and Cusi silver Mines in Mexico.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Production Highlights\nSilver production of 0.6 million ounces; a 15% decrease from Q1 2017 Copper production of 8.1 million pounds; an 11% increase from Q1 2017 Zinc production of 18.2 million pounds was flat when compared to Q1 2017 Total of 557,710 tonnes processed; a 5% increase from Q1 2017 Record quarterly throughput at both the Yauricocha Mine and Bolivar Mine\nThe Company achieved record quarterly throughput from both the Yauricocha and Bolivar Mines, continuing the successful production increases realized during 2017. Consolidated production of Copper increased 11% to 8.1 million pounds, silver declined 15% to 0.6 million ounces, lead decreased 31% to 6.3 million pounds, zinc was flat at 18.2 million pounds and gold increased 10% to 1,952 ounces compared to Q1 2017.\nThe Yauricocha mine achieved record quarterly throughput during Q1 2018. Metal production in Q1 slipped due to a difference in grades and recoveries. Record throughput at Bolivar, along with higher silver head grades, and silver and gold recoveries, resulted in an increase in equivalent metal production compared to Q1 2017. At Cusi, the difference in equivalent metal production was the result of the Company's continued focus on completing access, development, and production from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone which contains wider structures and higher silver grades. The Company expects to realize the benefits of these efforts at Cusi during the rest of 2018.\nIgor Gonzales, President and CEO of Sierra Metals, commented: \"The Company has started 2018 with solid production results coming from all three mines in the first quarter. Thanks in part to record production at both the Yauricocha and Bolivar mines where we are reaping the benefits of our operational improvement programs. The Company has initiated preliminary scoping / PEA studies to analyze future operational production increases at all three mines and continues development at our Mines with an objective of progressing the recent resource increases at the Cusi Mine, as well as the reserve and resource increases at the Yauricocha Mine into the mine plans. Similar plans will also be put in place with the results from the upcoming Bolivar reserve and resource update.\nYauricocha continues to perform with record tonnage throughput. During Q2 2018 the final infrastructure for the Yauricocha tunnel should be completed allowing for more capacity to handle larger volumes of waste and ore. The Yauricocha shaft will also be sunk to the 1270 level this year providing access to further reserves and resources at the Mine. The Mine will see consistent levels of throughput in 2018 due to a refurbishment of the lower part of the Mascota Shaft which could potentially cause a slowdown in production rates during that time period, which was already factored into our 2018 production guidance.\nAt Bolivar, the company continues to define higher grade ore sources at the Bolivar West and Northwest zones through successful exploration programs. These new zones are expected to come into the mine plan in later 2019. In the near-term, the Company continues to focus on the El Gallo zone while optimizing equipment usage and improving productivity. We are confident production levels will reach 3,500 tonnes per day in the second half of the year.\nAt Cusi, tonnages continue to improve with the Mine realizing a 65% increase in throughput when compared to Q4-2017. We continue to campaign development ore from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone with increasing throughput rates, while continuing to mine selected structures in the older part of the mine. The Company expects to reach the existing mill's capacity of 650 tonnes per day in Q2-2018, the addition of another ball mill will see the capacity increase to approximately 1,200 tonnes per day in early 2019.\nMr. Gonzales concluded, \"Management continues to be very optimistic for the year ahead as the groundwork for continued improvements, through the modernizing and implementation of best operational practices has been set. Our ongoing aggressive brownfield exploration programs at all mines should also lead to further significant growth in reserves and resources and add to the value of our assets during the year ahead.\"\nConsolidated Production Results\nConsolidated Production\n3 Months Ended\n2018 Guidance\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Var.\nLow\nHigh\nTonnes processed (mt)\n557,710\n529,695\n5%\nDaily throughput\n6,374\n6,054\n5%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n594\n698\n-15%\n2,474\n2,886\nCopper pounds (000's)\n8,090\n7,290\n11%\n32,700\n38,100\nLead pounds (000's)\n6,312\n9,143\n-31%\n19,100\n22,300\nZinc pounds (000's)\n18,214\n18,137\n0%\n62,900\n73,400\nGold ounces\n1,952\n1,777\n10%\n6,700\n7,800\nSilver equivalent ounces (000's) (1)\n4,394\n3,746\n17%\n13,900\n16,210\nCopper equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n23,445\n25,126\n-7%\n89,184\n104,005\nZinc equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n47,209\n52,231\n-10%\n183,830\n214,468\n(1) Silver equivalent ounces, Copper equivalent pounds, and Zinc equivalent pounds for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au.

Despite the record quarterly throughput realized at Yauricocha during Q1 2018, lower silver, lead, and zinc head grades, and lower recoveries of all metals, except copper, resulted in the slight decline in equivalent metal production compared to Q1 2017.\nThe Company continues to see positive improvements from the restructuring at Yauricocha with increased throughput; however, slightly lower head grades were noted with increased contribution from the Esperanza zone into the production schedule in Q1 2018, as evidenced by the 9% decrease in zinc equivalent production over Q1 2017. During Q1 2018, the Company saw a significant 34% increase in the production of copper, a 2% increase in the production of zinc, and a 7% increase in the production of gold, offset by decreases in production of silver (27%), and lead (28%) compared to Q1 2017.\nThe Company remains focused on capitalizing on the successful drilling campaigns executed during 2017 which resulted in significant increases to the reserves and resources at Yauricocha. Continued production growth is expected to be realized from the strategic allocation of operating cash flows towards growth efficient capital, in order to provide the infrastructure, and scoping studies necessary to monetize the reserve and resource increases as quickly as possible.\nA summary of production from the Yauricocha Mine for Q1 2018 is provided below:\nYauricocha Production\n3 Months Ended\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Var.\nTonnes processed (mt)\n271,389\n251,180\n8%\nDaily throughput\n3,102\n2,871\n8%\nSilver grade (g/t)\n59.52\n81.37\n-27%\nCopper grade\n0.89%\n0.81%\n9%\nLead grade\n1.24%\n1.76%\n-29%\nZinc grade\n3.45%\n3.60%\n-4%\nGold Grade (g/t)\n0.61\n0.56\n9%\nSilver recovery\n70.50%\n75.95%\n-7%\nCopper recovery\n70.22%\n62.00%\n13%\nLead recovery\n81.51%\n85.96%\n-5%\nZinc recovery\n87.94%\n89.12%\n-1%\nGold Recovery\n15.77%\n17.25%\n-9%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n366\n499\n-27%\nCopper pounds (000's)\n3,727\n2,783\n34%\nLead pounds (000's)\n6,069\n8,382\n-28%\nZinc pounds (000's)\n18,144\n17,774\n2%\nGold ounces\n835\n779\n7%\nZinc equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n34,767\n38,137\n-9%\n(1) Zinc equivalent pounds for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au.

The higher throughput, silver head grades, and silver and gold recoveries resulted in a 1% decrease in copper equivalent production in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017. In Q1 2018, copper production decreased by 3% to 4,363,000 pounds, silver production increased 28% to 120,000 ounces, and gold production increased 25% to 1,048 ounces compared to Q1 2017. The Company has been successful at increasing tonnage at Bolivar through the commissioning of 13 new pieces of equipment. The new equipment along with the best use of existing mine infrastructure and equipment will help to maximize ore delivery to the processing plant.\nThe Company continues to define higher grade ore sources at Bolivar West and Bolivar Northwest which are expected to come into the mine plan by the second half of 2019. However, as a short-term planning strategy, the Bolivar Mine continues to focus on developing and mining the El Gallo Inferior zone to centralize operations, optimize equipment usage and to improve productivity. The Company remains confident that throughput can be increased to 3,500 tonnes per day during Q3 or Q4 2018.\nA summary of production for the Bolivar Mine for Q1 2018 is provided below:\nBolivar Production\n3 Months Ended\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Var.\nTonnes processed (mt)\n259,375\n243,974\n6%\nDaily throughput\n2,964\n2,788\n6%\nCopper grade\n0.95%\n1.03%\n-8%\nSilver grade (g/t)\n17.85\n15.25\n17%\nGold grade (g/t)\n0.18\n0.20\n-13%\nCopper recovery\n80.65%\n81.49%\n-1%\nSilver recovery\n80.91%\n78.95%\n2%\nGold recovery\n70.94%\n52.49%\n35%\nCopper pounds (000's)\n4,363\n4,508\n-3%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n120\n94\n28%\nGold ounces\n1,048\n840\n25%\nCopper equivalent pounds (000's) (1)\n5,450\n5,533\n-1%\n(1) Copper equivalent pounds for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au.

Metal production decreased for gold (57%), lead (68%) and zinc (81%).\nThe Company is currently mining selected higher-grade structures at the old mine, in addition to campaigning development ore from the Santa Rosa de Lima structure containing improved head grades to the mill at Cusi. The Company expects to gradually increase tonnage from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone as well as other zones in the areas previously developed with a different mandate to produce from disseminated mineralized zones until the mill is operating at its capacity of 650 tonnes per day. It is expected that the main supply of ore in-terms of tonnage and grade will come from Santa Rosa de Lima, in conjunction with other zones such as Promontorio, and Azucarera, starting in Q2 2018. Additionally, structural development at the Santa Rosa de Lima zone will be completed using long hole mining versus the existing cut and fill methodology which should result in lower costs going forward.\nA summary of production for the Cusi Mine for Q1 2018 is provided below:\nCusi Production\n3 Months Ended\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\n% Var.\nTonnes processed (mt)\n26,945\n34,541\n-22%\nDaily throughput\n308\n395\n-22%\nSilver grade (g/t)\n143.47\n146.13\n-2%\nGold grade (g/t)\n0.18\n0.25\n-29%\nLead grade\n0.48%\n1.25%\n-61%\nZinc grade\n0.51%\n1.26%\n-60%\nSilver recovery\n86.69%\n64.18%\n35%\nGold recovery\n45.26%\n57.87%\n-22%\nLead recovery\n84.21%\n80.22%\n5%\nZinc recovery\n23.44%\n37.91%\n-38%\nSilver ounces (000's)\n108\n104\n3%\nGold ounces\n69\n159\n-57%\nLead pounds (000's)\n243\n761\n-68%\nZinc pounds (000's)\n71\n363\n-81%\nSilver equivalent ounces (000's) (1)\n136\n186\n-27%\n(1) Silver equivalent ounces for Q1 2018 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.75/oz Ag, $3.14/lb Cu, $1.15/lb Pb, $1.56/lb Zn, $1,334/oz Au.
