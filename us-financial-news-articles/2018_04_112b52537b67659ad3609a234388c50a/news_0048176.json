Prosecutors say he is the lone survivor of a suicide squad.\nNeither he nor Ayari, who is in custody in Belgium, was present for the judgment.\nDespite the absence of both accused, security was tight around the Brussels court, with heavily armed police on guard.\nBy the time of the shootout in the Brussels district of Forest on March 15, 2016, Abdeslam had been in hiding for four months after fleeing Paris the night his elder brother blew himself up at a cafe.\nProsecutors who accuse Abdeslam of helping organise the attacks and ferry former fighters from Syria around Europe say he, too, would have died if his suicide vest had not failed to detonate. His lawyers do not dispute Abdeslam was in Paris during the attacks.\nSven Mary and Romain Delcoigne, Belgian lawyers representing Salah Abdeslam, look on in the courtroom prior to the announcement of the sentence in the trial of Abdeslam and co-defendant Sofien Ayari, in Brussels, Belgium April 23, 2018. Frederic Sierakowski/Pool via REUTERS They finally stumbled across him when, with French officers, they went to inspect a suspect apartment in Forest and then came under a hail of gunfire which wounded four of them.\nAfter a three-hour siege ended with marksmen killing a 35-year-old Algerian called Mohamed Belkaid, police found an arms cache.\nAbdeslam’s DNA found at the scene linked him to the shootout and that led to his arrest three days later in a different apartment in Brussels.\nFour days after his arrest, suicide bombers attacked Brussels Airport and the city’s metro, killing 32 people. Officials believe Abdeslam had links with the bombers and that they brought forward their attack because they feared Abdeslam might reveal their plans under interrogation.\nAbdeslam was present on the opening day of the trial, but refused to answer the judge’s questions.\nSlideshow (2 Images) His lawyer Sven Mary told reporters on Monday that he discuss the case with his client before determining whether to appeal.\nReporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T12:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:52:15.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
