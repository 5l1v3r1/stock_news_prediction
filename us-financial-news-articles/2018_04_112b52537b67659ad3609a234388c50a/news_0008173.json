Rates have to improve to secure this business. It’s not only the oil companies that should earn money, we need a better balance,” Solberg said.\nWhile revenue in the offshore services business is expected to further decline in 2018, turnover in Norway’s combined maritime fleet is expected to increase by some three percent to 219 billion Norwegian crowns ($28 billion) after falling in each of the last three years.\nReporting by Ole Petter Skonnord, editing by Terje Solsvik\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:42:34.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
