REUTERS/Stringer/File Photo \nThe case highlights the Indian heartland’s fascination with spiritual gurus, who wield immense influence for their ability to mobilise millions of adherents, amass untaxed funds and find favour with politicians. \nA judge delivered the verdict in a jail in the city of Jodhpur, where Asumal Harpalani, commonly known as Asaram Bapu, has been held since September 2013, for fear of violence by his followers. \nThe 77-year-old had been denied bail a dozen times. \n“The conviction is under the section of rape and POCSO, which is sexual harassment of a young girl,” said state police chief O.P. Galhotra. \nIndia’s Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act permits lifetime jail terms for sexual assault of children, and was recently amended to allow the death penalty for the rape of girls younger than 12. \nThe crime carries a minimum sentence of ten years in jail, with sentencing set for later on Wednesday, although prosecutors are seeking a life term. Two of the preacher’s aides were also convicted, and two more acquitted. \n“I am waiting for the sentencing and I hope he gets the maximum sentence of life imprisonment,” said Kiran Jha Thakur, the founder of Kalpana, a non-government body that helped the victim’s family pursue the case.
