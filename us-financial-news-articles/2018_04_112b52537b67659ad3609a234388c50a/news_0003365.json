Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports World number 95 Lindberg completed a big upset when she rammed home a 25-foot birdie putt to beat South Korean Park In-bee at the eighth extra hole at Mission Hills.\nLindberg’s winning putt slammed against the back of the cup at speed and fell in at the par-four 10th.\nSeven-times major champion Park then missed a 15-foot birdie chance that would have extended the playoff.\nLindberg is the third Swede to win the Mission Hills major, after Annika Sorenstam (three times) and Helen Alfredsson.\nHer unlikely victory came after the 31-year-old slept on the lead four nights in a row.\n“I just know I’m a grinder and towards the end yesterday I just felt this is mine. I’m kind of due this,” Lindberg, 31, told Golf Channel.\n“I just looked at every day as just the same thing again, and even today, I felt like I went out and did my same routine. I just felt so calm and I felt this could be mine.”\nApr 1, 2018; Rancho Mirage, CA, USA; Pernilla Lindberg watches her shot on the 18th hole on a playoff during the final round of the ANA Inspiration women's golf tournament at Mission Hills CC - Dinah Shore Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports Even so, she was as surprised as anyone when her winning putt disappeared into the hole.\n“I couldn’t believe when that last putt went in,” she said.\nThe playoff was forced into Monday because darkness halted play on Sunday night after four extra holes.\nWhat started as a three-way playoff was whittled down to two when American Jennifer Song was unable to match the birdies by Lindberg and Park at the third extra hole.\nLindberg had a chance to win at the seventh extra hole, the par-five 18th, but she hit a timid birdie putt from about five feet that missed on the low side.\nShe made amends at the next hole, however, to complete a dream that goes back to her childhood.\n“I remember writing some goals when I got to high school, the dream scenario and it would be to win a major championship and leave a mark in history,” she said.\n“But at the same time that felt like too big of a dream to even come true, but it has.”\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T19:29:01.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
