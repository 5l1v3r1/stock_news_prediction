The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Tilman Blasshofer \nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.35 percent by 0715 GMT with most sectors trading in negative territory, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI and Britain's FTSE also slipped slightly following strong gains on Tuesday. \nTesco was the top STOXX gainer, up 3.7 percent after the British retailer beat guidance with a 28 percent rise in full-year profit, underlining the recovery under CEO Dave Lewis. \nDeutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) rose 3.9 percent after reports that Sprint ( S.N ) had restarted talks to merge with the German groupâ€™s U.S. unit T-Mobile US Inc ( TMUS.O ). Its gains lifted the telecoms index .SXKP up 0.8 percent, making it the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe. \nStill in earnings, a solid update lifted shares in Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut ( BARN.S ) up 2.6 percent, while CHR Hansen ( CHRH.CO ) fell 4 percent after it missed second-quarter profit forecasts.
