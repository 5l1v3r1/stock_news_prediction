But after the auction, buyers have all disappeared,” said a trader at a Japanese brokerage.\n“To attract buyers, their yield will have to rise to levels we have not seen in the new financial year (that started on Apr. 1,)” he said.\nThe 30-year yield rose 1.5 basis points to 0.715 percent.\nAt the shorter end, the five-year yield rose 1.5 basis point to minus 0.095 percent, a high last seen in early March.\nStill JGB options were pricing in limited price moves ahead.\nTraders say JGB futures options are traded at implied volatility of about 0.9 percent.\nS&P-JPX JGB volatility index hit a record low of 1.25 on Wednesday.
