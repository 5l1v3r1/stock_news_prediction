Our new location and facilities will allow us to increase our fulfillment space, accommodate our expanding workforce, and provide a productive work environment for our team as we continue to focus on execution.”\nAbout Endexx\nEndexx, with its collaborative partners and consultants, develops and distributes two consumable product lines derived from industrial hemp, which is organic and naturally rich in phytocannabinoids. Phyto-Bites® is its CBD-infused soft chews for dogs. The dog treats are formulated to promote health and support the reduction of separation anxiety, pain and inflammation. The company also has two technology products and services that launched in 2014 – the m3hub and the AutoSpense™. Both products provide essential solutions to promote regulatory compliance and full accountability through “seed to sale” inventory management and an “end of sale” technology integration. Based on principles developed by the pharmacological industry, the m3hub platform is the first standardized software solution for tracking pharmaceutical-grade marijuana that maintains compliance with federal, state and local regulations. It is intended to provide a smooth transition to eventual federal mandates. The AutoSpense™ is a commercial-grade inventory control and dispensing device that provides up-to-the-minute accounting details and ensures both product and patient security. By automating the dispensing process, AutoSpense™ increases productivity and reduces costs for marijuana retailers, while enhancing their service quality by reducing transaction time for customers.
