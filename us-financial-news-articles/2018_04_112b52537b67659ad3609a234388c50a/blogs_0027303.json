Four people were injured and 160 buildings damaged in a possible tornado in northwest Arkansas, local media reported. \nThe weather was blamed for two traffic deaths in western Nebraska and Wisconsin, according to National Public Radio. \nThe storms also killed a 1-year-old girl when a tree fell on a recreational vehicle where she was sleeping, the sheriff’s office in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, said. \nBy Sunday afternoon, 879 flights had been canceled into or out of U.S. airports, the website flightaware.com reported, including 115 flights in or out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. On Saturday, 240 flights were canceled to or from Minneapolis-St. Paul, the website said. \nA total of more than 150 flights had also been canceled on Sunday at Chicago’s O’Hare International, Boston’s Logan International, Milwaukee’s General Mitchell International and Newark Liberty International airport in New Jersey, flightaware said.
