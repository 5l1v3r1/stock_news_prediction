He became the first player from China to win on the PGA Tour’s secondary Web.com Tour when he captured the Digital Ally Open last year.\nZhang, 30, is a two-times PGA Tour China winner, and is that tour’s all-time leading money-winner. He is ranked 301st in the world.\nGlover, meanwhile, said he had tried to support his partner’s hot hand by playing somewhat conservatively as he and Reavie tied for the lead.\n“There was a stretch there I was trying to do that, trying to hit it to 20 feet and let him hit it to 10 and it really worked,” said the 2009 U.S. Open champion.\n“We hit a bunch of good putts and we were reading them right.”\nPatrick Reed made a good return to competition in his first start since winning the U.S. Masters three weeks ago as he and partner Patrick Cantlay carded 65.\nU.S. Open champion Brooks Koepka, who missed nearly four months due to a torn left wrist ligament, marked his return with a 67 with Marc Turnesa.\nThe shot of the day belonged to American Ron Oppenheim, who holed out from 261 yards with a three-wood at the par-five seventh for an albatross as he and partner Nate Lashley shot 64.
