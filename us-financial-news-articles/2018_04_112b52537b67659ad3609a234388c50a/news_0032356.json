After initially declining comment, TomTom said it has not mandated an advisor for a sale of the whole company.\nThe Dutch company sees itself as a provider of navigation and mapping technologies that will play an important role in assisted driving and self-driving cars. It has already signed partnerships with Germany’s Bosch and China’s Baidu, among others.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 43 million euros ($53.25 million), beating average expectations of 34 million euros in a company-published poll and unchanged from the first quarter of 2017.\nThe company’s shares gained 2.6 percent to 8.006 euros by 1215 GMT, giving it a market value of around 1.8 billion euros. The shares have lost around 3 percent this year.\nSales dropped by 10 percent to 192 million euros as the company’s personal navigation device (PND) business shrank further.\nThe company’s automotive sector sales rose by 42 percent to 78 million euros, following long-term contract wins from several major carmakers.\nCEO and founder Harold Goddijn told shareholders it was too early to forecast the size of new automotive contracts the company may win this year, although he said the overall value of contracts available in 2018 will be less than it was in 2017.\nThe company maintained a forecast for overall 2018 sales to drop to 800 million euros from 903 million euros in 2017, as the popularity of PNDs fade.
