You can’t make an elephant zookeeper happier,” said Ben Van Dyck who looks after the animals.\nOn his feet within fifteen minutes of his birth and now walking well, the newborn is perfectly healthy, the zoo said.\nHe became the tenth member of the elephant family at a zoo whose breeding programme aims to help repopulate the endangered species.
