Only Russia, at currently just under 11 million bpd, pumps out more.\n\"Barring any geopolitical shocks, we see limited upside potential for oil prices from current levels due to ongoing oversupply, mainly from the U.S. and Russia, and also a slowing demand growth outlook,\" said Georgi Slavov, head of research at commodities brokerage Marex Spectron.
