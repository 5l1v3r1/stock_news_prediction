Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Leicester City - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - March 31, 2018 Leicester City's Vicente Iborra celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Toby Melville \nWith seven matches remaining, Claude Puel’s Leicester are eighth in the Premier League table and three points behind seventh-placed Burnley. \nSeventh spot could be enough for a place in Europe’s second tier competition if the winners of the FA Cup have already qualified for Europe. \n“It will be very important, for the club and for us of course,” the 30-year-old Spaniard told the Leicester Mercury. \n“In the last period of the season we have to be ambitious but with our feet on the floor and with humility.” \nIborra, who was part of the Sevilla squad which won the Europa League for three consecutive season between 2014 and 2016, wants Leicester to seize the opportunity. \n“If we arrive in seventh it will be good for us, but we have some very difficult games against some very strong teams,” he added. \n“Now we have to work to improve and win a lot of games.” \nAfter injury delayed his start to his career at the King Power Stadium, Iborra established himself in the Leicester midfield under manager Claude Puel. \n“I feel settled into English football now,” Iborra said. \n“I was injured at the start of the season.. but now I can play a lot of times and I work for this. Everything I do is to help me play and help me improve my football. \nLeicester, who have recorded consecutive wins over West Bromwich Albion and Brighton and Hove Albion last month, host 12th-placed Newcastle United on Saturday.
