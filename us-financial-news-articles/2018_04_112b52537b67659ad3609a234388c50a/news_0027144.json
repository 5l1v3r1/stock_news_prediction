Bush on Iraq Reuters President Donald Trump announces airstrikes against Syria at the White House on Friday. \nBy Chris Gordon \nWASHINGTON — President Donald Trump defended the use of the phrase “mission accomplished” after the U.S., U.K. and France conducted airstrikes Friday night that targeted the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack. \n“The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished,” Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday morning. “I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!” The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished.” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 15, 2018 \nHours after the attacks occurred, Trump declared the military action a success. \n“Could not have had a better result,” he said in a Twitter message Saturday. “Mission Accomplished!” Critics jumped on the president’s remarks, comparing his comments to a banner reading “Mission Accomplished” behind President George W. Bush during a May 2003 speech he gave on an aircraft carrier returning from a deployment to support the invasion of Iraq. The U.S. toppled President Saddam Hussein’s government swiftly after entering the country, but the vast majority of U.S. casualties occurred later as troops battled insurgents. The war lasted until 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-15T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-15T21:09:36.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
