A scene from the Israeli television series Fauda. REUTERS/Courtesy Netflix \nIn a letter on Tuesday to Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, the executives from record labels and Hollywood talent agencies called the move by the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement a “blatant attempt at artistic censorship.” \n“Fauda” is an Israeli-made television thriller set in the West Bank about an Israeli undercover agent who comes out of retirement to hunt for a Palestinian militant. \nThe show, which features dialog in both Hebrew and Arabic, was first broadcast on Israeli television in 2015 and premiered on Netflix in December 2016. Netflix is due to release the second season in May. \nIn a posting on its website last week, the BDS called on Netflix to “nix ‘Fauda’,” saying the series “glorifies the Israeli military’s war crimes against the Palestinian people.” \n“Failing to do so will open Netflix to nonviolent grassroots pressure and possible legal accountability,” the posting added. \nNetflix declined to comment on Wednesday. \nIn its letter of support, the U.S.-based Creative Community for Peace called “Fauda” a “nuanced portrayal of issues related to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.” \n“We want you to know that we stand behind you and Netflix in the face of this blatant attempt at artistic censorship,” the letter said. Signatories included Universal Music Publishing Group Chief Executive Jody Gerson, Geffen Records president Neil Jacobson and Steve Schnur, music president at videogame producer Electronic Arts. \nThe campaign against “Fauda” is the latest move since 2005 by BDS to promote a global cultural boycott against Israel. \nIt has succeeded in recent years in dissuading a number of music acts, including Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, Elvis Costello and New Zealand singer-songwriter Lorde, from performing in Israel. \n(This version of the story corrects typographical error in penultimate paragraph to against instead of again) Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Sandra Maler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T16:43:54.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
