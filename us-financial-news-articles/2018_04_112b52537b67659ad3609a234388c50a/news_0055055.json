This is a big moment and we need to fight,” Soares told the Daily Echo.\n“... We can win with motivation but it’s not just about this. It’s about intelligence in how we approach the game and this is up to the big players and to who has personality in these big moments.\n“But, definitely, this one is a crucial moment and mathematically it’s not but mentality-wise it’s very important. I think we need to face it like it’s a final, where you do whatever you have to do to win.”\nSoares, 26, believes Southampton are improving under Mark Hughes despite their poor results.\n“To be honest, I think we are growing every week and the group is staying more together, even if we don’t win,” he said.\n“We are understanding better the system, understanding the new ideas of the new manager... We can see it happening, it’s just being a little more experienced in some moments.\n“We have been naive a bit this season, made mistakes, we’ve been missing that extra bit.”\nBournemouth are 11th in the table and are winless in their last four league matches.
