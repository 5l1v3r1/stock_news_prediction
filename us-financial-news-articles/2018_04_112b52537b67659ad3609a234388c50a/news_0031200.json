REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo Pensions & Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), which advises pension funds and others on how to vote at companies’ annual general meetings, said HSBC Chief Executive John Flint’s potential bonus amount was “excessive” at over 200 percent of fixed pay.\nA spokeswoman for HSBC declined to comment.\nShareholder advisory groups such as PIRC have become more vocal in recent years in encouraging investors to vote against pay plans at annual general meetings.\nHowever, two other groups, ISS and Glass Lewis, said they recommended votes in favor of all of HSBC’s proposals for its annual general meeting on Friday, including the CEO’s pay.\nInvestors will vote on a raft of proposals including pay, the re-election of HSBC’s board and plans to raise capital.\nPIRC said it also opposed the pay packages of executive directors Iain Mackay and Marc Moses, also on the grounds that incentive payments exceeded 200 percent of their fixed salaries.\nIn addition, the group recommended investors vote against the re-election of six board members, in four cases because they missed board meetings without the company giving a reason for the absences.\nPIRC said investors should oppose plans by the bank to raise funds for an unspecified acquisition or investment.\nPIRC said such plans are contrary to good corporate governance, and the bank ought to seek approval from shareholders to raise money for a specific deal.\nReporting by Lawrence White; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:18:02.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
