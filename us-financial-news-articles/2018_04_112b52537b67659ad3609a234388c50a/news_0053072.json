Along with networking and education opportunities, a business meeting, and committee reports, the Board election was held. Two incumbents and one new member were elected to three-year terms on the MnCUN Board of Directors.\n“It’s an honor to be elected to the MnCUN board and to have the opportunity to serve along with my peers from credit unions across the state,” said Smith. “I enjoy serving our TopLine members and I look forward to expanding my service by working to advocate for Minnesota’s million and a half strong credit union members in this new role.”\n“The MnCUN board has always attracted top level talent to serve our many members in Minnesota,” says Mark Cummins, President and CEO, MnCUN. “We look for strong leaders, and Tom Smith is no exception. He’ll fit right in and we look forward to working with him.”\nIn addition to Smith, other members elected are Mary Hansen, Mayo Employees FCU, and Julia Havens, Riverview CU.
