The company also withdrew double payments from consumers’ accounts, the agency said.\nLendingClub’s “actions have caused substantial injury to consumers,” the FTC said in the complaint filed in federal court in California.\nA representative of Lending Club didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\nLending Club shares fell as much as 10.4 percent on the news and were down 6.4 percent to $3.05 at 12:10 p.m. in New York.
