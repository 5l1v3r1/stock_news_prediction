REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo \nSimmering antipathy between the awkward partners boiled over on Saturday in a row over law enforcement, highlighting the challenge Merkel faces to forge a team spirit in the alliance of her conservatives and the left-leaning Social Democrats (SPD). \nThe row broke out after Health Minister Jens Spahn told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung earlier this week that in working-class areas in Essen, Duisburg or Berlin “there is the impression that the state is no longer willing or able to enforce the law.” \nAndrea Nahles, poised to take over as SPD leader this later month, said Spahn - a conservative - should focus on the health portfolio. \n“Before Health Minister Spahn bad-mouths the home affairs situation in too-clever-by-half interviews ... he should take care of his own job,” she told the RND newspaper group, noting the conservatives have held the interior ministry for 13 years. \nMerkel took office last month as chancellor for a fourth, and likely final, term that may prove her most challenging yet as she leads the fragile coalition with her personal standing diminished following Germany’s 2015 refugee crisis. \nHer conservatives only turned to the SPD to prolong their ‘grand coalition’ - in power since 2013 - out of desperation after talks on a three-way alliance with two smaller parties collapsed last November.
