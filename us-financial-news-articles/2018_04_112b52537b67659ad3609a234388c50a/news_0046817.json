As is tradition, the framed notice of birth will go on display on a ceremonial easel on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.\n“The framed bulletin will brought out of the Privy Purse Door and carried across the forecourt, to be placed on the easel,” Buckingham Palace said.\nThe practice of posting a bulletin on the occasion of a Royal birth has gone on for at least as long as Buckingham Palace has been the Sovereign’s official residence (from 1837).\nThe bulletin will be on display for approximately 24 hours. After it comes down, it is sent to the Privy Council Office in order that the details of the official notice may be recorded in the Privy Council records.\nHOW IMPORTANT IS THE NEW PRINCE? The new prince is Queen Elizabeth’s sixth great-grandchild and fifth-in-line to the British throne behind siblings George, 4, his two-year-old sister Charlotte, their father William, and grandfather Prince Charles, who is heir.\nA 2013 change to the law means the boy will not supplant his older sister Charlotte in the line of succession. Before that change younger males would take precedence over older female siblings.\n(For a graphic on the line of succession, please click tmsnrt.rs/2K7WeB5 )\nWHAT IS THE NAME? It is not yet clear. An announcement will come soon.\nWHEN WILL KATE LEAVE HOSPITAL?
