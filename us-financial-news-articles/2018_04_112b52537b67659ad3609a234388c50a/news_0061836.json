Its main ally in the center-right, Forza Italia, was on 12 percent.\nAt the March 4 national election, the League took 25.8 percent of the vote in the same region, 5-Star 24.6 percent, the PD 18.7 percent and Forza Italia, led by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, 10.7 percent.\nThe 5-Star regularly underperforms at a local level, but its weak showing in Friuli Venezia Giulia suggested it had failed to capitalize on its strong showing last month, when it emerged as easily the largest single party in Italy.\nFlushed by that success, 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio has been courting both the right and the center-left in an effort to secure a coalition government, but to no effect thus far.\nDi Maio has said he would like to strike an accord with the League, but insists it should first abandon its ally Forza Italia — something Salvini has refused to do.\nEfforts to enter into government talks with the center-left risk falling at the first hurdle, with PD bigwig Matteo Renzi urging his party to shun any such move.\nIf the 5-Star/PD initiative fails, President Sergio Mattarella will have few cards left up his sleeve.\nOne would be to try to put together a broad government of national unity to carry out electoral reform. The other would be to call new elections for the autumn.\nSunday’s vote suggested the League would fancy its chances in any new ballot, while other parties might be more hesitant over any rush back to the polls.\n“If the League and the center-right win (in Friuli Venezia Giulia) you’ll see that the government will come soon. Someone will stop being so cocky and we’ll finally get to work,” Salvini said earlier this month, referring to Di Maio.
