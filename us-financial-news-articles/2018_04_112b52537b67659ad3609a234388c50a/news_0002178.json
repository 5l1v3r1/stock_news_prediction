What led Oklahoma teachers to protest? \nThe U.S. is also dealing with a teacher shortage . For example, Oklahoma schools are hiring a record number of teachers with temporary emergency certifications and who lack formal education training. What’s happened so far? \nThe strikes began in late February in West Virginia, where teachers left their jobs for nine days before getting a 5% raise. \nTeachers in other states soon followed suit. “I got on Facebook and I typed in … Oklahoma walkout, teacher walkouts,” Alberto Morejon, an 8th grade teacher and baseball coach in Oklahoma who was inspired by the West Virginia protests, told CNN . “Nothing popped up and I was like — why not be the guy that makes the group? Now it has 72,000 people … next thing you know it just exploded.” \nOn March 8, Oklahoma teachers asked for more than $800 million in new school and state funding, including a $10,000 raise and $200 million in additional school funding. \nThe Oklahoma House and Senate approved a $447 million tax increase on March 29. The package includes a $6,100 average pay raise for teachers along with $33 million for textbooks and $18 million in additional school funding. Republican Gov. Mary Fallin signed the bill that gives a 15% and 18% raise to most Oklahoma teachers. But the educators say this is still not enough for them to serve students and they shut down schools again Monday to march to the capitol. \n“It’s more than the numbers. It’s more than a raise. We need funding for our kids, and we need to be respected as professionals,” Ellen Kraft, a teacher at Truman Primary in Norman, told Oklahoma’s News 4 . “You can’t cut 28%, and then fill it with half of that and call it a day. There’s more work to be done than that.” \nThe protest continued Tuesday, with classes cancelled in 20 of Oklahoma’s largest school districts that serve 230,000 students. What are the Oklahoma teachers asking for? \nThough it took a historic three-fourths majority for state lawmakers to pass the tax increase last week, teachers are noting that the package only partially fulfills their requests for raises and additional classroom funding. \nAbout 25,000 teachers showed up to the capitol Monday , but it seems some Oklahoma lawmakers have already checked the issue off their agendas. Sen. Marty Quinn, R-Claremore, said he and his colleagues had made every effort to address teacher pay and have done a good job, adding that there are 72 other agencies that also have needs that lawmakers must address.
