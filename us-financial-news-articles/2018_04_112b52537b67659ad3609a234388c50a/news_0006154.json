Falcon accused government supporters of attacking Teodoro Campos, who is also a lawmaker, with a brass knuckle. After being whisked to hospital, Campos was in stable condition, according to Falcon. \nMaduro, whom Falcon has accused of turning to violence to compensate for his deep unpopularity in the midst of a brutal economic crisis, condemned the attack. \n“I can say that there are 17 people arrested and that all who dare attack presidential candidate Henri Falcon’s campaign verbally or physically will be punished with jail,” Maduro said during a speech on state television. He did not provide any details on the arrests. \nMaduro rebuffed claims that militant grassroot groups known as “colectivos” were behind the attack. \n“If someone says they are ‘chavista’ or a member of a ‘colectivo’ and does what that group did yesterday in Catia, in Caracas, then they’re not ‘chavista.’ It could be an infiltrator on the right-wing’s payroll,” said Maduro, who frequently accuses his opponents of seeking to sabotage his presidency by allegedly hoarding goods, tampering with the electricity generation and fuelling violence. \nCritics say Maduro has wrecked the oil-rich nation’s economy with inefficient and corrupt state meddling but refuses to take responsibility for Venezuela’s meltdown. \nFalcon is hoping to beat Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader, in a May 20 election that the rest of the opposition is boycotting because it says the electoral process is stacked against it. \nMany opposition members distrust Falcon, once a member of the ruling socialists, and say he is a government puppet designed to legitimize an unfair election. Falcon, however, says Maduro’s opponents must unite to try to defeat Maduro at the ballot box and bring about peaceful change in Venezuela.
