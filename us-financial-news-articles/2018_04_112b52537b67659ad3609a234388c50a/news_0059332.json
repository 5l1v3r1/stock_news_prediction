If any wrongdoing is found, we will take fast and decisive action and do everything possible to prevent future misconduct,” it said.\nAt the same time, it added, publicity around the case has included “many sensational and unfounded claims in a politicised debate of which Novartis should not be a part”.\nThe socialist and conservative politicians who served between 2006 and 2015 have denied the allegations, saying they are a fabrication and a witch-hunt by the leftist-led government. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had urged parliament to investigate the case.\nGreek ministers are protected from prosecution and under Greek law, parliament is the only institution that can investigate them or lift their immunity. Greek prosecutors referred the case to parliament in February.\nThe parliamentary committee that looked into the case was made up of 21 lawmakers - a majority of them from the ruling Syriza party. Its president, former shipping minister Theodoros Dritsas, submitted a report with its conclusions to Parliament Speaker Nikos Voutsis on Friday.\nDritsas said the committee was led to the conclusion that: “Parliament has no authority to proceed with the judicial investigation into the criminal acts of bribery for the politicians mentioned, or of money laundering.”\nThe report will be distributed to lawmakers and parliament is expected to discuss it in May.\nThe case has struck a nerve in crisis-hit Greece, which has slashed healthcare spending to shore up its finances.\nSince 2015, Novartis has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements and fines as a result of kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China.\nReporting by Renee Maltezou; Editing by Mark Potter and Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T12:26:48.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
