Cryptocurrencies are suffering amid the uncertainty, sending Bitcoin prices below $7,000 for the first time in nearly two months. \nBitcoin prices hit $6,919 in mid-morning trading Wednesday, the first time they’ve slipped below the $7,000 barrier since Feb. 6. They have yet to hit recent lows, though. Since the digital coin’s stunning escalation in value last year, the lowest prices have fallen is $6,127.21, according to CoinMarketCap . \nAside from that brief dip in February, the last time Bitcoin was regularly in the sub-$7,000 range was last November, despite warnings that the crypto bubble was about to burst . \nCryptocurrencies on the whole are suffering in Wednesday trading. Bitcoin, Ethereum , and Ripple are all down roughly 7%, as of 11:00 a.m. ET. And Bitcoin Cash is down nearly 8%. Less well known cryptocurrencies are seeing big drops as well, with only one of the top 45 cryptos (as judged by market cap) showing gains. Ardor is actually up 13% today to 29 cents.
