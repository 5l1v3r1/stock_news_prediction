It was just the fourth time the jackpot has surpassed the $500 million mark, lottery officials have said.\n“Our goal is to do a lot of charity work and to do good work for people who need it,” Wahl said at a news conference at New Jersey Lottery headquarters in Trenton, New Jersey, as his new team of financial advisers looked on.\nWahl, 47 of Vernon, New Jersey, had previously claimed his prize, but state lottery officials had kept his identity secret until Friday.\nWahl bought the ticket that hit the $533 million jackpot on March 30, a day before the drawing, at a Lukoil gas station and mini-mart in Riverdale, New Jersey. Gas station owner Ameer Krass received a $30,000 bonus for having sold the ticket.\nSince he selected the cash option over the annuity, Wahl will receive only $324.6 million, which New Jersey Lottery officials estimated will leave him with a net of about $221 million after federal and state taxes.\nReporting by Peter Szekely; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T19:38:54.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
