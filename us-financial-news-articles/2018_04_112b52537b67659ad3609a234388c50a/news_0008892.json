The NYPD later discovered the object was a metal pipe.\nMarcus Vassell, Mr. Vassell’s brother, said shortly before the shooting, Mr. Vassell asked him for a pair of socks. “I just want justice for my brother,” he said. “I love you, bro.”\nA memorial was set up at the Crown Heights building where Mr. Vassell lived.

Friends said he was known to be mentally ill and regularly was seen strolling Utica Avenue.\n“This is why we need more community policing,” said Akel Williams, a 31-year-old Crown Heights resident. If officers “responded who knew who the guy was, they would’ve probably approached him in a whole different manner.”\nAt the Thursday evening demonstration, people held signs reading “R.I.P. Saheed.” Relatives of others shot by NYPD officers spoke, and a pastor led the crowd in prayer. Participants released white balloons into the sky before marching to the 71st police precinct. Several area streets were closed.\nOutside the police precinct, hundreds of people lined barricades, chanting, “Saheed!” One man shouted, “Why would you kill my brother like that?”\nDozens of officers stood inside the barricades. One officer told a protester: “It’s a sad thing, sir. It’s a sad thing.”\nThe demonstrations in this Caribbean neighborhood were held just blocks from the site of the infamous 1991 Crown Heights riots.\nMayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday he didn’t believe the 911 callers alerted police to the fact that the man “might be someone with emotional distress or mental-health problems.”\n“One piece of this human tragedy, besides all the other issues we have to sort out, is the mental-health element,” he said.\nA Jamaican flag was hung at a community memorial for Mr. Vassell. Photo: Bebeto Matthews/Associated Press The NYPD touts a neighborhood-policing strategy focused on solving low-level crimes to build ties with local communities. Some on Thursday wondered how well the initiative is working in light of the killing of Mr. Vassell.\nMr. Vassell had more than a dozen arrests, according to law-enforcement officials, and was classified as an “emotionally disturbed person.” It isn’t clear if the officers who responded to the incident on Wednesday previously had encountered Mr. Vassell.\nThose who knew Mr. Vassell described him as a loving father of a 16-year-old son, who walked along Utica Avenue, sometimes having a beer with a friend, occasionally helping people with their bags.\nKevin James, 29, of Crown Heights, said he had a drink with Mr. Vassell just a day before the shooting. “He’d do anything for me, you know?” Mr. James said. “Unjustified killing, man. Wrong, man. Harmless person.”\nWrite to Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T08:00:05.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
