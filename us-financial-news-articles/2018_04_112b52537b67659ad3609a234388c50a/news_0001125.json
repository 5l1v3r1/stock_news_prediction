He lasted five innings on Saturday, allowing six hits, two walks and five runs, four earned.\nMiami scored twice in the first. Leadoff batter Lewis Brinson was hit by a pitch, and Dietrich followed with his two-run homer to the upper deck in right, belting a 1-2 slider.\nChicago tied the score 2-2 in the second, also doing damage with its first two batters. Willson Contreras hit a broken-bat single, and Schwarber lifted his two-run homer to the upper deck in right. He hammered a 3-1 cutter.\nEach team scored three runs in the fifth inning.\nRizzo, who grew up a half-hour from Marlins Park and went to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, came up with the bases loaded, two outs and a 2-2 score in the fifth. He then drilled a single into a shift, and it cleared the bases when right fielder Cameron Maybin bobbled the ball.\nMiami tied the score 5-5 on an RBI single by Brinson and a two-run single by Castro. Both of those hits came with two strikes, and Castro’s single gave him 499 career RBIs.\nChicago took a 6-5 lead in the sixth. Schwarber led off with a double, advanced on an Addison Russell single and scored on Jason Heyward’s sacrifice fly.\nBut Miami rallied again, tying the score in the eighth. Brian Anderson hit a one-out single, advanced on a Miguel Rojas infield single and scored on a Bryan Holaday single.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T11:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:48:28.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
