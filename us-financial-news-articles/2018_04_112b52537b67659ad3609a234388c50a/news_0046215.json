Attacks have been carried out by both sides.\nSome 73 people were killed in central states - known as the “Middle Belt” - in the first few days of 2018, prompting a high- profile mass burial in Benue state’s capital, Makurdi.\nCritics of Buhari, a Muslim who is Fulani, have accused him of failing to crack down on herdsmen because they are from the same ethnic group - an accusation his administration has repeatedly denied.\nThe latest killings were described as “heinous” by Buhari, a 75-year-old former military ruler who vowed to improve security when he took office in May 2015.\n“Violating a place of worship, killing priests and worshippers is not only vile, evil and satanic, it is clearly calculated to stoke up religious conflict and plunge our communities into endless bloodletting,” he said in a statement.\nBuhari declared earlier this month he would seek a second term. His candidacy depends on party approval, which is widely seen as a formality.\nThe Middle Belt region includes a number of swing states that could play a significant role in determining Buhari’s electoral prospects.\nReporting by Alexis Akwagyiram; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T03:18:39.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
