Dressed all in black, Woods acknowledged the well wishers at the first hole with a subtle nod and touch of his visor and then got right to work. \nAfter two pars to start his round Woods got into red figures when he drained a 10-foot birdie putt at the par-four third hole. But the former world number one followed up with consecutive bogeys at the fourth and fifth holes. \nWoods had a solid chance to get back to even par but failed to capitalise on a solid tee shot at the par-three sixth after his eight-foot birdie attempt went just left of the hole. \nThe 11th brought more trouble as his tee shot sailed way right of the fairway. From there Woods hit a low stinger toward the green that hit someone in the gallery and he was unable to get up and down. \nWoods was then left in disbelief when his tee shot at the par-three 12th ended up in Rae’s Creek. After chipping to the edge of the green he salvaged a bogey with a lengthy putt. \nBirdies at 14 and 16, the latter producing the loudest roars directed at Woods all day, took him to one over.
