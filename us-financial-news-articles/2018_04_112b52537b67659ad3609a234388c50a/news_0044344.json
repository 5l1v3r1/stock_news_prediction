The private equity firm had originally bought the company in 2014, with sources at the time indicating a purchase price of around 480 million pounds. \n“This was very much a bilateral transaction. Three or four other firms might have met with the CEO (of Callcredit), but this was very much a deal where there was a logical buyer from the start,” Aaron Cohen, managing director at GTCR, told Reuters in an interview. \nThe deal is expected to close late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter pending regulatory approval, TransUnion said. \nJefferies, Credit Suisse and Evercore acted as financial advisers to Callcredit, with Kirkland & Ellis LLP providing legal assistance, according to GTCR’s statement.
