REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo\nThe exits follow disclosures at a judicial inquiry into the country’s financial sector that AMP misled many customers and deceived the corporate regulator. The scandal has already caused the early departure of CEO Craig Meller, who was due to leave by year end, and analysts expect more heads will roll.\nChairwoman Catherine Brenner and group General Counsel Brian Salter will depart immediately, AMP said in a statement.\nMike Wilkins, a former independent director who has been named both interim chairman and CEO, said the evidence given to the government-backed Royal Commission is “being treated extremely seriously by the board”.\n“Appropriate steps are being taken to address the issues raised, and remediating our customers is being given utmost priority,” he said.\nAMP, which is also staring at a possible class action, has seen around A$2.2 billion ($1.7 billion) wiped off its market capitalization over the past two weeks in the wake of the revelations. It was valued at A$11.6 billion at Friday’s close.\nThe inquiry was told that advisers at AMP misappropriated funds of thousands of clients over the last decade by charging them without providing advice, and that it had repeatedly lied to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\nCounsel assisting the inquiry said on Friday that AMP had breached provisions of the Corporations Act that carry criminal sanctions.\nBrenner, Salter and Meller were singled out by the inquiry as part of a group of senior executives that allegedly modified a report by law firm Clayton Utz and submitted it to the regulator in late 2017 as “external and independent”.\nTheir intention was to limit the report’s findings about the involvement of AMP’s senior executives in misappropriating customer fees, the inquiry heard.\nAMP said in its statement that Brenner, Meller and the other directors “did not act inappropriately in relation to the preparation of the Clayton Utz report”.\nThe statement did not comment on Salter’s behavior.

The inquiry will be able to make wide-ranging recommendations including legislative changes and on criminal or civil prosecutions.\n($1 = 1.3201 Australian dollars)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T01:06:02.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
