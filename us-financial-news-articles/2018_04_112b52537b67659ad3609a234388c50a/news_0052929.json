Meanwhile, the continued improvement in the French labor market points to solid growth in consumer spending,” she added.\nConsumer spending growth, traditionally the main motor of the French economy, grew only 0.2 percent in the first quarter despite exceptionally cold temperatures boosting energy consumption in February.\nMeanwhile businesses slowed investment growth to 0.5 percent from 1.6 percent in the previous three months while overall production of goods and services slowed to only 0.3 percent from 0.9 percent.\nAs a result, exports swung from a sharp increase in the fourth quarter to a slight decrease in the first three months of 2018. Since imports were flat, foreign trade had no impact on overall growth, INSEE said.\n($1 = 0.8286 euros)\nPeople walk on the esplanade of La Defense in the financial and business district of La Defense, west of Paris, France March 26, 2018.
