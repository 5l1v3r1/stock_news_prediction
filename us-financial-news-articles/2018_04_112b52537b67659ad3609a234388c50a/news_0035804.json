(NASDAQ:TCBI), the parent company of Texas Capital Bank, announced earnings and operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\n“We begin 2018 with strong operating results and continued traditional LHI growth, with the expected first quarter seasonal contraction in the mortgage finance business,\" said Keith Cargill, CEO. \"We remain focused on gaining efficiencies and improving client experience, positioning us for long-term success.\"\nLoans held for investment (\"LHI\"), excluding mortgage finance, increased 2% on a linked quarter basis, growing 18% from the first quarter of 2017. Total mortgage finance loans, including mortgage correspondent aggregation (\"MCA\") loans, decreased 9% on a linked quarter basis and increased 36% from the first quarter of 2017. Demand deposits decreased 5% and total deposits decreased 2% on a linked quarter basis, increasing 4% and 13%, respectively, from the first quarter of 2017. Net income increased 61% on a linked quarter basis and increased 69% from the first quarter of 2017. EPS increased 64% on a linked quarter basis and increased 73% from the first quarter of 2017.\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\n(dollars and shares in thousands)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS Net income $ 71,945 $ 42,542 69% Net income available to common stockholders $ 69,507 $ 40,104 73% Diluted EPS $ 1.38 $ 0.80 73% Diluted shares 50,353 50,234 —% ROA 1.22% 0.83% ROE 13.39% 8.60% BALANCE SHEET Loans held for sale (LHS), MCA $ 1,088,565 $ 884,647 23% LHI, mortgage finance 4,689,938 3,371,598 39% LHI 15,741,772 13,298,918 18% Total LHI 20,431,710 16,670,516 23% Total loans 21,520,275 17,555,163 23% Total assets 24,449,147 20,864,874 17% Demand deposits 7,413,340 7,094,696 4% Total deposits 18,764,533 16,605,380 13% Stockholders’ equity 2,273,429 2,050,442 11%\nDETAILED FINANCIALS\nTexas Capital Bancshares, Inc. reported net income of $71.9 million and net income available to common stockholders of $69.5 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $42.5 million and net income available to common stockholders of $40.1 million for the same period in 2017. On a fully diluted basis, earnings per common share were $1.38 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.80 for the same period of 2017. The increase reflects a $29.4 million year-over-year increase in net income caused by an improvement in operating results for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, as well as a decline in income tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") which became effective on January 1, 2018.\nReturn on average common equity (“ROE”) was 13.39 percent and return on average assets (“ROA”) was 1.22 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 8.18 percent and 0.71 percent, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 8.60 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The linked quarter increases in ROE and ROA resulted primarily from the deferred tax asset re-measurement that was included in the fourth quarter 2017 income tax expense as well as a decrease in income tax expense caused by a decline in income tax rates as a result of the Tax Act. ROA also benefited from more effective utilization of liquidity assets as balances were deployed into higher yielding loan categories.\nNet interest income was $210.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $210.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $163.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest income was flat on a linked quarter basis with seasonally lower mortgage finance loan balances as well as the decrease in day count for the first quarter, partially offset by the growth in the traditional LHI portfolio. The year-over-year increase in net interest income is due primarily to the increase in total LHI, improved earning asset composition and the effect of increases in interest rates on loan yields attributable to our asset-sensitive balance sheet. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.71 percent, an increase of 24 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 42 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. We experienced significant improvement in traditional LHI yields, reporting a 25 basis point increase for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and a 61 basis point increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. In contrast, total cost of deposits for the first quarter of 2018 was up only 13 basis points to 0.66 percent compared to 0.53 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, and was up 34 basis points from 0.32 percent for the first quarter of 2017.\nAverage LHI, excluding mortgage finance loans, for the first quarter of 2018 were $15.4 billion, an increase of $415.3 million, or 3 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $2.4 billion, or 19 percent, from the first quarter of 2017. Average total mortgage finance loans (including Mortgage Correspondent Aggregation (\"MCA\")) for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.3 billion, a decrease of $960.6 million, or 15 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $1.5 billion, or 38 percent, from the first quarter of 2017. The linked-quarter decrease in total mortgages is in line with historical first quarter seasonal declines.\nAverage total deposits for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.1 billion from the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $2.5 billion from the first quarter of 2017. Average demand deposits for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $938.1 million, or 10 percent, to $8.1 billion from $9.1 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017, but increased $600.4 million, or 8 percent, from the first quarter of 2017. The linked-quarter decrease in total average deposits and demand deposits is in line with historical first quarter seasonal declines.\nWe recorded a $12.0 million provision for credit losses for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The provision for the first quarter of 2018 was driven by the consistent application of our methodology. The linked-quarter increase was primarily related to traditional LHI growth and migration in the portfolio, which included a $22.1 million increase in non-accrual loans. The total allowance for credit losses increased to 1.27 percent of LHI excluding mortgage finance loans at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2017 and decreased from 1.37 percent at March 31, 2017. In management’s opinion, the allowance is appropriate and is derived from consistent application of the methodology for establishing reserves for the loan portfolio.\nWe experienced an increase in non-performing assets (\"NPAs\") in the first quarter of 2018 related to two commercial (non-energy) loan relationships compared to levels reported in the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing the ratio of total non-performing assets to total LHI plus other real estate owned (“OREO”) to 0.65 percent compared to 0.55 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. The ratio decreased from 0.99 percent for the first quarter of 2017 primarily related to the decrease in energy non-accrual loans from $92.3 million at March 31, 2017 to $50.4 million at March 31, 2018. Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 were $5.2 million compared to $964,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, net charge-offs related to energy loans were $5.1 million compared to $175,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, net charge-offs were 0.11 percent of average total LHI, compared to 0.02 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.15 percent for the same period in 2017. At March 31, 2018, total OREO was $9.6 million compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $18.8 million at March 31, 2017. We recorded a $2.0 million OREO valuation allowance during the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $6.1 million permanent write-down during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income increased $2.8 million, or 17 percent, during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017, and increased $573,000, or 3 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase primarily related to a $3.3 million increase in servicing income during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017 attributable to an increase in mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") associated with our MCA program.\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $20.9 million, or 20 percent, compared to the first quarter of 2017, and decreased $6.2 million, or 5 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase is primarily related to increases in salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, marketing and other non-interest expenses, all of which were attributable to general business growth and continued build-out. Servicing related expenses for the first quarter of 2018 increased $2.1 million compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to an increase in mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\"), which are being amortized. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase in non-interest expense was a $2.0 million increase in allowance and other carrying costs for OREO resulting from the OREO valuation allowance recorded during the first quarter of 2018. The linked quarter decrease in non-interest expense is primarily related to decreases in servicing related expenses and allowance and other carrying costs for OREO. Specifically, the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $2.8 million impairment charge on MSRs and a $6.1 million OREO permanent write-down.\nStockholders’ equity increased by 11 percent from $2.1 billion at March 31, 2017 to $2.3 billion at March 31, 2018, due to retention of net income. Texas Capital Bank is well capitalized under regulatory guidelines and at March 31, 2018, our ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible assets was 8.6 percent.\nABOUT TEXAS CAPITAL BANCSHARES, INC.\nTexas Capital Bancshares, Inc.
