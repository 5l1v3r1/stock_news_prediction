HELPING REAL ECONOMY \nAccording to his estimates based on terms similar to those agreed by Intesa, a bad loan sale could boost their Core Tier 1 ratio - a key measure of capital adequacy - by between 12 and 27 basis points. \nHealthier balance sheets could boost lending and further help the economy, fuelling investor interest for shares in Italian banks, which have undergone a painful restructuring with thousands of job cuts and branch closures over the last years. \n“This news is... relevant to the capacity of the banks to provide loans to the real economy, and that feeds through a more bright outlook for the Italian economy,” said ING Interest Rate Strategist Martin Van Vliet in Amsterdam. \nThe restructuring effort and cheap valuations has allowed Italian banks to outperform their peers since early 2017, helping investors to shrug off continued political uncertainty following an inconclusive parliamentary election in March. \nFollowing a stellar 2017, when the Italian economy grew 1.5 percent, nearly twice as much as initial forecasts, the bank-heavy Italian FTSE MIB index has risen nearly 8 percent so far this year. That compares with the 2.6 percent drop for the broader European STOXX 600 stock benchmark. \nOn Tuesday, the 10-year yield spread over Germany narrowed to two-week lows amid expectations the Intesa deal would bode well for the economy at large as well as potentially reducing somewhat the need for any state backup for the banking system. \nS&P Global unexpectedly raised Italy’s credit rating late last year in its first such increase for Italy for at least three decades. It cited Italy’s strengthening economic outlook, growing investment, a steady uptick in employment and improvements in the debt-laden banking sector for the move. \nHowever, Italy still holds nearly one third of the euro zone’s bad loan pile inherited from the financial crisis. A further clean-up could eventually spur consolidation in the country’s fragmented banking system. \nElisabeth Rudman, analyst at ratings agency DBRS, said it would be “logical” to expect Italian banks to merge but lenders needed to continue to clean up their balance sheets. \n($1 = 0.8084 euros) Additional reporting by Helen Reid, Fanny Potkin and Dhara Ranasinghe in LONDON and by Claudia Cristoferi and Giulio Piovaccari in MILAN Editing by Gareth Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T16:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T17:05:53.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
