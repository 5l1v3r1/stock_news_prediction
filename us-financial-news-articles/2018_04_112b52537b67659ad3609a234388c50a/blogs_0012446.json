This mode allows up to 100 online players to violently battle each other to the death until only one player survives.\nThe game is now the top-viewed game on Twitch and the most widely played game on Microsoft's Xbox console.\nOlson reaffirmed his $127 price target for Take-Two shares, representing 29 percent upside to Thursday's close.\nThe analyst said the average \"Fortnite\" gamer is 13 to 14 years old, which is much lower than Take-Two's \"Grand Theft Auto\" user base. Twitch viewership market share for \"Grand Theft Auto,\" which is a good proxy for game engagement, only declined to 2.8 percent in March versus 3.1 percent late last year.\nIn addition, Take Two is scheduled to release an eagerly awaited game, Red Dead Redemption 2, in October. \n\"We do expect a measurable impact on Activision's near-term revenue due to overlapping titles (CoD, Destiny, Overwatch, etc.), but we expect very minimal impact on EA and Take-Two,\" he wrote. \"Additionally, there is a significant catalyst in October with Red Dead Redemption 2. Currently, Take-Two shares trade at a material discount to comps.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:52:04.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
