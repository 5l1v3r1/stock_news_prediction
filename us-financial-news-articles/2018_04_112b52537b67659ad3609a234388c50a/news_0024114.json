He brings a depth of knowledge of the linkages between agricultural producers and their suppliers, drawing on experience gained in a professional career spanning more than 40 years beginning in 1972 with the Business Development Bank of Canada, where he spent 25 years and rose to post of Executive Vice President responsible for the effective operation of BDC’s 83 branch Canadian network. From there, Mr. Ryan relocated to Saskatchewan to assume the role of CEO at Farm Credit Canada, where he oversaw improvements to all aspects of the business, most notably the re-invention of the corporate culture to a positive, outward-looking one that focused on customers and employees. In 2008, Mr. Ryan accepted a challenging post-Great Recession role at Rabobank North America, initially as CEO of Rabo AgriFinance and finally as CEO of Rabobank North America. There, he oversaw all activities of the bank while, at the same time, implementing his focus on high performance teams, to the benefit of the organization and its clients. During his tenure, Rabo Agrifinance became the preferred lender to agricultural producers throughout the USA.\nMike Ferguson, Gensource’s Chairman of the Board and President & CEO, commented, “We are so pleased to have John join us as a director with Gensource.\n“With its vision of creating vertical integration between fertilizer production and the farmer, Gensource has always seen itself as an agricultural supplier rather than a miner. John’s impressive career in the agri-finance business in North America is another step towards realizing that vision and comes on the heels of Gensource signing two MOUs with major North American agricultural players, the first step in negotiating binding off-take agreements that will trigger financing for construction of Gensource’s first potash production module.\n“John’s track record exemplifies his ability to make far-sighted organizational decisions that pay dividends for all stakeholders for years into the future. As Gensource grows into its first project, John’s insight and experience will be invaluable to help us succeed past our project phase, into our operational phase.”\nAbout Gensource\nGensource is based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and is focused on developing the next potash production facility in that province. Gensource’s President and CEO, Mike Ferguson, P.Eng., has assembled a management and technical team with direct and specific expertise and experience in potash development in Saskatchewan.\nGensource operates under a business plan that has two key components - vertical integration with the market to ensure that all production capacity built is directed to a specific market, eliminating market-side risk; and, technical innovation which will allow for a small and economic potash production facility, while the same time demonstrating significant reductions in community and environmental impact.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCaution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain forward looking information and Gensource cautions readers that forward- looking information is based on certain assumptions and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of Gensource included in this news release.
