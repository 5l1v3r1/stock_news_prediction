It has used third-party fact-checkers to identify them, and then given such stories less prominence in the Facebook News Feed when people share links to them.\nIn January, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would prioritize \"trustworthy\" news by using member surveys to identify high-quality outlets.\nAlex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, said in the briefing that the company was concerned not only about false facts but also other kinds of fakery.\nHe said Facebook wanted to reduce \"fake audiences,\" which he described as using \"tricks\" to artificially expand the perception of support for a particular message, as well as \"false narratives,\" such as headlines and language that \"exploit disagreements.\" (Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Richard Chang)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-03-29T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T08:44:36.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
