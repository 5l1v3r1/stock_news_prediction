That compared with 584 million riyals in the same period a year ago.\nThe result was below SICO Bahrain’s forecast of 549 million riyals in net profit, but above EFG Hermes’ forecast of 449 million riyals.\n“The start of 2018 saw good performances in some of our markets, however challenging market conditions and new regulations impacted the overall performance of the group,” said the company’s chairman Sheikh Abdulla Bin Mohammed Bin Saud Al-Thani in a statement.\nFirst quarter revenue also dropped 3 percent to 7.76 billion riyals.\nOoredoo said new regulation on SIM card registration in Indonesia hit revenue in its biggest international market.\nIndonesia revenue declined 23 percent to 1.5 billion riyals, due to loss of non-compliant customers and a decline in voice and SMS, which is an industry-wide challenge.\nRevenue in Algeria was hurt by taxes, weak economic environment and intense competition, it said.\n$1 = 3.6405 Qatar riyals Reporting by Saeed Azhar; Editing by Tom Arnold\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T14:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:20:09.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
