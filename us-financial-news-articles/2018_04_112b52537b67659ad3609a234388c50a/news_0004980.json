Such subsidies will cover 30 million mu (2 million hectares) of land this year, the document said, without giving further details on the subsidies.\nChina started giving subsidies to encourage farmers in the northeast to rotate their corn plantings with other crops in 2016 as part of a push to rebalance grain stocks.\nBeijing will also give subsidies to farmers to purchase agriculture machinery and equipment in areas including irrigation and planting.\nThose treating animal waste, using organic fertilizer in growing vegetables and fruits, and recycling land films will also receive subsidies from the government, according to the document.\nReporting by Hallie Gu and Josephine Mason; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-03T18:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T15:42:32.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
