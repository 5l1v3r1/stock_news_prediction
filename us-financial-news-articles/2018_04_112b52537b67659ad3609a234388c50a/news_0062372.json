Citigroup, Credit Agricole and Societe Generale have been hired to arrange the meetings ahead of the potential deal, the sources said.\nThe planned Islamic bonds would have a maturity ranging between five and 10 years.\nThe bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIDB is a regular issuer of international Islamic bonds, which it raises to fund its business activities and to promote the international sukuk market by building a liquid sukuk yield curve.\nThe triple A rated Jeddah-based bank issued its latest international sukuk in March, when it raised $1.25 billion.
