The price (of aluminium) has gone up and therefore I think global smelting volumes will increase, there will be fresh demand and we will find something.” \nHigher price, he said, could also make it feasible to ship Kazakh alumina to markets further away. \nERG, which was preparing to gradually boost its own smelting capacity in anticipation of the Rusal contract expiring at the end of 2019, has not replied to questions regarding the impact of Rusal sanctions on its operations.
