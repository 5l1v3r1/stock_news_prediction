It will decide our destiny,” Najib said when unveiling the manifesto. \n“BN will continue to fight for the fate of each Malaysian... every Malaysian is important to BN,” the prime minister said to cheers from about 10,000 supporters gathered at a concert hall on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur. \nNajib and his coalition face an unprecedented challenge from his former mentor and former prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad who has joined hands with old foes in the federal opposition and is their candidate for premier.
