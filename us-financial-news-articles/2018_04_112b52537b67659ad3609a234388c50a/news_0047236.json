Airbus says it is confident Eurofighter could get certification by 2025, when Germany wants to start phasing out its Tornado fleet.\nVolker Paltzo, chief executive of Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH, told reporters at the ILA Berlin Air Show that U.S. certification was required, but said he was confident Eurofighter could take over the roles of the Tornado.\n“This is a subject where we would not expect the U.S. to leverage over Eurofighter in this competition,” he said.\nPaltzo said the European fighter had already received over 600 orders, and was competing for 300 more across Europe.
