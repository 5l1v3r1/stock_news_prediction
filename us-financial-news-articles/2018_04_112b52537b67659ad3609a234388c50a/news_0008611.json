A U.S. official said no talks had been scheduled.\nThe State Department said afterwards that both sides had discussed the need to restore “fairness and balance” in the economic relationship between the United States and China, the world’s largest economies.\nBoth sides agreed on the importance of pursuing a “constructive U.S.-China relationship that produces meaningful results,” the department said in a statement.\nThe meeting also reaffirmed their commitment “to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” - a reference to their cooperation in resolving a crisis over North Korea’s development of nuclear missiles capable of hitting the United States.\nChina has traditionally been North Korea’s closest ally though ties have been frayed by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles and Beijing’s backing of tough U.N. sanctions in response.
