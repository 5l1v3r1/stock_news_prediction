The numbers are due sometime this week.\n\"We like the set-up headed into Q1 deliveries as we believe sentiment is overly negative, and think Tesla may be able to exceed lower expectations,\" Baird analyst Ben Kallo wrote in a note.\nShares of the company were last down 4.4 percent at $254 in heavy trading, bringing its losses this year to nearly 15 percent.\nFailure to meet its production targets and liquidity pressures also prompted the Moody's downgrade last week. The ratings agency said Tesla was likely to raise more than $2 billion in new capital, partly to cover about $1.2 billion in convertible bonds coming due by March 2019.\n\"We consider a small possibility of Tesla releasing supportive data this week but mainly high probability that management and the Board will take more drastic action on guidance and funding to restore credibility,\" Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a client note.\n\"At the current share price, either would be positive, including higher than consensus dilution from raising capital if it credibly de-risked the Model 3 ramp up.\"\nMusk made light of the company's financial situation on April 1, joking in a tweet that Tesla had gone bankrupt.\n\"Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it,\" the tweet said.
