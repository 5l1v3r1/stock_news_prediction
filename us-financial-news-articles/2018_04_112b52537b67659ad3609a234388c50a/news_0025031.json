It is also the fastest growing of Britain’s “big four” along with No. 4 Morrisons ( MRW.L ). LEWIS TURNAROUND \nTesco made an operating profit of 1.644 billion pounds in the year to Feb. 24 - versus guidance of “at least” 1.575 billion pounds. Group sales rose 2.3 percent to 51 billion pounds. \nThe outcome was helped by a strong end to the year in Tesco’s home market, with fourth quarter like-for-like sales up 2.3 percent - a ninth straight quarter of growth.

REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo \nLewis joined Tesco in September 2014, leading a fightback after sales and profits were hammered by changing shopping habits, the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl and an accounting scandal that plunged the retailer into the worst crisis in its near 100-year history. \nLewis, who joined shortly before the scandal was uncovered, first stabilized Tesco, then got it growing with more competitive prices, streamlined product ranges, better customer service and improved supplier relationships. The Booker purchase is his boldest move yet. \n“With three years under our belt Tesco is growing again, recovering profitability and generating significant cash,” Lewis told reporters. \n“The merger with Booker allows us to build on this trajectory.” \nThe group, which competes with Sainsbury’s ( SBRY.L ), Asda ( WMT.N ) and Morrisons, said it was on track to deliver its targets - cost savings of 1.5 billion pounds, generating 9 billion pounds of retail cash and earning between 3.5 and 4 pence of operating profit for every pound customers spend by 2019-20. It had a margin of 2.9 percent in 2017-18. \nBernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne forecast Tesco could achieve the margin target one year early and raised the prospect of share buy-backs and special dividends. \nTesco is paying a final dividend of 2 pence a share, giving a total payout of 3 pence. An interim dividend in October was its first in three years. \nTesco’s shares have risen 14 percent over the last year but remain below the 230 pence they were at when Lewis joined. \nThat reflects caution among some investors about the ongoing challenge of the discounters and online players and the fact that Lewis has taken earnings out of the business through disposals such as the South Korean unit. \n“We’re very clear there’s more to do,” said Lewis. “It’s definitely not job done.” Editing by Kate Holto, Alexandra Hudson and Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T17:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T00:13:15.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
