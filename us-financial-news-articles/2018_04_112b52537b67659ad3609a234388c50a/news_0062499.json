The world number 92 became the first lucky loser to win a title since Leonardo Mayer triumphed in Hamburg last July.\n“I lost Sunday (in qualifying) and now I won the tournament. It’s amazing for me,” the 25-year-old Cecchinato said. “Maybe it’s a dream, I don’t know.”\nCecchinato broke Millman early in the first set to race into a 4-2 lead, but the 28-year-old Australian dragged himself back into the match by winning the next three games.\nCecchinato saved a set point on his serve while trailing 5-4 before regaining his composure to take the first set.\nMillman took a 4-1 lead in the second but Cecchinato fought back in style to claim victory.\n“Today is a special day because I won the first title of my career,” he said. “I’m very happy.”\nMillman reached the final earlier on Sunday after winning the final set of a 2-6 7-6(3) 7-6(5) victory over last year’s runner-up Aljaz Bedene. The semi-final was suspended on Saturday due to darkness.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-29T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T21:12:32.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
