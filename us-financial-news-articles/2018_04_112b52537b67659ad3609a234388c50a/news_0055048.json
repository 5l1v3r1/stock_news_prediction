He has promised a hard line on corruption and has vowed to refocus the government’s efforts on infrastructure spending to revive economic growth that slowed to 2.5 percent last year.\nReporting by Teresa Cespedes; writing by Mitra Taj; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:41:32.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
