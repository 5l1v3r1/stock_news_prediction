REUTERS/Stephane Mahe \nThe site in Notre-Dame-des-Landes had been squatted for years by opponents of the plan to build a 580-million-euro (£504.6 million) airport which the government decided to drop in January. \nSome 2,500 police took part in the evacuation which authorities said started at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT). Police had already blocked surrounding roads as early at 3:30 a.m., a Reuters journalist saw, while protesters set fire to barricades.

An old, inner-city airport 30 km (20 miles) to the south was congested and a security risk, they said. \nBut opponents said it was too costly, environmentally damaging and that there was another under-utilised airport 110 km (70 miles) to the north, near Rennes in Brittany. \nConstruction giant Vinci has said it is ready to discuss government compensation for the loss of its contract to develop Notre-Dame-des-Landes.
