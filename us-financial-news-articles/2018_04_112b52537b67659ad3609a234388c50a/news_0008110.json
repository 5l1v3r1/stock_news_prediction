Its numbers are based on national data and estimates for some smaller markets.\nThe seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of Western European sales fell 5.9 percent to 14.09 million, LMC said.\nSales fell 15.7 percent in Britain, 5.8 percent in Italy and 3.4 percent in Germany, according to data published in recent days, while rising more than 2 percent in France and Spain.\nThe British decline was accentuated by a year-earlier sales surge, ahead of tax increases in April 2017, LMC said.\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:49:14.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
