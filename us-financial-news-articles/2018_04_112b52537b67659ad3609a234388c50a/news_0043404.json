(AP) â€” Workplace safety regulators say they are investigating two incidents at automaker Tesla's factory in Northern California.\nThe New York Times reported Friday that the investigations come after the Center for Investigative Reporting catalogued a series of workplace injuries at Tesla.\nCalifornia's Division of Occupational Safety and Health said Friday that it had opened an investigation into an unspecified incident. The agency earlier said it was investigating an incident that resulted in a 30-year-old subcontractor breaking his jaw.\nTesla officials say the center incorrectly counted injuries that occurred away from the factory in Fremont, which is 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of San Francisco. The automaker says the reporting also relied on unspecified inaccurate information.\nTesla said Friday that it takes all worker injuries seriously and is cooperating with the investigations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T13:50:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
