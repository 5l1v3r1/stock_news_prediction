I suffer also. She was my best friend.”\nPolice alerted to the blood-splattered crime scene by a neighbor who was checking on the couple found Heisch’s headless body and her two pets slain inside a bedroom closet and discovered several bloody knives in the apartment.\nAuthorities said the couple met in a mental institution and that both had an extensive history of psychiatric illness and violence. They described Wakefield as a drifter.\nHe was arrested in 2003 for attempting to kill a family member, and Heisch was arrested in March 2015 for assault after attempting to stab her husband, police said.\nReporting and writing by David Schwartz in Phoenix; Editing by Steve Gorman and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T00:33:04.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
