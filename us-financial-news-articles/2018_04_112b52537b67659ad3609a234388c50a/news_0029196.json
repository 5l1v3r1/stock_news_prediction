After weeks of a hectic back-and-forth between China and the United States, the threat seems to have subsided, leading some investors to repurchase battered risky assets. A growing perception that Western strikes on Syria are unlikely to escalate also helped to boost optimism in global markets, though traders warned of lingering caution. \"Every once in a while the market sees an opportunity to take a breather, but don't fool yourself: there's plenty more volatility to come,\" said a portfolio manager at a São Paulo-based asset management firm. An MSCI index tracking Latin American stocks rose 1.3 percent, outperforming a broader emerging-market index . Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index led the gains, supported by shares of Usinas Siderúrgicas de Minas Gerais SA after the steelmaker announced plans to raise domestic steel prices. Shares in food processor BRF SA also jumped after Brazil lifted an embargo on some of its plants that export to the European Union. The ministry suspended production and health certification of BRF's poultry exports to the EU in mid-March. The embargo had affected 10 production units, BRF said at the time.
