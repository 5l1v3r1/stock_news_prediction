That had sent the dollar down to a 16-month low of 104.56 yen on March 26.\nSome market participants said the dollar could find support against the yen for now, especially if Japanese importers and intuitional investors opt to buy the dollar on dips.\nThe simmering trade tension between China and the United States is seen likely to be a market focus in the near term.\nThe Trump administration is expected sometime this week to publish a list of Chinese goods that could be subjected to new U.S. tariffs.\nBeyond the potential trade war, investors are also focused on U.S. data this week, led by the non-farm payrolls report for March due on Friday.\nThe reports should determine the path for future Federal Reserve interest rate increases, analysts say.\nThe euro held steady at $1.2303.\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar edged up 0.1 percent to $0.7667, clinging above a three-month low of $0.7643 set last week.\nAustralia’s central bank is seen as all but certain to keep its cash rate at a record low 1.5 percent at its monetary policy decision due later on Tuesday.
