REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo \nApple announced the deal in December to help it better compete with industry leader Spotify ( SPOT.N ). Shazam lets users identify songs by pointing a smartphone at the audio source. \nThe European Commission said it was concerned about Apple’s access to data on Shazam’s users who use competing music streaming services in Europe.

As a result, competing music streaming services could be put at a competitive disadvantage,” the EU competition enforcer said. \nThe investigation will also examine whether Apple Music’s competitors would be harmed if Apple halted referrals from the Shazam app to them. \nThe Commission set a Sept. 4 deadline for its decision. \nApple could offer concessions such as a pledge to allow fair access to Shazam to address regulatory concerns. \nThe EU executive launched a preliminary review of the deal in February following a request from seven European countries including France, Italy, Spain and Sweden. \nApple did not give a value for the deal when it announced it in December. Technology news website TechCrunch said at the time the price could be as much as $400 million (286.73 million pounds), far short of the most recent $1 billion valuation for privately-held Shazam.
