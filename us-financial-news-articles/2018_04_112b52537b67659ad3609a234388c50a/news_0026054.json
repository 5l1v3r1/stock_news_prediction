M.video said last month it would buy Eldorado in a deal expected to close in the second quarter. \nGutseriev was in talks to sell a 15 percent stake in the merged company to Media Saturn and use the proceeds to acquire MediaMarktSaturn’s Russian business, which operates under the MediaMarkt brand, a source at a Russian state bank said. \nM.video declined to comment, while Eldorado was not immediately available for comment and Safmar declined immediate comment. Ceconomy, which split last year from German retail conglomerate Metro, was not available for comment. \nOne person close to Ceconomy said it has been working on finding a solution for its Russian business, which is subscale and will likely come under more pressure as a result of the M.video-Eldorado deal. \nCeconomy usually aims for complete control of a business, so any deal involving a minority would likely only be an intermediary step, the person said, adding that a sale to the Russian group may throw up antitrust issues. \nCeconomy’s sales in Russia fell by 7 percent to 526 million euros ($649 million) in the 2016/17 financial year as it closed five stores to bring the total to 57.
