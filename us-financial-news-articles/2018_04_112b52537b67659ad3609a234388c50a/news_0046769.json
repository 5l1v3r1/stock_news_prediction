Most seem convinced fundamentals will drive prices higher and eventually allow them to liquidate their long positions into a rising rather than a falling market. \nThe calculation could be right, but there are still reasons to be concerned by the sheer concentration of long positions. \nRising oil prices are filtering through into more drilling activity in the United States, which will support even faster growth in production by the end of 2018. \nThe number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has risen in each of the last three weeks, in response to rising prices, after hitting a plateau during the previous seven weeks. \nWith oil prices now above the long-term average, oil consumption is no longer getting a boost from low prices and is increasingly reliant on strong economic growth around the world. \nBut the economic outlook is clouded by rising trade tensions, as well as late-cycle increases in interest rates in the United States and the other major economies. \nHedge fund managers have gambled everything on a goldilocks scenario in which oil prices rise without damaging demand or spurring too much shale drilling. \nThey also need the global economic expansion to continue without interruption throughout the rest of 2018 and 2019 to continue boosting oil consumption at record rates. \nPerhaps this Panglossian scenario will come to pass, but if it does not, lopsided hedge fund positioning could be setting the oil market up for some sharp price movements ahead. \nRelated columns: \n“Hedge funds build record bullish position in Brent”, Reuters, April 16 \n“Hedge fund oil bulls play down macro risks”, Reuters, April 3 \n“Oil market ‘locked’, almost all funds expect further price rises”, Reuters, March 27 Editing by Edmund Blair", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T17:45:35.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
