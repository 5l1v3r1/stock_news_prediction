Kasbar, chairman and chief executive officer of World Fuel Services Corporation. “While we are pleased with our first quarter results, we remain focused on increasing levels of profitability and returns by continuing to sharpen our portfolio and drive greater cost efficiencies.”\nFor the first quarter, the company’s aviation segment generated gross profit of $110.0 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by our government-related business and increased volume and profitability in our international fueling operations. The company’s marine segment generated gross profit of $31.2 million a decrease of 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by the continued challenges in the maritime industry and our strategy to reduce business in certain regions where we were not generating satisfactory returns on capital. The company’s land segment generated gross profit of $102.2 million, up 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by the solid seasonal performance in our land business in the United Kingdom.\n“Our continued cost savings initiatives contributed to year-over-year growth in adjusted operating income in all three operating segments in the first quarter,” said Ira M. Birns, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “We believe that our commitment to a higher standard of operational excellence will allow us to drive further efficiencies in our business model and result in greater operating leverage in the next 12 to 24 months, accelerating EBITDA growth.”\nLiquidity and Capital\nCash flow used in operating activities was $229 million for the first quarter 2018, primarily due to higher fuel prices combined with seasonal and strategic investments in inventory of $108 million, as well as approximately $121 million resulting from a newly adopted statement of cash flows accounting standard. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio stood at 2.2x at March 31, 2018 up from 1.8x at December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), and net debt (collectively, the “Non-GAAP Measures”). The Non-GAAP measures exclude acquisition-related charges and severance and restructuring charges primarily because we do not believe they are reflective of the Company’s core operating results. We believe that the Non-GAAP Measures, when considered in conjunction with our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, are useful to investors to further aid in evaluating the ongoing financial performance of the Company and to provide greater transparency as supplemental information to our GAAP results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our presentation of the Non-GAAP Measures may not be comparable to the presentation of such metrics by other companies. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing non-GAAP net income attributable to World Fuel Services and available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted average number of shares of common stock, stock units, restricted stock entitled to dividends not subject to forfeiture and vested restricted stock units outstanding during the period and the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if our outstanding potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these Non-GAAP Measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in this press release and on our website.\nInformation Relating to Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release includes forward-looking statements the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our beliefs and expectations with respect to our continued focus on increasing levels of profitability and returns by continuing to sharpen our portfolio and drive greater cost efficiencies, as well as our commitment to a higher standard of operational excellence and our expectations about driving efficiencies, our operating leverage and EBITDA growth.
