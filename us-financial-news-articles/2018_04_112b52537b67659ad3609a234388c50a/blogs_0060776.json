As we know, these stocks are very volatile. And, you think they'll never have a bad day. But when they have a bad day, it could be significant, and you can get all kinds of opportunities.\"\nHis outlook applies to the marquee FANG stocks, which include Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Google [Alphabet] . Meeks owns all of them in his portfolio — with the exception of Netflix, a stock he wished he bought before it went on a tear.\n\"Within FANGs, I actually do like Facebook and Google because they've had their corrections — and corrections even beyond 10 percent. So, what I did recently is I try to buy them on bad news,\" he said.\nOn March 9, Meeks told \"Trading Nation\" a correction in tech space could happen at any time. Since his last appearance, the tech-heavy Nasdaq dipped into correction territory, but year-to-date the index is now up 3 percent.\n\"I would wait until the next controversy. Even though Facebook has posted a great quarter, maybe Google less so, but still pretty robust,\" Meeks said. \"They will have a bad day. They will be down a lot, and you'll have a great opportunity yet again.\"\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey.
