Since December 2015, the Fed has approved six quarter-point hikes for its benchmark interest rate, the most recent being in late March.\nAlong with her warnings about potential overvaluations in markets, Brainard said Fed policy has helped stem the type of excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis of 2008.\nFor instance, she said stock market valuations don't look so bad compared to the still-low level of Treasury yields, and pointed out that lenders appear aware of the danger for property value to reverse.\nShe also said there are few signs that crypotcurrencies would pose a widespread threat to the financial system.\n\"Despite elevated asset valuations, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate in no small part because important financial reforms have encouraged large banking institutions to build strong capital and liquidity buffers,\" Brainard said.\nHowever, she seemed to caution about the push for cutting back on some of the post-crisis financial reforms.\n\"In the wake of the 2007-09 financial crisis and recession, we learned important lessons about the critical necessity of monitoring emerging financial vulnerabilities in a systematic fashion and taking corresponding prudential, macroprudential, and countercyclical policies to build resilience,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T23:41:22.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
