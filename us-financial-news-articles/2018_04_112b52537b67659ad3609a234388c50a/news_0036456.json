KCNA/via Reuters But in late March, Kim made a visit to Beijing, his first known journey abroad since he took power in 2011.\nMAKING HISTORY The visit came amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts by the North, starting a New Year speech in which Kim opened the door to participating in February’s Winter Olympics in South Korea.\nOn April 27, Kim is scheduled to make history when he meets South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a summit just inside South Korean territory on the fortified border that divides the two countries. He will be the first North Korean leader to step on South Korean soil since the 1950s.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he plans to meet Kim in May or early June.\nAmerican officials are still sceptical of Kim’s sudden overtures, with Trump’s pick for secretary of state, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, telling lawmakers last week that North Korea should not expect rewards from talks with the United States until it takes irreversible steps to give up its nuclear weapons.\nSouth Korea and a U.S.-led U.N. force are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce, not a peace treaty.\nSlideshow (2 Images) South Korea’s Munhwa Ilbo newspaper reported on Tuesday that the two sides had been discussing plans for a permanent end to the war at the North-South summit, citing an unidentified South Korean official with knowledge of the matter.\nThe two Koreas may also discuss pulling some of their forces away from the heavily fortified demilitarized zone separating them, the newspaper said.\nReporting by Josh Smith; Additional reporting by Heekyong Yang; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T06:45:13.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
