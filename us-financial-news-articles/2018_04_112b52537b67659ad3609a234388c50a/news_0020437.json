It said it did not expect significant depreciation of the peso currency in the coming months, after it sold over $2 billion in reserves this year to halt the peso’s slide.\n“However, currency intervention is a complement to and not a substitute for monetary policy,” the central bank said, noting that it was “prepared to act by adjusting the monetary policy rate” if inflation does not decline after “transitory impacts” such as regulated price hikes pass.\nEconomists expect consumer prices to rise 20.3 percent in 2018, above the central bank target of 15 percent. Argentina’s government is expected to publish March inflation data on Thursday.
