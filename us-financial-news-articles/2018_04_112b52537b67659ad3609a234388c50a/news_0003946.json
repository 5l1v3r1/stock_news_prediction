(Photo: Amazon.com) CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Big investors are taking a large hit from the share drops in technology leaders over the past week, partly driven by President Trump's tweets. Bank of America Merrill Lynch told its clients that funds had significantly larger stakes in Amazon ( AMZN ) and Netflix (NFLX) compared to benchmark market indexes at the end of last month. Trump has tweeted about Amazon multiple times in recent days. The president criticized the e-commerce retailer over taxes and claimed it has not paid the post office adequately for its delivery services, spurring a plunge in its stock price. Amazon and Netflix shares are down more than 11% over the past week through midday Monday. Both stocks fell more than 4% Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:22:47.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
