North America is next with 17.2 percent, followed by Asia Pacific (7 percent), Sub-Saharan Africa (5.4 percent), Middle East and North Africa (1.8 percent) and South America (1.2 percent), the report said.\nWyelands predicted that exports to the Asia Pacific region are expected to grow at 3 percent a year to 2021 and 0.5 percent annually to South America, until 2021.\nThe report stated that the U.K. economy is highly dependent on trade as it accounts for 58 percent of U.K. gross domestic product (GDP). \"This makes the U.K. economy one of the most open in the Group of 20 (major economies), and more open than China, America and Japan,\" the report noted.\nIn 2016, the U.K. exported goods worth $433.5 billion and imported goods worth $678.1 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T16:03:15.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
