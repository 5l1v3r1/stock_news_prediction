The sanctions have triggered steep falls in the rouble and some Russian stocks. \nSpeaking before Russia’s lower house of parliament, Medvedev said the new sanctions were an attempt to capture global markets for U.S. companies. \n“Measures in response should be well thought-out, not inflict harm to ourselves, and be appropriate. I do not rule out that... we will have to weigh all aspects of our cooperation with the United States,” Medvedev said.
