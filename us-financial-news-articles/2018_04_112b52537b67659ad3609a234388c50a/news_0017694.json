Ambassador Bashar Ja’afari told reporters that two teams of investigators from the global chemical weapons watchdog are due to arrive in Syria on Thursday and Friday to look into the Douma incident. \nMattis also accused Russia of being complicit in Syria’s retention of chemical weapons, despite a 2013 deal requiring Syria to abandon them that Moscow helped broker. \nHe noted that Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, sought to address Syria’s use of chemical weapons by striking that deal — which averted U.S. military action against Syria. \nIn doing so, Obama was “enlisting the Russians, who now, it shows, were complicit in Syria retaining those weapons – Assad retaining them.” \n“And the only reason Assad is still in power is because of the Russians’ regrettable vetoes in the U.N., and the Russian and the Iranian military,” he said.
