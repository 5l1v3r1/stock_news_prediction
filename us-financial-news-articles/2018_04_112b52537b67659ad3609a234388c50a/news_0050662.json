For the past 65 years, the tiny village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone has served as a symbol of the division of the Korean Peninsula into North and South.\nOn Friday, the two sides convened there once again as South Korean President Moon Jae-in, whose parents hailed from the North, hosted North Korea’s third-generation leader, Kim Jong Un, on the South side of Panmunjom, in the first inter-Korean summit in more than a decade .\nHere, a look at the historic site and the countries on either side.\nTour the storied location of the 2018 summit.

The country suffered a crippling famine in the 1990s.\nSouth Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, is deeply integrated into global trade networks. North Korea continues to rely on international aid, due in part to the country’s diplomatic and economic isolation .\nSouth Korea’s economy is an export powerhouse, specializing in products such as semiconductors, smartphones and cars. The majority of North Korea’s exports of coal and other natural resources go to its neighbors, China and Russia.\nSouth and North Korean soldiers stand guard at Panmunjom.

The two sides met in Panmunjom to begin hammering out the terms of a cease-fire. Negotiations took two years, hung up on a number of contentious issues, including the exchange of prisoners of war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:16:16.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
