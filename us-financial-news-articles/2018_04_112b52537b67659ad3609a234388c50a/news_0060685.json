Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas gestures during the Palestinian National Council meeting in Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas is expected to use the four-day Palestinian National Council (PNC) meeting to renew his legitimacy and to install loyalists in powerful positions to begin shaping his legacy.\nAbbas has billed the meeting of the Palestinian National Council (PNC), the de facto parliament of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation, as a chance to establish a united front against Israel and the United States, after President Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nNabil Abu Rdainah, a spokesman for Abbas, said it was “a strong message to the whole world that the Palestinian people are committed to their right to establish their independent state.”\nBut the location, timing and attendance have been criticised from outside the PLO, and from within.\nIslamist groups are boycotting, and question the PLO’s claim to be the “sole legitimate representative” of the Palestinian people.\nThey include Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which defeated Abbas’s western-backed Fatah in parliamentary elections in 2006 and has been locked in rivalry with it since.

REUTERS/Mohamad Torokman\nThey say that by holding the meeting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Abbas is excluding Palestinians who risk being arrested or turned back by Israel if they try to attend.\nThree PLO factions said they would boycott the 700-member assembly, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. It sought a postponement to give more time for reconciliation efforts between Fatah and Hamas, to overcome divisions and ensure broader participation.\nMahdi Abdul-Hadi, a Jerusalem-based analyst, said Abbas seemed intent on driving through his own agenda and replacing enemies with loyalists on the PLO’s powerful Executive Committee, whose members are appointed by the PNC.\n“When people look at these names they understand it is a one-man show. It is Abbas’s agenda,” said Abdul-Hadi.\nPointing out that Abbas’s mandate as president expired in 2010, he said the Palestinian leader appeared to be returning to old institutions to fend off criticism.

The PNC is not delivering an entire generation that views these meetings with a collective yawn,” said Diana Buttu, a Canadian-born former legal adviser to Palestinian peace negotiators, who now lives in Haifa.\n“Abbas may think that this will grant him ‘legitimacy’ but the question remains - legitimacy from whom?”\nIn Ramallah, Ahmed Tibi, an Arab lawmaker in Israel’s parliament, conceded that the PLO needed to improve, but said it remained the “main corpus to solve the issues of the Palestinians.”\nBut outside Ramallah there was widespread scepticism.\nIn Gaza many circulated a message on their phones that poked fun at the ages of PNC members. “Applicants should be 90 years of age and above,” it said. Cynicism was also rife in the West Bank. “We need fresh blood in Palestinian political life,” said Firas Doudein, in Hebron.
