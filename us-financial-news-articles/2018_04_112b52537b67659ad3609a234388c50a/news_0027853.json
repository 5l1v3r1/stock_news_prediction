It also marked the first time in Padres history that their only hit in a game was by a pitcher.\nStratton (1-1) allowed only four baserunners over seven innings and faced only one threat when he issued back-to-back walks with one out in the fifth. He had four strikeouts. The Padres hit only four flies to the outfield.\nLaw retired the six Padres he faced in the eighth and ninth to finish the one-hit shutout. Stratton and Law retired the final 14 Padres in order.\nMeanwhile, the Giants scored three runs in the first with the help of three walks by Mitchell. They added four unearned runs in the top of the sixth against right-hander Colten Brewer, who was making his Major League debut.\nMitchell walked Joe Panik to open the game and the Giants second baseman moved to third on Andrew McCutchen’s one-out single. After Buster Posey drew a walk to load the bases, Panik scored on Evan Longoria’s grounder to short, Longoria just beating the relay to avert an inning-ending double play.\nAfter Brandon Crawford walked to reload the bases, Hunter Pence hit a two-run single.\nMitchell (0-2) allowed three runs on four hits and five walks with two strikeouts in three innings to take the loss.\nThe Giants loaded the bases on singles by Pence and Panik around a walk to Gregor Blanco with two out in the sixth. McCutchen hit a two-out grounder to Padres’ third baseman Christian Villanueva, who threw wildly across the infield for a two-run error. Posey followed with a two-run double.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T13:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:30:44.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
