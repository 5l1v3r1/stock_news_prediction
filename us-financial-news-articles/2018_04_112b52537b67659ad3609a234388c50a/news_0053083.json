REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal\nRevenue advanced to 13.16 billion euros ($15.93 billion), Renault said on Friday, well short of the 13.77 billion expected by analysts, according to an Inquiry Financial poll.\nSales in key growth markets showed a “mixed situation” in the quarter, added the French company.

The overall increase in sales volume contributed 275 million euros to revenue growth, and pricing improvements another 140 million.\nRenault reiterated its 2018 market outlook and earnings guidance.\n($1 = 0.8257 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:35:31.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
