He added, “We are continuing to address costs and margins in a few of our operations to achieve the expected profitability for the Corporation.”\nFirst Quarter Results: (three months ended March 2, 2018 compared with three months ended March 3, 2017)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Sales $27,528,000 $27,172,000 Gross Margin\nGross Margin (%) 4,847,000\n17.6% 6,886,000\n25.3% Operating Earnings (1): 1,561,000\n3,017,000\nNet R&D Investment Foreign Exchange Loss (Gain) Recovery of Investment Tax Credits Amortization of Intangibles 1,150,000\n(26,000)\n(152,000)\n256,000 1,410,000\n161,000\n(141,000)\n281,000 Net Earnings before Tax 333,000 1,306,000 Current Tax Expense Deferred Tax Expense Non-controlling Interests 18,000\n636,000\n(28,000) 17,000\n488,000\n1,000 Net Earnings After Tax ($293,000 $800,000 Earnings per share - basic\n- diluted ($0.01)\n($0.01) $0.04\n$0.03\n(1) Operating Earnings is not a measure recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Management believes that this measure is important to many of the Corporation’s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation’s method of calculating Operating Earnings may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\nBusiness Highlights\nFTG accomplished many goals in the first quarter of 2018 that continue to improve the Corporation and position it for the future, including:\nSigned multimillion dollar contract with FlightSafety for KC-46 simulator cockpit assemblies Shipped first simulator cockpit assemblies from FTG Tianjin to CAE in Montreal Booked and shipped simulator hardware from FTG Tianjin to Rockwell’s simulator operations also in Tianjin China Signed contract amendment with Shanghai Avionics for C919 cockpit product assemblies for the C919 program valued at $4M USD in total.\nFor FTG, overall sales increased by $0.4M or 1.3%, from $27.2M in Q1 2017 to $27.5M in Q1 2018. In Q1 2018, as a result of new funding, some activity previously recognized as cost recovery on deferred development programs is now shown as revenue in accordance with our policy for revenue recognition on a percentage completion basis. As a result, $5.0M in revenue was recognized in Q1 2018 which represents the percentage completed to-date for this activity. In Q1 2018, the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar was $0.06 stronger than Q1 last year and this impacted sales by over $1.0M.\nRevenues from the PhotoEtch acquisition contributed about $1.6M in incremental sales during Q1 2018 compared to $2.0M in Q1 2017 and our target of $1.5M per quarter. The decrease from last year was due to minor fluctuations in demand from various customers. The PhotoEtch related revenues will ramp up significantly in the second half of 2018 as shipments begin on the KC-46 simulator assembly contract. Revenues from Teledyne PCT contributed $3.1M in Q1 2018 compared to $8.0M in Q1 last year and our target of $4M per quarter. Sales in Q1 last year were from the Teledyne PCT facility and were high as customers purchased safety stock ahead of the plant closure. Sales in Q1 2018 were below the target due to some temporary component shortages that delayed shipments late in the quarter from the Chatsworth facility.\nThe Circuits Segment sales were down $1.3M or 8.5% in Q1 2018 versus Q1 2017. Both North America sites were down. Demand dipped briefly in December in Toronto but has been strong after that. In Chatsworth, Q1 started slowly as momentum had been lost due to production issues reported in Q4. Momentum and solid production rates were achieved by the end of Q1, along with normalized scrap rates.\nFor the Aerospace segment, sales in Q1 2018 were $13.4M compared to $11.7M in Q1 2017 resulting in a 14.2% growth rate. Q1 2017 was unusually high due to the production rates in the Teledyne PCT facility to support safety stock demand. Q1 2018 had the unusually high development program revenue recognition of $5M. As noted above, shipments from Aerospace Chatsworth were low in February due to temporary component shortages.\nGross margins in Q1 2018 were $4.8M, or 17.6% compared to $6.9M or 25.3% in Q1 2017. Excluding the impact of the development program, which has a low margin, the margin in Q1 2018 was 21.3%. The drop in gross margin is due partially to the decreased activity revenue this year, offset by reduced operating cost from the closure of the Teledyne PCT facility. As noted at year end, there are activities at three FTG sites underway to improve margins including increased engineering development activities in Aerospace Toronto, reduced scrap at Circuits Chatsworth and reduced transition related costs of outsourcing, expedite fees, travel, and overtime at Aerospace Chatsworth.\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for Q1 2018 was $1.4M, a decrease from $2.2M in Q1 2017.\nThe following table reconciles EBITDA (2) to the net earnings for Q1 2018.\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 Net earnings ($293,000) $800,000 Add: Interest 151,000 123,000 Income taxes\nRecovery of ITCs 654,000\n(152,000) 505,000\n(141,000) Depreciation/Amortization 1,070,000 884,000 EBITDA $1,430,000 $2,171,000\n(2) EBITDA is not a measure recognized under International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). Management believes that this measure is important to many of the Corporation’s shareholders, creditors and other stakeholders. The Corporation’s method of calculating EBITDA may differ from other corporations and accordingly may not be comparable to measures used by other corporations.\nNet loss at FTG in Q1 2018 was $0.3M compared to a net profit of $0.8M in Q1 2017. The loss in Q1 2018 was impacted by a $0.06 strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus the US dollar negatively impacting Canadian operations profitability. Also impacting profitability was lower activity revenue and the temporary operating cost issues noted above. Offsetting this, SG&A and related expenses were $1.0M lower in Q1 2018 compared to Q1 2017 due primarily to the closure of the Teledyne PCT plant, and lower R&D expenses.\nThe Circuits segment net earnings before corporate and interest and other costs was $0.8M in Q1 2018 compared to $2.4M in Q1 2017.\nThe Aerospace net earnings before corporate and interest and other costs was $0.0M in Q1 2018 versus ($0.3M) in Q1 2017.\nCash outflow from operations after investments in capital equipment and deferred development, was ($0.3M) in Q1 2018 compared to cash inflow of $1.0M in Q1 2017. Capital asset additions in Q1 2018 were $0.8M versus $0.9M in Q1 2017. Accounts receivable increased $1.1M in the quarter. Inventories increased $1.1M. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $2.2M. These were offset by an increase of $3.4M in customer deposits.\nAs at March 2, 2018, the Corporation’s net working capital was $25.7M, an increase of $1.4M over November 30, 2017.\nThe Corporation will host a live conference call on Thursday April 12, 2018 at 8:30 am (EDT) to discuss the results of the first quarter of 2018.\nAnyone wishing to participate in the call should dial 647-427-2311 or 1-866-521-4909 and identify that you are calling to participate in the FTG conference call.
