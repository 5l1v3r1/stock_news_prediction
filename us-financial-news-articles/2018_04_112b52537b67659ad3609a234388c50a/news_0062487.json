Angels reliever Jim Johnson, who entered the game earlier in the inning to replace Heaney, gave up a deep fly ball to Neil Walker that appeared would leave the yard for a three-run home run.\nBut right fielder Kole Calhoun made a home run-saving catch, then doubled up Giancarlo Stanton at second for an inning-ending double play. However, Gregorius, tagging from third, crossed home plate before the out was recorded at second, and the Yankees had a 2-1 lead.\nAndrelton Simmons came up with a clutch hit in the seventh, his two-out, two-run triple to right field scoring Mike Trout and Albert Pujols to put the Angels up 3-2.\nSeverino finished the inning but was done after seven, giving up three runs on five hits and one walk, striking out eight.\nHeaney gave up two runs (one earned) on five hits and one walk, striking out nine in five-plus innings.\nCam Bedrosian pitched scoreless seventh and Justin Anderson a scoreless eighth for the Angels, setting up Keynan Middleton for the ninth.\nMiddleton, who entered the game 6-for-6 in save opportunities, walked Gary Sanchez to start the inning, then struck out Walker for the first out. Miguel Andujar followed with a double into the left field corner, Sanchez being held at third.\nAfter an intentional walk to Gleyber Torres, pinch hitter Brett Gardner hit a sacrifice fly to left field, scoring Sanchez to tie the game at 3.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T17:45:57.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
