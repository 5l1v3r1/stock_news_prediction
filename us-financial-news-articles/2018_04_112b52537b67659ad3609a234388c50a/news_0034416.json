The action generally prohibits U.S. citizens from dealing with Barakat or his group.\nThe designation of the group as a transnational criminal organization “is an important step toward disrupting Barakat’s prolific human smuggling operations in Syria and around the world,” Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.\nBarakat and his gang operate a global network of traffickers that smuggle foreign nationals to the United States for an average price of about $20,000, the Treasury said in a statement.\nTrafficked individuals are provided with fraudulent or counterfeit documents, often including passports from European or other countries, the Treasury said. They often travel across Lebanon, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Latin American countries before arriving at the Southwest U.S. border, it said.\nReporting by David Alexander; editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T20:23:36.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
