Baird in Milwaukee. \"Earnings are coming up and expectations are high.\"\nStrong quarterly results from BlackRock Inc and Delta Air Lines Inc added to the sanguine mood.\nDelta topped profit estimates, sending its shares 2.9 percent higher and boosting other airline stocks.\nBlackRock gained 1.5 percent after the asset manager's quarterly profit rose more than expected.\nThe earnings season begins in earnest on Friday with reports from JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co.\nAnalysts expect quarterly profit for S&P 500 companies to rise 18.4 percent from a year ago, in what would be the biggest gain in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n\"People are looking forward to earnings season,\" said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. \"Market participants are not wanting to miss out if (earnings are) as good as the forecasts say they will be.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 293.6 points, or 1.21 percent, to 24,483.05, the S&P 500 gained 21.8 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,663.99, and the Nasdaq Composite added 71.22 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,140.25.\nInvestor sentiment was also boosted by the weekly U.S. initial jobless claims report, which pointed to sustained labor market strength.\nFacebook Inc was a notable laggard among technology stocks, falling 1.5 percent following a 5.3 percent gain over the past two days when Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress on the social network's data security.\nBed Bath & Beyond Inc shares dived 20.0 percent after the company's full-year profit forecast missed estimates.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 1.20-to-1 ratio and on the Nasdaq, for a 1.84-to-1 ratio.\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.12 billion shares, compared to the 7.27 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
