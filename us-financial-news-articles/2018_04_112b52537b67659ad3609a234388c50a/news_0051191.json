Their Olympic teams march together under a common flag at February’s winter games in South Korea.\nAs the two men started their meeting in the Peace House on the southern side of the border, both seemed aware of the gravity of the occasion.\n“The whole world is watching” with high expectations, Moon said. “We have a lot on our shoulders.”\nHe said Kim’s crossing of the border had transformed Panmunjom into a “sign of peace, not a sign of division”.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un gesture after signing agreements during the inter-Korean summit at the truce village of Panmunjom, in this still frame taken from video, South Korea April 27, 2018. Host Broadcaster via REUTERS TV Kim responded with equal optimism.\n“With determination, we will be heading toward a better place to make up for the lost 11 years,” he said, referring to the last summit.\nTheir two-hour morning meeting was marked with laughter and some banter, as well as more serious discussion, behind closed doors, officials said.\n‘HIGH HOPES’ At one point, Kim said he heard Moon was “always waking up early” because of North Korea’s missile tests - which usually occurred in the morning - and promised not to interrupt his sleep anymore, presidential spokesman Yoon Young-chan told reporters.\nKim mentioned the contentious issue of North Korean defectors - who are routinely denounced in North Korean media as “human scum” - and even referred to the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, which North Korean forces shelled in 2010, killing four people.\n“Coming here, I saw people are having high hopes for the summits – including ... defectors and residents of Yeonpyeong Island – those who used to worry about North Korea’s missiles coming to them at any time,” Kim said, according to Yoon.\nKim said he had heard good things about a South Korean high-speed train built for the Winter Olympics, and expressed concern that North Korea’s traffic system would “cause inconvenience” should Moon visit.\nThe two men went back to their separate sides for lunch, Kim driven in a black limousine and escorted by a dozen bodyguards in dark suits and ties jogging alongside the vehicle.\nIn the afternoon, they planted a memorial tree and watered it with water from rivers in the South and North, before walking into a small glen along the border and across the blue footbridge for their private tete-a-tete.\nAfterwards, they strolled back to the Peace House, seemingly engrossed in conversation with no officials nearby.\nWith a joint declaration and a bear hug, Kim and Moon sealed their talks to end the Korean War within the year and commit to complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula - without offering specifics.\nWrapping up the day at an evening banquet with thumping live music, Kim made a toast with a glass of traditional Korean liquor.\n“Today’s meeting and accomplishment is just the beginning and nothing more than a tip of the iceberg compared to what we have to do ahead,” he said.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “Let’s end the history of confrontations and mistrust between the North and the South, hold hands together and boldly move forward for the future of our people.”\nReporting by Christine Kim, Josh Smith, Heekyong Yang and Inter-Korean Summit Press Corps.
