It currently stands at 4.1 percent, a 17-year low.\nSeveral Fed policymakers have pushed for the central bank to begin a review of its inflation framework this year, but Chairman Jerome Powell has not backed one when asked.\nBullard noted that while any review would likely reaffirm the current framework of having a 2 percent inflation target, he supported holding such an exercise every five years or so.\n\"I don't know what the chairman is going to do on this issue. I do think it is best practice to have a regular review process as the Bank of Canada does,\" he said. \"The reason I think it's best practice is that even though inflation targeting has become standard, the world also changes over time and it's not always clear that's going to be the best policy forever.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T19:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T00:46:31.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
