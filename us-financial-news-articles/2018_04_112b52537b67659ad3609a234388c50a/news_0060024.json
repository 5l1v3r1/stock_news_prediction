It would see the U.K. debt ratio rise to 92 percent (of gross domestic product),\" she said.\nIn comparison, the International Monetary Fund's April forecast estimated that U.K. public debt as a percentage of GDP will fall below 84 percent in 2022.\nJames predicted that given a \"hard Brexit\" British consumers would feel the pinch most with disposable income shrinking and unemployment rising to around 5.8 percent by 2022.\nThe forecast is based on the harshest of exits and assumes that the U.K. leaves Europe with no trade deal, an exit from both the single market and customs union and no \"passporting rights.\" These passporting rights remove regulatory barriers to sell services to EU countries and are seen as particularly crucial to the banking industry.\nThe DBRS model also assumed a 15 percent depreciation in the value of sterling and a reversal of the interest rate rises that capital markets currently have factored in.\nJames said the United Kingdom's triple-A sovereign rating remained well placed for now and that the country's debt profile, with its unusually long average repayment terms, should allow the country to ride out any storm.\n\"The U.K. has average repayment terms of around 15 years. That means that rollover risks from any temporary shocks are greatly reduced,\" she said.\nJames added that following an average shock the U.K. tends to recover quickly, regaining its poise within five economic quarters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T16:14:27.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
