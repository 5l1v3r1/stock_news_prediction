(NYSE: OAKS) (\"Five Oaks\" or the \"Company\") announced today that it acquired 100% of the equity interests of Hunt CMT Equity LLC (the \"Transaction\") from Hunt Mortgage Group for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $68 million. Assets of Hunt CMT Equity LLC include the junior retained notes and preferred shares of a commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation (\"CLO\"), a licensed commercial mortgage lender and eight (8) loan participations.\nThe Transaction is part of the Company's previously announced reallocation of capital into new investment opportunities in the commercial real estate mortgage space. The Company believes that it is a significant positive step in transitioning its strategy to include transitional commercial mortgage loans which are expected to be positive to stockholder returns while lowering overall leverage. The Company funded the Transaction through sales of residential mortgage-backed securities and available cash.\nThe Transaction was, in accordance with the Company's related party transactions policies and procedures, unanimously approved by the Company's audit committee, which is comprised of all of the independent directors of the board. In addition, the Company obtained independent third-party valuation support for the Transaction.\nThe assets of the CLO consist of performing transitional floating rate commercial mortgage loans with a portfolio balance of $346.3 million as of March 31, 2018, collateralized by a diverse mix of property types, including multifamily, retail, office, mixed-use, industrial and student housing. The securitization pool is financed by $290.7 million of investment-grade notes that bear a weighted-average cost of 138 basis points over one-month LIBOR, excluding fees and transaction costs. The CLO has a replenishment period that allows principal proceeds from repayments of the portfolio assets to be reinvested in qualifying replacement assets, subject to certain conditions. As of March 31, 2018, the CLO had $2.9 million of cash available for reinvestment.\nJames Flynn, the CEO of Five Oaks, stated, \"This transaction provides the Company with attractive floating rate investments which we anticipate will produce higher returns for our investors while decreasing our overall leverage. The CLO securitization acquired in the Transaction provides the Company with competitive match term financing with significant reinvestment capabilities. In addition, the inclusion of a licensed commercial mortgage originator will support the Company's continued growth in this space.\"\nChris Hunt, Chairman of Five Oaks, stated, \"This transaction provides an important step towards the Company's long term transition to a commercial mortgage focused strategy. The CLO assets were all originated by an affiliate of our manager and are indicative of the quality of assets we envision the Company investing in moving forward.\"\nMichael Larsen, the President of Five Oaks, stated, \"This Transaction is the first of what we anticipate to be a series of similar ongoing investments by the Company in the commercial mortgage space. As this transaction shows, Hunt provides the Company with access to attractive investments and financing that well position the Company as it focuses on its new strategy. We are pleased to be able to begin the process of reallocating the Company's capital and executing transactions in line with the Company's new strategic direction.\"\nDentons US LLP served as Five Oaks' legal advisors.
