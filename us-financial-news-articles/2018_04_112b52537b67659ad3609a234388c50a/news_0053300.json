The rest will be used to pay short term debt owed to Brazilian lenders.\nAndrade, one of the conglomerates ensnared in Brazilâ€™s largest ever corruption probe, is offering to Pimco as loan collateral shares in tollroad company CCR SA, in which it has a 14.9 percent stake.\nAndrade and Pimco did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
