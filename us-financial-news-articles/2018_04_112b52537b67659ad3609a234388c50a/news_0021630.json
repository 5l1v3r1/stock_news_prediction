The ACCC’s final report is due on June 30.\nThe ACCC also is expected to examine recent claims made by the Productivity Commission, the government’s chief economic advisor, that policy interventions by the banking regulator to curb asset bubbles had delivered record profits for the banks at the expense of competition.\nIn February, the Productivity Commission also recommended the ACCC should be a member of the Council of Financial Regulators, which is chaired by the central bank and holds the main responsibility of financial system oversight, to act as “the competition champion”.\nAustralia’s big four banks reported a combined net profit of A$31.5 billion ($24.5 billion) in the 2017 fiscal year, up 6.4 percent on a year ago, according to KPMG.\n$1 = 1.2882 Australian dollars Reporting by Paulina Duran in SYDNEY; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T06:20:24.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
