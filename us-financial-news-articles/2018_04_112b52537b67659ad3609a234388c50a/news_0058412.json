The company reported a smaller-than-expected loss on Thursday as its U.S. clients deployed more of the company’s rigs to take advantage of rising oil prices.\n* All of the index’s 10 main groups ended higher, with energy advancing 0.5 percent as oil prices rose.\n* U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled 0.2 percent higher at $68.19 a barrel, supported by the risk of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, plunging Venezuelan output and robust global demand.\n* The largest decliner on the index was Husky Energy, down 8.1 percent. The refinery explosion injured at least 10 people, sent smoke billowing into the sky and shook a building a mile away, officials at hospitals and the fire department said, on the same day that the company reported financial results.\n* The TSX posted six new 52-week highs and three new lows.
