(“WMI”). As such, the results of WMI are excluded from continuing operations and are reported as discontinued operations.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nThe Company entered fiscal 2018 with over $100 million of backlog from continuing operations. As such, the Company believes its revenue results in fiscal 2018 will exceed the $49,452,000 revenues it achieved in fiscal 2017 (excluding its AMK unit that was sold at the end of January 2017).\nThe Company continues to take steps to improve its liquidity and operations and targeted to achieve breakeven Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the first quarter of 2018 with a goal to achieve quarterly Adjusted EBITDA thereafter in the range of $2,500,000 to $3,000,000 within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s revenue and Adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2018 excludes the operations of WMI.\nFiscal 2017 Highlights From Continuing Operations\nConsolidated net sales were $49,869,000 in 2017, a slight decrease of 2.8% as compared to prior year’s results of $51,321,000. Excluding sales related to AMK, which was sold in 2017, consolidated net sales would have been $49,452,000 in 2017 or an increase of 5.6% as compared to $46,810,000 in fiscal 2016.\nConsolidated gross profit from operations was $4,867,000 which represents an increase of $598,000 as compared to fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily the result of the adoption of cost reduction and productivity initiatives that were successfully implemented.\nOperating expenses (excluding goodwill impairment charges) were $11,430,000 or a decrease of 20.6% as compared to $14,404,000 in fiscal 2016. The Company’s efforts to reduce its cost structure will continue.\nInterest and financing costs were $3,378,000 iniscal 2018 as compared to $2,500,000 in 2016.\nIncome tax benefits of $197,000 were recorded in fiscal 2017 as compared to an expense of $2,101,000 in fiscal 2016.\nAs disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017 that has been filed with the SEC, the Company recorded total consolidated non-cash charges of $19,172,000 were recorded in 2017 including: (i) $6,195,000 for goodwill impairment, (ii) $2,723,000 of depreciation expense, (iii) loss related to assets held for sale of $1,563,000, (iv) impairment of intangibles assets of $1,085,000, (v) $564,000 of amortization of stock-based compensation expense, and (iv) $673,000 of amortization of intangible expense. Such amounts compare to similar total consolidated non-cash charges of $8,219,000 in 2016.\nNet loss from continuing operations, net of tax was $15,873,000. Excluding the impairment charge of goodwill, our net loss, net of tax, from continuing operations, would have approximated $9,678,000 or a decrease of 34.9% from the $14,867,000 recorded in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA (Loss) from continuing operating operations, as shown in the table below, was only ($15,000) in 2017. Such amount represents a significant improvement from the Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) of ($5,506,000) in 2016 and reflects the successful steps the Company has taken on its path to achieve profitability. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which is reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and is more fully defined in the below table.\nLiquidity Position\nTotal notes payable and capital lease obligations (the large majority of which is current) was $26,841,000 as of December 31, 2017. This amount reflects a significant reduction of $10,129,000 from December 31, 2016 and reflects steps during fiscal 2017 to improve the company’s balance sheet.\nAs disclosed in its Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 18, 2018, the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017, contained a going concern explanatory paragraph in the audit opinion.\nNew management remains focused on meeting customer needs, improving liquidity and achieving profitability. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, management’s efforts has resulted in the execution an agreement to sell WMI for a purchase price of $9.0 million and currently expects 1st quarter 2018 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be breakeven.\nAdditional information about the Company can be found in its filings with the SEC.\nInvestor Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Monday April 23rd at 4:00PM EST.\nConference Toll-Free Number – 1- 866-564-7431\nConference ID – 3697640\nPasscode – 540866\nABOUT AIR INDUSTRIES GROUP\nAir Industries Group (AIRI) is an integrated manufacturer of precision equipment assemblies and components for leading aerospace and defense prime contractors.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain matters discussed in this press release are 'forward-looking statements' intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, the Company's statements regarding trends in the marketplace, future revenues, earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, the ability to realize firm backlog and projected backlog, cost cutting measures, potential future results and acquisitions, are examples of such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the timing of projects due to variability in size, scope and duration, the inherent discrepancy in actual results from estimates, projections and forecasts made by management, regulatory delays, changes in government funding and budgets, and other factors, including general economic conditions, not within the Company's control. The factors discussed herein and expressed from time to time in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such statements. The forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this press release and the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC, as a supplemental profitability measure because management finds it useful to understand and evaluate results, excluding the impact of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges, stock based compensation expenses, and nonrecurring expenses and outlays, prior to consideration of the impact of other potential sources and uses of cash, such as working capital items. This calculation may differ in method of calculation from similarly titled measures used by other companies and may be different than the EBITDA calculation used by our lenders for purposes of determining compliance with our financial covenants. This Non-GAAP measure may have limitations when understanding performance as it excludes the financial impact of transactions such as interest expense necessary to conduct the Company’s business and therefore are not intended to be an alternative to financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company has not quantitatively reconciled its forward looking Adjusted EBITDA target to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because such items such as amortization of stock-based compensation and interest expense, which are specific items that impact these measures, have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control, or cannot be predicted. For example, quantification of stock-based compensation is not possible as it requires inputs such as future grants and stock prices which are not currently ascertainable.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Fiscal 2017 Fiscal 2016 Consolidated Net loss $ (22,551,000 ) $ (15,623,000 ) Loss from Discontinued Operations 6,678,000 756,000 (Benefit from) Provision for Income Taxes (197,000 ) 2,101,000 Interest and financing costs 3,378,000 2,500,000 Amortization of stock-based compensation - employees 332,000 167,000 Amortization of stock-based compensation - directors 232,000 - Amortization of intangibles 673,000 1,279,000 Impairment of intangible assets - discontinued operations 1,085,000 Loss related to assets held for sale - discontinued operations 1,563,000 - Loss related to assets held for sale - 5,000 Deferred (gain) on sale of real estate (38,000 ) (38,000 ) (Gain) on sale of subsidiary (200,000 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt 112,000 Goodwill Impairment 6,195,000 - Depreciation of property and equipment 2,723,000 3,347,000 Adjusted EBITDA - From Continuing Operations $ (15,000 ) $ (5,506,000 )\nContact Information\nAir Industries Group\n631.881.4913\nir@airindustriesgroup.com\nSource:Air Industries Group, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8af03c8b-242c-41b0-b6a9-0beecab5f9e1"], "published": "2018-04-20T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T01:22:12.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
