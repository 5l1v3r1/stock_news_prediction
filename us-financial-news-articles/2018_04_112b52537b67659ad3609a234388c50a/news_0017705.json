It did not include their price, but similar facilities in Israel have cost about $400 million. \nIt will also expand the country’s water grid, cut back on pumping from natural springs to rehabilitate rivers that have dried up, and possibly even pump large amounts of water into the ailing Sea of Galilee, technically a lake near the border with Syria that is Israel’s main freshwater source. \nIn the Middle East, one of the regions most vulnerable to climate change, water is also the subject of wider tensions. Intense pressure on already scarce water resources could lead to an increase in migration and the risk of conflict, the World Bank has warned. \nSteinitz said he will bring the plan to the government for approval in the coming weeks.
