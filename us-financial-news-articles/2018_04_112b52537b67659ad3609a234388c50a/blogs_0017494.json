Gentner & Associates in Buffalo, New York.\nThis year, taxes are due April 17 — Tuesday. While organizing your receipts before handing them off is helpful, the advice from pros shows the importance of making tax planning a year-round practice instead of a last-minute scrambled effort.\nHere are some of the most agreed-upon strategies among tax pros for getting the most bang for your buck out of your tax advisor, now and year-round.\nGet organized Beyond saving receipts for expenses that could be tax-deductible (i.e., charitable contributions, business expenses) and keeping them organized throughout the year, there are other steps that lend themselves to better tax planning. In the survey, the top three ways identified by respondents to stay organized were:\nUse separate bank accounts for personal and business funds (83 percent). Keep your receipts in case your return is examined (81 percent). Use a mileage log or smartphone app to record business miles driven (75 percent). show chapters Here’s what to do if you can’t pay your tax bill on time 8:49 AM ET Mon, 9 April 2018 | 01:16 Additionally, ask your tax advisor for a thorough checklist of items or situations that could have tax implications. For instance, Gentner said, some taxpayers don't realize that renting out their vacation home could result in tax deductions. Others might think income from a side gig is not taxable.\nYou also can ask your tax preparer in advance of the meeting for a list of exactly what documents and information you should bring so that your tax return can be prepared without a hitch.\nCommunication While taxes might not be in the forefront of your mind when you're not facing a filing deadline, it's important to keep your tax advisor in the loop in certain situations. When you have a major life change — i.e., divorce, job change, birth of a child, house purchase — it's worth sharing the information.\nFor instance, if the event would affect your tax burden (for better or worse), your preparer might have suggestions for changes to make to your W-4, which dictates how much tax gets withheld from your paycheck.\nIt's also important to let your tax advisor know if you hear from the IRS about your tax return. And the sooner the better — the longer you ignore the issue, the more it could cost you in penalties and fees if you owe additional tax.\nYet don't act so quickly that you pay the stated amount due without making sure it's accurate.\n\"If you just pay what the IRS says you owe, you could be overpaying,\" Gentner said. \"It isn't always as severe as you think it is.\"\nMore from Your Money, Your Future:\nGet your taxes done for free, even as deadline approaches\nDon't overlook the expanded tax deduction for medical expenses\nThese 5 last-minute tax dodges could cost you thousands", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T15:50:27.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
