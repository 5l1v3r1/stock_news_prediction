Related Coverage WPP's Read says no timetable on reviewing the group\nOrganic net sales slipped only 0.1 percent — compared with a 1 to 1.5 percent drop that analysts had forecast.\nBut WPP, which provides advertising, data and market research to the likes of Ford, Unilever and Vodafone through its 200,000 staff in 112 countries, is still trailing peers Omnicom ( OMC.N ), Publicis ( PUBP.PA ) and IPG ( IPG.N ).\nRead, the joint chief operating officer, said he did not underestimate the challenges ahead.\n“We are not complacent about what we need to do and we recognise that we need to get the top-line growing more quickly,” Read told Reuters in an interview.\n“There are structural shifts in the industry and we need to have more of a structural response, (but) we are an industry in structural change, not structural decline.” CHANGING TIMES\nWPP was particularly hit by the lower spending from consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G, the trend of some clients to create marketing in house and by the upheaval sparked by the growth of Google and Facebook who can help clients to cut out the middle-man of the advertising groups.\nWPP said in March it did not expect to grow in 2018 and it reiterated that on Monday. Slideshow (2 Images)\nRead said he had spoken to the group’s top 20 clients since Sorrell’s departure and had been reassured that they were not looking to ditch the British company.\nHe said however that clients wanted a more integrated offering from WPP after years of dealing with its multiple agencies. Recent events such as a Facebook data scandal and the presence of ads next to extremist online content showed the importance of an independent advertising voice, he added.\n“Clients need an independent source of advice in how to navigate this new digital environment,” he said.\nScott said the group would look to dispose some minority assets with funds raised going towards the faster growing parts of the business, such as data, technology and digital services.\nSigns that the group is moving ahead with its strategy and better-than-expected trading in China and Brazil put the shares on course for their best single gain ever and mean the stock has regained the losses it incurred when Sorrell stepped down. HARD TO REPLACE\nThe 73-year-old Sorrell, who built the group from a two-man outfit in 1985 to dominate the industry, remains a hard act to follow however and Chairman Quarta faced questions over his handling of the April 14 departure from analysts.\nWPP did not give any details of the allegation against Sorrell who denied the charges.\nQuarta said on Monday that Sorrell had quit after the investigation had concluded but before the board had considered its implications.\n“The matter...was really what we consider to be a matter of privacy and therefore is a matter for Martin and hence the reason why we did not disclose,” he said.\nAnalysts spoken to by Reuters said the team of Read and Scott, backed by Quarta, finance director Paul Richardson and transformation officer Lindsay Pattison, had presented a joined up strategy while the improved results will boost sentiment.\nLiberum media analyst Ian Whittaker said the executive team had sought to explain the restructuring already done while stating that the more bearish suggestions of industry decline were exaggerated.\n“There is nothing that suggests WPP is significantly behind the curve relative to other agencies,” he said.
