Mr. Cohen’s lawyers are opposing the government’s use of a “filter team” of prosecutors who are walled off from the investigation to review the seized materials for privileged documents.\nThe motion prompted prosecutors to stop their review of the evidence. Prosecutors accused Mr. Cohen’s team of filing the motion as a delay tactic.\nThe dispute over who should be able to first review the seized materials was at the heart of three hearings Friday in Manhattan federal court.\nU.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ordered Mr. Cohen’s legal team to produce by Monday morning a list of both his clients and his own lawyers with whom he has attorney-client privilege. She ordered them to substantiate through retainers or other proof that the individuals are, in fact, Mr. Cohen’s clients.\nJudge Wood also ordered Mr. Cohen himself to show up for a separate hearing Monday that will specifically discuss privileged documents pertaining to Mr. Trump.\nAccording to the government’s filing, Mr. Cohen, who has described himself as Mr. Trump’s “fix-it guy,” told at least one witness that Mr. Trump is his only client.\nTodd Harrison, a lawyer for Mr. Cohen from McDermott Will & Emery, estimated “thousands” of privileged documents were among the seized materials.\nThe government filing said prosecutors have obtained search warrants on multiple email accounts maintained by Mr. Cohen, which showed Mr. Cohen is “performing little to no legal work” and “zero emails” that were exchanged with Mr. Trump. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has reason to believe Mr. Cohen possesses a “low volume” of privileged documents, the filing said.\nAt a hearing Friday morning, Joanna Hendon, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said Mr. Trump “has an acute interest in these proceedings and in the manner in which these materials are reviewed.”\n“He is the president of the United States. Ultimately…this is of most concern to him,” Ms. Hendon said regarding potentially privileged materials.\nAfter the raids on Mr. Cohen, Mr. Trump tweeted that “attorney-client privilege is dead” and called the search “A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!”\nThomas McKay, a prosecutor in the case, said Friday that Mr. Trump’s “attorney-client privilege is no stronger than any other person who seeks legal advice.”\nTrump Organization lawyers told the government that “each and every communication” between Mr. Cohen and any Trump Organization employees is protected by privilege, according to prosecutors, who called the claim “overbroad.”\nSome of the seized material relates to a $130,000 payment made by Mr. Cohen just before the 2016 election to Stephanie Clifford, a former adult-film star known professionally as Stormy Daniels, in order to muzzle what she says was a past sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.\nMr. Cohen and White House representatives have denied any sexual encounter took place between Mr. Trump and Ms. Clifford. In their filing, prosecutors used Mr. Trump’s public denial last week of any knowledge that Mr. Cohen paid Ms. Clifford to argue there is reason to doubt that communications by Mr. Cohen with Mr. Trump regarding such payments would be privileged.\nMichael Avenatti, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, was present at Friday’s hearings and told the judge he has reason to believe the seized materials are relevant to Ms. Clifford.\nWrite to Nicole Hong at nicole.hong@wsj.com and Erica Orden at erica.orden@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-14T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T03:00:37.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
