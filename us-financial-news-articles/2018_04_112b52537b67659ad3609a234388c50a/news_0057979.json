Beijing aims to raise the country’s tourism market revenue to 7 trillion yuan by 2020, from 5.3 trillion yuan last year.\nLocated along Haitang Bay, a 22-kilometre strip of white, sandy beaches, Atlantis Sanya was inspired by Dubai’s Atlantis, The Palm, according to Fosun. The integrated resort offers hotel suites with views of underwater marine life, as well as a water park and a shopping mall.
