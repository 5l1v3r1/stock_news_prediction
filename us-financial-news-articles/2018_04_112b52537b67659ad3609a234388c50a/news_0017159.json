MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.27 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.54 percent. \nOil markets rose sharply on hopes that the trade dispute may be resolved without greater damage to the global economy. \n“This has been another huge day,” said Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures in Chicago. “There’s soothing trade war fears, geopolitics, and a weaker dollar at play.” \nU.S. crude CLc1 rose 3.66 percent to $65.74 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $71.22, up 3.74 percent on the day.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nXi’s comments also lifted the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen. \n“The main driver was the speech by China’s President overnight that helped to calm some concerns about a looming trade war,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. \nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.38 percent versus the greenback at 107.19 per dollar, while Sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.4181, up 0.37 percent on the day. \nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.26 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.31 percent to $1.2357. \nBenchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.786 percent late on Monday. \nThe 30-year bond US30YT=RR last /32 in price to yield 3.0174 percent, from 3.017 percent late on Monday. RUSSIA FALLS FURTHER \nRussian assets extended Monday’s slide as investors digested the new round of U.S. sanctions targeting the country’s tycoons. The rouble plunged 3.9 percent against the dollar and touched 63.925 per dollar, its lowest since late 2016. \nStocks in Moscow calculated in U.S. dollars .IRTS fell as much as 4.8 percent after dropping more than 11 percent on Monday, but shaved most of Tuesday's loss to end down 0.4 percent. \nShares of Rusal, the aluminium giant highlighted prominently in the sanctions alongside its boss Oleg Deripaska, fell a further 8.7 percent in Hong Kong ( 0486.HK ) after slumping 50 percent on Monday.
