She said she was declining an offer of assistance from the Russian embassy.\nThere are several variants of Novichok, a binary weapon containing two less toxic chemicals that when mixed react to produce a poison several times more lethal than sarin or VX.\nRussia's ambassador to Britain, Alexander Yakovenko, has identified the alleged poison as Novichok A-234, derived from an earlier version known as A-232.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T14:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T15:09:45.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
