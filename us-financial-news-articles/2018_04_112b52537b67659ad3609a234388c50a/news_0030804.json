REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo Canadian light oil, which is easier to extract and refine, is cheaper to produce than northern Alberta’s oil sands crude, but is not as fast-growing as the booming Permian shale play.\nSpartan Energy, which has about 480,000 acres of light oil producing assets in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, is expected to have 23,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boed this year.\nCalgary, Alberta-based Vermilion had forecast 2018 output of 75,000 - 77,500 boed.\nVermilion Energy’s shares were trading down nearly 3 percent, while Spartan Energy’s shares were flat.\nVermilion said the deal will add to its production, fund flows from operations and reserves.​\nVermilion also has operations in Europe and Australia. It entered southeast Saskatchewan, where most of Spartan’s assets are located, when it bought Elkhorn Resources in 2014.\nEarlier this year, Vermilion said it would buy a privately held producer in the same region for C$90.8 million​.\nAs part of the Spartan deal, Vermilion will offer C$1.23 billion of its own shares and take on C$175 million of Spartan’s debt.\nSpartan shareholders will get 0.1476 of a Vermilion share for each share they own, Vermilion said in a statement.\nReporting by John Benny in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva and Supriya Kurane\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T15:35:24.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
