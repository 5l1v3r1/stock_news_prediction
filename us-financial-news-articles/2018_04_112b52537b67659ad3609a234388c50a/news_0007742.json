The government has rejected the allegations.\nThe violence has raised doubts about whether Mali will be able to hold credible elections in less than three months’ time.\nTwo Chadian peacekeepers were killed on Thursday and at least 10 others were wounded when a U.N. camp came under mortar fire in the northern Kidal region, the country’s most volatile.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said such acts “only reinforce the commitment of the United Nations to support the people and the Government of Mali in their quest for peace”.\nOn Friday evening, a peacekeeper was killed when two armed men in the northern city of Gao opened fire on his vehicle, the U.N. force said in a statement.\nUnidentified gunmen killed one person and wounded at least two others last Wednesday in an attack on a hotel in the central town of Bandiagara regularly frequented by U.N. staff and humanitarian agency workers.\nSome 65 people have been killed in 2018 by improvised explosive devices, Amnesty International estimated this week.\nBurkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Mali and Mauritania launched a G5 Sahel taskforce last year to tackle Islamist militants in the region.\nFrance, its main Western backer, hopes the force will enable them to start drawing down the 4,000 or so troops it has had stationed in Mali since intervening to prevent Islamists and allied Tuareg rebels taking over the country in 2013.\nInternational donors have committed half a billion dollars to the force, but Mali remains heavily dependent on foreign firepower.\nThe French army said on Thursday that French and Malian troops had killed about 30 Islamist insurgents during a gun battle near the border with Niger, where Islamic State’s Saharan affiliate are known to be active.\nWriting by Tim Cocks; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T15:46:39.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
