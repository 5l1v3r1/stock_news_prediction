MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe , which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.49 percent, though emerging market stocks dipped 0.50 percent.\nThe yields on German and 10-year U.S. government bonds, among the most liquid and safe assets in the world, were the highest in nearly two weeks and four weeks, respectively.\nThat was partly as attention turned to what is expected to be a robust first-quarter U.S. corporate earnings season, which begins in earnest this week.\nBenchmark 10-year notes were last down 2/32 in price to yield 2.834 percent, compared with 2.828 percent late on Friday.\nThe 30-year bond was higher, however, rising 2/32 in price to yield 3.0327 percent, from 3.036 percent.\nSome other traditional safe-haven bets held firmer, with gold and Japan’s yen edging higher.\nDealers were keeping a wary eye on Japanese politics after a survey showed support for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had fallen to 26.7 percent, the lowest since he took office in late 2012.\nMeanwhile, oil prices were lower. Brent crude was last at $71.39, down 1.64 percent on the day, with a rise in U.S. drilling for new production dragging on prices.\nU.S. crude oil futures settled at $66.22 per barrel, down 1.74 percent, or $1.17.\nFor Reuters’ Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, open a news window on Reuters Eikon by pressing F9 and type in ‘Live Markets’ in the search bar.\nAdditional reporting by Abhinav Ramnarayan, Jan Harvey and Amanda Cooper in London, Richard Leong and Kate Duguid in New York, Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski and Steve Orlofsky\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T05:20:57.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
