Formula 1 F1 - Bahrain Grand Prix - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - April 6, 2018 Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen ahead of practice REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed \nThe Finn was summoned to the stewards afterwards for an unsafe release from the pits but escaped a grid penalty with Ferrari picking up a 5,000 euro ($6,136.50) fine instead for the misdemeanour. \nThe team had told Raikkonen immediately after the practice stop that there was a loose wheel on the car and he stopped as soon as it was safe to do so. \nRaikkonen, who was third in the opening afternoon session led by Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo, lapped the 5.4km Sakhir circuit in one minute 29.817 seconds. \nVettel, winner last year in Bahrain, was a mere 0.011 seconds slower.

It looks very close between all the teams and we definitely have got some work to do to try and see if we can eke out to be ahead of the others,” said Hamilton. \nMax Verstappen ended the day fifth fastest ahead of Red Bull team mate Daniel Ricciardo. \nThe former champions had book-ended the timesheets in the afternoon, with Ricciardo fastest and Verstappen at the bottom having failed to set a time after being sidelined by an electrical issue. \nThe Dutchman got out and helped marshals push the car back to the pitlane. \nNico Hulkenberg was seventh fastest in the Renault ahead of Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly while McLaren pair Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne rounded out the top 10. \nFriday’s two 90-minute sessions were relatively uneventful although Bottas, on a slow lap, almost collided with Ricciardo who was going quickly.
