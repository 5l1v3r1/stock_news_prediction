Alloush also denied the group had shelled residential areas of Damascus. \nSeparately, Jaish al-Islam military spokesman in Douma said the group’s artillery and rocket brigade was targeting government forces in response to “the massacre committed by the Assad militias and their ally the Russian war planes”. \nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-06T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:03:56.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
