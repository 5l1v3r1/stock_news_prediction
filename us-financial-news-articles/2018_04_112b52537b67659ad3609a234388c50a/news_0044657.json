Wee, one of more than 100 social media users who commented on the zoo operator’s Facebook page.\n“He is the only tropical polar bear, a true-blue Singaporean, a one-of-a-kind icon,” added another, Anita Ryanto.\nInuka, or “foreboding strength” in Inuit, was born on Boxing Day in 1990 to parents Nanook and Sheba, who had arrived from Canada and Germany, respectively, in 1978.\nPolar bear Inuka is pictured next to mother Sheba in this undated handout photo released April 25, 2018. Wildlife Reserves Singapore/Handout via REUTERS His father, Nanook, died in 1995 at 18 while Sheba died at the ripe old age of 35 in 2012. In the wild, the bears have an average life expectancy of 15 to 18 years.\nHis name picked from among 390 suggested in a nationwide contest, Inuka was three when he was chosen as one of the city’s icons by its main broadsheet, the Straits Times, alongside the Singapore Sling cocktail.\nBut in 2004, when the fur on Inuka and his mother started turning green, questioning began over the ethics of keeping polar bears in the tropics.\nThe Singapore Zoo said the green tinge was algae growth. In 2004, the BBC said the bears were bleached with hydrogen peroxide.\nAnimal rights groups have urged zoos not to keep polar bears, who suffer from being denied the huge ranges they are accustomed to in their natural habitat.\n“Add the additional challenge of a hot climate and it becomes clear the animal’s needs are being entirely disregarded in favor of the desire to exhibit,” said Chris Draper, animal welfare head at Britain’s Born Free Foundation.\nSlideshow (8 Images) Inuka will be the last polar bear in Singapore, the zoo operator has said.\nReporting by Fathin Ungku and John Geddie; Additional reporting by Christophe Van Der Perre; Editing by Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T10:53:01.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
