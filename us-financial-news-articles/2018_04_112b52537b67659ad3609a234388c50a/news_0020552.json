Martinez (1-for-5) and Andrew Benintendi (2-for-3) had two apiece as the Red Sox earned their MLB-leading ninth straight victory.\nBoston (9-1) became the 40th team in major league history to win nine of its first 10 games. The Red Sox have not lost since a season-opening 6-4 setback at Tampa Bay, a game that Boston dropped after leading 4-0 in the eighth inning.\nAaron Judge (3-for-4) hit his third homer of the year for the Yankees (5-6), who lost for the fourth time in five games. Giancarlo Stanton (2-for-4) struck out twice in his rivalry debut, bringing his season total to a league-high 22.\nSale (1-0) has a 1.06 ERA after three starts.\nYankees starter Luis Severino (2-1) was gone after five innings, allowing five runs and eight hits while striking out six.\nIt was the first of 19 meetings this year between the AL East foes. The Yankees and Red Sox evenly split their last 38 meetings over the past two seasons.\nBoston led 5-0 entering the fifth inning when Judge blasted an estimated 444-foot solo homer to center field with an exit velocity of 116.3 mph, the hardest homer ever allowed by Sale in the Statcast era.\nBetts’ blast came an inning later, sailing 424 feet over the Green Monster in left to cap a nine-run Boston sixth. It was his third career grand slam and the second for Boston this season after Xander Bogaerts hit one Saturday.\nThe Red Sox’s last grand slam before that came on Sept. 24, 2016.\nNew York right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (1-1, 2.92 ERA) opposes Boston left-hander David Price (1-0, 0.00) on Wednesday night.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-11T11:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:03:48.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
