(NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We are off to the strong start we expected in 2018. First-quarter revenue grew 29% over Q1 2017, driven by growth across all major regions. Robust replenishment, following strong Q4 2017 holiday sell-through, and shipments to support Q2 holidays in the United States, drove domestic revenue growth of 26% over last year. EMEA and Japan also saw significant year-over-year growth of 47% and 38% , respectively, in part driven by the revenue uplift from acquisitions, neither of which we had in Q1 2017,\" said Colin Angle, chairman and chief executive officer of iRobot.\n\"Given our Q1 results and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our 2018 full-year revenue and operating income expectations, and increasing our full-year expectations for earnings per share. We anticipate full-year 2018 revenue of $1.05 to $1.08 billion, which is year-over-year growth of 19 – 22%, operating income of $86 to $96 million, and EPS of $2.15 to $2.40.\n\"We are off to a very strong start in 2018, and I am very excited about the year ahead. We expect our global business to deliver strong financial performance in 2018 that will fund our ability to reinforce our core product leadership in the RVC category, widen our competitive moat through technological differentiation protected by our IP portfolio, and extend our product portfolio.\n\"We believe that consistent execution of this strategy is the most effective way to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value.\"\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $217.1 million, compared with $168.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Operating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $25.4 million, compared with $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Quarterly earnings per share were $0.71, compared with earnings per share of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2017. In Q1 2018, earnings per share included $0.05 of tax benefit relating to stock compensation accounting compared with a $0.06 tax benefit in Q1 2017.\nBusiness Highlights\nWe delivered year-over-year double-digit Q1 quarterly revenue growth across all major regions. First-quarter revenue grew 26% in the U.S. and 32% internationally over Q1 2017. Our acquisitions have enabled more consistent global control of our brand and execution of our marketing programs.

The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense, gain on business acquisition, net intellectual property litigation expense, and restructuring expense. The Company also presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance.\nThe term Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, and is not a measure of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and when assessing the Company's operating performance, investors should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Among other things, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the Company's actual cash expenditures. Other companies may calculate similar measures differently than iRobot, limiting their usefulness as comparative tools. iRobot compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementally.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-reports-first-quarter-financial-results-300635695.html\nSOURCE iRobot Corp.", "external_links": ["http://www.irobot.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-reports-first-quarter-financial-results-300635695.html", "http://investor.irobot.com/events/event-details/q1-2018-irobot-corp-earnings-conference-call"], "published": "2018-04-25T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T00:25:29.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
