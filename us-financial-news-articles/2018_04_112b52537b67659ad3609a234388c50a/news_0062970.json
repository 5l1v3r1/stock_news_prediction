Trump has been a strong supporter of the NRA and enjoyed their backing in his 2016 campaign.\nAfter a deadly school shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Trump suggested he was open to new gun control measures. He held a meeting with senators, declaring that he would stand up to the gun lobby and calling for a \"comprehensive\" bill.\nBut Trump later backpedaled from those sweeping statements, offering a more limited plan. After he advocated increasing the minimum age to purchase an assault weapon to 21, Trump tweeted there was \"not much political support\" for the idea.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T16:19:05.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
