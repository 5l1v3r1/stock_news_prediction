Feldman, portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Miracle Mile Advisors.\nAt 11:10 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.82 percent at 24,560.96. The S&P 500 gained 0.65 percent to 2,673.6 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4 percent at 7,135.34.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with a 1.2 percent gain in the utilities index leading the gainers.\nShares of optical components makers Acacia Communications , Oclaro, Lumentum and Finisar took a beating after Reuters reported that the U.S. government was banning American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp .\nNetflix fell more than 2 percent. The company is expected to reports results after the closing bell on Monday.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 2.90-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, a 1.71-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
