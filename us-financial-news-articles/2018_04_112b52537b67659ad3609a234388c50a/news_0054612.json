The Company earns income from investing in a leveraged portfolio of residential adjustable-rate mortgage pass-through securities, referred to as ARM securities, issued and guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or by an agency of the federal government, Ginnie Mae.\nFirst Quarter Earnings and Related Discussion\nCapstead reported net income of $19.4 million or $0.16 per diluted common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $22.6 million or $0.19 per diluted common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which included a $1.9 million benefit from the enactment of tax reform legislation. The Company paid a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.16 per common share on April 20, 2018.\nPortfolio yields averaged 2.08% during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 17 basis points over the 1.91% reported for the fourth quarter. Cash yields (yields on the portfolio before investment premium amortization) increased six basis points to average 2.85% during the first quarter, benefiting from mortgage loans underlying the portfolio resetting to higher rates based on higher prevailing six- and 12-month interest rate indices and higher coupon interest rates on recent acquisitions. As of March 31, 2018, 52% of the Company’s ARM securities portfolio will reset in rate in approximately 6.3 months on average, allowing the Company’s cash yields to continue benefiting from higher prevailing interest rates in future quarters. Yield adjustments for investment premium amortization decreased 11 basis points to average a negative 0.77% for the first quarter as mortgage prepayment activity declined. Mortgage prepayment rates averaged an annualized constant prepayment rate, or CPR, of 19.64%, a decrease of 2.86% CPR from an average of 22.50% CPR the previous quarter.\nThe following table illustrates the progression of Capstead’s portfolio of residential mortgage investments for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 (dollars in thousands):\nResidential mortgage investments, beginning of quarter $ 13,454,098 Portfolio acquisitions (principal amount) 449,476 Investment premiums on acquisitions* 11,905 Portfolio runoff (principal amount) (793,735 ) Investment premium amortization (25,620 ) Decrease in net unrealized gains on securities classified as available-for-sale\n(44,053 ) Residential mortgage investments, end of period $ 13,052,071 Decrease in residential mortgage investments during the quarter\n$ (402,027 ) * Residential mortgage investments typically are acquired at a premium to the securities’ unpaid principal balances. Investment premiums are recognized in earnings as portfolio yield adjustments using the interest method over the estimated lives of the related investments. As such, the level of mortgage prepayments impacts how quickly investment premiums are amortized.\nRates on Capstead’s $11.94 billion in secured borrowings, after adjusting for hedging activities, averaged 18 basis points higher at 1.47% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.29% for the prior quarter. Average unhedged secured borrowing rates increased 25 basis points during the first quarter to 1.64%. This increase is largely attributable to the funding market’s response to 25 basis point increases in the Federal Funds Rate in December 2017 and, to a lesser extent, March 2018. Related hedged borrowing rates increased 12 basis points to 1.35% as $1.70 billion of lower fixed-rate swaps matured while $500 million in new swaps were added at higher prevailing rates. The Company typically uses two- and three-year term interest rate swap agreements with variable rate receipts based primarily on three-month LIBOR to help mitigate exposure to rising short-term interest rates. At quarter-end the Company held $6.85 billion notional amount of portfolio financing-related swap agreements with contract expirations occurring at various dates through the first quarter of 2021, and a weighted average expiration of 14 months.\nOperating costs expressed as an annualized percentage of long-term investment capital averaged 1.01% for the first quarter of 2018. As an annualized percentage of total assets, operating costs averaged 0.10% during this period. Capstead operates a highly efficient investment platform, particularly compared to other mortgage REITs, and has a competitive cost structure relative to a wide variety of high yielding investment vehicles.\nCommon Stock Repurchases\nPursuant to its $100 million stock repurchase program reactivated last November, the Company repurchased 3.4 million shares of its common stock in the open market for $29.1 million during the first quarter of 2018. At an average repurchase price, including underwriting fees, of $8.60, these repurchases resulted in book value accretion of $0.06 per share. An additional 48,000 share repurchases settled subsequent to quarter-end, leaving a remaining repurchase program authorization of approximately $67 million. Future levels of stock repurchases will largely be dependent upon market conditions, including alternative capital investment opportunities.\nLong-Term Investment Capital, Portfolio Leverage and Book Value per Common Share\nCapstead’s long-term investment capital, which consists of common and perpetual preferred stockholders’ equity and long-term unsecured borrowings, decreased by $46.6 million during the first quarter of 2018 to $1.29 billion primarily as a result of common stock repurchases and declines in portfolio valuations that outstripped increases in swap gains. Portfolio leverage (secured borrowings divided by long-term investment capital) increased to 9.26 to one at March 31, 2018 from 9.22 to one at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table illustrates the progression of the Company’s book value per common share (total stockholders’ equity, less preferred share liquidation preferences, divided by shares of common stock outstanding) as well as changes in book value expressed as percentages of beginning book value for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nBook value per common share, beginning of quarter $ 10.25 Change in net unrealized gains (losses) on mortgage securities classified as available-for-sale\n(0.48 ) Change in net unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of:\nSecured borrowings 0.23 Unsecured borrowings 0.06 (0.19 ) (1.9 )% Capital transactions: Accretion from common stock repurchases 0.06 Other, principally stock compensation-related activity (0.02 ) 0.04 0.4 % Book value per common share, end of period $ 10.10 Decrease in book value per common share during the quarter\n$ (0.15 ) (1.5 )% Nearly all of Capstead ’s residential mortgage investments and all interest rate swap agreements are reflected at fair value on the Company’s balance sheet and related unrealized gains and losses are included in the calculation of book value per common share. The Company’s borrowings, however, are not reflected at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value is impacted by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and the availability of financing at reasonable rates and leverage levels, among other factors. The Company’s investment strategy attempts to mitigate these risks by focusing on investments in agency-guaranteed residential mortgage pass-through securities, which are considered to have little, if any, credit risk and are collateralized by ARM loans with interest rates that reset periodically to more current levels, generally within five years. Because of these characteristics, the fair value of the Company’s portfolio is expected to be less vulnerable to significant pricing declines caused by credit concerns or rising interest rates compared to leveraged portfolios containing a significant amount of non-agency-guaranteed securities or agency-guaranteed securities backed by longer-duration ARM or fixed-rate loans. Duration is a common measure of market price sensitivity to interest rate movements. A shorter duration generally indicates less interest rate risk.\nManagement Remarks\nCommenting on current operating and market conditions, Phillip A. Reinsch, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “During what has proved to be a challenging quarter for the residential mortgage sector, Capstead has posted a positive economic return of 0.10% and a total stockholder return (“TSR”) of 1.85% (7.71% annualized). We anticipate that these results will compare favorably to other residential mortgage REIT industry participants, many of which are expected to report significant book value declines due largely to higher prevailing interest rates and pressure on pricing for fixed-rate agency-guaranteed mortgage securities as the Federal Reserve continues to reduce its participation in the marketplace.\n“Our first quarter 2018 earnings benefited from higher cash yields and lower mortgage prepayment rates, which offset most of the effects of higher borrowing rates and lower portfolio balances. We increased leverage slightly to 9.26 to one as a portion of our capital made available from portfolio runoff was used to buy back approximately 3.5% of our outstanding common stock at a meaningful discount to our book value. These buybacks contributed $0.06 in book value accretion for the quarter. Future buyback activity will depend on market conditions.\n“Cash yields are expected to continue improving in 2018 with roughly half of our portfolio of agency-guaranteed ARM securities scheduled to reset in rate within 18 months primarily based on six- and 12-month indices that have increased considerably during the first quarter. For instance, the coupon interest rates on many of the mortgages underlying our portfolio reset based on a margin over one-year LIBOR and this index increased 55 basis points during the first quarter and is higher still today. This key feature of our short duration ARM strategy affords us the opportunity over time to recover financing spreads diminished by rising borrowing rates. For more information regarding coupon resets see the last page of this release.\n“Continued declines in mortgage prepayment activity this quarter were largely a function of seasonality and higher prevailing mortgage interest rates. Second and third quarter 2018 prepayment activity will likely be driven higher by seasonal considerations such as the summer home buying season and available processing days, with refinancing activity primarily centered on homeowners whose mortgages are resetting higher that may have opportunities to refinance.\n“First quarter borrowing rates absorbed the brunt of the December Federal Funds Rate increase while much of the March increase is being absorbed in the second quarter. Hedging costs have increased as we entered into new swap agreements at higher prevailing rates and as older, lower-rate swaps matured.\n“Our investment strategy of cost-effectively managing a leveraged portfolio of short duration agency-guaranteed residential ARM securities seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long term. Our near-term results will continue to be driven by mortgage prepayment levels, and the pace of future increases in short-term interest rates.”\nEarnings Conference Call Details\nAn earnings conference call and live audio webcast will be hosted Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET.

Capstead segregates its residential ARM securities based on the average length of time until the loans underlying each security reset to more current rates.\n(b)\nTo help mitigate exposure to higher interest rates, Capstead uses one- and three-month LIBOR-indexed, pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements supplemented with longer-maturity secured borrowings when available at attractive rates and terms. The Company has also entered into $100 million notional amount of swap agreements with terms coinciding with the 20-year variable-rate terms of the Company’s unsecured borrowings. Swap positions are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and carried on the balance sheet at fair value with related unrealized gains or losses reflected as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income in Stockholders’ equity. Above amounts exclude variation margin and accrued interest.\nThe following reflects Capstead’s portfolio financing-related swap positions, sorted by quarter of swap contract expiration. Average fixed rates reflect related swap fixed-rate payment requirements.\nSwap Notional\nAverage\nPeriod of Contract Expiration\nAmounts\nFixed Rates\nSecond quarter 2018 $ 600,000 0.79 % Third quarter 2018 400,000 0.88 Fourth quarter 2018 800,000 1.15 First quarter 2019 950,000 1.58 Second quarter 2019 1,650,000 1.33 Third quarter 2019 550,000 1.40 Fourth quarter 2019 700,000 1.72 First quarter 2020 600,000 2.07 Second quarter 2020 100,000 2.56 Third quarter 2020 200,000 1.64 Fourth quarter 2020 200,000 2.04 First quarter 2021 100,000 2.67 $ 6,850,000 After consideration of portfolio financing-related swap positions, Capstead’s residential mortgage investments and related secured borrowings had durations as of March 31, 2018 of approximately 12 and 8 months, respectively, for a net duration gap of approximately 4 months. Duration is a measure of market price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. A shorter duration generally indicates less interest rate risk.\nCAPSTEAD MORTGAGE CORPORATION RESIDENTIAL ARM SECURITIES PORTFOLIO STATISTICS (as of March 31, 2018)\n(dollars in thousands, unaudited)\nFully\nAverage\nAverage\nAverage\nMonths\nAmortized\nNet\nIndexed\nNet\nPeriodic\nLifetime\nTo\nARM Type\nCost Basis (a)\nWAC (b)\nWAC (b)\nMargins (b)\nCaps (b)\nCaps (b)\nRoll (c)\nCurrent-reset ARMs: Fannie Mae Agency Securities $3,819,650 3.25% 4.16% 1.69% 2.91% 9.36% 5.9 Freddie Mac Agency Securities 1,583,361 3.31 4.37 1.80 2.40 9.19 7.3 Ginnie Mae Agency Securities 1,440,390 2.73 3.61 1.51 1.06 8.27 6.3 Residential mortgage loans 1,162 4.04 4.30 2.11 1.71 11.17 5.1 (52% of total) 6,844,563 3.15 4.09 1.68 2.40 9.09 6.3 Longer-to-reset ARMs: Fannie Mae Agency Securities 3,124,835 2.77 4.24 1.59 3.08 7.77 41.6 Freddie Mac Agency Securities 1,679,790 2.73 4.29 1.64 2.70 7.80 38.8 Ginnie Mae Agency Securities 1,399,676 3.03 3.59 1.50 1.01 8.03 46.4 (48% of total) 6,204,301 2.82 4.11 1.58 2.11 7.88 42.0 $13,048,864 2.99 4.10 1.63 2.28 8.59 23.3 Gross WAC (rate paid by borrowers) (d) 3.59 (a)\nAmortized cost basis represents the Company’s investment (unpaid principal balance plus unamortized investment premiums) before unrealized gains and losses. At March 31, 2018, the ratio of amortized cost basis to unpaid principal balance for the Company’s ARM holdings was 103.03. This table excludes $2 million in fixed-rate agency-guaranteed mortgage pass-through securities, residential mortgage loans and private residential mortgage pass-through securities held as collateral for structured financings.\n(b)\nNet WAC, or weighted average coupon, is the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans underlying the indicated investments, net of servicing and other fees as of the indicated date. Net WAC is expressed as a percentage calculated on an annualized basis on the unpaid principal balances of the mortgage loans underlying these investments. As such, it is similar to the cash yield on the portfolio which is calculated using amortized cost basis. Fully indexed WAC represents the weighted average coupon upon one or more resets using interest rate indexes and net margins as of the indicated date. Average net margins represent the weighted average levels over the underlying indexes that the portfolio can adjust to upon reset, usually subject to initial, periodic and/or lifetime caps on the amount of such adjustments during any single interest rate adjustment period and over the contractual term of the underlying loans. ARM securities with initial fixed-rate periods of five years or longer typically have either 200 or 500 basis point initial caps with 200 basis point periodic caps. Additionally, certain ARM securities held by the Company are subject only to lifetime caps or are not subject to a cap. For presentation purposes, average periodic caps in the table above reflect initial caps until after an ARM security has reached its initial reset date and lifetime caps, less the current net WAC, for ARM securities subject only to lifetime caps. At quarter-end, 76% of current-reset ARMs were subject to periodic caps averaging 1.75%; 17% were subject to initial caps averaging 3.37%; and 7% were subject to lifetime caps averaging 7.07%. All longer-to-reset ARM securities at March 31, 2018 were subject to initial caps.\n(c)\nCapstead classifies its ARM securities based on the average length of time until the loans underlying each security reset to more current rates (“months-to-roll”) (less than 18 months for “current-reset” ARM securities, and 18 months or greater for “longer-to-reset” ARM securities). After consideration of any applicable initial fixed-rate periods, at March 31, 2018 approximately 90%, 5% and 3% of the Company’s ARM securities were backed by mortgage loans that reset annually, semi-annually and monthly, respectively, while approximately 2% reset every five years. Approximately 83% of the Company’s current-reset ARM securities have reached an initial coupon reset date, while none of its longer-to-reset ARM securities have reached an initial coupon reset date.\n(d)\nGross WAC is the weighted average interest rate of the mortgage loans underlying the indicated investments, including servicing and other fees paid by borrowers, as of the indicated balance sheet date.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006583/en/\nCapstead Mortgage Corporation\nLindsey Crabbe, 214-874-2339\nSource: Capstead Mortgage Corporation", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capstead.com&esheet=51795296&newsitemid=20180425006583&lan=en-US&anchor=www.capstead.com&index=2&md5=65cfd46fded9b835c0a50b29df6bda51", "https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006583/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.capstead.com%2F&esheet=51795296&newsitemid=20180425006583&lan=en-US&anchor=CMO&index=1&md5=e2b4af9a77b35c335dcc1f06fbbe6310"], "published": "2018-04-26T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T01:45:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
