Rusal 0486 26.06% PLC. And because Rusal owns 28% of Norilsk Nickel Mining & Metallurgical Co. and some analysts think Norilsk could also be affected by sanctions moving forward, nickel has also gotten a boost from the supply uncertainty.\nBut some traders remain uncertain what the long-term impact of the sanctions could be, noting that supply from China could fill the void. Rusal shares have plummeted since the sanctions were announced but surged 26% Thursday following a Bloomberg report that officials met Chinese companies and traders this week to discuss the possibility of buying alumina, a key ingredient for making the metal, and selling aluminum.\nSome analysts have said outsize swings in stockpiles and immense uncertainty could continue driving huge moves in the relatively illiquid markets.\n“It will take some time and more reasonable price action and some kind of equilibrium before the markets return to some level of normality,” said Tai Wong, head of metals trading at BMO Capital Markets.\nVolatility related to Russia has also ensnared palladium, as the country accounts for about 40% of supply. Futures prices of the metal used to scrub emissions in diesel engines were down 1.8% in New York Thursday but also have rocketed since the sanctions were announced.\nElsewhere in base metals, copper for May delivery edged down 1.2% to $3.1210 a pound, following aluminum and nickel lower.\nAmong precious metals, gold for June delivery edged down 0.3% to $1,350 a troy ounce, staying in its 2018 trading range as worries about higher interest rates and a stable dollar continue to offset haven demand.\nWrite to David Hodari at David.Hodari@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T21:48:00.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
