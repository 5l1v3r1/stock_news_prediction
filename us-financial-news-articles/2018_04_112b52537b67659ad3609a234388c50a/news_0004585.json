We hope the UK will continue to press countries where the biggest ivory markets are, most of which are in Asia, to shut down their trade too.”\nFILE PHOTO: Ivory carvings seized by the UK Border Force at Heathrow Airport sit on display at Custom House near Heathrow in London, Britain November 22, 2017.
