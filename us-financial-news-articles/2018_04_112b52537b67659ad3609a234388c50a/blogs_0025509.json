BAD!\" TRUMP TWEET \nThe president was so incensed by the FBI's raid of his personal attorney's office and hotel room that he's privately pondered firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and publicly mused about ousting Mueller. \nFive people familiar with the president's views say the raid of Cohen's records left the president more angry than advisers had seen him in weeks.

He says it is \"Very calm and calculated.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T15:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T15:14:37.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
