He was then doused with Gatorade by Domingo German while getting ready to conduct a postgame interview.\nIt was the catcher’s sixth homer of the season and first walk-off homer and hit. It was New York’s first walk-off homer since Brett Gardner on July 27, 2017 versus Tampa Bay.\nBefore Sanchez won it, Rodney was betrayed by some shaky defense from third baseman Miguel Sano. Sano committed a throwing error on a ball hit by Didi Gregorius and then cut in front of shortstop Ehire Adrianza on a grounder by Giancarlo Stanton.\nSanchez’s homer capped a day when the Yankees were held without a hit until Gardner singled with two outs in the sixth off Kyle Gibson.\nGibson recorded his first career double-digit strikeout game with 10 and held the Yankees to one hit in six innings.\nThe Twins finished their first 0-7 road trip since Aug. 10-16, 2001.\nEduardo Escobar hit a two-run homer off Jordan Montgomery and Robbie Grossman homered off German for the Twins.\nIncluding the wild-card game, Minnesota has dropped its last eight games to the Yankees. Minnesota lost the Yankees for the 12th time in the last 13 regular-season visits to New York.\nMontgomery allowed two runs and four hits in five innings while running up his pitch count.\nDellin Betances (1-1) struck out the side in the ninth for New York.\nAaron Hicks drove in the other run with a sacrifice fly for the Yankees.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-27T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:33:47.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
