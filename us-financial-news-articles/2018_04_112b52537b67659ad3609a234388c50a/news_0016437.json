Tianqi representatives in China had previously declined to comment on the case.\nTianqi lawyers also told FNE that the lithium market participation data used by Corfo in its claim was incorrect and overestimated Tianqi’s participation in the global lithium industry, the papers said.\nCorfo, which manages natural resources including mining in Chile, filed the complaint that was first reported by Reuters last month. It seeks to avoid a potential sale of the 32 percent stake in SQM held by Canada’s Nutrien ( NTR.TO ) to Tianqi or any other company “controlled by the Chinese State.”\nThe agency said a sale to Tianqi or any company backed by the Chinese state could affect “the competitive rivalry of the market” of the key mineral used in the manufacture of batteries for electric cars.\nTogether, Tianqi and SQM, the world’s second largest lithium producer after Albemarle ( ALB.N ), would control 70 percent of the world lithium market, according to the complaint.\nThe FNE has until August, with the possibility of further extensions, to determine whether to launch a full investigation.\nCanadian fertilizer company Nutrien must sell its stake in SQM by next March as part of an agreement with regulators for the merger of Agrium and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, which created Nutrien.\nReporting by Felipe Iturrieta; Writing by Caroline Stauffer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-07T18:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T18:39:18.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
