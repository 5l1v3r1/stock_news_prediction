WTX101 works by removing excess copper from the bloodstream.\n“The acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics is a strong strategic fit for Alexion given the overlap with our current clinical and commercial focus on metabolic and neurologic disorders, and is an important first step in rebuilding our clinical pipeline,” said Alexion Chief Executive Ludwig Hantson.\nWTX101 has secured fast-track designation in the United States, which should speed its path to market, and also has orphan drug status in both the U.S. and Europe, which brings certain benefits.\nSunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Yatin Suneja said the new drug would provide badly needed diversity to Alexion's pipeline, assuming it proves itself in Phase III. Results from the pivotal WTX101 trial here are expected later next year.\nRBC Capital Markets said buying Wilson would use up much of Alexion’s cash pile but there was still scope for smaller deals.\nWilson disease affects approximately 10,000 patients in the United States and 15,000 in the European Union.\nBIOTECH DRUG RACE There have been a slew of deals in the biotech sector this year as drugmakers turn to promising drugs from outside to boost sales growth. Highly priced and high-margin treatments for rare diseases have been a particular focus for such acquisitions.\nOn Monday, Swiss drugmaker Novartis ( NOVN.S ) agreed to acquire gene therapy specialist AveXis ( AVXS.O ) for $8.7 billion, following similar multibillion-dollar deals by the likes of France’s Sanofi ( SASY.PA ) and U.S.-based Celgene ( CELG.O ).\nJapan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ), meanwhile, is considering a takeover bid for London-listed Shire ( SHP.L ).\nAlexion said its acquisition of Wilson was expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and that it intended to finance the acquisition through cash on hand.\nLazard is acting as financial adviser to Wilson, while Alexion is being advised by BofA Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and DNB Markets.\n(Corrects company spellings in headline and paragraph 14 and analyst’s name in paragraph 10)\n($1 = 8.3000 Swedish crowns)\nEditing by Susan Fenton and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T16:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:26:44.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
