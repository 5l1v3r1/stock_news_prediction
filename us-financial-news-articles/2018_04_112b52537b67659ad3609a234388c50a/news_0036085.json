Soccer Football - Serie A - Genoa vs Inter Milan - Stadio Comunale Luigi Ferraris, Genoa, Italy - February 17, 2018 Inter Milan's Yann Karamoh reacts REUTERS/Alberto Lingria \nKaramoh, 19, has been used sparingly since joining on loan from Ligue 1 side Caen in the close season but has already scored a stunning goal in the 2-1 win over Bologna in February. \nHe enjoys playing to the crowd but a backheel in front of Cagliari’s Leandro Castan in the first half was too much for Spalletti and also angered the Brazilian. \n“He’s a strong player with flair and a good turn of pace. The fans like him although the backheel he did is a gesture which should not be repeated if he wants to become a champion,” said the shaven-headed coach. \n“In terms of finishing and the overall balance of the team, he can improve but he’s a lad of real quality. With the right focus and through hard work, he could become a great player.” \nSpalletti added: “He is very creative and that means that collaborating with team mates is tricky for him but he mustn’t get into bad habits.” \nKaramoh made no apologies for the trick but said: “I often do these things, it is what football is all about.” \n“I had a lot of chances, I missed them but I will have more in the future,” he added. \n“The applause from the crowd at the San Siro gives me a lot of satisfaction and helps my self confidence to grow with every chance and opportunity I get to play.” Writing by Brian Homewood; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T13:14:48.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
