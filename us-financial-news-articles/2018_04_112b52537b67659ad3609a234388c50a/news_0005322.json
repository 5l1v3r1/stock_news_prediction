REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo \nThe Commerce Department said on Monday construction spending edged up 0.1 percent after being unchanged in January. \nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending accelerating 0.5 percent in February. Construction spending increased 3.0 percent on a year-on-year basis. \nFebruary’s marginal increase in construction spending could have implications for first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates, which are mostly below a 2 percent annualized rate. \nIn February, spending on public construction projects tumbled 2.1 percent, almost reversing January’s 2.3 percent rise. February’s drop was the largest since June 2017. \nSpending on federal government construction projects plunged 11.9 percent, the biggest decline since October 2004, after surging 13.4 percent in January. \nState and local government construction outlays fell 1.0 percent after rising 1.3 percent in January. \nSpending on private construction projects increased 0.7 percent after falling 0.7 percent in January. Outlays on private residential projects edged up 0.1 percent to the highest level since January 2007. They rose 0.1 percent in January. \nSpending on nonresidential structures rebounded 1.5 percent in February after dropping 1.7 percent in the prior month.
