Private equity group Pamplona Capital Management is also a shareholder in Octo Telematics with a 26.5 percent stake.\nThe planned Milan IPO, structured through the sale of shares by existing Octo Telematics shareholders, was expected in the first half of 2018, another source told Reuters in December.\nOwners were planning to sell 35-40 percent of the company to Italian and foreign institutional investors, targeting an enterprise value of 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion), Il Sole said in its report.
