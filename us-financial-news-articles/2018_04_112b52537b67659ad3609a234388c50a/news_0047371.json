REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson The forecast came as Viacom reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit and revenue, which could help the media and entertainment company as it negotiates with CBS over a potential merger.\nViacom said on a conference call it would not discuss the ongoing talks with CBS.\nViacom and CBS, both owned by National Amusements Inc, Sumner and Shari Redstone’s family holding company, have been going back and forth on price and management in a combined company in the\nmerger talks, sources have told Reuters.\nViacom Chief Executive Officer Bob Bakish has implemented a turnaround plan, which included improving programming at its cable TV networks, include Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon, and improving relations with distributors.\nViacom’s shares rose 1.3 percent to $31.31 in late-morning trading.\nViacom’s Paramount Pictures returned to profitability as it sold “The Cloverfield Paradox” and the international rights to horror movie “Annihilation” to video streaming service Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ).\nPerformance at the film division helped Viacom’s operating income surge 37 percent to $456 million in the second quarter.\n“Viacom’s management does appear to be doing a lot of the right things,” Cowen analyst Doug Creutz said.\n“Still, they face tough secular trends and the fact that their core youth audience isn’t engaging with TV nearly as much as they used to.”\nViacom’s domestic advertising revenue fell 3 percent to $841 million, while analysts expected a 3.8 percent decline, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.\nDomestic affiliate revenue, or the fees collected from U.S. cable and satellite operators and online distributors, fell 4 percent to $934 million in the quarter. Analysts expected a 4.2 percent drop, according to FactSet.\nNet income attributable to Viacom rose to $256 million, or 64 cents per share, from $121 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 92 cents per share.\nTotal revenue fell 3.3 percent to $3.15 billion.\nAnalysts, on average, expected profit of 79 cents on revenue of $3.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru and Jessica Toonkel in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:40:37.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
