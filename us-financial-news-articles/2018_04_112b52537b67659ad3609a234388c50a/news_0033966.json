Aluminium prices are up 30 percent so far in April and nickel has jumped 20 percent this week alone.\nHowever, some of those gains in aluminium prices were due to a supply squeeze after U.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal, with similar worries also spurring nickel.\nOil prices rose 1.2 percent to over $74 a barrel, highs not seen since late 2014, after a report that top crude exporter Saudi Arabia was seeking a price rise to as high as $100 a barrel, suggesting no change in a supply-cutting deal.\nThe Saudi bourse jumped 1.4 percent to its highest since August 2015, while Qatar rose 1.05 percent to 2-1/2 month highs. Other commodity producers also benefited, with South Africa shares up 0.4 percent to near one-month highs and Russian stocks up 0.3 percent to 10-day highs.\nEarlier in Asia, Chinese mainland and Hong Kong stocks gained around 1.2 percent, boosted by gains in materials and energy firms. Beijing said it was well prepared to handle any negative effects from a trade dispute with the United States\nCurrencies delivered a more mixed performance, with the Kazakhstan tenge firming 0.8 percent, but the Russian rouble weakened 0.3 percent.\nRatings agency Moody’s said Russia’s strong public and external finances would shield its economy from the impact of the latest U.S. sanctions. But it also warned the sanctions would be credit-negative for some Russian debt issuers, especially Rusal.\nTurkey’s lira was among the worst performers, slipping 0.8 percent after gaining 2.1 percent in the previous session, its biggest one-day gain in more than a year. The surge came after President Tayyip Erdogan announced early elections for June 24.\nLonger-dated Turkish sovereign dollar bonds extended Wednesday’s gains with the January 2041 issue trading at around a one-month high according to Tradeweb. Turkish five-year credit default swaps held at 195 basis points, according to IHS Markit, a near two-week low.\n“The authorities want to see the lira stable ahead of that election and a pre-requisite for that is tighter monetary settings,” said Kiran Kowshik, a strategist at UniCredit. “The market is pricing that in. If they did a 100 basis points hike or above that, it would be short-term positive for the lira.”\nHe said the rally might go on for a few weeks yet, with the lira potentially breaking through the 4 per dollar mark in the next few days. But to get through the key level of 3.94-3.95, the central bank would need to deliver, he added.\nThe Mexican peso also slipped 0.6 percent, with leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador widening his lead in the race for the July 1 presidential election, opening up a gap of 22 percentage points, according to a poll.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1185.52 +9.38 +0.80 +2.34\nCzech Rep 1128.92 -0.06 -0.01 +4.71\nPoland 2334.86 +19.36 +0.84 -5.13\nHungary 38694.08 -72.41 -0.19 -1.74\nRomania 8948.25 +14.79 +0.17 +15.41\nGreece 840.91 -1.43 -0.17 +4.80\nRussia 1159.51 +4.96 +0.43 +0.44\nSouth Africa 51316.91 +291.11 +0.57 -2.31\nTurkey 11946.79 -152.23 -0.14 -2.94\nChina 3117.55 +26.15 +0.85 -5.73\nIndia 34410.99 +79.31 +0.23 +1.04\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.32 25.30 -0.10 +0.82\nPoland 4.17 4.16 -0.07 +0.24\nHungary 310.33 310.18 -0.05 +0.06\nRomania 4.66 4.65 -0.11 +0.47\nSerbia 118.02 118.08 +0.05 +0.32\nRussia 61.01 60.86 -0.25 -5.50\nKazakhstan 325.51 328.11 +0.80 +2.24\nUkraine 26.22 26.14 -0.31 +7.34\nSouth Africa 11.96 11.92 -0.33 +3.28\nKenya 100.25 100.30 +0.05 +2.84\nIsrael 3.51 3.51 -0.01 -0.97\nTurkey 4.04 4.01 -0.78 -6.19\nChina 6.28 6.27 -0.10 +3.63\nIndia 65.76 65.71 -0.08 -2.93\nBrazil 3.38 3.38 -0.01 -2.02\nMexico 18.22 18.09 -0.72 +7.86\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 313 -2 .03 7 93.54 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench; graphic by Karin Strohecker; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T12:41:13.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
