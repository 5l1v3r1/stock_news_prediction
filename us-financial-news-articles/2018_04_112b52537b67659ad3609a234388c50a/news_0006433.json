Greek courts have ruled in the company’s favor several times, but the mining ministry then stalled permit approvals, he said.\n“There’s still a lot more that has to happen before Eldorado would be in a position to say it feels comfortable going ahead and committing to spending the (approximate) $700 million to build Skouries,” he said, noting the company has already spent some $435 million on Skouries since 2012.\nEldorado said the decision provides a foundation to advance dialogue with Greece.\n“We look to the Greek state to fulfill its obligations under the transfer contract including issuing the outstanding permits for the Skouries project,” Eldorado Chief Executive George Burns said in a statement.\nLast week, Eldorado filed an updated technical report on Skouries that it said reduces the project footprint by 40 percent. It will take about two years to build the mine, which has 3.77 million ounces of gold reserves and 779 million pounds of copper.\nEldorado forecast 2018 development capital for Skouries at $20 million with future care and maintenance costs estimated at $3 million to $5 million annually.\nEldorado, which also filed updated technical reports for projects in Turkey and Canada last week, does not have the $1.3 billion required for those projects and Skouries, said Eight Capital analyst Craig Stanley in a note to clients.\nThe miner ended 2017 with $485 million in cash, $250 million undrawn on lines of credit and $600 million of debt due in late 2020, Stanley wrote.
