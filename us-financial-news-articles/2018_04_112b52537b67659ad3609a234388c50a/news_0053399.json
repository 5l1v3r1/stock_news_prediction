But the setback is likely temporary against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and large fiscal stimulus.\nWhile the dollar has ignored yield differentials for more than a year, with investors preferring to give greater weight to the momentum of economic recovery in other major economies, notably Europe, this week's spike in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields forced investors to acknowledge the widening yield differentials favoring the greenback.\n\"Were coming to a point now finally where the market is focusing more on the dollars widening yield advantage over its major rivals, which has been in place for some time but has been largely ignored by investors,\" said Esiner.\nBenchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields peaked at 3.03 percent on Wednesday. Short-dated U.S. yields hit a more-than- decade high of 2.51 percent on Wednesday.\nSterling was the biggest loser among major currencies on Friday as weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth numbers further whittled away at the likelihood of a rate hike next month.\nThe pound fell 0.96 percent to $1.3781 against the dollar, after data showed Britain's economy grew at its slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 2012. Against the euro, the pound dropped as much as 1.09 percent to 87.86 pence.\nThe Japanese yen was little changed after the central bank's policy decision to keep its settings unchanged.\nThe dollar rose to a top of 109.53 yen Friday, the highest level since Feb. 8. It last exchanged hands down 0.18 percent at 109.09.\nThe euro , in which speculators held record long positions, fell to $1.205 on Friday, its lowest since Jan. 12.
