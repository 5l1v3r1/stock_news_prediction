During the quarter ending January 31, 2018, the Company expanded into agriculture with its expansion into the organic hemp growing business in New York and in its application process for cannabis growing and manufacturing licensure in California.\nIncome from operations increased YTD by $300K ($600K as adjusted) as compared to the same period last year, a 316% as adjusted increase in profitability from operations. Cost of Goods and Services sold has been reduced by 7% YTD and 19% for the quarter ending January 31, 2018. We attribute this decline in costs of goods primarily to the reduction of percentage of income derived from the construction division, which traditionally has low margins, from 51% of the revenue to just 15% of our revenue generated.\nWhile expending $2.3 million YTD in advancing our operations and expanding our capital assets, we have reduced our liabilities by 34% and our cash position has increased 61% as compared to the same period last year.\nPaul Rosenberg, MCIG’s CEO, stated, “We continue to expand operations and 2018 looks to be a very good year for MCIG. As we spin-off our tech division and supply division, we will focus on our development and growth into agriculture, extraction, and product development.”\nAbout MCIG Group ( MCIG )\nHeadquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, mCig, Inc.
