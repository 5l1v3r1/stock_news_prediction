The 1.9 billion euros price is an enterprise value, including equity and debt. \nThe planned Zentiva sale follows a move by UK group Shire ( SHP.L ) this week to sell its oncology business to unlisted French drugmaker Servier for $2.4 billion. \nSanofi has been reshaping its business in recent months, spending more than $16 billion to buy biotech company Ablynx ( ABLX.BR ) and U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ, but also selling off some assets. \nThis week, it sold some brands to Charterhouse Capital Partners’ Cooper-Vemedia drugs manufacturing arm for 158 million euros. \n“Following a comprehensive review of strategic options for our generics unit in Europe, we have determined that transferring this business to Advent is the best option to ensure its long-term success,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo \nSanofi shares were down 0.3 percent in early session trading. \n“The sale price is decent, but nothing that extraordinary. Sanofi will probably re-invest the proceeds in looking to make pharma or biotech acquisitions. They are looking to strengthen their pipeline, which is a bit weak at the moment,” said Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based Prime Partners, which does not hold Sanofi shares at present. \nThe planned sale of Zentiva began in October after Sanofi spent more than a year carving out the division to create a stand-alone company that could be sold to one of its competitors or to an investment fund. \nIn February, sources told Reuters that private equity firms Carlyle ( CG.O ), BC Partners and a consortium of Blackstone ( BX.N ) and Nordic Capital had been shortlisted to buy Zentiva along with two industry players, Brazilian drugs firm EMS and India’s Torrent Pharma ( TORP.NS ). \nZentiva operates in 50 markets and has a strong presence in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania. \nIts generic drugs portfolio includes cardiovascular and gastrointestinal drugs as well as painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs based on ibuprofen and leflunomide molecules.
