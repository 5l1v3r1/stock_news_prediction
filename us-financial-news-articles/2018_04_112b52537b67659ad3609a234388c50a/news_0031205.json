He claimed that Russia gained ground in Syria as a result of inaction by the Obama administration, which also allowed extremists in the Middle East to thrive. \n\"I'm not saying you should police the world, but you can't let evil strive and say, 'It's none of my business.' So I believe President Trump is on the right track,\" he said. \nThe Obama administration in 2012 threatened to retaliate if Syria's Bashar Assad used chemical weapons in that country's civil war. The following year, Assad's government killed hundreds of civilians in the town of Ghouta with chemical weapons, but the United States did not respond with military force. \nTrump likes to blame the Obama administration for the rise of ISIS and take credit for that group's decline, though ISIS began its rise during the administration of George W. Bush and started to lose ground militarily thanks largely to the Obama administration's support of Kurds fighting the terror group.

His company, Orascom Telecom, holds the sole telecommunications license in North Korea. \n\"I always think you should punish regimes but not the people of the regime,\" he said. \"And from an investment perspective, there's also a lot of sense in there. When they, North Korea and South Korea , unite or come to an agreement, my assets there would be worth billions.\" \nDisclosure: NBC Universal is a minority stakeholder in Euronews, which is majority-held by Naguib Sawiris .
