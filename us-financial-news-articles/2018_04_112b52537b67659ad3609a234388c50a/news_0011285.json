The overall savings rate, which includes businesses, households and the government, adjusted for depreciation fell to 1.3 percent of the national income in the fourth quarter, he said. \n\"Lacking in saving and wanting to grow, we import surplus savings from aboard to square the circle,\" he said. \"China loans us their surplus saving to help us square the circle. And so, if they stop doing that where are we going to get the money from?\" \nEarlier Wednesday, China announced additional tariffs on 106 U.S. products. The move came less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump unveiled a list of Chinese imports the administration plans to target as part of what the president deems unfair trade practices. \nTreasury purchases have not been brought to the table, but some fear that could come to pass if tensions escalate. \nSo far, there have been mixed messages coming from China on the issue. \nOn Tuesday night, China's ambassador to the U.S., Cui Tiankai, responded to a question on Treasury bond purchases simply by saying that, \"If the other side makes a wrong choice, we have no alternative but to fight back.\" \nHowever, on Wednesday, China's vice finance minister, Zhu Guangyao, told CNBC's Eunice Yoon the government is not considering reducing its holdings anytime soon . \nâ€” CNBC's Natasha Turak contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T23:42:57.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
