It will be a symbolic step which serves to stifle non-government groups.”\n“At this moment we need to think about how that might affect us who support them, and how we might proceed,” he said, declining to confirm news that OSF was definitely on its way out of Hungary to Berlin.\nReporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-20T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T17:53:26.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
