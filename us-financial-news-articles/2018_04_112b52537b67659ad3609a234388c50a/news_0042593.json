REUTERS/Stefanie Loos/File Photo \nClaudia Kueck, a prosecutor in the northern city of Bremen, said some 1,200 people were likely to have been wrongly granted asylum, the majority of them members of the Yazidi ethnic group. She said prosecutors were also investigating three lawyers, an interpreter and an intermediary suspected of involvement. \nMore than a million migrants, many fleeing conflict in the Middle East, have arrived in Germany since mid-2015. Concerns about integration and security since then have boosted support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD), which won seats in the national parliament in Septemberâ€™s election. \nKueck said the people wrongly granted asylum had deliberately been taken to Bremen, a small city state, from other states around Germany, to file their applications.

The properties included two law offices. \nThe BAMF could not immediately comment on the report when contacted by Reuters.
