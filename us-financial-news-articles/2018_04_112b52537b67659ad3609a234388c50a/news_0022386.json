The people asked not to be named as the details of the deal had not been revealed.\nNaked Hub, headquartered in Shanghai, has around 50 opened and planned locations across mainland China, Hong Kong and Vietnam. Its chief executive told Reuters in January the firm was looking to expand around Asia and have 200 locations by 2020.\nWeWork, backed by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, is one of the world’s hottest start-ups. It received $4.4 billion in investments from the Japanese firm and its technology fund last year and has been valued at around $17 billion.\nThe U.S. firm leases office space and rents it out to individuals and small companies. It said in February it expected to double its membership to 400,000 people this year and would open 200 new office spaces around the world.
