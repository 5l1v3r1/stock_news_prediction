In fact, multiple vendors may form a partnership to offer us a competitive solution.\" \nEarlier this week, the Pentagon released its second draft request for proposal for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure or JEDI cloud. The second draft proposal is expected to be the last one before the Pentagon releases a final proposal in May.
