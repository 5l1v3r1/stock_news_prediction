Bharti Infratel Ltd, the telecommunications tower arm of top Indian mobile carrier Bharti Airtel, said it will allot shares worth $120 million to cornerstone investors as part of its up to $832 million initial public offering. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri (INDIA - Tags: BUSINESS TELECOMS) Seeking to capitalise on rapid growth in smartphone usage in the country, the transaction, which values Indus Towers at roughly $10 billion, will create an infrastructure giant with more than 163,000 towers, lagging only China Tower.\nTop Indian telecoms carrier Bharti Airtel, the majority owner of Bharti Infratel, will be the biggest shareholder in the combined company followed by Vodafone Group Plc. Indus’ two other main shareholders, Idea Cellular and Providence Equity Partners, will have an option to cash out.\nBharti Airtel also said separately it would sound out potential investors with a view to selling stakes in the combined entity.\nThe deal comes amid a vicious price war in the sector that has helped spur a rush of M&A activity, including a planned merger of Vodafone’s Indian unit and Idea that threatens Bharti Airtel’s position as India’s biggest phone carrier.\nVodafone and Idea had flagged they would look at selling their stakes in Indus and other tower assets they separately own to help cut debt for the merged telecoms carrier.\nUnder the deal, Bharti Infratel, which currently owns 42 percent of Indus Towers, will pay 1,565 of its own shares for each Indus Towers share, the companies said in a statement.\nBharti Airtel will hold between 33.8 percent to 37.2 percent of the combined business, whose name will remain Indus Towers. Vodafone, which will be issued new shares in exchange for its 42 percent stake, will gain between 26.7 percent and 29.4 percent.\nBharti Airtel shares climbed on the deal to be up 3 percent in afternoon trade while shares in Bharti Infratel were trading 0.6 percent lower.\nIdea has the option of selling its 11.2 percent stake in Indus for about $1 billion or receiving new shares in the combined firm. Providence has the option to receive cash or shares for 3.35 percent of its 4.85 percent holding in Indus, with the remainder exchanged for shares in the combined firm.\nThe new Indus Towers board will have 11 members - three each from Bharti Airtel and Vodafone, one from KKR or Canada Pension Plan Investment Board as well as four independent members.\nKKR and CPPIB last year bought a combined stake of more than 10 percent of Bharti Infratel.\nThe deal is expected to close before end-March next year.\nWhile telecom tower operators in India have benefited from growing demand from carriers that have rolled out high-speed 4G services, they have also lost tenants in some areas as several money-losing carriers shutdown operations.\n($1 = 66.5675 Indian rupees)\nBharti Infratel Limited initial public offering (IPO) application forms lie on a pavement for distribution in New Delhi December 12, 2012.
