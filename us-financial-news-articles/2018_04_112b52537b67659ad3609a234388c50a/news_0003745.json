Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015. \nThe government could keep the entire property as a national monument for conservation, it could retain only the room with most historical significance (the dining room) and demolish the rest, or it could knock down the property and redevelop the site. \nBy releasing the report, the committee said it hoped at least one aspect of the matter had been settled. “With this, we hope to close the chapter on this topic, and focus on other pressing national issues ahead of us,” said Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who chaired the panel. \nLee Hsien Loong may not be running the government that makes the final decision. He said in October he intends to step down and hand over to a successor in a couple of years time. \nHis younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, who owns the property, and sister Lee Wei Ling, who still lives there, had wanted the house to be eventually demolished in accordance with what they say were their father’s wishes as stated in his will. \nLast summer they accused their brother, the prime minister, of seeking to turn the home into a shrine to a political dynasty. They also said they feared their brother was going to use the organs of the state against them. \nThe prime minister last year denied there was any abuse of power and questioned whether his father really wanted the home, which is near Singapore’s bustling Orchard Road shopping district, to be knocked down. \nThe committee said in its view “that while Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s preference was for the Property to be demolished, he was prepared to accept options other than demolition,” adding that their conclusions were made on the grounds that the house had an “architectural, heritage and historical significance”. \nThe public conflict that gripped Singapore for at least a month last year prompted a two-day long parliamentary debate which found no evidence of abuse of power. Prime Minister Lee’s siblings called the debate a “whitewash” at the time. \nIn a statement on Facebook after the report was issued, the prime minister noted he had recused himself from the discussions and said that the committee was correct to point out that there was no need for a decision now as his sister was still living in the house. \n“I hope that when the time comes to decide on what to do with the house, this report will help the Government of the day to make an informed decision that both respects my father’s wishes and is in the public interest,” he said.
