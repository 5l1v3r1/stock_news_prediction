Japanese car exports to the U.S. are booming, lifted by the growing popularity of SUVs among American consumers. It’s a sore point for President Donald Trump, the WSJ’s Sean McLain writes, and stakes are high for Japan, whose auto industry is far more important than its steel industry. While many Japanese cars sold in the U.S. are assembled at American plants, those factories are weighted heavily toward sedans. Toyota Motor Corp. is importing more RAV4s from Japanese plants, while Nissan Motor Co.’s exports to the U.S. rose by a third last year, led by its Rogue crossover SUV. The U.S. share of the Japanese car market remains tiny, partly because Japanese buyers prefer smaller, more fuel-efficient models.\nCMA CGM SA is expanding its reach into supply chains with a stake in global operator Ceva Logistics. The world’s No. 3 container shipping line is taking a 25% stake in the Netherlands-based logistics giant and says the companies will “explore possible cooperations” in services to shippers. Reuters reports the shipping line will subscribe for mandatory convertible securities in Ceva for up to about $400 million as Ceva prepares for an initial public offering on the Swiss stock exchange. The agreement comes amid upheaval in the shipping business following a downturn that triggered major consolidation among the world’s biggest operators. The remaining carriers are looking for ways to differentiate their services beyond port-to-port container operations to reach deeper into the supply chains of international shippers.\nConsumer-goods companies are struggling to raise prices as shoppers hunt for bargains online . That has left companies like Procter & Gamble Co. struggling to pass along rising supply-chain costs as they try to pull in more revenue from consumers by selling more products . Prices at P&G fell 2% in the first quarter, and barely budged upward at Unilever PLC and Nestlé SA, the WSJ’s Saabira Chaudhuri, Brian Blackstone and Sharon Terlep write. Many U.S. shoppers now buy household staples on the cheap from Amazon.com Inc. or from discount retailers, making it harder for companies to raise prices there. Surging transportation costs are also crimping margins for shippers, as strong demand and near-record spot-market prices give carriers leverage in freight contracts. Werner Enterprises Inc. said one key measure of its pricing was up 10% in the first quarter.\nE-COMMERCE The Port of Los Angeles. Photo: Bloomberg News Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is betting on Thailand as it looks for new markets. The Chinese e-commerce giant signed a deal to build a regional logistics center there, WSJ’s James Hookway writes, and is pledging to invest in digital partnerships and joint ventures that Thai officials said add up to $350 million. It’s part of a broader push to develop Thailand’s industrial eastern seaboard, including a slew of logistics projects that will include new roads and rail lines. Alibaba is the first big name to sign on, and it comes as Alibaba and other e-commerce companies are expanding in Southeast Asia. The Thailand venture could boost Thai exports to China, helping local farmers and small businesses in a country whose economic growth has lagged behind its neighbors.\nA longtime fuel discount in distribution channels may be ending. Oil prices are hitting their highest levels in more than three years amid tightening U.S. inventories. Although prices have pulled back a bit since mid-week, WSJ’s Alison Sider and Sarah McFarlane write that rising demand in a growing global economy could push them still higher . So could the potential extension of a pact to cut production by major oil exporters who are meeting this week to discuss compliance with the agreement. Fuel prices are becoming an increasingly important factor in shipping costs. The average U.S. price of $3.104 per gallon hasn’t been as high since January 2015. And bunker prices for carriers are near highest levels of the past year, close to $400 per metric ton in Singapore.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ “It looks like we’ve gone from all price and no volume to all volume and no price. ’\n—Graeme Pitkethly, finance chief at Unilever.\nNumber of the Day 11.5% Share of world-wide container shipping capacity held by CMA CGM, according to Alphaliner.\nIN OTHER NEWS U.S. jobless claims fell for the third time in four weeks .
