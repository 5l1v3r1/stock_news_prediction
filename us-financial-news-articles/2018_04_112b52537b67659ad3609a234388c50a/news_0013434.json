It was a fantastic job today. I hope that this will only be the start.”\nThe result equalled Toro Rosso’s second best to date.\nIt also gave new power unit partners Honda a boost after a bruising three-years with McLaren marked by unreliability and a lack of performance blamed chiefly on their engines.\nThey split with the former champions, who now use Renault power, at the end of last season and have enjoyed a far more promising start to their partnership with the Red Bull sister team.\nThe combination looked quick and reliable in pre-season testing with none of the frustration many had predicted.\nGasly felt Sunday’s result, at a power sensitive track, was validation of the progress Honda had made even if he was helped by a double retirement for Red Bull and Ferrari’s Kimi Raikkonen also failing to finish.\n“They (Honda) had a tough couple of years and it’s a great way to motivate them and show them we need to keep pushing,” he said.\n“To finish fourth in Formula One you need to have a good engine. So, the engine is good.” (Editing by Alan Baldwin)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-09T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:15:57.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
