Buses transferring fighters from one of them to opposition territory in northern Syria under safe passage from the government continued to leave on Monday, state media said.\nOn Friday, state television and a war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State and the rebels had agreed to surrender the south Damascus area, withdrawing to territory their comrades control in other parts of the country.\nHowever, the fighting has continued and the Observatory said on Monday that it was because some of the Islamic State fighters had rejected the surrender agreement.\nThe continued bombardment was directed only at the area held by Islamic State, the Observatory added.\nState television broadcast live footage showing the area of Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp and the al-Hajar al-Aswad district with large plumes of smoke rising from several places.\nUNRWA, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinians, said on Sunday that conditions in Yarmouk were hellish. “There must be safe passage for the sick and the wounded and the dying civilians,” said Chris Gunness, the UNRWA spokesman.\nReporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T13:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T13:53:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
