The Flames had scored just 13 goals in their previous 10 games and tied their season-high with seven goals in a game.\nJon Gillies finished with 26 saves for the Flames in picking up just his third win in nine decisions (3-5-1) this season.\nCody Eakin scored the only goal for Pacific Division-winner Vegas (51-24-7, 109) which will play the Los Angeles Kings in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs next week.\nMarc-Andre Fleury, playing for the first time since a 3-2 win over San Jose on March 31 while resting up for the playoffs, stopped just 12 of the 18 shots he faced before getting pulled after the second period in favor of Malcolm Subban. Subban finished with 12 saves.\nCalgary scored three goals in the first 7:31 en route to a 3-0 lead after one period. Gaudreau started the scoring with a tap-in off a pass across the crease by Micheal Ferland for his 24th of the season. Jankowski followed with his first goal of the night just 10 seconds later when he finished a 2-on-1 with Gaudreau with a shot into a wide-open left side of the net.\nJankowski got his second a little over three minutes later when his pass from behind the goal hit the back of Fleury’s pad and caromed into the net.\nEakin cut the lead to 3-1 just 51 seconds into the second period when he intercepted a pass near his own blue line and beat Gillies on a breakaway. But the Flames answered with goals by Hathaway, Foo and Jankowski over a 7:30 span to increase their lead to 6-1 after two periods.\nJankowski became the first Calgary player since Sam Bennett on Jan. 13, 2016 against Florida to score four goals in a game when he tapped in a rebound of a Brouwer shot into the left side of the net early in the third period.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:17:21.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
