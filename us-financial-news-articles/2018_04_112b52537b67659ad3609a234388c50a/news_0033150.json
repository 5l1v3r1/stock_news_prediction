Electrify America said the fast chargers will deliver 20 miles of range per minute of charge, seven times faster than chargers currently in operation. \nOther suppliers chosen include Portugal’s Efacec Electric Mobility, S.A. and Santa Ana, California-based BTC Power Inc. \nVW has agreed to spend $800 million in California and a total of $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of its agreement with federal regulators after admitting to diesel emissions cheating. \nABB said it would supply its Terra HP charging stations, which can recharge “even the largest electric vehicle battery in under 15 minutes.” \nA lack of public charging infrastructure for U.S. consumers to recharge their vehicles is seen is as a major barrier to the mass adoption of electric vehicles as consumers remain concerned over their limited range.
