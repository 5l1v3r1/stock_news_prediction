Brin's letter also acknowledges the risk of artificial intelligence, which he says that Google is taking seriously.\nHowever, such powerful tools also bring with them new questions and responsibilities. How will they affect employment across different sectors? How can we understand what they are doing under the hood? What about measures of fairness? How might they manipulate people? Are they safe?\nThere is serious thought and research going into all of these issues. Most notably, safety spans a wide range of concerns from the fears of sci-fi style sentience to the more near-term questions such as validating the performance of self-driving cars.\nBut Brin does not mention the debate that has erupted within Google over the company's partnership with the Pentagon to use artificial intelligence to interpret drone videos. Since Google revealed the contract, thousands of employees signed a petition urging the company not to be involved in \"the business of war.\"\nBrin says that Alphabet is focused on moving forward with \"deep responsibility, care, and humility.\"\n\"I expect machine learning technology to continue to evolve rapidly and for Alphabet to continue to be a leader â€” in both the technological and ethical evolution of the field,\" he writes.\nRead the full letter here .\nshow chapters More pain ahead for Alphabet? 22 Hours Ago | 01:46", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/sundar-pichai-ai-first-world-2016-4", "https://abc.xyz/investor/founders-letters/2017/index.html"], "published": "2018-04-28T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T03:42:03.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
