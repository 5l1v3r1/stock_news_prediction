It gives both sides time to negotiate, which I think is the strategy for both the U.S. and China.”\nChina’s retaliation came after trading hours for Japan’s Nikkei, which added 0.2 percent in thin volume, while Chinese blue chips ended down 0.2 percent.\nMSCI’s all-country world index of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.45 percent, cutting about half earlier losses. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 0.43 percent.\nThe FTSE index closed up 0.05 percent, while the DAX closed down 0.39 percent and France’s CAC 40 index fell 0.18 percent.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 145.05 points, or 0.6 percent, to 23,888.31. The S&P 500 lost 8.86 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,605.59 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.37 points, or 0.09 percent, to 6,934.92.\nShares of Boeing, the single largest U.S. exporter to China, tumbled 2.6 percent. Caterpillar fell 1.67 percent.\nChina and the United States are likely to hold prolonged negotiations on trade and lead investors to recognize equity fundamentals remain strong as the results of first-quarter corporate earnings will show in coming weeks, Arone said.\n“My view is this is more trade poker than it is trade policy,” he said.\nThe dollar index fell 0.15 percent, with the euro up 0.2 percent to $1.2293. The Japanese yen firmed 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 106.58 per dollar.\nCrude bounced off session lows after U.S. data showed a weekly decline in crude stocks, instead of the increase analysts had expected. U.S. crude was down 42 cents to $63.09 per barrel and Brent slid 41 cents to $67.71.\nBorrowing costs nudged lower in Europe even as the first March reading on euro zone inflation, important data for markets as the European Central Bank looks to wind down its massive monetary stimulus, came in firm at 1.4 percent.\nBenchmark 10-year notes last were little changed in price to yield 2.7826 percent. Germany’s 10-year bund rose in price to yield 0.499 percent.\nU.S. gold futures rose 0.13 percent at $1,339.10 an ounce.\nAdditional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney, Helen Reid and Dhara Ranasinghe in London Editing by Louise Ireland and Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-05T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T00:21:35.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
