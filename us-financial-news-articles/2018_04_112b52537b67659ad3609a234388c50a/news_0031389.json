REUTERS/Thomas White The healthcare conglomerate, whose stock had climbed about 3 percent over the previous six days, reported better-than-expected profit in the first quarter, helped by strong demand for its cancer treatments.\nJ&J said it was not revising its earnings forecast higher for the year because certain divestments it previously expected to make this year might be pushed into 2019.\n“I’m definitely surprised by the stock reaction,” said Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Jeff Jonas. “There was some expectation that they would raise EPS guidance this quarter just because foreign exchange has gotten better and the business did do pretty well.”\nShares were down $1.99 at $129.63 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\nJohnson & Johnson products are displayed for sale in Solana Beach, California, U.S., July 17, 2017.
