It was the eighth three-homer game in Padres history and the first since Hunter Renfroe accomplished the feat last season.\nThe Padres scored first for the first time this year on Villanueva’s first homer, a drive off Rockies left-handed starter Kyle Freeland that struck the “N” just below the roof of the Western Metal Supply Co. building down the left field line.\nAfter the Rockies took a 3-1 lead, Villanueva connected for his second homer off Freeland, a line drive into the second deck in left.\nVillanueva’s third homer was a three-run shot in the seventh off Rockies reliever Antonio Senzatela. Villanueva was hit by a pitch in his other plate appearance and scored, giving him career highs of four runs and five RBIs.\nThe Padres took the lead for good with three runs in the sixth. Jose Pirela opened the inning with a single and moved to third on Renfroe’s double off Freeland. After Villanueva was hit above the left elbow by a Scott Oberg pitch, Galvis grounded a two-run single to right to give San Diego a 4-3 lead. Villanueva subsequently scored on a swinging bunt by Carlos Asuaje.\nThe win went to right-hander Tyson Ross, who was pitching in his first game for the Padres since injuring his shoulder on Opening Day in 2016.\nAfter a slow start, Ross, who was activated Tuesday afternoon, allowed three runs on five hits and three walks with two strikeouts over six innings. He finished strong, retiring the last eight hitters he faced.\nFreeland (0-1) gave up four runs on five hits and two walks with six strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings.\nThe Rockies then took a 3-1 lead on a two-run, bases-loaded double by Nolan Arenado in the third and a run-scoring single by Chris Iannetta in the fourth.\nHowever, Ross and relievers Craig Stammen, Kirby Yates and Kazuhisa Makita retired 15 consecutive Rockies from the fourth to the ninth. Brad Hand struck out the only batter he faced to record his first save of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T13:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T17:14:45.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
