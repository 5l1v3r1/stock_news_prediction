Companies are just starting to roll out their results from the first months of the year, with Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) and BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) beating estimates when they reported on Thursday.\nThomson Reuters I/B/E/S expects S&P 500 .SPX companies' year-over-year earnings for the most recent quarter to rise by 18.4 percent.\n“People are encouraged by the fact that most pundits are predicting a pretty solid [first quarter] earnings season,” said Roseen.\nU.S. fund investor demand for shares outside their home country has grown more mixed. Emerging markets pulled in $1.2 billion, continuing their unbroken streak of inflows this year. Japanese equities attracted $332 million, their first week of inflows in the past seven weeks.\nBut investors peeled $751 million out of European stock funds for a sixth straight week of withdrawals as Citigroup Inc’s euro-zone economic surprise index .CESIEUR slumped to its lowest level since 2012.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
