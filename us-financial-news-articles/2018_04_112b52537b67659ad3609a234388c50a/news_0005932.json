Michigan got there by taking away Cinderella's slipper. \nThis end to March Madness should be good. \nA wild NCAA Tournament of upsets comes down to this: Villanova and its squadron of long-range shooters against Michigan and its ultra-stingy defense, Monday night at the Alamodome. \nThe Wildcats (35-4) turned a Final Four showdown with fellow No. 1 seed Kansas into a laugher, dropping in 3-pointers like they were playing pop-a-shot in the 95-79 rout. Villanova made a Final Four-record 18 3s in a record-matching 40 attempts, its second trip to the title game in three seasons never in doubt. \nThe third-seeded Wolverines (33-7) had a bit more trouble against the bracket's favorite underdogs, overcoming a frightful first half to send Loyola-Chicago and Sister Jean packing. \nThe Wolverines had trouble scoring in their Final Four game to trail Loyola-Chicago by seven at halftime, before finding the right gear in the second to run past the underdog Ramblers 69-57 into the title game. How to stop the 3? \nTheir next task: Find some way to slow Villanova's 3-ball roll. \nThe Wildcats were one of the most proficient 3-point shooting teams during the regular season and upped the 3 ante in the NCAA Tournament, knocking down a record 65 and counting. \nVillanova literally shot the lights out by the second half, when some scoreboards and upper-level lights went out for a few minutes and darkened the upper decks. \nMichigan may have a better answer than Kansas had. \nThe Wolverines have fixed the one thing holding them back in past seasons, developing a lockdown defense so they no longer have to simply outscore opponents. \nMichigan had the nation's No. 3 defense efficiency-wise and put Loyola on lockdown in the second half, holding the Ramblers to 1-of-7 shooting from 3 to send Sister Jean Delores Schmidt to the exits early. \nThe Wolverines are seeking their first national title since Glen Rice and Rumeal Robinson rumbled through the bracket in 1989.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T07:10:02.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
