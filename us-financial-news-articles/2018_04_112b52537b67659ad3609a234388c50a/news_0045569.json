Britain's Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell, speaks as he sets out Labour's demands for the Spring Statement, in London, Britain, March 9, 2018. REUTERS/Simon Dawson/File Photo \n“I’m quite attracted by the wider mandate that there is in America but we would retain Bank of England independence,” McDonnell told ITV’s Peston on Sunday show. \nAsked whether he thought such a shift was very likely, he said “Yes, it is.” \nBritain is not due to hold another national election until 2022, and is currently governed by Theresa May’s Conservatives. \nThe Bank of England’s interest rate-setting committee has a remit to maintain price stability and keep inflation at 2 percent, as well as supporting the government’s objectives for growth and employment. \nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has a mandate to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.

REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo \nMcDonnell said the party would publish its second report on the future of the Bank of England in late May or early June, and that he wanted as wide a debate as possible about what its aims should be. \nLast year, Labour said it would consider moving parts of the BoE to Birmingham, in central England, if it won power, arguing such a change was needed to reduce the economy’s reliance on London’s banking industry. \nAlthough Labour trails the Conservatives in most opinion polls, it is considered a viable future government given that May is undertaking a complex and divisive exit from the European Union without a parliamentary majority. \nThat prospect has unnerved some in the British financial services sector, who fear for the status quo as a result of the shift towards a socialist agenda undertaken by Labour since left-wing leader Jeremy Corbyn took power in 2015. \nOn Thursday, McDonnell, an outspoken critic of the banking system, offered London’s financial services industry a new pact, giving banks a seat at the policymaking table if Corbyn replaces May, in return for higher taxes.
