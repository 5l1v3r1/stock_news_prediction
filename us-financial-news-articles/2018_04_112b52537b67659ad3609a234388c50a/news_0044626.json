Secretary-General António Guterres strongly condemned air strikes on a wedding party in Yemen that killed at least 20 civilians on Sunday.\nSaudi Arabia and its mostly Gulf Arab allies accuse the Houthis of being proxies of their arch-rival Iran — charges the group and Tehran deny.\nThe Houthis control the capital Sanaa and are fighting forces loyal to the internationally-recognised government based in the southern port city of Aden. The government is backed by a mostly Gulf Arab alliance which in turn receives arms and other support from the United States and Britain.\nSamad was second on the coalition’s most wanted list of Houthi leaders, after al-Houthi. It had offered a $20 million reward for any information that led to Samad’s capture.\nThe death of Samad, the group’s Ansarullah political council chief, dealt one of the biggest blows yet to the Houthi in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and unleashed the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis.\nThe United Nations has been advancing efforts to bring the warring sides closer together and achieve a peace deal to spare the impoverished country further bloodshed.\n“This can potentially escalate the conflict, as it comes comes amidst tense political negotiations,” said Adam Baron of the European Council for Foreign Relations.\n“The Houthis will feel the need to respond,” he added.\nAl-Masirah reported that the Houthis had appointed Mahdi al-Mashat, once director of al-Houthi’s office, to replace Samad.\nResidents and medical sources said coalition air strikes also killed at least 20 people attending a wedding in a village in northwestern Yemen on Sunday night, and about 30 people were wounded. The coalition said it would investigate the report.\nThe United Nations’ Guterres also called for a prompt and transparent investigation.\n“The Secretary-General reminds all parties of their obligations under international humanitarian law concerning the\nprotection of civilians and civilian infrastructure during armed\nconflicts,” a U.N. statement said.\nThe coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people, although it says it does not target civilians.\nReporting by Sarah Dadouch, Marwa Rashad and Mohammed Ghobari; Writing by Noah Browning; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T11:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T12:08:55.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
