Gallagher scored in each of the four wins over Detroit.\nArtturi Lehkonen had the other Montreal goal while Antti Niemi stopped 23 shots.\nDylan Larkin had a goal and an assist for the Wings. Tyler Bertuzzi and Darren Helm also scored, while Jared Coreau made 24 saves.\nDeslauriers’ first goal of the game gave Montreal an early lead. He redirected Noah Juulsen’s shot from the point.\nLarkin’s individual effort tied the score late in the period. He whizzed past three defenders, then flipped a backhander just inside the goalpost for his 15th goal.\nBertuzzi’s goal early in the second put the Wings on top 2-1.\nThe lead was short-lived. A goalie interference call against the Wings’ Justin Abdelkader prevented Detroit from gaining a two-goal advantage.\nA Wings giveaway in Montreal’s zone resulted in a 2-on-0 break for the Canadiens. Gallagher took a pass from Jonathan Drouin and ripped a shot past Coreau for his 31st goal.\nDeslauriers scored his second goal exactly three minutes later at the 14:39 mark. He made a steal near his own blue line, skated in along the right boards and fired a shot through Coreau’s five-hole to give the Canadiens a 3-2 lead.\nAnother Wings turnover, this one at center ice, led to Montreal’s next goal.\nLehkonen pounced on the loose puck, gave it up to Logan Shaw, then got it back on a 3-on-1 break and beat Coreau.\nHelm narrowed Montreal’s lead to 4-3 moments later. Larkin dropped off a pass near the blue line and Helm scored from the slot.\nNiemi robbed Anthony Mantha in the final minute to preserve the Montreal victory.\nMontreal won the first three meetings by a combined score of 20-6.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T10:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:53:20.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
