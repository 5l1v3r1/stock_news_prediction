Keuchel struck out three and didn’t walk a batter.\nThe win was the ninth in the past 11 games for the Athletics, who started the season 5-10 and now are 14-12.\nMarcus Semien, Pinder and Chapman had two hits apiece in Oakland’s 10-hit attack.\nThe Astros, who have lost three of their past four games (all to AL West rivals), managed just five hits off three Oakland pitchers.\nAfter a scoreless duel between Manaea and Keuchel through 3 1/2 innings, Carlos Correa started the scoring with an RBI single in the fourth to give the Astros a 1-0 lead.\nChapman tied the score with a solo home run off Keuchel in the fifth, and the A’s took charge in the sixth, thanks to a two-run homer by Pinder that pushed Oakland to a 3-1 lead.\nThe Athletics added three runs in the seventh off Keuchel on a single by Matt Olson that drove home Chapman and a two-run home run by Canha that brought Olson home.\nOakland capped the scoring with two runs in the eighth on former Astro Jed Lowrie’s triple off Joe Smith that plated Semien and Pinder.\nSaturday’s probables are former Texas A&M standout right-hander Daniel Mengden (2-2, 3.86 ERA) for Oakland and right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. (3-1, 4.67) for the Astros.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-28T11:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-29T17:44:12.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
