It also rejected Chahal's claim that prosecutors did not do enough to get his second accuser to testify at his parole revocation hearing.\nThe woman left for South Korea and declined to cooperate with prosecutors, according to court documents.\nNone of Chahal's arguments had \"merit,\" the appeals court said.\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that the judge revoked probation, not parole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T11:02:48.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
