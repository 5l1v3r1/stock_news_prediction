They want her to step down and offer a sincere apology to all employees and the public.\n“The controversy surrounding management taking advantage of its power has become the most-searched term and the subject of unending breaking news, and ... leading to criticism for around 20,000 employees who have devoted blood and sweat working on the front lines,” the unions said.\n“Why must our employees feel shame? Why must our employees, who have committed no crime, be the subject of criticism?”\nAlso on Sunday, Cho sent a mass email to Korean Air employees apologizing again for her actions, according to a copy of the email seen by Reuters.\n“As I was focusing on my passion for the work, I was unable to control my thoughtless words and deeds, through which I caused injury and disappointment for a lot of people,” Cho said.\nKorean Air confirmed that the email was sent to all Korean Air employees, but declined to comment further.\nDozens of petitions demanding that Cho be punished and “Korean” removed from the airline’s name were posted on Monday on the presidential Blue House’s online petition page.\nOne petition calling for the change to the company’s name had 44,374 signatures.\n“Around 20,000 Korean Air employees earnestly desire the continued use of our company name ‘Korean Air,’” the labor unions said in the statement.\nShares in Korean Air Lines fell 4 percent in early trade to a near three-week low, compared to a 0.1 percent fall in the broader market.
