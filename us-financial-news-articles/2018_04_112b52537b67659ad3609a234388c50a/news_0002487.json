It was the first Rohingya vessel spotted off Thailand in more than a year, local police said.\n“We treated them with humanitarian consideration and allowed them to return to sea because they told us they were heading to Malaysia,” Lanta police chief, Police Colonel M.L. Pattanajak Chakrabandhu told Reuters. Locals gave the refugees food and water, he said.\nTens of thousands of Rohingya fled by sea following an outbreak of sectarian violence in Rakhine State in 2012, some falling prey to human traffickers.\nThat exodus peaked in 2015, when an estimated 25,000 people fled across the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\nRights groups expect another surge in Rohingya boats reaching Southeast Asia, even if not at the levels of the past.\n“We have received credible information about boats full of Rohingya refugees making their way to Malaysia over the last few months,” Matthew Smith co-founder of advocacy group Fortify Rights told Reuters. “The humanitarian situation in Bangladesh for the refugees is very difficult.”\nReporting by Aukkarapon Niyomyat and Panu Wongcha-um; editing by John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-01T14:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T14:16:24.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
