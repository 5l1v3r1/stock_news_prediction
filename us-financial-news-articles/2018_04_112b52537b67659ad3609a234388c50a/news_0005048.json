Toronto finished with a total of 15 hits and also drew five walks.\nJ.A. Happ (1-1) picked up the win, lasting 5 1/3 innings and allowing four runs off seven hits and a walk. He fanned nine.\nMiguel Gonzalez absorbed the loss in his first start of the year, pitching five innings and yielding eight hits. He was charged with six runs, five of which were earned, walked two and whiffed four.\nNicky Delmonico’s RBI single in the second put the White Sox on top 1-0, but Diaz erased that lead with a two-run bomb over the left field wall in the second, his second of the year.\nTim Anderson cracked a solo homer in the fourth to pull Chicago within 3-2, but Diaz and Donaldson went to work in the fourth. Diaz drilled an RBI double that scored Pillar, although Diaz was thrown out at third. After Granderson tripled, Donaldson pulled a two-run homer over the wall in left, giving him homers in five straight games against Chicago pitching.\nAvisail Garcia’s solo homer pulled the White Sox within 6-3 in the fifth, and Adam Engel’s infield out made it a 6-4 game in the sixth. Donaldson tacked on his third RBI in the Blue Jays’ sixth to restore a three-run lead.\nYolmer Sanchez drew Chicago within 7-5 in the eighth when he walloped his first homer of the year to right-center, but Toronto removed any doubt about the outcome with its biggest inning of the young season.\nAnderson finished 3-for-4 with three runs for the White Sox. Garcia and Jose Abreu each collected two hits.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-04T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T12:13:27.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
