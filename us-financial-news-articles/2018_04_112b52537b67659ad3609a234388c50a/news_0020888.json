On April 2, Indian soldiers killed at least three civilians and wounded 70 more when hundreds of people tried to prevent another security operation. \nAs word of the deaths spread on Wednesday, thousands took to the streets of the capital Srinagar, chanting slogans such as “We want freedom” and “Go India, go back”. \nSchools, colleges and businesses in the Kashmir valley closed in answer to a strike call from separatists in protest at the killings.

REUTERS/Danish Ismail \nAuthorities reacted with a security clampdown, shutting down internet services in southern parts of Kashmir and suspending train services south of Srinagar. \nTwenty more people were wounded in Wednesday’s confrontation between protesters and security forces south of Srinagar, according to S.P. Vaid, the state director general of police.
