It has fallen 3 percent from a 2018 high above $1.2550 in mid-February.\nEuro zone firms ended the first quarter with their weakest expansion since the start of 2017, according to the March Purchasing Managers’ surveys. Inflation rose less than estimated last month and investor morale in powerhouse economy Germany has tumbled.\nMORE EVIDENCE Tuesday’s data showed business morale in Germany, France and Italy — the euro zone’s three biggest economies — deteriorated in April as a stronger currency and capacity constraints limited output.\nDespite the recent softness in data — the Citi economic surprise index for the eurozone is now at its lowest since June 2012 — markets remain stubbornly bullish on the euro with overall bets still near record highs as longer-term expectations remain optimistic.\n“The ECB will have to collect more evidence that the recent data moderation is indeed a soft patch and not the first sign of a more enduring slowdown in the economy,” said Luigi Speranza, head of European economics at BNP Paribas in London.\nElsewhere, the dollar held at a three-month high against a basket of currencies, after having received a boost from U.S. 10-year Treasury yields holding near the key 3 percent level.\nThe dollar’s index against a basket of six major peers rose to as high as 91.076, its strongest since Jan. 12. The dollar index was last steady on the day at 90.989.\nThe dollar set a two-month high of 108.87 yen and was holding near those levels.\nThe rise in U.S. bond yields has dented emerging market currencies and bond markets, including those in Asia.\nHigher U.S. yields can put pressure on the currencies of emerging market countries that run current account deficits such as Indonesia and India, said Satoshi Okagawa, senior global markets analyst for Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation in Singapore.\nA stronger dollar also intensified pressure on some commodity-linked currencies such as the New Zealand dollar which tumbled 0.3 percent to 0.7129 per dollar.\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by Masayuki Kitano in SINGAPORE Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-04-24T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T02:17:09.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
