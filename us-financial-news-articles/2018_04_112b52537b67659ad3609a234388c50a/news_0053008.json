Investors still have their doubts, however.\n“In the UK while we remain broadly positive there are a lot of headwinds as the Brexit negotiations continue. The market will swing on news on a daily basis,” said Gary Waite, portfolio manager at Walker Crips.\n“It’s got the lowest growth rate among developed economies, so on a relative trade the marginal capital is better deployed in emerging markets, U.S. and Japanese equities,” he added.\nIn other results-driven moves, Madame Tussauds owner Merlin Entertainments gained 3.2 percent, rising to the top of the FTSE 250 after reporting trading in line with expectations.\nThe group said visits to its London attractions were however still suffering from the impact of last year’s militant attacks in Britain.\nCarpetright shares were up 11.3 percent on the small-cap index after the struggling retailer’s creditors and landlords approved its restructuring plan.
