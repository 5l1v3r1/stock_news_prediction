I don’t see that, that would be an awful a lot of momentum” and would call for a reassessment of his assessment of labor market slack, Evans told reporters after a speech at the Chicago Rotary Club. Still, he said, “I don’t think 2.25 (percent) is something to get our nose out of joint over,” he said, especially if projections for the following year were for inflation to cool a bit.\nReporting by Tom Polansek, writing by Ann Saphir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T22:29:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
