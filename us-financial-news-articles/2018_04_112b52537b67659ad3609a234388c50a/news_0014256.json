REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo Asian buyers helped propel sales in products ranging from LVMH’s high-end cognacs to Bulgari jewelery, and the group said business in Hong Kong and Macau had rebounded strongly.\nBut headwinds still lurk and investors have been seeking reassurance that the sector’s revival was not running out of steam, especially as earnings comparisons against a strong 2017 may not be as favorable.\nTrade tensions between the United States and China could have a knock-on effect on the sector if they hurt sentiment among shoppers.\nA strong euro is a disadvantage, meanwhile, as it can put tourists off from spending and can hurt sales made in other currencies when converted back.\nCurrencies had a 10 percent negative impact on LVMH’s sales in the first quarter, more than some analysts had expected.\nYet the group has some levers it can count on to mitigate that risk, including raising prices.\nThe cost of Louis Vuitton’s high-margin handbags rose around 1.7 percent to 1.8 percent on average in the quarter, the first hike in three to four years, Guiony said.\nEditing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Alexandra Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:06:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
