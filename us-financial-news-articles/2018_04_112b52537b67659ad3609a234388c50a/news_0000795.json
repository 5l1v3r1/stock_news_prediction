Jake Voracek and Oskar Lindblom set up Patrick’s goal, his 11th in the last 14 games.\nThe Flyers couldn’t hold the lead as the Bruins quickly got within 3-2 with 13:06 left as Pastrnak’s shot deflected off Andrew MacDonald and into the net.\nBoston went with an extra skater for the final 1:36 when it pulled Khudobin. The move paid off as Philadelphia wasn’t able to clear the puck and the Bruins tied the game at 3 with 3.8 seconds left as Bergeron scored to send the game into overtime.\nThe Flyers took a 2-0 advantage just 25 seconds into the second when Konecny moved the puck through two Bruins and scored a spectacular goal. Konecny has been red hot lately and recorded his 24th goal of the season.\nPhiladelphia had a two-on-none break and couldn’t score and the Bruins came right back and sliced the lead in half to get within 2-1 when Acciari scored with 5:35 remaining.\nThe Bruins led 29-15 in shots on goal through two periods.\nGiroux gave the Flyers a 1-0 lead with 10:22 remaining in the first with an impressive one-timer into the back of the net. It was Giroux’s 28th goal of the season, tying a career high before setting a new mark in overtime. The captain also scored 28 goals in the 2011-12 and 2013-14 seasons.\nThe Bruins had more scoring chances in the first, outshooting the Flyers 12-7. But Giroux put the Flyers ahead and Mrazek stopped all 12 Boston shots.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:47:26.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
