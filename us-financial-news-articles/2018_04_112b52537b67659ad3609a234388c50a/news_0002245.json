The profile information was used for targeted political ads.\nCook last week questioned the practice of monetizing user data on social platforms. Facebook executives have long said the service will always be free for users, but that such a model requires selling advertising based on anonymous user information.\nshow chapters Zuckerberg responds to Apple’s Facebook critique 6 Hours Ago | 02:55 \"You know, I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib.

Because that sounds ridiculous to me,\" he said.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
