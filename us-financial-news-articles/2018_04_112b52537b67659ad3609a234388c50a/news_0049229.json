This led to a rise in longer-term JGB yields, with the benchmark 10-year yield touching a peak of 0.065 percent, the highest since March 2.\nThe 20-year JGB yield climbed as high as 0.550 percent at one point, matching a level last recorded on March 5.\nJGBs later regained their footing, with market participants citing buying on dips by domestic players, especially in super-long bonds.\nThe lead June 10-year JGB futures contract edged up 0.05 point to 150.63, having recovered from a 2-1/2-month low of 150.43 set earlier on Monday.\nThe 10-year JGB yield was last steady on the day at 0.055 percent. The 20-year JGB yield was 0.5 basis point higher on the day at 0.535 percent, but down from the seven-week high set earlier on Monday.
