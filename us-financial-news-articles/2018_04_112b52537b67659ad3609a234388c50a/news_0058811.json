During “off times,” the app is inaccessible, meaning children will be unable to send or receive messages or video calls, use the creative camera to take or send photos or receive notifications.\nAll Sleep Mode settings are controlled from the parent’s Facebook account and can be changed at any time.\nMessenger Kids, which is aimed at children from 6 to 12, launched in December. While some parents have said that they appreciate having control over their children’s social media access, it’s still been met with controversy. Facebook itself recently faced a number of questions from Congress over how user data it collects is handled, especially when those users are minors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T20:51:16.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
