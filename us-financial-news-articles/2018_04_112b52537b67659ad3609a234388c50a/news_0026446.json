REUTERS/Stephane Mahe \nThe continuing violence in the Notre-Dame-des-Landes region, near the city of Nantes in western France, is a challenge for President Emmanuel Macron who also faces student sit-ins as he tries to push through education and economic reforms. \nIn Paris, police were called in to evict 200 protesters who had occupied part of the Sorbonne university overnight.
