He reiterated his equal-weight rating for the stock.\nThe analyst also raised the stakes for Tesla shareholders, saying the developments over the next few months could move the stock significantly up or down.\n\"We see the next three months as the most critical time in Tesla's history since the Model S launch six years ago. The fundamental pendulum could move in either direction or in both directions in a big way, making Tesla the ultimate high risk name in autos,\" he wrote in the report entitled \"Tesla's Next Move: $200 or $400?\"\nAlthough Telsa stated it doesn't need to raise capital this year, the analyst expects the company will raise $2.5 billion in its third quarter through a stock sale. Jonas noted the investor community is still skeptical of the car maker's Model 3 production targets.\n\"No investor that we have spoken to expects Model 3 production of 5k/week by the end of 2Q'18,\" he wrote. \"We don't expect a 5k/week run-rate to be achieved before late 4Q'18.\"\nTesla shares rose 2 percent Wednesday, a day after Elon Musk sent an email to Telsa employees setting a new internal goal of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-18T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:43:19.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
