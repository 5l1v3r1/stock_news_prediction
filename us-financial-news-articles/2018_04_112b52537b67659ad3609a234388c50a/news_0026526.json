The companies have filed an all-parties settlement agreement in the merger proceeding before the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (the \"Commission\"). This represents a full settlement which all parties have agreed is consistent with the public interest.\n\"I would like to thank all the parties in Idaho that worked together to reach this significant milestone,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. \"The settlement agreements we have obtained in Washington, Idaho and Alaska speak to the long-term benefits of the merger of Hydro One and Avista for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. We are optimistic that we will satisfy all reasonable concerns in all jurisdictions.\"\n\"We believe this settlement agreement represents a positive outcome that is broadly supported by the parties and meets the standards for approval in Idaho,\" Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. \"The settlement agreement reinforces the commitments we've made to our stakeholders in each of the states we serve to maintain our local presence and decision-making, increase our charitable contributions and continue to support economic development, innovation and community involvement. We're confident our partnership with Hydro One enhances our ability to provide exceptional service and support to our customers and communities well into the future.\"\nThe settlement agreement includes financial and non-financial commitments that align in value with the settlement agreement reached in Washington. The settlement agreement in Idaho confirms our commitment to customers, community investment and long-term environmental protections.
