REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nThe move came as GM Korea averted bankruptcy with a last-minute wage deal with its labor union on Monday, paving the way for possible financial support from the government. \nGM had said it would fund its “portion of the $2.8 billion investment”, paving the way for two new sport utility vehicles to be built in South Korea, on condition of union concessions and the government support. \nState-run Korea Development Bank previously said it may offer about 500 billion won ($468.4 million), proportional to its 17 percent stake in GM Korea, to help fund GM’s investment in the unit.
