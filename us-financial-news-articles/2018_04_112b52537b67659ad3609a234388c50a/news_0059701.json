For bonds, Barclays Capital tops the list, followed by Citigroup, Janus Capital Management, JPMorgan, and Deutsche Bank. NERVOUS BROKERS\nA flurry of lists are set to be published on Monday and Tuesday across the EU.\n“If a fund manager and a broker really get on and that broker thinks they get all the fund manager’s flow, then on the 30th of April and they don’t appear, there is probably a bit of sensitivity there,” said Tim Cant, a financial lawyer at Ashurst.\n“People have been a bit nervous on the brokerage side.”\nThe list could also catch they eye of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the regulator of the EU’s biggest financial hub in London.\nThere will be cases where there are several affiliates of the firm on the list, raising questions about whether investors are really being offered the best deals.\n“If you only use one venue then that is a kind of red flashing alert in some ways. Why is this broker only using one venue, though there may be reasons for that,” Cant said.\n“But that is something the FCA would look at harder than at sheets where they do have five separate venues on them.”\nSome affiliates of Henderson, such as Janus Capital Management, feature on its lists.\nHenderson said in its disclosure statement there was no commercial incentive for Janus Henderson to route orders to different entities within the firm, and the prime objective was to assist the company in achieving the best possible outcome for clients.
