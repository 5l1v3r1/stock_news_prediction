It pulled back from a 2-1/2-month high of 109.200 set the previous day when the S&P 500 and the Dow posted their biggest declines since April 6.\nWhile the weakening by equities was supportive for the yen, often sought when stocks fall due to its perceived safe-haven status, analysts said the dollar was still likely headed for further gains in the longer term.\n“At first glance, the situation is similar to February, when U.S. yields rose sharply and equities tumbled. But the difference this time is that the response by equities is more measured, and yen demand stemming from ‘risk off’ is not nearly as strong,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.\n“The market’s attention is firmly back on interest rate differentials and this is likely to keep supporting the dollar going forward.”\nThe spreads between U.S. yields and those of its European and Japanese counterparts have widened significantly amid diverging monetary policy expectations.\nThis week the gap between U.S. and German 10-year government bond yields has hit its widest in 29 years and the U.S.-Japanese 10-year yield spread reached its broadest in nearly 11 years.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3 percent on Tuesday, reflecting the durability of the U.S. economic expansion. Accelerating inflation and concerns about increasing debt supply have also driven yields higher.\nWall Street dropped sharply on Tuesday as warnings by bellwether companies of higher costs stemming from the surge in yields reverberated.\nThe pound was 0.05 percent higher at $1.3989, crawling away from a one-month low of $1.3919 plumbed on Tuesday.\nThe Australian dollar traded at $0.7596 following a descent to a four-month trough of $0.7576 the previous day.\nThe New Zealand dollar extended losses and dipped to $0.7105 , its weakest since Jan. 4.
