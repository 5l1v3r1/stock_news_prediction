Witnesses said the men were calmly sitting in the cafe and in a widely viewed video, some patrons asked police whether they were targeted because they are black.\nPolice released the men, who were not charged.\n“The circumstances surrounding the incident and the outcome in our store on Thursday were reprehensible ... they were wrong,” Johnson told ABC’s Good Morning America on Monday, amid protests at the Philadelphia store and calls for a boycott on social media.\nThe incident, roughly a year after Johnson took the helm at Starbucks, comes at a time when the company is grappling with flat traffic and lackluster sales growth at its more than 14,000 US cafes. Johnson, who was interviewed from Philadelphia, said it was “completely inappropriate to engage the police.” He said a disciplinary review was underway and added that Starbucks would conduct training to prevent unconscious bias.\nIn a “mutual” decision, the manager who reported the men to police has left the company, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.\nRepresentatives from Starbucks did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the two men could not be immediately reached.\nReporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:40:08.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
