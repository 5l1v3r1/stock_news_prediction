REUTERS/Samsul Said/File Photo The market, however, is seen to be range-trading pending further leads, said a Kuala Lumpur-based trader.\nThe benchmark palm oil contract for June delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange slightly was up 0.1 percent at 2,425 ringgit ($625.32) a tonne at the midday break.\nPalm is down 3.2 percent for the week, poised for its sharpest weekly decline in five weeks.\nTrading volumes stood at 14,551 lots of 25 tonnes each at the midday break.\n“Palm prices may attempt to rebound after recent losses, but a recovery in rival oilseed may lend support and cushion the selling interest,” said another trader.\nPalm oil prices are affected by movements in rival edible oils, as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oils market.\nThe Chicago Board of Trade’s May soybean oil contract gained 0.2 percent, after dropping as much as 1 percent earlier this week.\nIn other related oils, the May soybean oil on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange slipped as much as 1 percent, while the Dalian May palm oil contract edged down up to 0.6 percent.\nPalm oil may test a resistance at 2,433 ringgit, as it seems to have stabilized around a support at 2,401 ringgit per tonne, said Wang Tao, a Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals.\nReporting by Emily Chow; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T09:33:58.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
