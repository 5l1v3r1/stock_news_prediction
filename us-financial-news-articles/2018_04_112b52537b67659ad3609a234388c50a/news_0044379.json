The television station took to Twitter to call the move “arbitrary and illegal.” \nWith the changes which were signed into law earlier this week, employees will now have to contribute 7 percent of their salary to social security, up from a current 6.25 percent. \nEmployers will have to contribute 22.5 percent of salaries from a current 19 percent. \nPensioners will also have 5 percent of their pension taken out to be used for medical expenses. \nThe changes to the pension system are aimed at shoring up Nicaragua’s social security system.
