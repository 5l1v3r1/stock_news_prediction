He has been charged with fraud affecting Angola’s central bank, involving the transfer of $500 million held in the United Kingdom. The funds were frozen and then returned to Angola’s central bank. Quantum Global has said it had nothing to do with the transaction. \nDos Santos is the highest-profile figure to be investigated for corruption since President Joao Lourenco took power last September, vowing to combat years of endemic graft in Africa’s second-largest oil producer. \nQuantum Global said it has not been given an underlying reason for why its licenses have been suspended in Mauritius. \n“As a result of the absence of due process and the rush to sanction us, Quantum Global has seen its business seriously damaged,” Bastos de Morais said, adding that his firm operates within the law. “We urgently need to have a fair hearing so we can clear our name,” he said.
