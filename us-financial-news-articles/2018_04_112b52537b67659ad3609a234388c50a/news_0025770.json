However, fighting rarely breaks out in the capital.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was ready to put up tents if needed outside Bangui’s Community Hospital, where the trauma unit and casualty ward are full.\nThe wounded included fighters as well as civilians who were hit by stray bullets, said ICRC spokeswoman Jessica Barry.\nHundreds of angry protesters on Wednesday laid the bodies of at least 16 people killed in front of the headquarters of the peacekeeping mission, accusing U.N. troops of firing at civilians during their operation in PK5.\nThe head of U.N. peacekeeping said civilians killed were young people who had been “manipulated” and armed by criminal gangs to confront the peacekeepers and Central African Republic forces.\n(This story has been refiled to change word in second paragraph to clarify timeline)\nReporting by Nellie Peyton, Editing by Robert Carmichael.
