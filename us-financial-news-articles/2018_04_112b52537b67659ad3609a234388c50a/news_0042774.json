FILE PHOTO: A building on the Qualcomm campus is seen, as chip maker Broadcom Ltd announced an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, in San Diego, California, U.S. November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake \nThe company, which has about 33,800 employees as of Sept.24, informed about its job cut plans in California in a regulatory notice that was filed with the state on April 18. \nQualcomm said it plans to cut 1,231 jobs in its San Diego office and 269 from its San Jose and Santa Clara offices in the state. \nThough the company first considered cost reductions without layoffs, it concluded that job cuts are needed to support long-term growth and success, a Qualcomm spokesperson said on Wednesday. \nQualcomm had in January said it would implement a series of targeted reductions across businesses, as part of its attempt to win over investors support against a hostile bid from rival Broadcom Inc ( AVGO.O ). \nThe bid, however, was cancelled by the Trump administration on national security grounds.
