The difference was attributable to an increase of $3.0 million, or 26.0%, in net interest income due largely to the Company's September 2017 acquisition of Resurgens Bancorp (\"Resurgens\") and the associated increase in loan balances, offset in part by a $2.0 million increase in noninterest expense. Of the noninterest expense increase, $618,000 was related to nonrecurring merger-related costs. Full conversion of the Resurgens acquisition was completed in February 2018, and no further expenses are expected.\n\"We had a strong second fiscal quarter, which has traditionally been a challenging quarter for us due to seasonality,\" said Chairman and CEO Robert L. Johnson. \"We continued to see expansion of net interest income and net interest margin despite limited growth in loan and deposit portfolios, and improvement in already impressive asset quality metrics. Earnings also benefited from reduced income tax expense, with an effective tax rate of 27.73% for this quarter as compared to 40.78% for the prior-year quarter.\"\nNet income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $9.6 million, or $0.67 and $0.63 per basic and diluted share, respectively, compared with net income of $8.4 million, or $0.59 and $0.55 per basic and diluted share, respectively, for the same period in 2017. The increase was largely a result of increased interest income as a result of the Resurgens acquisition, offset in part by a discrete tax expense of $1.5 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, enacted on December 22, 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). The Company's year-to-date annualized return on equity as of March 31, 2018 was 8.84%, as compared to 6.89% for the last full fiscal year, while the Company's return on tangible equity (a non-GAAP measure which excludes the average balance of intangible assets from average equity) was 10.99%, as compared to 8.18% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.\nQuarterly Operating Results\nQuarterly earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were positively impacted by:\nAn increase in loans receivable income of $3.2 million, or 26.9%, to $15.1 million for the 2018 second quarter, compared with $11.9 million for the same quarter in 2017, as a result of the Resurgens acquisition, as well as additional accretion of $380,000 due to the early payoff of an acquired Resurgens loan. A negative provision for loan losses of $350,000 due to the Company's continued trend of net recoveries and positive asset quality. A negative provision of $150,000 was recorded during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. An increase in bankcard fee income of $176,000, or 12.8%. Interest on interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions increased $273,000 due to increased cash balances and the Federal Reserve's rate increases. A new quarterly incentive payment of $79,000 from the Company's bankcard vendor, included in other income. A decrease of $271,000, or 11.8%, in income tax expense due to a 13.05% decrease in the Company's effective tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Due to the Company's fiscal year, its federal tax is calculated at a blended statutory rate of 24.5% during the current fiscal year, and will drop to 21% during fiscal 2019.\nQuarterly earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by:\nNonrecurring merger-related expenses from the Resurgens acquisition of $618,000, largely concentrated in severance costs and data processing fees. No merger-related costs were recorded in the same period in 2017. An increase in interest expense on deposits of $309,000, or 26.5%, due to higher balances as well as an increase of eight basis points in the Company's cost of deposits due to higher-costing deposits from Resurgens assumed in September 2017 and higher interest rates pushing legacy deposit costs higher. Salaries and employee benefits increased $944,000, or 15.5%, data processing increased $421,000, and occupancy increased $385,000, all due to transaction costs related to the Resurgens acquisition as well as increased ongoing operating costs as a result of the acquisition.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased $13.8 million from September 30, 2017, to $1.7 billion at March 31, 2018, largely attributable to a $27.1 million increase in cash and cash equivalents from deposit growth and paydowns on the Company's portfolio of investment securities available for sale. Net loans grew $2.6 million, or 0.2%, to $1.2 billion at March 31, 2018, due primarily to $10.0 million of growth in the Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area (\"MSA\"). Loans in the Atlanta MSA now account for 57% of the Company's gross loan balance.\n\"We're happy to see the usual tax season growth in our checking deposit accounts and balances,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"Seasonal factors negatively impacted loan growth, which is typically slow during our fiscal year's first half. We believe loan growth will improve in the second half of the year if the economy remains reasonably strong. As we continue to integrate our new Resurgens team, we will leverage our capital and market base to further grow the loan portfolio.\"\nTotal deposits increased $10.1 million to $1.3 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2018, largely due to growth in transaction accounts of $28.0 million. Money market deposit accounts increased $11.2 million from September 30, 2017, while retail certificates of deposit decreased $25.9 million.\nFrom September 30, 2017 to March 31, 2018, total stockholders' equity increased $7.4 million to $221.6 million due primarily to $9.6 million of net income, offset by a $1.9 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Book value per share increased to $14.64 at March 31, 2018, from $14.17 at September 30, 2017, while tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for further information) increased to $11.83 from $11.33, both due to the Company's retention of earnings.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income increased $3.0 million to $14.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with $11.7 million for the prior-year period. Total interest income increased $3.4 million. These increases were attributable to increased loan balances and loans receivable interest income as a result of the Resurgens acquisition, as well as increased loan interest income from the higher market interest rates. Loans receivable interest income increased $3.2 million to $15.1 million during the current quarter from $11.9 million during the prior-year quarter. The Company also experienced an increase of $273,000 in interest income on interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions during the current-year quarter due to higher balances and higher rates paid on overnight balances. Total interest expense increased $326,000 to $2.0 million for the current quarter, due to a six basis point increase in the average cost and a $96.2 million increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. A portion of the rate increase was attributable to increased interest rates on money market accounts and certificates of deposit, while the remainder was tied to higher-costing deposits from the Resurgens acquisition.\n\"Our recent acquisitions and loan production capabilities in Metro Atlanta paired with our exceptional deposit base have, to date, favorably driven our net interest income and net interest margin,\" Mr. Johnson added. \"We expect to continue to enjoy a competitive funding advantage that will allow us to compete assertively for high-quality loans and deposits in a rising rate environment.\"\nNet interest margin was 3.98% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to 3.52% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The impact of purchase accounting on the Company's net interest margin was 0.23% 2018, compared to 0.11% 2017, due to the aforementioned $380,000 of additional accretion during the current quarter. The increase in net interest margin was attributable to increased loan income, both from acquisitions and legacy loan growth, as well as increased yields on the Company's Federal Reserve deposits.\nNet interest income for the six months ended March 31, 2018, increased $5.1 million, or 21.5%, to $29.0 million, compared to $23.9 million for the prior-year period. Interest income increased $5.8 million, or 21.2%, to $32.9 million due to increased balances and higher yields on loans from the Resurgens acquisition and interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions. Interest expense increased $632,000, or 19.1%, to $4.0 million due to higher deposit balances from the Resurgens acquisition and an increase in the average cost of deposits of eight basis points.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $2.9 million of remaining loan discount accretion related to the Community Bank of the South (\"CBS\") and Resurgens acquisitions, which will be accreted over the lives of the loans acquired.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a $350,000 negative provision for loan losses during the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, due to the continued positive credit quality trends of its loan portfolio and net recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Negative provisions of $150,000 and $900,000 were recorded during the three and six months ended March 31, 2017, respectively.\nNoninterest Income and Expense\nNoninterest income increased $417,000 to $5.0 million in the fiscal 2018 second quarter compared to $4.5 million in the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $458,000, or 14.9%, increase in deposit and bankcard fees. The Company's $1.5 million of bankcard fee income was its highest-ever quarterly total. The Company also saw an increase of $122,000 in income on bank owned life insurance due to an annual pricing adjustment that ended during the prior fiscal year. There was also a $79,000 gain on incentive rebates from our debit card vendor. These increases were offset in part by a $248,000 decrease in gains on the sale of investment securities for sale and an $86,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans due to reduced mortgage sale activity.\nNoninterest expense 2018, increased $2.0 million to $12.7 million, compared with $10.7 million for the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased ongoing operational costs as a result of the acquisition of Resurgens. Salaries and employee benefits increased $944,000, or 15.5%, to $7.0 million during the current quarter, while occupancy and data processing increased $385,000 and $421,000, or 31.6% and 42.0%, over the prior-year quarter. The Company also recorded $618,000 of merger costs from the Resurgens acquisition, which were largely concentrated in severance and data processing costs. Federal insurance premiums and other regulatory fees increased $110,000 due to the Company's increased asset size as a result of the Resurgens acquisition.\n\"We have sustained our decades-long efforts to diversify our revenue streams, control costs, and increase operating and capital leverage,\" Mr. Johnson continued. \"Our success in growing checking accounts and encouraging signature debit card use give us tremendous flexibility in reacting to anticipated changes in the business cycle. Overall, revenue growth rates in both our interest and noninterest income have outpaced expense growth as reflected in both our quarterly and year-to-date efficiency ratios of 64.82% and 62.54%, respectively, as compared to 66.35% and 63.02% for the same respective periods last year.\"\nNoninterest income for the six months ended March 31, 2018, increased $826,000, or 8.7%, to $10.4 million, compared with $9.5 million for the prior-year period. The increase was largely due to an increase of $861,000, or 13.8%, in deposit and bankcard fees, $294,000 in incentive rebates from the Company's bankcard vendor, a nonrecurring $266,000 gain on the sale of assets available for sale, and a $112,000, or 19.3% increase in bank owned life insurance. These increases were offset in part by a $247,000 decrease in gains on the sale of investment securities for sale and a decrease in gains on sale of loans of $198,000 due to reduced activity. The Company also recorded a $250,000 recovery on loans previously covered in FDIC-assisted acquisitions during the prior year, while no such gain was recorded for the same period in the current fiscal year.\nNoninterest expense for the six months ended March 31, 2018 increased $3.6 million, or 17.0%, to $24.6 million compared with $21.0 million for the prior-year period. The increase was primarily attributable to increased ongoing operational costs from the Resurgens acquisition, as well as $927,000 of merger-related expenses from the acquisition. Salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, and data processing increased $1.8 million, $540,000, and $665,000, respectively. The net benefit of operations of real estate owned also decreased $296,000 due to reduced sales activity as the Company's portfolio of other real estate has fallen to minimal levels. These increases were offset in part by a reduction of $187,000 in legal and professional fees.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets at March 31, 2018, were at 0.10% of total assets, a nine basis point decline from September 30, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.1 million, or 78.9%, decline in the balance of other real estate owned to $303,000 at March 31, 2018. Nonaccrual loans also declined $356,000 from September 30, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses was at 0.96% of total loans and 780.63% of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.96% and 649.13%, respectively, at September 30, 2017. Not included in the allowance at March 31, 2018, was $2.9 million in yield and credit discounts on the acquired loans from CBS and Resurgens. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was 1.15% of legacy loans, compared to 1.22% at September 30, 2017. The Company recorded net loan recoveries of $347,000 and $382,000 in its allowance for loan losses for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, compared with net loan recoveries of $156,000 and $1.0 million for the same periods in the prior year.\n\"Our asset quality metrics are historically strong,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"We maintained a strong credit culture as we worked through most of the problem assets inherited from our FDIC-assisted acquisitions, disposing of practically all of our foreclosed real estate and adding high-quality loans in the CBS and Resurgens acquisitions. The metro-area market economies where we operate seem resilient at present, although we expect rising interest rates will eventually have some impact.\"\nCapital Management\nFrom the first quarter of fiscal 2014 through the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company has repurchased 8.1 million shares, or 35.6%, of its common stock, for $91.9 million. The Company repurchased no shares during the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company paid a $0.08 per share dividend, the sixth consecutive quarterly dividend increase. Additionally, the Company announced on April 24, 2018, it would pay another increased dividend of $0.085 on May 24, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2018. The Company's equity as a percent of total assets was 13.40% at March 31, 2018, as compared to 13.06% at September 30, 2017, while the Company's tangible common equity ratio, a non-GAAP measure (see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures for further information), was 11.11% at March 31, 2018, up from 10.72% at September 30, 2017.\nAbout Charter Financial Corporation\nCharter Financial Corporation is a savings and loan holding company and the parent company of CharterBank, a full-service community bank and a federal savings institution.
