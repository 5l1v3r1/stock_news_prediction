I have watched WES grow under Tim's leadership from a young Canadian operation to a highly successful, world-renowned organization.\"\nMadhany was instrumental in the launch of WES Canada in 2000 during her tenure at the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship, as Provincial Lead, Access to Professions and Trades.\n“Shamira is a long-time friend and supporter of WES,” said Mariam Assefa, Executive Director of WES. “We are thrilled to have her join the WES family and look forward to all she will help us to accomplish in Canada.
