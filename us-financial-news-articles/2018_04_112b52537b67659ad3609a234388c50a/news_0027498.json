The scripts criticized “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one sided news stories plaguing our country” and have drawn fire.\n“We are concerned that Sinclair is engaged in a systematic news distortion operation that seeks to undermine freedom of the press and the robust localism and diversity of viewpoint that is the foundation of our national broadcasting laws,” the senators wrote. They added that it “may have violated the FCC’s longstanding policy against broadcast licensees deliberately distorting news by staging, slanting, or falsifying information.”\nRepublicans in Congress have not backed criticism of Sinclair. After the scripts drew significant public attention, President Donald Trump tweeted on April 2 in defense of Sinclair: “Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC.”\nThe FCC and the Justice Department are reviewing Sinclair’s deal.\nIn February, Representative Frank Pallone, a Democrat, said the FCC’s inspector general was investigating whether FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was biased in favor of Sinclair.\nPallone in November asked the inspector general to investigate, citing a string of FCC decisions he said benefited Sinclair and a media report that Trump’s election campaign struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage.\nPai has repeatedly denied he has taken actions aimed at benefiting a single company and Sinclair has denied improper conduct.\nThe FCC and Sinclair declined to comment on the senators’ letter, signed by the 11 Democrats, including Senators Maria Cantwell, Tom Udall, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal, as well as Sanders.\nIn February, Sinclair offered to sell two major TV stations in Chicago and New York owned by Tribune to companies with ties to Sinclair as part of its effort to win FCC approval.\nSinclair said, however, that it would seek to operate both stations as if it owned them. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the plan has run into resistance at the FCC, but the merger is still expected to be approved.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T00:30:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
