The average yield on junk bonds is still near historical lows, and the spread over Treasurys is 150 basis points below the historical average.\n\"The coupon is not bad in this market, but it's not enough to make up for the risks,\" said Rusnak. \"We could see negative total returns for high yield this year.\"\nA major risk rattling stock and bond markets is geopolitical risk — in large part centered on President Donald Trump. Whether it's fears of a trade war with China, a confrontation with North Korea or what feels like chaos in his administration, Trump has ratcheted up fear in the markets. Geopolitical risk indexes are near all-time highs, and politics could quickly change the positive global economic picture. It could also send investors fleeing from risky assets, like stocks and high-yield bonds. \"We're in the eighth or ninth inning of this economic cycle, but the unprecedented late-cycle stimulus makes it an extra-inning game.\" -Elaine Stokes, portfolio manager and strategist at asset manager Loomis Sayles\n\"The trend toward protectionism and populism could derail things,\" said Stokes at Loomis Sayles. \"The geopolitical threat is very real and it can change sentiment on a dime.\"\nAaron Kohli, a financial strategist with BMO Capital Markets, sees signs that the end of the economic cycle is already close at hand. One of the clearest is pressure on corporate margins, which bodes ill for corporate earnings down the road.\n\"Inflation has been less responsive to wage gains than in the past,\" he said. \"Producers don't have the ability to pass on costs through higher prices.\" The producer price index was up 3 percent in the 12 months through March, compared to 2.4 percent for the consumer price index.

Privacy Policy .\nKohli thinks inflation is unlikely to rise far above 2 percent, regardless of the fiscal stimulus that kicks in this year. He also expects that as the Fed raises short-term rates, the yield curve will flatten further and invert sometime later this year — a classic sign of an imminent recession.\n\"The 10-year Treasury yield has failed to hold above 3 percent five times now,\" said Kohli. \"It depends on how fast the Fed raises rates and on global growth, but we expect the yield curve to invert in the third or fourth quarter.\"\nIf that comes to pass, credit risk — and high-yield debt, in particular — will be punished.\nKohli favors a barbell approach with low-risk Treasurys and high-quality long-term bonds. As the Fed hikes rates, the short-duration bonds can keep rolling into higher rate ones, while long-term bond prices will rise if inflation and economic growth expectations retreat.\n\"The long end could lose some ground at times, but I think it will outperform,\" Kohli said.\nIf there are extra innings to this economic cycle and to the performance of high-yield bonds, they're going to be nail-biters.\n— By Andrew Osterland, special to CNBC.com Andrew Osterland Special to CNBC.com Fixed Income Strategies", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-30T15:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T15:49:31.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
