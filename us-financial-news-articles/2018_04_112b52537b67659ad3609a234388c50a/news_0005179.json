He had joined the Mariners in a trade with the Oakland Athletics last August.\nAlonso also played a role in the Indians’ other two runs, drawing a leadoff walk in the fourth inning off Mariners starter James Paxton (0-1) before Yan Gomes belted a two-run homer, putting Cleveland up 6-3.\nPaxton took the loss, allowing all six Indians runs on six hits in 4 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out four.\nMitch Haniger had a solo home run in the second inning, and Jean Segura and Robinson Cano had RBI singles in a two-run third inning for the Mariners, who found themselves playing catch-up the entire game.\nNelson Cruz, who lined into an inning-ending double play with two runners aboard to end the third inning with Seattle trailing 4-3, smacked a two-run home run after a Cano single in the sixth, drawing Seattle within one again at 6-5.\nBut Miller struck out Segura after two-out singles by Ichiro Suzuki and Dee Gordon in the seventh, and stranded Cano at second as the potential tying run in the eighth, before yielding to Allen in the ninth.\nIndians starter Carlos Carrasco (1-0) got the win despite allowing five runs on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out four and did not walk a batter.\nKipnis had two hits for the Indians, whose six hits included two homers and a double.\nCano finished with three hits for the Mariners, who out-hit the Indians 10-6. Gordon and Suzuki added two hits apiece.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-01T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-01T15:33:33.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
