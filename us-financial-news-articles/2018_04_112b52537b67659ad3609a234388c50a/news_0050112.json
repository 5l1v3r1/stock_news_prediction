She is a nun.”\nThe left-wing activist group Bayan (Nation) condemned the expulsion order of an Australian nun who “has done so much for Philippine farmers in her nearly three decades stay here”.\n“The Duterte regime is paranoid and afraid of an elderly nun working for human rights and social justice for the poor,” Bayan leader Renato Reyes said in a statement.\n“The deportation order of Sister Pat is indeed despicable and utterly shameful,” said Reyes.\nIn a speech last week to soldiers, Duterte said he ordered the immigration to look into Fox’s political activities in the country.\n“It’s a violation of sovereignty,” Duterte said, accusing Fox of badmouthing his administration. “You do not have that right to criticize us. Do not insult my country.”\nHis spokesman, Harry Roque, even showed journalists photos of Fox speaking at farmer and labourer protest rallies in Duterte’s hometown in southern Davao City early this month.\nReporting By Manuel Mogato and Neil Jerome Morales; Editing by Michael Perry\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T06:47:49.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
