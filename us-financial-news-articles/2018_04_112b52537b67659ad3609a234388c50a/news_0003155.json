REUTERS/P. Ravikumar/File photo Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) said the link with the satellite was lost in the third and final stage of its launch, but it did not specify the possible cause of the snag.\n“Efforts are underway to establish the link with the satellite,” ISRO said on its website.\nThe satellite was launched on Thursday through an indigenously developed launch vehicle.\nThe GSAT-6A is an advanced mobile communications satellite with a six-meter wide antenna, the biggest used by an ISRO communication satellite.\nOnce located, the agency should be able to command and take the satellite to its final orbit.\nIf not, the satellite would come down and burn out like any other, an agency official said.\nThe satellite would enable advanced mobile communications, the space agency said, including for the military.\nIndia is seeking a larger share of the more than $300 billion global space industry as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to project it as a global low-cost provider of services in space.\nReporting by Malini Menon; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-02T15:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T15:48:38.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
