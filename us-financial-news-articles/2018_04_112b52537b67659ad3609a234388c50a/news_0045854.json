The reach and power behind their LMS, mobile technology and course library will better enable us to reach a wider audience with our 3D training while better serving our existing clients.”\nThe acquisition provides clients across Vector and Convergence with access to thousands of new courses in a variety of modern formats and includes content accredited by hundreds of licensing bodies and professional associations.
