REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo The pair aim to allow Barclays customers in the United States and Britain to use their PayPal accounts on the bank’s online and mobile phone-based platforms while Barclays products will be used in PayPal accounts.\nThe move comes amid mounting concerns from bank industry executives that big technology companies such as Amazon ( AMZN.O ) and Apple ( AAPL.O ) in the U.S. or China’s Alibaba ( BABA.K ) could come to dominate the $1.8 trillion global payments industry.\nFILE PHOTO: The PayPal app logo seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo October 16, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo With their ever-expanding customer bases and nimbler platforms, the tech companies could supplant the banks as the face of an industry that accounts for 34 percent of all banking revenues, according to consultancy McKinsey.\nThe announcement from Barclays shows one route traditional lenders are taking, to try and collaborate with large technology companies rather than compete.\nAmazon and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) are exploring offering a checking account together in the U.S., according to media reports in March, while those two firms plus Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) are mulling a collaboration on healthcare payments.\nBarclays and PayPal made clear that they are still discussing possible ways the companies’ services could be combined.\n“By joining forces, we can make it much easier for people to manage their money and payments,” Barclays UK Chief Executive Ashok Vaswani said in the bank’s statement.\nTech firms face their own obstacles in trying to break into the financial sector, from stringent regulations on any activity resembling deposit-taking to customers trusting banks more than new tech firms to safeguard their money.\nThe announcement comes as Barclays prepares to report its first quarter earnings on Thursday, with investors focused on whether it can improve profits to match its U.S. rivals.\nReporting By Lawrence White; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T02:26:21.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
