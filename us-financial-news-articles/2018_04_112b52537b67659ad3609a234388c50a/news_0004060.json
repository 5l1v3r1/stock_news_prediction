It's payback time,\" Gundlach told CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" in an interview. \"2017 was the easiest investment year of all time. The risk-adjusted returns for the stock market were probably the best in history.\" \nRising government bond yields have put pressure on stock prices, he said. Specifically, a 2.63 percent yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note marks a line in the sand for stocks, which are currently in correction territory. \n\"The stock market can't take higher bond yields,\" he said. \nGundlach spoke on a day when stocks tumbled at the open but regained most of their losses through the course of the day. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq briefly turned positive in afternoon trading, while the Dow industrials remained negative. \nVolatility has indeed surged in 2018 after lingering around historic lows in the previous year. \nOne sign Gundlach pointed to is bitcoin â€” the cryptocurrency had peaked in 2017 along with stock prices, while its slumps this year have preceded downturns in stocks. \n\"Bitcoin very clearly leads risk assets,\" he said.
