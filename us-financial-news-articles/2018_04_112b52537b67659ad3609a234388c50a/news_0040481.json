Related Coverage Zaha debate rages as Palace accuse Watford of targeting striker \nThe Palace winger repeatedly drew challenges from an increasingly desperate defence and twice had penalty appeals turned down, one of which led to a booking for simulation. Soccer Football - Premier League - Watford v Crystal Palace - Vicarage Road, Watford, Britain - April 21, 2018 Watford's Adrian Mariappa in action with Crystal Palace's Ruben Loftus-Cheek REUTERS/Darren Staples \nWatford’s Abdoulaye Doucoure was so incensed by his behaviour that he was also yellow carded for pushing Zaha after one appeal. With his name already in the referee’s notebook, Doucoure could easily have been dismissed.

The home side started with a greater sense of purpose and almost went in front when Palace keeper Wayne Hennessey had to be at his sharpest to prevent an own goal from Joel Ward. \nThe second half, though, largely belonged to the visitors as Zaha became increasingly influential and Luka Milivojevic was unlucky not to break the deadlock in the second half. \nIn the end, there were no goals but plenty of bookings with referee Chris Kavanagh issuing eight cards. \nWatford defender Adrian Mariappa said: “It was a tough game. We take the point and the clean sheet. They’ve got a lot of good players and it’s down to us to keep them quiet. \n“It’s a massive clean sheet for us. Everyone from top to bottom put in a real shift today. We’re fully focussed on the rest of the games and it’s a good opportunity to pick up some points.” \nThe win leaves Palace six points clear of relegation with Watford three points and places above them in 12th.
