(NASDAQ:CWBR) and (TSXV:COB.U) (“CohBar” or the “Company”) today announced that it has applied to voluntarily delist its common shares from the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSXV”).\nThe Company decided to voluntarily delist from the TSXV because the limited trading activity in the Company’s shares no longer justifies the financial and administrative costs required to maintain a dual listing.\nThe Company’s common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under its current symbol “CWBR”. The Company’s Canadian shareholders may trade in CohBar’s common stock through their brokers on that exchange.\nAbout CohBar\nCohBar is an innovative biotechnology company focused on the research and development of mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs), an emerging class of drugs for the treatment of age-related diseases. MBTs originate from the discovery by CohBar’s founders of a novel group of peptides within the mitochondrial genome which regulate metabolism and cell death, and whose biological activity declines with age. CohBar’s efforts focus on the development of these mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) into clinically relevant MBTs that offer the potential to address a broad range of age-related diseases with underlying metabolic dysfunction, including obesity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), Type 2 diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the Company and its founders have discovered more than 100 MDPs.\nAbout CohBar’s Lead Program\nCohBar’s lead preclinical development program is based on MOTS-c, a mitochondrial-derived peptide discovered in 2012 by the Company’s founders and their academic collaborators, whose research has shown that MOTS-c plays a significant role in the regulation of metabolism. The Company has developed a novel, improved analog of the MOTS-c peptide, CB4211, which has demonstrated significant therapeutic potential in preclinical models of obesity and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\nFor additional company information, please visit www.cohbar.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements (statements which are not historical facts) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws.
