It said Postal Service had lost $65 billion since the 2007-2009 recession.\nThe Postal Service is supposed to be self-sustaining, but it must ask Congress for permission to raise rates and, because of a 2006 law, it must pre-fund decades worth of retiree health benefits.\nTrump said earlier this month that the United States was subsidizing Amazon.com Inc and that the online retailer must pay more to ship its products through the postal service.\nCiting an unnamed report, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service “delivers packages for Amazon at a very low rate,” adding, “If you look at the cost that we’re subsidizing, we’re giving a subsidy to Amazon.” (Reporting by Diane Bartz Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh)\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-13T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T18:03:27.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
