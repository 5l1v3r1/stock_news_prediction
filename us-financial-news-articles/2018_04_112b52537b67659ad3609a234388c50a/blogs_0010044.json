The group pushed the message that changes to the tax code will lead to economic growth across the country. \nOn Friday, with the president ratcheting up his trade rhetoric, Americans for Prosperity continued to make the case for the GOP tax cuts. In a recent article titled \"5 Things to Look Forward to Under the New Tax Code,\" the group promoted the notion that the reduced corporate tax rate – which was cut from 35 percent to 21 percent in the tax bill – will not only lead to strong growth, but more investments in the United States. \nHowever, there is concern within Koch-backed groups that the ripple effects from a trade war could cancel out tax-reform wins. \n\"We think when you look at tariffs this is a significant threat that can undermine tax reform and increase costs for people who are only just starting to feel the relief,\" Americans for Prosperity's top spokesman, Bill Riggs, told CNBC. \nThe group has privately spoken with the White House about the tariffs. So far, the two sides have failed to see eye-to-eye on the administration's trade policies. \n\"It's been an ongoing conversation. We have a good line of communication with the White House's economic policy team. They've explained their reasoning behind it and we just strongly disagree,\" said Phillips, the Americans for Prosperity president. Potential conflict for the congressional GOP \nWith the network taking a stand against the president's efforts to slap tariffs on Chinese imports, Republican leaders in Congress who reaped Koch funds last year could be forced to go after Trump. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., for instance, was one of the top recipients of the Koch financial contributions in 2017. His campaign committee, Team Ryan, brought in $495,000 in November from the coffers of Charles Koch and his wife, Elizabeth, during the same month the House of Representatives passed their historic tax reform bill, according to Federal Election Commission filings. \nRyan criticized the president in March when the administration proposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imports. \"I disagree with this action and fear its unintended consequences,\" Ryan said at the time. \nIn a statement provided to CNBC, Ryan's spokeswoman, AshLee Strong, said on Friday that the speaker still intends to work with the administration on future trade initiatives and is hoping for a different approach. \n\"We continue to work directly with the White House to find a better, more targeted approach,\" Strong said. \nThe Kochs also gave more than $406,000 last year to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign fundraising arm for Republicans trying to get elected into the House. They gave a similar amount to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is dedicated to maintaining a GOP majority in the Senate. \nDavid Koch made his fair share of political investments in 2017, as well, shelling out $100,000 to the joint fundraising committee for Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, among others. \nThe NRCC declined to comment while the NRSC and a spokesman Hatch did not immediately return CNBC's requests for comment.
