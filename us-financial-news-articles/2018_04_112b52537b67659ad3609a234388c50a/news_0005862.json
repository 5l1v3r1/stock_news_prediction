Spot gold was down 0.1 percent at $1,339.60 per ounce, as of 0712 GMT. It climbed 1.3 percent on Monday in its biggest one-day percentage gain in a week. U.S. gold futures eased 0.3 percent to $1,343.60 an ounce. Gold is down most likely due to Chinese investors getting out of their positions ahead of holidays on Thursday and Friday, said MKS trader Sam Laughlin. The three-day Qingming tomb-sweeping festival in China starts on April 5. The risk-averse sentiment in the market, however, underpinned bullion, often seen as an alternative investment during times of political and financial uncertainty. \"Gold prices at this moment serve for investors risk aversion demand and gold for the immediate short term will be well supported because of the volatility in the equity markets,\" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group. \"The previous $1,300 to $1,350 trading range for gold price could gradually move up to $1,330 to $1,380 because of the risk aversion.\" The dollar index , which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 89.893. Asian shares slipped on Tuesday and the yen rose amid escalating trade tensions and concerns about tech firms. \"Trade war risk isn't about to leave anytime soon as China escalation appears to have more bite than bark as there's growing fear this could escalate,\" said Stephen Innes, head of trading in Asia-Pacific for OANDA in Singapore. \"As the market continues to go through the exercise of what if, the fear of the unknown will continue to support Gold prices.\" The Trump administration this week will unveil a list of advanced technology Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies, a move expected to intensify trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Holdings of SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.73 percent to 852.31 tonnes on Monday from 846.12 tonnes on Thursday. Among other precious metals, spot silver slid 0.4 percent to $16.55 an ounce, having risen 1.8 percent in the previous session. Platinum climbed 0.6 percent to $934.60 an ounce. Palladium was on track for an eighth straight session of declines, down 0.2 percent at $932.97 per ounce. Earlier in the session, the metal hit $927.75, its lowest since Oct. 10.
