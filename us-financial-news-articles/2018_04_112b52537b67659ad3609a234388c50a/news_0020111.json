Crete will also be connected to Athens in a later phase.\nPower production on Crete, the largest of the Greek islands, is currently provided by three oil-fired plants that must be shut down to comply with a European Union directive.\nEnergy Minister George Stathakis said the project would contribute to the “drastic reduction” of electricity costs, improve Crete’s ecological footprint and lead to 215 million euros in annual savings, mainly through lower service charges.\nState-controlled grid operator ADMIE was spun off last year from power utility Public Power Corp under Greece’s international bailout. China’s State Grid, the world’s biggest utility, bought a 24 percent stake.
