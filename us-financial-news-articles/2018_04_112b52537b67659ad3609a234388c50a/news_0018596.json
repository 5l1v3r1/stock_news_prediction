Lowe reiterated on Wednesday that policy is likely to remain accommodative for some time yet.\n“The Reserve Bank Board does not see a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy.”\nEven so the next move in rates was more likely up than down, he added.\n“The last increase in the cash rate was more than seven years ago, so an increase will come as a shock to some people,” Lowe told a business lunch.\n“But it is worth remembering that the most likely scenario in which interest rates are increasing is one in which the economy is strengthening and income growth is also picking up.”\nWage growth is crawling near the slowest pace on record, putting a lid on inflation which remains below the RBA’s 2-3 percent target band.\n“A continuation of the current stance of monetary policy in Australia will help our economy adjust and should see further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target,” Lowe added.
