Romaine lettuce grows near Soledad, California, U.S., May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Michael Fiala\nThe reported strain of E. coli, which produces poisonous substances known as Shiga toxins, can cause severe abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.\nThe outbreak that began last month is now the largest multi-state Shiga toxin-producing outbreak since 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\nForty-six people have been hospitalized, including 10 who had developed a type of kidney failure, the CDC said in its latest update on the outbreak. No deaths have been reported.\nThree more states — Mississippi, Tennessee, and Wisconsin — reported people falling sick.\n“We do expect more reports of illnesses since there is a two-to-three week delay between the time that a person is sick and between the time they can be confirmed as part of the outbreak,” Matthew Wise, deputy branch chief for Outbreak Response at the CDC, said at a media briefing.\nEight cases in Alaska were linked to a farm in Yuma, Arizona, the CDC said.\n“Most of the illnesses linked to the Romaine outbreak are not linked to the Romaine lettuce from (the Yuma) farm. We are investigating dozens of other fields as potential sources of the chopped Romaine lettuce,” a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official said at the briefing.\nThe CDC repeated its advice that people not eat or buy romaine lettuce, which is commonly used in salads, unless they can confirm it is not from the Yuma growing region.
