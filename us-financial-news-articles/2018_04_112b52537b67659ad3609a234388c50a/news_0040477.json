REUTERS/Kwiyeon Ha The system was developed for security at buildings run by Leopalace21 Corp,, said Keiichi Nakamura, manager of the firm’s advertising department.\nQueries from the public prompted the company to think bigger and consider offering it for sale. But some people have had doubts about how effective it might be, said Nakamura.\nIn particular, criminals might sooner or later work out that a “man behind the curtain” who spends his whole time shadow boxing, actually means a woman is alone inside.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “If projecting a shadow makes a woman an easy target by showing criminals there’s nobody home, that would put the cart before the horse,” he said.\n“So we’d like to commercialise it once we add variety, such as releasing a new video every day.”\nReporting by Kwiyeon Ha; Writing by Elaine Lies; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-21T12:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-21T13:02:01.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
