It reinforces our strategic focus to be a leading global casino information and data analytics solutions provider,\" said John Dominelli, NRT’s Founder and President. \"We're delighted to count on the expertise of NCC’s management and staff, and we welcome them into the NRT family.\"\nNRT’s recent investment in Gaming Analytics.AI will further set the stage for the next evolution of technology enhancements for the gaming industry, allowing NRT to incorporate AI search-driven analytics with insights and contexts of marker player behavior and preferences.\n“NCC and eMarker together create a groundbreaking end-to-end marker underwriting and issuance solution for casinos,” said Kirk Sanford, Sightline Payments Founder and CEO. “Through NCC, we will have a robust platform connected to hundreds of casinos from which to offer advanced data analytics services for underwriting processes and ‘next generation’ risk scoring information.”\nMrs. Landis added, \"Our immediate objective is consistency and continuity for our customers and the NCC team members. I will stay on through a transition period to bring all the benefits of the combined companies together as quickly as possible while ensuring that NCC’s solutions remain as nimble and well-organized as ever, and to efficiently incorporate more capabilities to accelerate performance for our valued customers.\"\nAbout NCC\nFor the past 40 years, NCC’s mission has been to help our over 300 casino partners around the world to optimize risk-based decisions for underwriting of casino credit and to meet AML compliance requirements.
