EgyptAir and several other major airlines that fly in the area did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\nThe Nicosia flight information region named in the Eurocontrol statement covers the island of Cyprus and surrounding waters, according to a map on the agency's website.\nThe same map did not designate any specific territory as being the \"Eastern Mediterranean\" region.\nLast year, North Korea tested missiles without warning, leading some airlines to re-route flights to avoid portions of the Sea of Japan.\nEurocontrol's warning cited a document from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), Europe's safety regulator.\nEASA warned of a danger to aircraft flying over Iran, Iraq, and the Caspian sea in October 2015 after Russia fired cruise missiles at Syrian targets from the Caspian Sea.\nAn EASA spokesman said it had informed member states and Eurocontrol of its cautionary message on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:23:25.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
