The firm provides facial-recognition technology that can be used for things like bank card verification and counts state-owned telecommunications giant China Mobile , phone maker Huawei and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia among its clients. \nThe latest round of investment followed a $410 million capital injection SenseTime received in July last year. Its Series C round, the third stage of funding for a company, was also backed by Chinese retailer Suning.com and Singaporean state wealth fund Temasek. \nSenseTime has partnered with Honda on autonomous driving and Qualcomm on algorithms and smart technology. Qualcomm has also backed SenseTime in a funding round last year, although the size of the investment has not been disclosed. \nSenseTime said it will use the raised capital to expand its AI platform, advance its technological innovation and open up new business opportunities.

The funding will also help us widen the scope for more industrial application of AI, thus increasing the value of SenseTime's global ecosystem.\" \nChina's government has said it wants to make the country the world leader in AI by 2030, by boosting the value of the sector to 1 trillion yuan ($147.7 billion). In January, it said it would build a state-backed $2.1 billion AI research and development campus to house around 400 tech businesses.
