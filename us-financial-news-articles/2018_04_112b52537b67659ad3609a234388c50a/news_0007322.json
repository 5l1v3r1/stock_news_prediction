But the central bank seems to have a different idea,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. \n“The market will likely continue seeing high volatility for the time being, so the BOJ is likely to keep up with the current purchase pace for a while.” \nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said on Tuesday it was premature to debate when and how the central bank should slow its purchases of ETFs. \nKuroda was reappointed for another five-year term by premier Shinzo Abe, who hand-picked the former top currency diplomat in 2013 to deploy aggressive monetary easing as one of three arrows of his “Abenomics” policies to reflate growth. \nKuroda’s second term begins on April 9.
