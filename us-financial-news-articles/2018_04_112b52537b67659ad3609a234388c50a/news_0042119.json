Soccer Football - Spanish King's Cup Final - FC Barcelona v Sevilla - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - April 21, 2018 Barcelona's Andres celebrates with the trophy and team mates after the match REUTERS/Juan Medina \nLuis Suarez struck twice in the first half for the Catalans as they won the competition for a record 30th time. However, it was Iniesta and Messi who pulled all the strings as the La Liga leaders blew away Vincenzo Montella’s stunned side. \nPhilippe Coutinho set up Suarez for the opening goal in the 14th minute and Barcelona dominated the rest of the game. The result goes some way to make up for their humiliating Champions League quarter-final elimination by AS Roma earlier in April. \nMessi slammed home the second after good work from Jordi Alba with Suarez adding another, before Iniesta netted from a tight angle. Coutinho added a fifth from the penalty spot to complete the rout. \n“This doesn’t cover up what happened in Rome but it’s an important title,” said Suarez.

Slideshow (15 Images) \nThe veteran midfielder is considering a move to the Chinese Super League and this could be his last cup final for Barcelona - and he made sure it was one to remember. \n“Barcelona had a formidable game and when they are like that it’s hard to stop them,” said Montella. \n“They have formidable players like Iniesta, Messi, Suarez. \n“I’m very sorry to the fans who were fantastic today. We are not in our best form, we have to react.” \nWith Iniesta leading the way, Barca came flying out of the blocks and moved ahead after a long ball from goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen found Coutinho deep in opposition territory and he set up Suarez. \nSevilla rallied but after a couple of half-chances Barcelona doubled their lead when Iniesta sent Alba flying down the left. The Spaniard backheeled the ball into Messi’s path and the Argentine fired in. \nMessi then created the third for Suarez with a sublime through-ball and the fourth for Iniesta, whose goal will be a special moment to take with him if he does depart. \nCoutinho’s penalty after Clement Lenglet handled the ball in the area helped Ernesto Valverde’s side finish emphatically and they were soon able to celebrate with the cup which had their name on it from the start - and recently always seems to.
