Nassetta, President & Chief Executive Officer of Hilton, said, \"We are thrilled with the strong start to the year, reporting first quarter results that exceeded the high end of our guidance for system-wide RevPAR, Adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items. As a result of our strong performance and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising guidance for the full year. We also continue to deliver on our capital return strategy through share repurchases and dividends, returning more than $1.3 billion so far this year.\"\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, system-wide comparable RevPAR grew 3.9 percent, driven by increases in both ADR and occupancy. In particular, strength at Hilton's international hotels benefited results, particularly in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. Management and franchise fee revenues increased 12 percent as a result of RevPAR growth of 3.8 percent at comparable managed and franchised hotels, license fees and the addition of new properties to Hilton's portfolio.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018 diluted EPS was $0.51 and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, was $0.55 compared to $0.14 and $0.38, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $163 million and $445 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $48 million and $410 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nDevelopment\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Hilton opened 75 hotels totaling 10,600 rooms, a 7 percent increase from the same period in 2017, and achieved net unit growth of 7,100 rooms.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Hilton's development pipeline totaled more than 2,340 hotels consisting of approximately 355,000 rooms throughout 106 countries and territories, including 38 countries and territories where Hilton does not currently have any open hotels. Nearly 187,000 rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, are located outside the U.S. Additionally, approximately 184,000 rooms in the pipeline, or more than half, are under construction.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Hilton had $6.7 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding deferred financing costs and discount, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.25 percent. Excluding capital lease obligations and other debt of Hilton's consolidated variable interest entities, Hilton had $6.4 billion of long-term debt outstanding as of March 31, 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.17 percent.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $683 million as of March 31, 2018, including $73 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents. No borrowings were outstanding under the $1.0 billion revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Hilton repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $110 million and an average price per share of $84.01. From the inception of Hilton's share repurchase plan in March 2017 through March 31, 2018, Hilton repurchased 14.8 million shares for approximately $1.0 billion at an average price per share of $67.37.\nIn March 2018, Hilton paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share on shares of its common stock, for a total of $47 million. In April 2018, Hilton's board of directors authorized a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock to be paid on or before June 29, 2018 to holders of record of its common stock as of the close of business on May 11, 2018.\nIn April 2018, Hilton repurchased 16.5 million shares of Hilton common stock from an affiliate of HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. (\"HNA\") for $1.17 billion at a price of $70.9925 per share, bringing total share repurchases by Hilton to over 31 million shares. HNA also sold 66.0 million shares of Hilton common stock in an underwritten, public offering and no longer has any beneficial ownership interest in Hilton. Additionally, in April 2018, Hilton issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2026 and used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance, together with borrowings under its senior secured revolving credit facility and available cash to fund the stock repurchase and repay approximately $500 million outstanding under its senior secured term loan facility.\nAdoption of ASUs\nThe Company adopted ASU 2014-09 and ASU No. 2017-07 (\"ASU 2017-07\"), Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, on January 1, 2018 on a full retrospective basis in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The provisions of ASU 2014-09 affected the Company's revenue recognition as follows:\nApplication, initiation and other fees charged are recognized over the term of the franchise contract, rather than upon execution of the contract; Certain contract acquisition costs related to management and franchise contracts are recognized over the term of the contracts as a reduction to revenue, instead of as amortization expense; Incentive management fees are recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur as a result of future hotel profits or cash flows, as opposed to recognizing amounts that would be due if the management contract was terminated at the end of the reporting period; Revenue related to the Hilton Honors guest loyalty program is deferred as points are awarded and recognized upon point redemption, net of any reward reimbursement paid to a third party, as opposed to recognized on a gross basis at the time points are issued in conjunction with the accrual of the expected future cost of the reward reimbursement. Additionally, points issued at owned and leased hotels are accounted for as a reduction of revenue from owned and leased hotels, as opposed to expenses of owned and leased hotels; and Reimbursable fees related to management and franchise contracts are recognized as they are billed, as opposed to when Hilton incurs the related expenses.\nThe provisions of this ASU will not affect the Company's cash flow or cash available for capital return. The changes in revenue recognition for contract acquisition costs will not affect the Company's net income, and the changes for incentive management fees will not affect the Company’s net income for any full year period.\nThe provisions of ASU 2017-07 include presenting: (i) the service cost component of net periodic pension cost in owned and leased hotels expense and general and administrative expense; and (ii) the other components of net periodic pension cost in other non-operating income (loss), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prior to adoption, all net periodic pension cost was presented in owned and leased hotels expense and general and administrative expense. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\nRefer to \"New Accounting Standard Adoption - Effect on the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017\" in the schedules to this press release for additional information.\nOutlook\nShare-based metrics in Hilton's outlook include actual share repurchases to date and do not include the effect of potential share repurchases.\nFull Year 2018\nSystem-wide RevPAR is expected to increase between 2.0 percent and 4.0 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis compared to 2017. Diluted EPS, before special items, is projected to be between $2.57 and $2.66. Diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, is projected to be between $2.62 and $2.71.

Net unit growth is expected to be approximately 6.5 percent.\nSecond Quarter 2018\nSystem-wide RevPAR is expected to increase between 3.0 percent and 4.0 percent on a comparable and currency neutral basis compared to the second quarter of 2017.
