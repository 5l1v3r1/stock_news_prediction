In exchange, parents would have to agree to delay their Social Security benefits. A new analysis by The Urban Institute, a policy research group, finds that such a move could take a sizable cut out of older Americans' retirement payments. CNBC.com Alvarez | Getty Images \nSome Republicans are considering legislation that would allow people to borrow from their future Social Security benefits to pay for time off from work after they have a baby. \nA new analysis by The Urban Institute, a policy research group, finds that such a law could risk sending Americans into retirement with less money. \n\"This plan seemed too good to be true, and it probably is,\" said Richard Johnson, director of the program on retirement policy at the Urban Institute. \nThe details of the paid leave proposal are still thin, but it would allow new parents to take an early withdrawal from their Social Security benefits to pay for 12 weeks off from work after they've had a baby. In exchange, they'd have to agree to defer the collection of Social Security payments later in their life. \"This plan seemed too good to be true, and it probably is. \" -Richard Johnson, director of the program on retirement policy at the Urban Institute \nThe Independent Women's Forum, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C., first suggested the paid leave proposal in January. It has since garnered the attention of at least three Republican senators — Joni Ernst of Iowa, Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida. \n\"Paid family leave is a vital issue for every young American family,\" wrote Conn Carroll, Sen. Lee's communication director, in an email. \"He is currently working with Senators Rubio and Ernst on turning Independent Women's Forum's policy idea into actual legislation.\" \nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment about whether it supports the proposal. \nThe Urban Institute's analysis found that taking a loan from your Social Security when you're younger could set you back decades later. \nParents who took one 12-week paid leave would have to delay their Social Security checks by around 20 to 25 weeks, the Urban Institute calculated. Such a wait would reduce a person's lifetime Social Security benefits by 3 percent, according to the group's estimate. \nThat's because Social Security would not be able to recoup its loans from roughly one-quarter of new parents, because they either died before retirement age, received disability insurance or didn't work enough to qualify for the benefits, the institute calculated. And that gap would result in additional costs for other participants. \nThose who had more than one child and opted for additional paid leave would see their funds for old age shrink even more. Four 12-week paid leaves, for example, would slash a parent's Social Security payments by about 10 percent, the Urban Institute found.

We don't have a headache with Social Security. Why add it?\" -Kathleen Romig, senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nRomig believes paid leave should instead be funded through taxation. \"That's how social insurance programs are paid,\" Romig said. \nIn a review of more than 180 countries and territories, the International Labour Organization, an agency within the United Nations, found that just two countries don't offer cash benefits to women when they have a baby: Papua New Guinea and the United States. \nBut the handful of states that have adopted a paid family and medical leave policy — California, New Jersey, Rhode Island and New York — do so through a payroll tax. \nThe calculus of the proposal would be particularly punishing to women, advocates warn. \n\"Women will be more likely to dip into their Social Security, because women are still disproportionately family caregivers,\" said Sarah Fleisch Fink, director of workplace policy at the National Partnership for Women and Families. \nAnd already women receive smaller Social Security checks than men since they earn less throughout their lifetime, Fink said. \n\"This would just be a further way in which women's retirement security is at risk,\" she said. \nMore from Personal Finance: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-20T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T19:15:53.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
