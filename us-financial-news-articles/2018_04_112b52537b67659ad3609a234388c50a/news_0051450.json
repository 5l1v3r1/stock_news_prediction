REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/File Photo “About 15 percent of our children and young people are overweight, about 17 billion euros ($8.5 billion) of healthcare costs are generated annually by diet-related illnesses,” Julia Kloeckner told a food industry conference in Berlin.\nKloeckner took office in the new German government in March, with the coalition agreement committing to a strategy to reduce consumption of sugar, fat and salt.\nShe called on Germany’s food industry to make its own concrete proposals on how to achieve this in the near future.\nThe existing voluntary labeling of food content should be improved, removing sometimes confusing statements about small portions that in turn have small levels of unhealthy content, she said.\nBut Germany will not introduce a “traffic light” system of red, yellow and green codes for healthy and unhealthy food, she said. She regarded this as oversimplified.\nReporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann, writing by Michael Hogan; editing by Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-26T17:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T18:48:20.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
