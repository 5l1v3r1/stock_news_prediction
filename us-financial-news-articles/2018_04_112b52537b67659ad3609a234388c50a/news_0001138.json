The Twins hit three homers in a 6-2 win over Baltimore (1-2) on Saturday night.\nThey belted three homers off Baltimore starter Kevin Gausman and one more off rookie Pedro Araujo, and that proved to be more than enough offense for Berrios (1-0).\nBaltimore could manage just a Chance Sisco double in the third before threatening in the ninth. The Orioles loaded the bases with one out but Berrios retired the next two batters.\nOverall, Berrios threw 107 pitches, 71 for strikes, in the victory. The right-hander had six strikeouts and just one walk.\nHe now has a 3-0 career record vs. the Orioles.\nAs for Gausman (0-1), he has pitched well in the second half of the season in 2016 and 2017 but struggled in early days. That trend continued in his first start of 2018.\nThe right-hander gave up four runs in the first inning plus two more in the third, as the Twins took a 6-0 lead early. Overall, Gausman allowed six runs on seven hits in four innings.\nHe also made two wild pitches and did not have complete command.\nThe Twins jumped out to an early lead for the second straight game. Dozier homered on Gausman’s first pitch, and Minnesota never trailed after that.\nLater in the inning, Eduardo Escobar got an RBI double, and Gausman made a wild pitch with Byron Buxton batting that brought in a third run. Buxton followed that with an RBI single to make it 4-0 in the first.\nGausman needed 25 pitches to get through the top of the first inning. He did not allow anything in the second inning but Sano hit his second homer in two days and gave the Twins a 5-0 lead in the third.\nThey made it 6-0 later in the third when Escobar hit the team’s third solo homer in the first three innings.\nDozier gave the Twins a 7-0 lead with his second homer, this one off Araujo, in the top of the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-02T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-02T20:47:17.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
