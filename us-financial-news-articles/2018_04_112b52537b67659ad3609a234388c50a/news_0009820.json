Space feels tantalisingly close now. \n— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) April 5, 2018 \nVSS Unity has completed a series of unpowered test flights over the past year, according to Space.com, but Thursday’s mission marks Virgin Galactic’s first return to powered flight since the VSS Enterprise crashed in 2014, killing one of its pilots. The company will continue to run progressively longer test trips throughout 2018, Space.com reports, with the goal of launching commercial service by the end of the year. \nVirgin Galactic aspires to “open space for everyone” and use “space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience,” according to its website. The VSS Unity and its sister spaceships will eventually “offer everyone the opportunity to become private astronauts and experience the wonder of space for themselves,” the company says.
