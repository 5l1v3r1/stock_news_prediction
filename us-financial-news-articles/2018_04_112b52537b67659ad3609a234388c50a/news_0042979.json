Britain's Queen Elizabeth waves during a special concert \"The Queen's Birthday Party\" to celebrate her 92nd birthday at the Royal Albert Hall in London, Britain April 21, 2018.

The major beneficiary of Saturday’s event, televised live on BBC TV and radio, will be the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust youth charity, of which her grandson Prince Harry was appointed president this week. \nElizabeth was born on April 21, 1926, and became queen in 1952 at the age of 25, meaning she has now reigned for more than 66 years. \nShe still carries out official engagements but her husband Prince Philip, who spent 10 days in hospital this month for a hip replacement, retired from public life last year.
