REUTERS/Omar Sanadiki The military focus on the area, where Islamic State holds a pocket next to one held by rebel factions, began last week after the army took back eastern Ghouta. \nRebels in two other enclaves northeast of Damascus surrendered in recent days. Buses transferring fighters from one of them to opposition territory in northern Syria under safe passage from the government continued to leave on Monday, state media said. \nOn Friday, state television and a war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Islamic State and the rebels had agreed to surrender the south Damascus area, withdrawing to territory their comrades control in other parts of the country. \nRelated Coverage Syrian opposition says U.S. cannot afford to leave Syria yet G7 to set up group to study Russian 'malign behavior': UK Russia says no decision yet on delivery of S-300 missiles to Syria However, the fighting has continued and the Observatory said on Monday that it was because some of the Islamic State fighters had rejected the surrender agreement. \nThe continued bombardment was directed only at the area held by Islamic State, the Observatory added. \nState television broadcast live footage showing the area of Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp and the al-Hajar al-Aswad district with large plumes of smoke rising from several places. \nUNRWA, the U.N. agency that cares for Palestinians, said on Sunday that conditions in Yarmouk were hellish. “There must be safe passage for the sick and the wounded and the dying civilians,” said Chris Gunness, the UNRWA spokesman. \nReporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n  0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
