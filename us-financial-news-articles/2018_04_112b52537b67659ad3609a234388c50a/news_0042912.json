That’s it. \n“I don’t want to think about another title yet, I just want to think about the way I have to play and try to be ready for it.” \nNishikori fought back from a set down to beat Germany’s Alexander Zverev 3-6 6-3 6-4 to reach his first Masters final since 2016 in Montreal. \nThird seed Zverev looked in control when he claimed the opening set but Nishikori fought back to claim four straight games in the second to force a decider. \nEach player saved two break points in their first service games of the decider before Nishikori steadied himself to convert a match point in the 10th game and book a place in the final.
