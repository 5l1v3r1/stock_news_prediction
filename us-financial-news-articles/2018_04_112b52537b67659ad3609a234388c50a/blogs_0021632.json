The power Sessions abdicated fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , whom Trump has reportedly also considered firing.\nAt the Monday evening briefing, Trump offered some of his harshest criticism yet for the head of his own Justice Department. \"The attorney general made a terrible mistake when he did this,\" Trump said of Sessions' recusal. Had Sessions let Trump know he was planning to recuse himself over failing to report contacts with a Russian ambassador in congressional testimony, \"we would have used a — put a different attorney general in,\" Trump said.\nSanders affirmed that Trump's words represented his feelings about Sessions, saying \"the president was pretty clear about his frustrations when he spoke about that last night.\"\nAsked if John Bolton , who began his tenure as Trump's new national security advisor on Monday, forced homeland security advisor Tom Bossert to resign , Sanders said she is \"not going to get into specific details about ongoing personnel.\" She added, however, that Trump feels Bossert has \"done a great job.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T22:43:19.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
