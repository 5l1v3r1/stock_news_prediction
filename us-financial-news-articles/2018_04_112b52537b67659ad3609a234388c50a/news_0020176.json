This increase signals management’s continued confidence in the cash generation of its ongoing business,” Bernstein analysts said. \nSaga reported a small rise in pre-tax profit to 190.1 million pounds ($269.5 million) for the year ended January after its tour operations were hit by the collapse of Monarch Airlines. \nSaga reiterated that its underlying profit would be about 5 percent lower in the current fiscal year. Saga first made that forecast in December, citing challenging trading in insurance broking and the Monarch collapse. \nMonarch’s failure hit Saga’s tour operations, leading it to restructure its travel business. \nThe drop in the pound since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has hit British consumers’ spending power, but Saga’s customers have continued to travel, helping the firm report a 36.9 percent jump in underlying pre-tax profit in the travel business. \n“Our customers remain resilient, they remain apparently unaffected by Brexit ... It doesn’t seem to have driven a change in their booking behaviours,” Batchelor said. \nSaga will have two new ships by 2020, and has hit over 50 percent of its sales target for the ‘Spirit of Discovery’.
