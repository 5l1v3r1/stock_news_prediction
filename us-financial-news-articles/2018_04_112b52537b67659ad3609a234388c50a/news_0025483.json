The game ended 2-2. \nA third Arsenal player who did not come off the substitute’s bench was targeted with the same chants after the final whistle as he jogged to warm down on the pitch at the CSKA Arena, the witness said. The player, who Reuters was unable to identify, was black. \nRussia faces increased scrutiny over fan behaviour ahead of the World Cup it hosts starting in June and the country has pledged to crack down on racism. \nUEFA told Reuters on Friday that no racist behaviour had been reported to it by match officials at the game. \nUEFA said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow on Friday for infractions including throwing objects and setting off fireworks. The alleged infractions were not connected to racist or discriminatory behaviour. \nThe European soccer body said it took allegations of racist behaviour very seriously and it would be grateful for audio or video evidence of any other incident as it required sufficient proof to be able to press charges. \nThe Russian Football Union declined to comment. Reuters made repeated calls to a mobile number for a CSKA spokesman but there was no reply. An email to the club was not answered. \nA spokesman for Arsenal declined to provide a comment for publication. \nFootball governing bodies have previously taken action in response to racist and discriminatory behaviour at Russian soccer grounds on several occasions. \nUEFA last month opened disciplinary proceedings against Saint Petersburg’s Zenit over racist chanting and other violations by fans at a Europa League game against Leipzig. \nFIFA said last month it was probing racist abuse directed at French players by Russian fans during a pre-World Cup friendly between the countries in Saint Petersburg.
