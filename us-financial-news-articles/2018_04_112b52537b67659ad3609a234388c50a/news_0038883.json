REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo \nCommodity currencies such as the Australian dollar and the Kiwi came under pressure thanks to a drop in Chinese stocks, while sterling extended losses for a second consecutive day after the central bank dampened expectations of a May rate hike. \nLong euro bets are the biggest consensus trade in the foreign exchange market, with net positions holding near a record high despite PMIs recording a sizeable drop in March and mixed inflation data. \n“We are seeing the euro stuck in a range and unless the ECB signals a major change in policy we expect the currency to be trapped around these levels,” said Kenneth Broux, an FX strategist at Societe Generale in London. \nThe European Central Bank meets next week and expectations have grown that policymakers may take another small step in exiting its ultra-easy monetary policy after dropping a long-standing pledge to increase its bond buying if needed at its last meeting in March. \nBut Nordea markets strategists believe such a step may be hasty, given some signs of a softening in economic data and brewing concerns of an escalation in trade disputes. \nThe central bank still wants to emphasize patience, prudence and persistence”, they said in a note. “Forward guidance will thus likely be left unchanged next week, while Draghi’s tone should be relatively dovish.” \nDespite a 0.4 percent drop to $1.2299 on Friday, the single currency EUR=EBS has traded within a broad 1.21 to 1.25 range for much of this year even as long euro positions have swelled to a record $23 billion. COMMODITY PRICES \nThe Australian dollar came under heavy selling pressure as a drop in Chinese stocks weighed on the currency despite generally firmer commodity prices across the board. The Aussie AUD=D3 weakened half a percent while the kiwi NZD=D3 weakened 0.7 percent. Shanghai stocks .SSEC ended down 1.5 percent. \n(For a graphic on 'Europe Inflation and PMI' click reut.rs/2Hg00Gx ) \nSterling took another leg down on Friday to $1.4041 having fallen nearly 1 percent in the New York session after Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that a rate hike this year was \"likely\". GBP=D3 \n“There is a vulnerability in the British economy which Carney is only flagging now when markets have all but priced in a May rate hike,” said Marc Ostwald, a global strategist at ADM Investor Services International in London. \n“This is a bit like indicating north by northwest and then choosing to fly south by southeast.” \nExpectations of a UK interest rate increase in May has shrunk to around 40 percent from 70 percent earlier this week after Carney’s remarks. \nThe dollar held generally firm across the board .DXY helped by higher U.S. Treasury yields. Ten-year yields held at 2.91 percent. \nThe dollar firmed to 107.54 yen JPY=EBS , up 0.2 percent on the day and edging near its seven-week high of 107.78 yen touched last week, after U.S. President Donald Trump apparently made no new fresh demands on trade at his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier this week. \nElsewhere, the euro stabilised below the 1.20 line against the Swiss franc after briefly breaking above that line on Thursday.
