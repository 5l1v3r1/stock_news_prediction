CSX 7.85% is getting more profitable as it gets smaller. The freight railroad more than doubled its net profit in the first quarter to $695 million and showed big gains in service performance, only a few months after Chief Executive James Foote undertook an “apology tour” to sell CSX’s shipping customers on the turnaround efforts . The WSJ’s Justin Lahart writes the results signal that CSX has its operations in order following snafus that came as the carrier implemented a plan by the late chief executive Hunter Harrison. CSX’s revenue inched up only slightly from a year ago in the first quarter as volumes declined. But the company slashed its operating ratio to 63.7% from 73.2%, and critical service measures for train velocity and dwell time showed big improvements. For now, at least, running fewer trains means smoother operations and bigger profits.\nOil is backing up so much in the Permian basin that producers may have to look to trucks to get more of the crude moving. The West Texas and New Mexico region at the heart of the U.S. shale boom has become a top area globally for expanding oil production. The WSJ’s Alison Sider and Bradley Olson report it now appears to be choking on its own growth . Permian producers are encountering congested pipelines and shortages of materials and workers, souring some energy executives on forecasts that production will climb by a third within two years. The bottlenecks highlight how investment in the oil fields has outpaced infrastructure development and overwhelmed pipelines. That’s threatening to hit financial returns as producers struggle to bring more equipment and workers into the region and even look to ship crude over the road.\nFashion retailer Primark is using a streamlined purchasing system with suppliers to help improve its profit margins. The U.K. chain has undertaken the shift in sourcing as it continues “refining its model” for expansion in the U.S., Chief Financial Officer John Bason tells the WSJ’s Nina Trentmann, part of a measured approach to growth in a tumultuous market for brick-and-mortar retailers. Mr. Bason says the company is “becoming more professional” in its purchasing strategy, and is focusing more on big suppliers to take advantage of economies of scale in its sourcing. The company even sources certain items from only one supplier, reducing the cost per item sold. The subsidiary of Associated British Food PLC is trying to halt a slide in profit margin that’s taken the critical financial measure from 14.1% in 2006 to 9.8% in the six months ending March 3.\nECONOMY & TRADE Photo: Bloomberg News President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on China stand to create winners and losers among U.S. manufacturers. The tariffs will have a disproportionate impact on factories that rely more on certain Chinese imports, the WSJ’s Andrew Tangel and Theo Francis write, potentially driving up costs that would put them at a competitive disadvantage . An analysis of data from research firm Panjiva shows China is a major source of overall imports for only a minority of the products on Mr. Trump’s tariffs list. Companies that buy those components are likely to bear the brunt of the tariffs. Trade figures show the same tariff also could hit two companies in the same industry differently, depending on where they source their components. Many will be seeking exemptions to the tariffs to keep their trans-Pacific shipments coming and their costs in check.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ No apology tour anymore. That’s canceled, nothing to apologize for.
