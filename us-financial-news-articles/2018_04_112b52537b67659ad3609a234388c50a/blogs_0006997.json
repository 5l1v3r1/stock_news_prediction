Chinese President Xi Jinping , meanwhile, could benefit politically from the ordeal, Baptist said.\n\"By responding to the U.S. and sticking within World Trade Organization parameters, [China] look good domestically, and they look good internationally. It really makes the U.S. look like the aggressor.\"\nNicolas Asfouri | AFP | Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping leave a business leaders event at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on November 9, 2017. A better solution is to focus on reciprocal treatment by opening up both economies for parallel export and investment, Zarit said.\nAdditionally, tariffs may change the business environment in China for U.S. companies, and many of the chamber's members are concerned about retaliation from Beijing, according to Zarit.\nUncertainty about what will happen has roiled markets â€” and that could eventually drag down the wider economy, Baptist said: \"If sentiment on Wall Street means that the stock markets fall by another 15 or 20 percent, then I think that would be the thing that tips the U.S. economy over.\"\nIntellectual property theft But even if tariffs do end up having some short-term negative effects on the U.S. economy, Trump is willing to accept that to fix what the White House sees as long-term problems, Baptist said.\n\"Nationalism has been on the rise in both countries and I think both leaders will try and paint this as standing strong against a foreign adversary,\" the economist told CNBC.\nshow chapters China is playing 'a good tactical game': Economist 13 Hours Ago | 02:02 One of the core complaints the White House has about the U.S.-China relationship is about the alleged Chinese theft of American companies' intellectual property.\nWhile the U.S. shouldn't begrudge China for making strides in the IT field and becoming capable of developing its own technology, tensions are bound to arise where intellectual property is concerned, according to Zarit.\nWhen successful Chinese products are \"based on IP that was taken from U.S. companies,\" and \"often times, the technology is developed with a lot of state support, preferential loans, and domestic protection,\" then tensions are sure to arise, Zarit said.\nOne way to overcome the issue would be to focus on \"Made in China 2025,\" an industrial policy plan that China is rolling out, which promises state subsidies, preferential loans, and protection of the domestic market, for Chinese companies. The policy is only applicable to Chinese companies currently, but Zarit argued that it could go a long way to mending trade relations if it were opened up to foreign participation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-05T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-05T09:38:06.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
