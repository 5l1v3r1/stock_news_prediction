How do they manage ... selling Lotus without cannibalizing Symetis accounts?” Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings asked.\nBoston Scientific raised full-year revenue forecast to between $9.75 billion and $9.90 billion from $9.65 billion to $9.80 billion.\nThe company also hiked its 2018 adjusted earnings per share forecast to between $1.37 and $1.41 from between $1.35 and $1.39.\nBoston Scientific reported adjusted earnings of 33 per share, a cent above analysts’ estimates.\nNet sales of $2.38 billion beat the average Street estimate of $2.34 billion.\nReporting by Tamara Mathias in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Anil D'Silva\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T19:31:20.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
