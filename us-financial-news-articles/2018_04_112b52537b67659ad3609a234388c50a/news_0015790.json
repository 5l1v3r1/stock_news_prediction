(Photo: Business Wire)\nManaging Directors Jack Spilberg , who joined XDA last week, and Rachel Hermansader , who joined the agency in October, will lead the effort to build on The XD Agency’s rich roster of cutting-edge technology clients, including Samsung and Cisco.\n“Tech companies understand real-world experiences’ ability to shape perceptions and compel behaviors. Of course, we do, too,” said CEO Steve Shlansky. “And we feel confident that Jack and Rachel’s tech expertise, marketing bona fides, and sought-after ability to develop meaningful relationships will allow us to increase our portfolio of tech sector work — work that generates greater value for our clients than ever.”\nSpilberg is celebrated as much for his meaningful and mutually beneficial relationships as for his hustle. He brings to The XD Agency a 15-year track record in business development, most recently serving as the director of business development and marketing at Stimulant, an innovation studio focused on digital experience design. His work at The XD Agency will focus on client development in the technology and media and entertainment verticals.\nHermansader came to The XD Agency from Duncan Channon, a branding and advertising agency that specializes in relaunching brands. Under her leadership as director of marketing and business development, the agency was recognized as by Ad Age as a Small Agency of the Year. At XDA, Hermansader leads cross-disciplinary teams in service of clients in her two specialty sectors: technology and food and beverage.\nThe two managing directors report to SVP of Client Development Matt Schrader , who came to XDA in June 2017, after serving as the Managing Director at INVNT. An innovator and an industry leader, Schrader focuses on driving revenue by optimizing The XD Agency’s sales strategy and mentoring the client development team.\n“Matt’s combination of trusted marketing expertise, deeply held relationships, and charismatic leadership position him optimally to lead the evolution of The XD Agency’s client development team,” Shlansky said. “He is bringing out the best in his team, and ensuring that, more than ever, The XD Agency offers our clients unparalleled return on investment in our segment.”\nABOUT THE XD AGENCY\nThe XD Agency is a strategic communications agency hyper-focused on experience design. We create transformative business value for our clients through immersive experiences that are emotional and real. We develop smart content and strategies to bring out the best in experiential programs and portfolios.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410006406/en/\nThe XD Agency\nLeigh Long, 240-605-3551\nleigh.long@xdagency.com\nSource: The XD Agency", "external_links": ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410006406/en/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T23:02:40.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
