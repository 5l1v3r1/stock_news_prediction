A third source said the finalization is now “very close.” The deal was originally expected to close in late 2018, and then mid-year, pending regulatory approval.\nThe companies have almost completed the process of seeking clearances which must span multiple jurisdictions, the persons added.\nAll of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are private.

REUTERS/Regis Duvignau\nAn Airbus spokesman cited comments by Chief Executive Tom Enders who said this month the deal would close by mid-year.\nBombardier could not immediately be reached for comment.\nIn October last year, Airbus agreed to buy a majority stake in Bombardier’s CSeries jetliner programme, grabbing control of a struggling competitor.\nCompletion of the venture could kick-start orders from airlines sitting on the sidelines at a time of industry consolidation, the people added.\nBombardier said in February there had been a “bit of a pause” in orders for its narrowbody jets as airlines waited for the company to complete the partnership deal. Separate talks aimed at a tie-up between planemakers Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ) are also said to be advancing.\nU.S. carrier JetBlue Airways Corp ( JBLU.O ) has said these developments prompted it to put off a decision whether to replace its fleet of about 60, 100-seater E-190 jets, in a campaign that pits the CSeries against its Brazilian rival’s latest model, the E190-E2.\n“The timing of the review moved a little based on what was happening out in the market with the OEMs,” said JetBlue CFO Steve Priest in an April interview.\n“Obviously Airbus announced that they were taking a stake in the CSeries programme from Bombardier, and there’s been some noise in the market around some sort of Boeing and Embraer (agreement). So we’ve been taking that into consideration as we’re going forward.” Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and Alana Wise in New York; Editing by Susan Thomas and Matthew Lewis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T21:27:50.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
