Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.119 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed financial forecasts, however.\nAnalysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro operating loss on revenues of 10.209 billion, according to a Reuters poll. $1 = 0.8258 euros Reporting by Tim Hepher, Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Richard Lough", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T08:24:23.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
