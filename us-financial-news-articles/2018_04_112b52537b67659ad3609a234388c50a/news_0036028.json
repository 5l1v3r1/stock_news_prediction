(EU digital chief Andrius) Ansip refers to the invitation as a measure of rebuilding trust,\" she said.\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment. Zuckerberg fielded 10 hours of questions over two days from nearly 100 U.S. lawmakers last week and emerged largely unscathed. He will meet Ansip in San Francisco on Tuesday.\nAnother European lawmaker Sophia in't Veld echoed the call from her colleagues, saying that the Facebook CEO should do them the same courtesy.\n\"I think Zuckerberg would be well advised to appear at the Parliament out of respect for Europeans,\" she said.\nLawmaker Viviane Reding, the architect of the EU's landmark privacy law which will come into effect on May 25, giving Europeans more control over their online data, said the right laws would bring back trust among users.
