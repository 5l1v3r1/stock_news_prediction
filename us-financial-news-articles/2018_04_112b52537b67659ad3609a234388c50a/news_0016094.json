Chiloba did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.r\nThe commission was frequently at the cente of controversy during Kenya’s extended elections season last year, in which around 100 people were killed.\nSeveral days before the Aug. 8 vote, a top official from the commission was found dead in unclear circumstances, adding to a climate of fear surrounding the vote for Kenyans who saw their 2007 election descend into ethnic violence.\nThe Supreme Court nullified the results of the August election, citing procedural irregularities. It ruled that commission officials had announced results before being able to verify them.\nPresident Uhuru Kenyatta won a repeat vote in October that opposition leader Raila Odinga boycotted.\nReporting by John Ndiso; Editing by Maggie Fick and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T19:57:53.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
