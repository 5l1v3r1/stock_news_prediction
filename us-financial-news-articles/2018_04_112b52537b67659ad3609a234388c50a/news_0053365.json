REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo\n“Amazon delivered a humongous quarter, with faster growth and higher profitability than Street projections and followed up with a one-two punch by announcing it was raising annual Prime membership fee,” Deutsche Bank Lloyd Walmsley said.\nThe 20 percent hike was the second time Amazon had increased its Prime subscription fee since the launch of the service in 2005.\nThe service, crucial in driving purchases of both goods and digital media on Amazon, gives members free delivery, access to movies and original series through Prime Video, on-demand music streaming and free books on Prime Reading.\nThat appears to put it on a collision course with Netflix and Apple in the streaming market - but analysts say Bezos is more interested in how the appeal of the service props up his retail empire.\nAmazon disclosed last week it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally and commentators said it would likely raise prices outside of the United States as well.\n“So far there is no word on international price hikes but with the expansion of shipping services and content worldwide, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see them,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said.
