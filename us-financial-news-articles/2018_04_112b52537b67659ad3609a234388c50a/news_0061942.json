Now, the state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco has crossed a milestone of its own.\nAs part of a board reshuffling that took place over the weekend, Aramco added its first-ever female director.\nLynn Laverty Elsenhans, who previously served as the chairwoman, president, and chief executive of U.S. oil refiner Sunoco Inc., was among the five members added to Saudi Aramco’s board. In joining Saudi Aramco's board, former Sunoco CEO Lynn Elsenhans is one of the most powerful women in Saudi business.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih remains the company’s chairman.\nWhile the introduction of a woman and additional non-Saudi members may be intended to increase the attractiveness of the company as it prepares for an IPO , the continued inclusion of Saudi government officials could limit its options for listing on Western exchanges, suggests The Wall Street Journal .\n", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-aramco-shakes-up-board-adds-first-female-director-1524996457"], "published": "2018-04-30T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-30T14:51:20.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
