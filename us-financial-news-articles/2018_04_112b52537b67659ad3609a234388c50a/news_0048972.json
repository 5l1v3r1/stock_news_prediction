Analysts have been steadily raising that estimate in recent months as companies have touted the benefits of a lower tax rate, a healthy consumer and higher oil prices.\nOf the companies that have reported so far, 80% have posted per-share earnings that beat expectations of Wall Street analysts, with the companies on average topping estimates by 5.9%. Both of those metrics are ahead of five-year averages. At the sector level, health-care, energy and real-estate companies in the index have delivered the highest percentage of better-than expected performances, while materials and consumer-discretionary firms have underperformed.\nhttps://asset.wsj.net/dynamic-insets/charts/cdc_f38b81e8c49b454c90be004e.json \nUnitedHealth Group stock being traded on Jan. 31, 2018, at the New York Stock Exchange.

Companies that reported stronger-than-expected earnings have seen their shares on average rise by 0.1% two days before the earnings release through two days after, well below the five-year average increase of 1.1%. And the companies that disappointed by posting weaker-than-expected numbers have seen their shares slide 0.9% over the same period, much smaller than the five-year average decline of 2.4%.\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T10:06:16.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
