It would also include a 154-room luxury hotel in the premises. \nPace chief executive Sorapoj Techakraisri said the firm would use the proceeds to purchase shares in the project from investors Goldman Sachs Investment Holdings (Asia), an arm of Goldman Sachs, and Apollo Asia Sprint, a unit of Apollo Global Management LLC, for $320 million and repay loans. \nThe proceeds would also be used to develop its four other real estate properties and expand high-end grocer Dean & Deluca in the United States, Japan and Thailand, Sorapoj said in a statement. \nKing Power is Thailand’s biggest duty free retailer and owner of English Premier League football club Leicester City. \n($1 = 31.1600 baht)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-11T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T11:55:58.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
