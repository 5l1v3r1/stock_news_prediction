Ray pitched in St. Louis for the first time since suffering a concussion when he was struck by a line drive on July 28, 2017, causing him to miss a month.\nYadier Molina’s RBI double was one of the two hits off Ray and four relievers for the Cardinals (4-3). Matt Carpenter walked twice, the 100th multi-walk game of his career, and has reached safely in all seven games.\nThe Cardinals, who had homered in their first six games, did not have a hit in the final five innings as Ray, Yoshihisa Hirano, Andrew Chafin, Archie Bradley or Brad Boxberger shut down the St. Louis offense.\nBoxberger recorded his third save with a 1-2-3 ninth.\nDescalso walked to open the second inning off Adam Wainwright, who was activated before the game after opening the season on the disabled list with a hamstring injury, and Owings doubled with one out.\nJarrod Dyson was intentionally walked before Ray hit a sacrifice fly to center. Peralta singled to right to drive in Owings and make it 2-0.\nOwings, starting at second base for the first time this season, singled in the fourth inning, advanced on Ray’s sacrifice bunt and scored on Peralta’s two-out single for a 3-0 lead.\nCarpenter and Jose Martinez walked in the fourth inning before Molina’s one-out double drove in Carpenter. Ray struck out the final two batters of the inning with runners on second and third to preserve a 3-1 lead. That was the Cardinals’ last hit.\nWainwright (0-1) gave up three runs and four hits in 3 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T11:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T22:11:00.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
