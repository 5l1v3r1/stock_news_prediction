It was also their largest victory margin. \nThe New Zealanders are on six points and now in danger of not qualifying for the semi-finals, having already been beaten 57-53 by Malawi, and could be forced to rely on goal percentage to advance. \nUganda, who are third in Pool B on four points, could still finish second if they beat Scotland heavily later on Wednesday. \nThe second-placed team in the pool will likely have to face world and Commonwealth champions Australia in the semi-finals. \nThe unbeaten Australians face Jamaica, who also have a 4-0 record, later on Wednesday for the top-spot in Pool A. \nNew Zealand have only ever finished first or second in the Commonwealth Games netball tournament since it was introduced at Kuala Lumpur in 1998.
