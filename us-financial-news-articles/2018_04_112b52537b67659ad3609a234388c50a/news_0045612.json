Earnings per share (EPS) for the three months ended were $0.79 per basic share and $0.76 per diluted share compared to $0.56 per basic share and $0.54 diluted share reported for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nOverall, total assets increased by $6.2 million or 2.18% to $289.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $283.6 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe largest component of assets, loans, net of deferred fees and costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased $5.1 million or 2.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. Total net loans at March 31, 2018 were $242.5 million compared to $237.4 million at December 31, 2017. The growth was primarily the result of demand for loans secured by real estate including 1-4 family residential, land, and residential construction loans.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 increased $8.3 million or 3.65% to $236.2 million compared to $227.9 million at December 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, money market, and savings deposits were the main growth areas contributing to the increase in overall deposits.\nThere were no short-term borrowings at March 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 million of FHLB advances at December 31, 2017.\nLong-term borrowings, consisting of FHLB discount note borrowings were unchanged at $22.1 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income was $2.78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $2.39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This was an increase of $390,000, or 16.3%. The increase for the quarter was primarily from interest income earned on loans.\nThe provision for loan losses amounted to $195,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $150,000 in provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in loan loss provision for the quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter, is not a result of increased loss activity but more appropriately a result of increased risk awareness and identification to strengthen the allowance for loan losses.\nTotal non-interest income amounted to $370,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $381,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $11,000 or 2.9%. The decrease was primarily from a decline in income from held-for-sale mortgage activity.\nTotal non-interest expense increased by $176,000 or 9.9% to $1.96 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.78 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The majority of the increase was due to increased expenses of salaries and benefits. The Company continues to show improvement in its efficiency ratio, a measure of expense as a percent of total income, to 62.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 64.3% for the same period in 2017.\nAdditional Information\nCentury Next Financial Corporation is the holding company for Bank of Ruston (the “Bank”) which conducts business from three full-service banking centers.
