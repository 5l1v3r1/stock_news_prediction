Just 27 percent of Americans call it a good idea, down from 30 percent in January. A 36 percent plurality call it a bad idea, while the rest have no opinion.\nMoreover, a majority gives thumbs-down on the plan when asked to consider its potential effects. Just 39 percent foresee a positive impact from a stronger economy, more jobs and more money in their pockets; 53 percent foresee a negative impact from higher deficits and disproportionate benefits for the wealthy and big corporations.\n\"Not a great starting point\" for the fall campaign, said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with Republican counterpart Bill McInturff. The telephone poll of 900 adults, conducted April 8-11, carries a margin of error of 3.27 percentage points.\nRepublicans began learning that lesson last month during a special House election in Pennsylvania. GOP strategists found the tax cuts an ineffective message against the Democratic candidates and dropped the issue as Election Day approached.\nThe Democratic victory in a district President Donald Trump had won by 20 percentage points in 2016 showed that tax cuts are \"a political loser,\" says David Wasserman, a House analyst at the Cook Political Report.\nThe question now is how much effort GOP candidates sink into improving their stance on the tax-cut issue. They retain some advantages: Men still favor the tax cuts, although less strongly than women oppose it; so do rural residents, older men, and men without college degrees.\nYet working-class, middle-class and upper-class Americans all hold negative views of the tax-cut law. Women who have graduated from college call the tax cuts a bad idea by nearly a 3-to-1 margin.\nOverall, the NBC/WSJ Poll shows Democrats with a seven-point edge over Republicans , 47 percent to 40 percent, on which party Americans want to win control of Congress this fall. Just 39 percent of Americans approve of Trump's job performance, while 57 percent disapprove.\nWATCH: Tax cuts will bode well for earnings show chapters Consumer tax cuts impacting economic growth will bode well for earnings, says strategist 1:28 PM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 04:51 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T00:23:34.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
