It also acquired Sony Corp’s lithium ion battery operations last year to further expand into the automotive sector.\nMurata, which earns about 60 percent of revenue from smartphone parts, has said that it wants auto parts to contribute 20 to 30 percent in about 10 years, from around 13 percent at the moment.
