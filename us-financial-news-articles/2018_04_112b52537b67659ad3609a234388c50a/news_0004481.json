The average sales price rose 7.7 percent to $393,000. \nHousing in the United States is benefiting from a strong economy and an improving job market, but house builders have been battling higher raw material costs and shortage of labor. \nNet income attributable to Lennar shareholders rose to $136.2 million, or 53 cents per share, in the quarter ended Feb. 28, from $38.1 million, or 16 cents per share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, the company earned $1.11 a share. \nRevenue rose to $2.98 billion from $2.34 billion.
