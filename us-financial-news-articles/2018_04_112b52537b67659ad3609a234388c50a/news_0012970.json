He practically grew up in an orchestra pit where his father was a big band leader at New York’s Roxy Theatre. His grandfather also performed in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. \nThrough his family, McCann was exposed to some of the best comedians of the 1930s and 1940s and he would have his classmates in stitches imitating them at school, Lozzi said. \nHe got his professional start in local radio and television doing voices, puppetry work and standup comedy. McCann later starred in scores of children’s television programs such as “Lunch with Soupy Sales” and “The Captain Kangaroo Show” and “Rootie Kazootie,” Lozzi said. \nMcCann later moved to Los Angeles and worked as a character actor on shows including; “Little House on the Prairie”, “Bonanza”, and “Columbo.” \nBut he is best known for voicing the hungry bird Sonny for General Mills cereal. \n“We all grew up with him,” Lozzi said. “He was a pioneer.” \nHe is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Fanning, and two daughters.
