(BMV:AZTECACPO) (Latibex:XTZA), one of the two largest producers of Spanish-language television programming in the world, announced today financial results for the first quarter 2018.\n\"During the period, we generated content with cutting-edge, agile and innovative proposals, which translated into growing audiences and a solid positioning of our formats in the Mexican media market,\" commented Benjamín Salinas, CEO of TV Azteca. \"This further boosted the strong demand for advertising space on TV Azteca platforms, and increased domestic sales by double digits in the quarter.\"\n\"Going forward, we will emphasize monetizing the growing audience of the company, with commercial options that seek to further align the objectives of advertisers with the profitability of TV Azteca,\" added Mr. Salinas.\nFirst quarter consolidated results\nNet sales for the quarter were Ps.3,427 million, 12% higher than the Ps.3,065 million for the same quarter of last year. Total costs and expenses were Ps.2,906 million, compared to Ps.2,530 million for the same period last year.\nAs a result, TV Azteca reported EBITDA of Ps.521 million, from Ps.535 million last year; EBITDA margin for the quarter was 15%. Operating income was Ps.264 million, in comparison to Ps.263 million for the previous year.\nThe company registered net profit of Ps.173 million, compared to a net profit of Ps.398 million for the same quarter of 2017.\n1Q 2017 1Q 2018 Change Ps. % Net sales $3,065 $3,427 $362\n12%\nEBITDA\nOperating income $535\n$263 $521\n$264 $(14)\n$1 -3%\n0% Net result $398 $173 $(225)\n-56%\nNet result per CPO $0.13 $0.06 $(0.07)\n-56%\nFigures in millions of pesos.\nEBITDA: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.\nThe number of CPOs outstanding as of March 31, 2017 was 2,982 million and as of March 31, 2018 was 2,986 million.\nResults by business segment\nDomestic operations\nDomestic advertising sales grew 19% to Ps.2,709 million, from Ps.2,284 million a year ago, in the context of the generation of successful content that attracted large audiences in Mexico.\nProduction, programming and transmission costs were Ps.1,923 million, 31% higher than the Ps.1,465 million a year ago, in line with efforts to produce superior quality programs, which translate into higher revenues.\nContribution generated by operations of the media business in Mexico was Ps.786 million, compared to Ps.819 million from the previous year.\nAs of this quarter, due to the sale of assets of Azteca America, the results related to the generation and sale of content, and services and exhibition rights in the United States are included in domestic operations, because they come from actions that are carried out predominantly in Mexico.\nTV Azteca Guatemala and Honduras\nRevenue from TV Azteca Guatemala and TV Azteca Honduras was Ps.13 million, in comparison to Ps.14 million for the year-ago period. Costs associated with the operation of both channels were Ps.26 million, from Ps.29 million a year ago. As a result, their contribution was a negative Ps.13 million this period, compared to a negative Ps.15 million from the previous year.\nExports to the rest of the world\nContent sales to other countries were Ps.89 million in the quarter, from Ps.25 million in the previous year; revenue for the quarter resulted, to a great extent, from the commercialization of the shows Mujeres Rompiendo el Silencio in South America, Vivir a Destiempo in Europe, and Tanto Amor in Africa, as well as the sale of TV Azteca content to pay TV channels in the rest of the world.\nExported content does not have associated costs, thus export revenue is equal to its contribution.\nAzteca Comunicaciones Perú\nAzteca Comunicaciones Perú reported revenue of Ps.94 million, from Ps.186 million a year ago. The lesser amount this quarter results from telecommunications services and reimbursements by the Peruvian government for maintenance and operation of the network, whereas a year ago the figure was derived from reimbursements of the government for the National Dorsal Fiber Optic Network construction.\nThe company registered costs of Ps.111 million in the quarter, compared to Ps.151 million a year ago. As was the case with top line, the costs this period were related to the operation and maintenance of the network, whereas a year ago, the costs derived mainly from the construction of the network.\nThe contribution of Azteca Comunicaciones Perú was a negative Ps.17 million, compared to a positive figure of Ps.35 million a year ago.\nWGC Mexico Championship\nDuring the quarter, TV Azteca organized the golf tournament WGC Mexico Championship for the second consecutive year, one of the most important sporting events in the world, creating synergies relevant to the company. The income generated from this tournament was Ps.522 million, in comparison to Ps.556 million from previous year. The lower revenues are due to the presence of simultaneous sporting events that competed this year for the audience attending the golf tournament.\nThe costs related to the golf tournament WGC Mexico Championship were Ps.541 million this period, from Ps.555 million a year ago, as a result of operational efficiencies.\nThe contribution of the tournament was a negative Ps.19 million this quarter, compared to a positive figure of Ps.1 million a year ago.\nConsolidated SG&A expenses\nThe company's total selling and administrative expenses were Ps.306 million, 7% lower compared to Ps.330 million from the previous year, as a result of lower service and personnel expenses this quarter.\nConsolidated EBITDA and net result\nConsolidated EBITDA of the company was Ps.521 million, compared to Ps.535 million for the same period of the prior year. Operating profit was Ps.264 million, in comparison to Ps.263 million a year ago.\nThe most significant variations below EBITDA were the following:\nA reduction of Ps.44 million in interest expenses, due to the reduction of debt balance of the company this period.\nAn increase of Ps.61 million in other financial expenses due to expenses associated with the payment of exchange rate hedges and interest on the debt denominated in dollars and pesos, respectively\nA reduction of Ps.351 million in foreign exchange losses, due to a lower net liability balance denominated in US dollars this period, compared to the previous year, together with a lower peso appreciation this quarter.\nA decrease of Ps.112 million in discontinued operations as a result of the deconsolidation of Azteca America's operations, as a result of the sale of assets from the company on the previous year.\nTV Azteca registered a net profit of Ps.173 million for the quarter, compared to a net profit of Ps.398 million for the same period a year ago.\nDebt\nAs of March 31, 2018, TV Azteca’s outstanding debt ̶ excluding Ps.1,676 million debt due in 2069 ̶ was Ps.11,065 million, 22% lower than the Ps.14,120 million a year ago.\nAs previously reported, the company carried out a solid strategy in 2017 to strengthen its capital structure, which reduced the debt balance, extended the debt profile and reduced the exposure to foreign exchange liabilities.\nThe cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter totaled Ps.2,823 million, from Ps.3,009 million a year ago.\nAs a result, net debt of the company as of March 31, 2018, excluding debt due in 2069, was Ps.8,242 million, 26% lower than the Ps.11,111 million a year ago.\nFiber-optic network in Peru\nAs previously announced, TV Azteca’s administration is in the process of updating the valuation and perspectives of its investments in telecommunications in Peru, as previously requested by the board, in order to determine its consistency with the strategic focus of the company. Based on this analysis, TV Azteca will formulate a plan of action regarding these investments.\nAbout TV Azteca\nTV Azteca is one of the two largest producers of Spanish-language television programming in the world, operating four television networks in Mexico, Azteca Trece, Azteca 7, adn40 and a+ through more than 300 owned and operated stations across the country.
