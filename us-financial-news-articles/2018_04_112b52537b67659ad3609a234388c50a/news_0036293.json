REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo \nBut Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke said the ECB’s request was not an unusual exercise and that it was totally unrelated to Deutsche’s internal review of its global investment bank. \n“We think we are first in the queue here because we are the largest capital markets bank in the ECB’s supervision,” von Moltke said in an interview with Reuters. \nThe timing of the simulation is sensitive because Deutsche Bank’s investment banking division has been losing market share and key staff, contributing to three consecutive years of losses at Germany’s largest lender. \nLast week, Deutsche ousted its chief executive John Cryan and Marcus Schenck, one of the heads of the investment bank, also left. The management upheaval has added to speculation that Deutsche Bank might slim down its sprawling investment banking operation. \nAn ECB spokeswoman declined to comment on individual banks. “There are in general various exercises such as recovery plans which the supervisor asks banks to provide,” she said. “In any case, the ECB does not intervene in any business model decision of banks.” \nDeutsche Bank, by talking publicly about normally private supervisory exercises, wants to avoid the impression that regulators are worried about the investment bank. \nThe bank has stabilized since late 2016, when speculation mounted that it would need a government bailout in the wake of huge fines from U.S. authorities. \nGlobal regulators are working on unified procedures for such exercises like the one that Deutsche is conducting. Regulators are primarily focused on big global banks that trade risky securities like derivatives. \nThe regulators have categorized some banks as “sytemically important” because of their size. They have identified Deutsche Bank as the most systemically important bank in the euro zone. \nRegulators in Britain have already conducted a similar simulation with Deutsche’s London-based arm. \nThe exercise can shed light on whether a sudden halt of trading activities would require government guarantees or support from taxpayers, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in its Monday edition. The German paper was the first to report the news of the simulation. \n“This (the exercise) doesn’t have any connection to any sort of state aid,” von Moltke said. \nDeutsche Bank began the task in late January and expects to conclude it in the third quarter.
