This is encouraging.”\n“The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors,” Subbaraman said.\nMSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.15 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.15 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat.\nShanghai’s index shed 0.35 percent and Japan’s Nikkei was unchanged. Australian stocks gained 0.3 percent with mining shares gaining on higher aluminium prices.\nWhile Saturday’s missile strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syria, investor risk appetite improved on speculation that the attacks would not lead to prolonged conflict.\n“The markets had been bracing for a possible escalation in Syria following President Trump’s earlier warnings. Military action, however, has been limited, bringing relief,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo.\n“That said, the underlying picture has not changed. Conflict continues in Syria and trade issues remain unresolved. Geopolitics will impact the markets again.”\nThe Dow gained 0.87 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent on Monday, with the biggest boosts from technology and healthcare sectors as investors were optimistic about the earnings season and appeared less worried about U.S.-led missile attacks in Syria.\nS&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit, on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.415 after losing 0.4 percent overnight.\nThe euro was steady at $1.2382. The dollar was effectively flat at 107.055 yen\nThe pound rose to $1.4355, its highest since June 2016, with focus on data that could cement expectations of a May interest rate increase from the Bank of England.\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped into the currency market again on Tuesday, buying HK$5.77 billion ($735 million) in Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the lower end of its allowable trading band.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was at 2.834 percent after rising to 2.865 on Monday, its highest since March 22.\nU.S. crude oil futures rose 0.5 percent to $66.57 a barrel after tumbling nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over tensions in the Middle East waned.\nBrent crude climbed 0.3 percent to $71.66 a barrel.\nAluminium hovered near seven-year highs reached the previous day after U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal stirred supply concerns.\nAluminium on the London Metal Exchange was at $2,386 per tonne after surging 5 percent to $2,403 on Monday, its highest since September 2011.
