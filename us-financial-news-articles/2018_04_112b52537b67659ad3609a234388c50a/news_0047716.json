The enactment of a fiscal 2018 budget and income tax rate hikes over Governor Bruce Rauner’s vetoes in July saved the state’s credit ratings from falling into junk.\nIllinois sold its latest debt amid a drop in tax-exempt bond prices that boosted yields on MMD’s scale as the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yield edged above 3 percent.\n“Because these yields are so big and Illinois operates in its own little world, I don’t think that had much of an impact,” said MMD research analyst Greg Saulnier.\nReporting by Karen Pierog in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T21:37:50.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
