Under these warrant plans, 1,585,000 warrants were created, subject to acceptances, and offered to the beneficiaries of the plans.\nThe offer of warrants to directors remains subject to approval of the annual shareholders' meeting to be held on 24 April 2018.\nThe warrants have an exercise term of eight years as of the date of the offer and have an exercise price of €79.88 (the average closing price of the share on Euronext Amsterdam and Brussels during the thirty days preceding the date of the offer). The warrants are not transferable and can in principle not be exercised prior to 1 January 2022. Each warrant gives the right to subscribe to one new Galapagos share. Should the warrants be exercised, Galapagos will apply for the listing of the resulting new shares on a regulated stock market. The warrants as such will not be listed on any stock market.\nGalapagos' total share capital currently amounts to €277,122,928.92; the total number of securities conferring voting rights is 51,234,962, which is also the total number of voting rights (the \"denominator\"), and all securities conferring voting rights and all voting rights are of the same category. The total number of rights (warrants) to subscribe to not yet issued securities conferring voting rights is 3,660,623, which equals the total number of voting rights that may result from the exercise of these warrants, and excludes the 1,585,000 warrants of Warrant Plan 2018 and Warrant Plan 2018 RMV, which were created subject to acceptance.
