Israel said eight of the 15 killed on Friday belonged to Hamas, and two to other militant factions. However it denied that its fighters had fired on Israeli forces, using the crowds as cover. \nOn Monday, the Palestinian death toll rose to 16, after Palestinian medical officials said that a 29-year-old man died of wounds he suffered on Friday. The armed wing of Islamic Jihad claimed him as a member.

REUTERS/Mohammed Salem \nThose who have stayed in the camps seemed to have divided into three groups. One, mostly youths, sometimes pushed to within a few dozen metres of the fence to hurl rocks at Israeli soldiers, who fired live and rubber bullets, and teargas canisters. \nOthers watched the stone-throwers from a distance. A third group stayed further back, sitting in and around the tents about 700 metres from the frontier. The mood there was calmer, with people snapping selfies and sharing stories about the protest while vendors sell ice cream, cigarettes and sandwiches.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the European Union’s top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, to call for an independent investigation. In his Easter address, Pope Francis also referred to “the wounds of ongoing conflict that do not spare the defenceless”. \nBut Israel’s government has rejected the criticism, saying it had to prevent infiltration from Gaza. A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas, the armed Islamist group which controls Gaza, of sending “children to war zones”. \nHamas rejected Israeli accusations as “lies aimed to justify Friday’s massacre”. \nAvigdor Lieberman, the Israeli defence minister, said its soldiers did what was necessary to protect Israel’s border.
