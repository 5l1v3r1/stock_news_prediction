It was not immediately clear if the figures were fully comparable.\nComcast lost 96,000 video subscribers in the quarter ended March 31, compared with an addition of 42,000 customers last year. Analysts from MoffettNathanson, UBS and Macquarie had expected losses of about 75,000 video customers.\nBut the company added 379,000 high-speed internet customers during the quarter, compared with estimates of about 365,000, and average earnings per customer relationship ticked up 0.9 percent to $152.83.\nNBCUniversal’s revenue rose by 21 percent from last year, driven by the airing of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and the U.S. Super Bowl.\nComcast is also taking steps to grow its wireless business. Comcast and Charter Communications Inc announced they will partner to build back-end software to support their Xfinity and Spectrum mobile services, respectively.\nReporting by Sheila Dang; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:03:34.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
