AUTOPILOT \nNTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt told Reuters on Tuesday the NTSB had a good working relationship with Tesla, but companies must follow the rules if they are a formal party to investigations. He and Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk had spoken with each other over the weekend. \nIn its statement, Tesla said “an agreement that prevents public release of information for over a year is unacceptable. Even though we won’t be a formal party, we will continue to provide technical assistance to the NTSB.” \nHuang’s family said on Wednesday it had hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, adding the law firm believed the Autopilot feature probably caused his death. The firm said its preliminary review of the crash suggested Autopilot was defective and that it had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the system. \nThe NTSB has not disclosed any findings from the probe. \nTesla has said Huang had activated Autopilot and it was in operation at the time of the crash. Vehicle logs from the accident showed no action was taken by Huang before the crash and that he had received warnings from the system to put his hands on the wheel, the company said. \nWhile sympathizing with the family, Tesla again blamed Huang on Wednesday, saying the driver was well aware that Autopilot was not perfect and, specifically, he had previously told them it was not reliable in that exact location, but nonetheless he engaged Autopilot. \nTesla said the Autopilot system always reminds drivers to be alert and to keep their hands on the wheel. \nThe NTSB confirmed earlier this week it had two other pending investigations of Tesla crashes, including an August 2017 Tesla battery fire in Lake Forest, California, after an owner lost control and ran the vehicle into his garage. The investigation into that fire has not previously been reported.
