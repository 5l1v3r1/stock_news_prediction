(OTCQB: SNBP), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for the treatment of pancreatic diseases, today announced the appointment of Susan Horvath as Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer, effective April 17, 2018.\n“We are very pleased to welcome Susan to Sun BioPharma’s executive team”, said David B. Kaysen, President and CEO. “Susan brings an outstanding balance of experience in public and private enterprises in several different industries. She has proven to be a strong financial and strategic partner within her previous organizations with broad industry and international experience.”\nMs. Horvath is a highly qualified senior executive.

It is with gratitude and respect that we send our best wishes with Scott as he moves on to a new opportunity.”\nAbout SBP-101\nSBP-101 is a first-in-class, proprietary polyamine compound designed to exert therapeutic effects in a mechanism specific to the pancreas. Sun BioPharma originally licensed SBP-101 from the University of Florida Research Foundation in 2011. The molecule has been shown to be highly effective in preclinical studies of human pancreatic cancer models, demonstrating superior activity to existing FDA-approved chemotherapy agents. Combination therapy potential has also been shown for pancreatic cancer. SBP-101 is expected to differ from current pancreatic cancer therapies in that it specifically targets the exocrine pancreas and has shown efficacy against primary and metastatic disease in animal models of human pancreatic cancer. Therefore management believes that SBP-101 may effectively treat both primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer, while leaving the insulin-producing islet cells and non-pancreatic tissue unharmed.\nAbout Sun BioPharma\nSun BioPharma Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing disruptive therapeutics for urgent unmet medical needs.
