Nine of the 28 defaults were by retailers. (See the complete list below.) \nMany retailers are still grappling with the debt load left behind from the private equity buyout boom several years ago. Meanwhile, all retailers are faced with the expensive task of investing in e-commerce, a business that without the right store footprint can eat into profits. \nThe latest retail defaults' come from Claire's Stores, which just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month, and Sears Holdings . The department store recently completed a distressed debt exchange, which Moody's considers a default. \n\"Stresses in the retail sector have weighed on the operating earnings of department stores, discount stores and drug stores in particular,\" said Sharon Ou, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's. \nCNBC reported last month that Moody's is expecting retailers' maturities to spike in 2019, meaning many significant debts are coming due. Companies on that list with loans to pay include Sears, Neiman Marcus and Guitar Center. These companies are also targeted as ones that could struggle to refinance or fund their loans. \nHere are the 9 retailers globally that defaulted during the first quarter of 2018, according to Moody's: \nBon-Ton Stores\nSears Holdings\nClaire's Stores\nTops Holding\nBI-LO\nBrightHouse Group PLC\nCharlotte Russe\nTops Holding II\nBI-LO Holding Finance", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T19:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T20:55:05.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
