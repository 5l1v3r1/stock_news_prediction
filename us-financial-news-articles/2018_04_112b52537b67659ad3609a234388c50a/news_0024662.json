At Friday’s closing share price of 126.3 francs, the deal would have a value of 631.5 million Swiss francs ($658 million).\n“Sulzer is in close contact with authorities and believes that this transaction will assuage any concern as to the independence of Sulzer from the Renova Group,” the company said.\nA company spokesman said no decision had been made on what to do with the shares, which would be assigned to its treasury.\nAfter completion Renova will be a 48.83 percent shareholder in the company, Sulzer said.
