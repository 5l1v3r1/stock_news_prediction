We are already present in Colombia.”\nEcuadorean crude is heavy in quality, suitable for processing at complex refineries in Asia and the United States.\nThe OPEC producer needs capital to replace oil reserves, revitalize production and overhaul refineries and terminals. But frequent contract changes have spooked big oil firms in recent years, contributing to an output decline.\nSeparately, Perez said China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) which already has investments in Ecuador’s upstream sector is also interested in downstream projects such as a 300,000 barrels per day oil refinery.\nThe proposed plant will be a complex refinery capable of processing crude of API 14 degrees produced at the Ishpingo, Tambococha and Tiputini (ITT) field located in a national park in the Amazon, he said.\nCNPC could not be immediately reached for comment.\nReporting by Florence Tan and Promit Mukherjee.
