Layoffs dropped a steep 7.7 percent, to 1.65 million.\nThe figures suggest a healthy job market tilting in favor of job seekers. There are nearly as many job openings as there are unemployed people. Businesses have complained they can't fill jobs, and many are feeling pressure to raise pay to attract and keep workers.\nThere are now just 1.08 unemployed people, on average, for every available job.
