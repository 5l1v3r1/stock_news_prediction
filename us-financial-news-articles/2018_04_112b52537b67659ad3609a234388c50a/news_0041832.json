Its stock has declined some 36 percent from an August 2016 high.\nThe company also faces a challenge from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which nominated directors to Macerich’s board earlier this month. Starboard may replace the majority of Macerich’s 10-member board, sources told Reuters.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T23:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-20T00:11:39.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
