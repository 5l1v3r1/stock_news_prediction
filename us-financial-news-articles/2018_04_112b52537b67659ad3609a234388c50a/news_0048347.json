These include tech giants Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, as well as Boeing and Chevron.\nS&P 500 companies are expected to report their strongest first-quarter profit gains in seven years. Of the 87 companies that have reported so far, 79.3 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n3 PCT BARRIER Fears are the rise in bond yields could further derail world stocks which stand some 7 percent off end-January peaks.\nWhen U.S. 10-year yields neared the 3 percent mark in 2013, it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. It also came shortly before oil’s 75 percent price tumble.\n“Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater currency and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin.\nWhile the dollar traditionally has a slight negative correlation with oil, Ruskin said higher 10-year yields would be “mildly dollar-positive”.\nIndeed, dealers cited yield differentials for the dollar’s latest rally, as the gap with German bonds touched the widest in almost three decades.\nThe greenback rose strongly against the yen and euro. The latter slumped 0.5 percent to 108.21, the weakest since Feb. 13, weighed down also by easing risks around North Korea.\nThe euro too fell half a percent to around $1.2232. It could gain direction from the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, especially if policymakers signal it may be too early to announce a timetable for winding down bond-buying.\nECB chief Mario Draghi said on Friday that while the inflation outlook had picked up, uncertainties “warrant patience, persistence and prudence”.\nAdditional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Sujata Rao and Jonathan Cable in London Editing by Gareth Jones and Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-23T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T20:59:30.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
