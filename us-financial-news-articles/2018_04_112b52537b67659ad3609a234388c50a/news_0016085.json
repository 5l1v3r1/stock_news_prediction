Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co, which have operations in China, rallied 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent, respectively.\n“By and large it appears that the speech is more conciliatory than it is pugilistic with respect to how their approach to the U.S. is,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy for Mizuho Bank in Singapore.\n“At the end of the day the sense is that the political incentives will be for both parties to get to the negotiation table.”\nAs risk sentiment improved, the safe haven currencies and assets retreated.\nU.S. 10-year Treasuries fell, pushing their yields up 2 basis points to 2.805 percent. Gold eased about 0.2 percent.\nThe safe-haven yen fell broadly, helping the dollar rise 0.3 percent to 107.14 yen, while the euro set a four-week high against the yen..\nThe Australian dollar climbed 0.8 percent on the yen to a three-week high of 82.94 yen. Against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar gained 0.4 percent to $0.7729 . “President Xi has ignited a rally in risk assets that might have some legs if the U.S. can keep a lid on the protectionist rhetoric for a while,” said Sean Callow, FX strategist for Westpac in Sydney.\nReporting by Masayuki Kitano in Singapore; additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo and Wayne Cole in Sydney Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T09:26:50.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
