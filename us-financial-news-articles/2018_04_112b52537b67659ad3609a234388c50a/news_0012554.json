Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) meets with Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Moscow, Russia March 29, 2018. Sputnik/Mikhail Klimentyev/Kremlin via REUTERS \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large oil producers led by Russia have agreed to curtail their combined output by around 1.8 million barrels per day until 2018-end in order smooth out bloated oil inventories. \nMany market participants have worried about what will happen to the oil market once the deal runs its course. \n“This could be an indefinite agreement,” Novak told reporters, referring to future cooperation with OPEC once the current deal expires. \nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters last month that Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to greatly extend a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices. \nNovak reiterated his proposal for the creation of a joint organisation with OPEC to facilitate joint efforts on the global oil market. \n“In essence, this could be some international organisation, which could gather once every half a year and discuss the situation on the oil market; both OPEC and non-OPEC countries,” Novak said. \nHe also said other large oil producers may also join the organisation. He stopped short of saying that the United States may join the body. \nU.S. oil production may surpass 11 million barrels per day in late 2018 because of the shale oil output boom, making the United States the country world’s top oil producer. \nThe rising oil production in the U.S., which weighed down oil prices, has been a worry for OPEC and Russia. \nNovak said he expected the United States Secretary of Energy Rick Perry as well as his Saudi Arabian counterpart Khalid al-Falih to attend the annual Russian economic forum to be held in the city of St. Petersburg. \nThe next OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial meeting is set for June in Vienna. \nNovak said that the meeting’s participants may discuss changes to the global output cut deal, such as tweaking oil production quotas.
