Depreciation of the Argentinean Peso decreased company sales growth by a third.\nGrupo Rotoplas S.A.B. de C.V. (AGUA.MX) (\"Rotoplas\", \"the Company\" or \"the Group\"), the leading provider of individual and integrated water solutions in the Americas, reported its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The information within has been prepared based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\"Our first quarter results show the strength of our business strategy and constitute further evidence that we are on the right track and at the right pace. Additionally, we registered record sales and EBITDA despite of generalized political uncertainty in many of our markets, which has driven down consumer confidence. Our margins improved as a result of a better price-mix and enhanced expense-control strategies. Furthermore, our most recent acquisition, the e-commerce platform in the United States, is already contributing to our overall results. And, it should be noted that, government sales stood at 4.4%, well below the 10% target in our new strategy.\nDue to the increasing importance of our Argentinean operations, which have grown significantly we have adopted a new geographical breakdown in our financial reporting, which allows us to provide greater visibility to the markets. It is worth mentioning that Argentina's currency depreciation has affected the group's sales and EBITDA growth in 5 percentage points in comparison with last year's quarter.\nWe remain therefore committed to continue pursuing our Water-as-a-Service and Water-Products business solutions strategies, focusing on innovation and a customer-centric approach\" remarked Carlos Rojas Mota Velasco, Chairman and CEO of Grupo Rotoplas.\nConference Call\nGrupo Rotoplas is pleased to invite you to participate in its First Quarter 2018 Conference Call, to be held on Wednesday, April 25th, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Mexico City time (11:00 a.m. EST).\nManagement team will host the call and discuss results, followed by a Q&A session.\nCarlos Rojas Mota Velasco – Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nMario Romero Orozco – Chief Financial Officer\nOfelia López Aranda Trewartha – Investor Relations\nTo participate in the conference call please use the Conference ID 1503367 and dial or log in:\nMexico: 01 800 062 2954\nUnited States: 1 800 263 0877\nOther Countries: 1 (323) 794 2094\nWeb: http://www.rotoplas.com/inversionistas.html\nInvestor Relations Contact Information\nOfelia López Aranda\nTel: +52 (55) 52015000\nExt. 50163\nEmail: olopezaranda@rotoplas.com\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release may include certain relating to Grupo Rotoplas S.A.B. de C.V., it relies on considerations of the Grupo Rotoplas S.A.B. de C.V. management which are based on current and known information; however, the could vary due to facts, circumstances and events beyond the control of Grupo Rotoplas, S.A.B. de C.V.\nAbout the Company\nGrupo Rotoplas S.A.B. de C.V. is America's leading provider of individual and integrated water solutions for storing, carrying, and treating water.
