REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio/File Photo “We are being left in the dark. No one is explaining to us why this is good for Brazil,” said Herbert Claros da Silva, vice president of the metalworkers union of Sao Jose dos Campos, told a Senate hearing. “We ask President Temer not to sell Embraer.”\nGovernment officials and Embraer executives were invited but did not appear at the hearing called by Workers Party Senator Paulo Paim to discuss the talks between Boeing and Embraer for a potential partnership over which the government has veto power.\nFILE PHOTO: The Boeing logo is seen at their headquarters in Chicago, in this April 24, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo No other senators attended the hearing of the Senate’s human rights committee, although the Boeing-Embraer tie-up has drawn criticism from politicians that could complicate a deal as October general elections approach.\nEmbraer and Boeing declined to comment on the hearing. A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, which has led a government working group vetting the deal, said the hearing was about jobs and not a defense matter.\nThe Brazilian government, which privatized Embraer in recent decades but still holds a decisive golden share, has resisted the outright sale of Embraer to Boeing due to concerns over the loss of sovereign control over its defense programs.\nThe two companies are reportedly seeking government approval for a compromise agreement that would involve Boeing investing in a third, newly created company including Embraer’s commercial aircraft division but excluding its defense unit.\nBoeing’s proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world’s third-largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) and backed by European rival Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) last year.\nUnion leader Silva acknowledged at Monday’s hearing that a tie-up would initially be a boon for Embraer as Boeing would help market its shorter-range jets around the world.\nBut he said many of the 14,000 workers at Embraer’s plants in Sao Jose dos Campos, half of which are unionized, were worried about their jobs a decade down the road if they end up working for a U.S.-based company.\nReporting by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T02:09:08.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
