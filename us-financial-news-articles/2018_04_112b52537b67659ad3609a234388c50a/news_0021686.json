He said the best way forward would be for him to step down from his role pending the outcome of the investigation. \n“I personally will plan to lay down the presidency. Personally I think this is the right thing to do.” \nHe said he expected this also to be the decision of the Executive Board during their conference call. \nThe IBU said it was “fully cooperating with the investigation and the office remains operational during normal business hours.” \n“The IBU Executive Board is taking the matter extremely seriously and continues to be committed to operating under the highest standards of good governance and transparency,” it said. \nThe IBU was recently in the spotlight after it went ahead with the season-ending World Cup in Russia in March despite the country’s doping scandal and several nations, including the United States and Canada, refusing to send athletes.
