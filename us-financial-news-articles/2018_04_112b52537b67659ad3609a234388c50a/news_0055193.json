Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nIncludes Revenue Standard Impact\nThree Months Ended March 31\n(Millions) (Unaudited)\nOverview\nThe Company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (referred to in this release as \"GAAP\" or \"reported\" results). The Company also refers to and presents below certain additional non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of Regulation G under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These measures are: adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted operating margin, adjusted income, net of tax and adjusted earnings per share (EPS). The Company has included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP in the following tables. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that enables investors to better compare the Company’s performance across periods. Management also uses these measures internally to assess the operating performance of its businesses, to assess performance for employee compensation purposes and to decide how to allocate resources. However, investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information that the Company reports in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures include adjustments that reflect how management views our businesses, and may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Operating Margin Adjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by excluding the impact of certain noteworthy items from the Company's GAAP operating income or loss. The following tables identify these noteworthy items and reconcile adjusted operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income or loss, on a consolidated and segment basis, for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The following tables also present adjusted operating margin. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by consolidated or segment GAAP revenue.

Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nIncludes the Revenue Standard Impact\nThree Months Ended March 31\n(Millions) (Unaudited)\nAdjusted Income, Net of Tax and Adjusted Earnings per Share Adjusted income, net of tax is calculated as the Company's GAAP income from continuing operations, adjusted to reflect the after-tax impact of the operating income adjustments set forth in the preceding tables and investments gains or losses related to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments on certain equity securities previously recorded to equity. Adjusted EPS is calculated by dividing the Company’s adjusted income, net of tax, by MMC's average number of shares outstanding-diluted for the relevant period.
