The statement said Facebook would have to meet the requests within seven days of the letter that was sent on Thursday. Facebook did not immediately provide comment on Friday. Earlier this week, Facebook said in a statement that it was “committed to improving the way we protect people’s information, and to providing a safe and secure experience for the more than 115 million Indonesians on Facebook”. It said it was “working hard to tackle past abuse, prevent future abuse and give people more prominent privacy controls” and was “committed to providing regular updates to Indonesians, their representatives, the authorities and the media.” The company is also facing investigations in other countries, such as the Philippines, the United States and Australia, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal.
