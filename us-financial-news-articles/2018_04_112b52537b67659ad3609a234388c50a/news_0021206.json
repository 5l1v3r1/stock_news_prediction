REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo Deutsche Post had offered a wage increase of 3 percent from Oct. 1 for around 130,000 employees, followed by a 2.1 percent increase a year later.\nThe offer also includes a one-time payment of 250 euros ($309) this month and the option for employees to take more time off or get more money.\nUnion Verdi had said in February that the offer was below its expectations and asked its members to vote on it.\n“We are pleased by the clear vote by Verdi’s members. But at the same time the outcome shows that not everyone is satisfied with it, and we respect that,” the union said on Tuesday.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Christoph Steitz\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T18:08:20.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
