In February, it said it had commitments from member banks to buy back 71.7 percent of their shares.\nAt the time, a source said more than 10 foreign stock exchanges had shown interest in buying a controlling stake in the TASE.\n$1 = 3.5283 shekels Reporting by Steven Scheer Editing by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-17T12:22:39.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
