Soccer Football - Serie A - AC Milan vs Napoli - San Siro, Milan, Italy - April 15, 2018 AC Milan's Gianluigi Donnarumma saves a shot from Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo \nNapoli substitute Arkadiusz Milik seemed certain to score when Lorenzo Insigne’s header found him alone in front of goal but Donnarumma managed to turn his low shot around the foot of the post. \nThe result gave leaders Juventus a chance to go six points clear of Napoli at the top in their later game at home to Sampdoria. \nJuve, chasing a seventh successive title, have 81 points with Napoli on 78 followed by Lazio and AS Roma, who were meeting in their derby in the late kickoff, on 60. Soccer Football - Serie A - AC Milan vs Napoli - San Siro, Milan, Italy - April 15, 2018 Napoli's Christian Maggio and Jorginho in action with AC Milan's Giacomo Bonaventura REUTERS/Alessandro Garofalo \nNapoli produced their usual slick passing and pinned Milan in their own half for long periods but lacked imagination and variety in the final third, a feature of their play in the last six weeks. \nSixth-placed Milan had a goal by Mateo Musacchio ruled out for offside in the first half. Slideshow (5 Images) \nBenevento forward Cheick Diabate notched his third successive brace in a 2-2 draw at Sassuolo. \nDiabate, on loan from Turkish side Osmanlispor, put Benevento ahead with a delicate chip in the 22nd minute. \nMatteo Politano scored twice to put Sassuolo in front before Diabate turned in Danilo Cataldi’s cross to give Benevento their first away point of the season, although they stayed 11 points adrift at the bottom. \nFiorentina’s run of six successive wins ended in a 0-0 draw at home to SPAL who are 17th with 28 points, just above the drop zone. \nBologna’s Adam Nagy, 22, scored his first-ever professional goal in a 2-0 win over one-from-bottom Verona.
