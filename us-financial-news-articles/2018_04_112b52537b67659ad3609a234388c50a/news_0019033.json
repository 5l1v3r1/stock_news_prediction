Most recently, Mr. Mazarakis served as a Managing Director at Goldman Sachs in London where he was head of the Fundamental Strategies Group, a department of research analysts within the securities division's multi-billion dollar equity and credit businesses. Earlier in his career at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mazarakis served as an Executive Director and led the retail/consumer sector team. Prior to his tenure at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Mazarakis spent two years at Citigroup in New York where he analyzed high yield and distressed industrial companies within the credit research department. Mr. Mazarakis received a Bachelor of Science in environmental engineering from Northwestern University and a MBA from the University of Michigan.\n“Tom is a seasoned financial professional who brings years of relevant experience and a strong track record to Salveo,” said Michael C. Gruber, a Managing Partner of Salveo Capital. “We expect Tom’s fundamentals-driven research process and analytical background to add a significant level of rigor and diligence to the cannabis fund landscape. We are very much looking forward to Tom’s contributions to our portfolio companies, fund investors and the firm as a whole.”\n“We are thrilled to welcome Tom as we seek to build premier companies to help reshape the image of legalized cannabis,” added Jeffrey Howard, a Managing Partner of Salveo Capital. “As the legalized cannabis space continues to evolve, it is critical that we have the right people in place to help us capitalize on strategic investment opportunities. As an avid early-stage investor and advisor to high-growth companies who is knowledgeable and passionate about the industry, Tom is the ideal fit to support our mission and goals.”\nCommenting on his appointment, Mr. Mazarakis stated, “I am excited to have the opportunity to join a well-regarded firm that is investing in and partnering with innovative companies and entrepreneurs within a unique and high-growth sector. Michael and Jeff have worked diligently in a short time frame to assemble a high-quality portfolio of companies that is performing very well and has significant upside potential. I look forward to working with the team and building on this momentum.”\nSalveo Capital's primary investment focus is on high-growth, ancillary service providers to the cannabis industry - rather than more highly-regulated businesses that “touch the plant”. The firm is currently investing capital out of its first private equity fund (“Fund I”) and is targeting a $25 million close in mid-2018. Salveo is seeking to rapidly scale its platform with a goal of reaching $100 million of committed capital by 2019. Thus far, Salveo Capital has completed seven investments including Baker, Front Range Biosciences, Headset, Purissima, Hiku (formerly Tokyo Smoke), Treez and Wurk. Legalized cannabis is a $9 billion market in North America and, according to industry research, is expected to reach an estimated $22 billion by 2020. From an international perspective, various countries around the world including Australia, Germany and Spain are legalizing marijuana, while others including Canada, Israel and The Netherlands are permitting exportation.\nAbout Salveo Capital\nLaunched at the end of 2016, Salveo Capital is an alternative investment firm specializing in the legalized cannabis space, particularly ancillary businesses. Salveo Capital's approach is to bring an institutional quality discipline to company vetting, investment structures and portfolio management.
