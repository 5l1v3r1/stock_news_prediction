If you do that every time around here, you’re going to be pretty good.” \nMcIlroy was more than pretty good in 2011 when he led after each of the first three rounds and carried a four-stroke lead into the final round. \nA wild left tee shot led to a triple-bogey seven at the 10th that sent him into a spiral. He ended up posting a final-round 80 as Charl Schwartzel of South Africa claimed victory. \nAsked about the difference in approach in the 2018 version of McIlroy, the Northern Irishman said: “Stay patient. Keep your putts on the high side of the hole. Hope for the best.” \nMcIlroy said he learned to embrace patience through experience. “Just with the amount of times that I’ve been in contention or around the lead. Whether it be a regular PGA Tour event or a major or whatever it is, every experience that you have in that arena in those situations, you learn a little bit from. \n“I don’t have to go out there and make a birdie on every hole, especially not on this golf course and in these conditions, pars are OK. Sometimes pars might be a little bit boring and you might feel as if you want to get a little bit more out of your round, but as you look up the leaderboard, you’re still there around the lead. \nMcIlroy said he had the wrong idea when he started out. \n“I thought all these guys birdied every hole and you just had to hit unbelievable shot after unbelievable shot. It’s not quite like that,” he said. \n“You know, golf is a game of making your misses not that bad and taking advantage of your good shots. So far this week, I’ve been able to do that.” \nTwo more rounds of that sort of patience might just land McIlroy in the grand slam club with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods.
