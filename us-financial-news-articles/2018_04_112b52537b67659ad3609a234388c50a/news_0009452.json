(NASDAQ: IPXL), a specialty pharmaceutical company, today announced it has launched a generic version of Estrace ® Cream (estradiol vaginal cream, USP, 0.01%). Impax's manufacturing and development partner, Perrigo Company plc (NYSE; TASE: PRGO), received final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in late January.\nEstrace ® Cream had annual U.S. sales of approximately $469 million according to IQVIA ® for the12 months ending January 2018.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nWARNING: ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER and PROBABLE DEMENTIA\nEstrogen-Alone Therapy\nEndometrial Cancer\nThere is an increased risk of endometrial cancer in a woman with a uterus who uses unopposed estrogens. Adding a progestin to estrogen therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of endometrial hyperplasia, which may be a precursor to endometrial cancer. Adequate diagnostic measures, including directed or random endometrial sampling when indicated, should be undertaken to rule out malignancy in postmenopausal women with undiagnosed persistent or recurring abnormal genital bleeding [see WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasms, Endometrial Cancer ].\nCardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia\nEstrogen-alone therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders, and Probable Dementia ].\nThe Women's Health Initiative (WHI) estrogen-alone substudy reported increased risks of stroke and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 7.1 years of treatment with daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) [0.625 mg]-alone, relative to placebo [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders ].\nThe WHI Memory Study (WHIMS) estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 5.2 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) -alone, relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ].\nIn the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and other dosage forms of estrogens.\nEstrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.\nEstrogen Plus Progestin Therapy\nCardiovascular Disorders and Probable Dementia\nEstrogen plus progestin therapy should not be used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or dementia [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders, and Probable Dementia ].\nThe WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy reported increased risks of DVT, pulmonary embolism (PE), stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) in postmenopausal women (50 to 79 years of age) during 5.6 years of treatment with daily oral CE (0.625 mg) combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) [2.5 mg], relative to placebo [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Disorders ].\nThe WHIMS estrogen plus progestin ancillary study of the WHI reported an increased risk of developing probable dementia in postmenopausal women 65 years of age or older during 4 years of treatment with daily CE (0.625 mg) combined with MPA (2.5 mg), relative to placebo. It is unknown whether this finding applies to younger postmenopausal women [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Probable Dementia and PRECAUTIONS, Geriatric Use ].\nBreast Cancer\nThe WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy also demonstrated an increased risk of invasive breast cancer [see CLINICAL STUDIES and WARNINGS, Malignant Neoplasms, Breast Cancer ].\nIn the absence of comparable data, these risks should be assumed to be similar for other doses of CE and MPA, and other combinations and dosage forms of estrogens and progestins.\nEstrogens with or without progestins should be prescribed at the lowest effective doses and for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for the individual woman.\nFor complete safety information and other important information about this product please see the Full Prescribing Information .\nYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.
