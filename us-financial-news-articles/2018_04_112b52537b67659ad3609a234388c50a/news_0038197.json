They risk making many cherelles and flowers fall,” he said.\nSo far, the signs for the mid-crop have been positive.\nData collected by Reuters showed there was 11.8 millimetres of rain in Soubre last week, 8 mm below average. Soil moisture content was at 292.9 mm in March, above the average of 238.7 mm.\nIn the western region of Duekoue, farmers were upbeat.\n“Here the mid-crop will be long. There is a mix of small pods and big pods on the trees,” said Amara Kone, who farms in the outskirts of Duekoue.\n“The soil is moist and trees have already yielded a lot compared to the same period last year,” he said.\nData showed there was 6.2 mm of rain in Man, which includes Duekoue, last week, 15.7 mm below average. Soil moisture was at 270.1 mm in March, above the average of 248.6 mm.\nIn the centre-western region of Daloa, farmers said more rain was needed this month to increase the size of beans.\nDaloa received 10.9 mm of rain last week, 11.2 mm below average.
