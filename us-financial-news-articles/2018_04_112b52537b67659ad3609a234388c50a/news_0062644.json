Soccer Football - Serie A - Fiorentina vs Napoli - Stadio Artemio Franchi, Florence, Italy - April 29, 2018 Fiorentina's Giovanni Simeone celebrates his hat-trick after the match REUTERS/Alberto Lingria\nThe defeat left Napoli four points behind leaders Juventus with three matches to play, only a week after re-igniting the title race with a last-minute win away to the Turin side.\nJuventus beat Inter Milan 3-2 on Saturday after scoring twice in the last five minutes against opponents who played for over an hour with 10 men.\nThe game hinged on the first attack when Simeone broke clear of Koulibaly — scorer of the winner at Juventus last week — and was felled as he was about to shoot.\nThe referee at first gave a penalty to Fiorentina and booked Koulibaly but changed both decisions after a VAR review.\nAfter seeing that the incident had taken place outside the area and that Koulibaly had denied Simeone a clear scoring chance, he changed the penalty to a free kick and the yellow card to a red.\nNapoli never settled after that and fell behind to another long ball forward to Simeone who broke clear and slotted the ball past Pepe Reina in the 38th minute.\nDominant Fiorentina extended their lead in the 62nd minute when Simeone scored from close range after the ball pinged around the Napoli area following a corner.\nThe son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego capped his performance — and Napoli’s misery — when he was sent clear by again and slotted past Reina in the 90th minute.\nJuventus lead on 88 points with Napoli on 84 followed by AS Roma on 70, Lazio on 67 and Inter Milan on 66.
