REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch \nMacron is urging closer euro zone integration and wants the currency bloc to have a finance minister and budget while its rescue fund should be turned into a mechanism that can help member states pre-empt threats of financial instability. \nMerkel’s conservatives are due to discuss such reforms on Tuesday before Merkel meets Macron later this week. \nA draft resolution for German lawmakers drawn up by top conservatives rejects plans floated by the executive European Commission to make use of a specific EU legal provision to beef up the currency zone’s bailout system by creating a European Monetary Fund (EMF). \nScholz represents Merkel’s centre-left partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), who were given the finance portfolio in a coalition government that took office last month. \nThe SPD is less reluctant than Merkel’s conservatives to seek closer European integration. In particular, the conservatives are allergic to the idea of pooling risks and debts with other euro zone countries. \nIn March Macron and Merkel pledged to overcome differences to formulate a roadmap for euro zone reform in time for it to be approved by their European peers in June. \nSpeaking at an event in Berlin hosted by the BdB banking association, Scholz said the most important task now was to strengthen Europe and take further steps to help the bloc grow closer together. \n“In my view Europe is the most important national issue for Germany,” he said. Of Macron’s reform proposals, he said: “It’s good that he does that with a certain amount of courage.” \nAt the weekend Scholz said Macron’s reform proposals should be addressed before European elections next year, but added that not all of the suggestions were feasible. \nEuro zone states are discussing deeper integration of their economies, focusing on creating a banking union and turning the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund, with more powers to help troubled countries. \nScholz said the euro zone should speed up steps towards the banking union: “We don’t have a lot of time for that.” \nHe stressed that it was important to complete the banking union in such a way that it adhered to stability requirements. \nScholz also said he would stick to the previous government’s policy of ensuring a balanced budget, saying his ministry would come up with budgets that do not include any new debt.
