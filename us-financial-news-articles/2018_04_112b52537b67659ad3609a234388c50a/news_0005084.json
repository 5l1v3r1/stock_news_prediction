According to the White House’s calculations, that investment would unleash $1.5 trillion in infrastructure spending over the next decade. \nGribbin is the latest departure in a wave of exits — some forced and others voluntary — that have the White House on edge. \nTrump conceded last week that his plan would probably “have to wait until after the election.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-04T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-04T04:18:43.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
