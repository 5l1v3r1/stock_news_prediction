REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \nThe German carmaker said on Tuesday it was considering a change in leadership as part of a broader management overhaul, but gave no further details. The 64-year-old Mueller’s contract is due to run until 2020. \nHis departure will test the ability of Volkswagen’s stakeholders, which include the Porsche and Piech families, the German state of Lower Saxony, and the company’s powerful labor representatives, to unite behind a new boss. \nMueller, a company veteran, was installed at short notice in 2015, a week after the company admitted to cheating U.S. diesel emission tests, prompting criticism from some investors who said that only an outsider could rebuild trust in the business. \nHe launched an ambitious reform plan, including investing billions of euros in electric vehicles, but has struggled to push through reforms aimed at creating a more efficient and focused company. Amid opposition from labor leaders, Mueller failed to sell motorbike maker Ducati last year.

Previous executives including Bernd Pischetsrieder and Wolfgang Bernhard struggled to push through such reforms. \nGerman newspaper Handelsblatt first reported that Diess would replace Mueller. Other potential CEO candidates include Volkswagen’s trucks chief and Daimler veteran Andreas Renschler.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nShares in Volkswagen, which also owns the Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Skoda, Audi ( NSUG.DE ) and Porsche brands, jumped on the news, and were up 4.3 percent at 171.24 euros at 1520 GMT. \n“Volkswagen is considering a further development of the management structure of the group which would also be associated with personnel changes in the board of management,” the company said in a short statement. \nTwo people close to the carmaker said its supervisory board was due to meet on Friday, and would also discuss a possible stock market listing for the company’s truck and bus division - another move aimed at creating a more focused business. ‘BETTER ALTERNATIVE’ \nMueller’s likely departure comes two days after Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), another pillar of corporate Germany, dismissed its chief executive, John Cryan, in pursuit of a more rapid turnaround following years of losses. \n“If Diess is confirmed as the successor, VW shares will extend their gains,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said, who has an “outperform” rating on the stock. \n“We see no better alternative to Matthias Mueller to make the company fit for the future.” \nDespite facing billions in fines, vehicle refits and lawsuits relating to its “dieselgate” scandal, Volkswagen’s operating results have been robust, with sales and profit hitting record highs last year. \nBut the persistent tug of war between its controlling families, unions and other stakeholders have made it difficult to drive through structural changes that investors have said are key to the company fulfilling its potential. \nVolkswagen said on Tuesday that Mueller had expressed his general willingness to participate in a management overhaul, and it was still to be determined whether efforts to develop a new leadership structure would leave him in place. \nChairman Hans Dieter Poetsch is currently in talks about changing the structure with fellow supervisory board members and members of the management board, Volkswagen said. \nThe debate about Volkswagen’s future structure comes a month after its largest shareholder, Porsche Automobil Holding ( PSHG_p.DE ), picked three new representatives of the Porsche and Piech families to help oversee Volkswagen. \nTwo months ago, sources close to Volkswagen management told Reuters that Mueller was growing frustrated with a lack of support for his reform efforts and by the company’s inability to draw a line under its emissions scandal. \nVolkswagen declined to comment on whether the board was poised to name Diess as new CEO. The works council, whose members occupy half the seats on the supervisory board, also declined comment.
