He said the dividend would stay high but be more sustainable.\n“We have seen the telecoms industry, we have seen UK builders and so many industries where people overpay (dividends) and then suddenly can’t ... and the stock falls into oblivion,” he said, adding part of shareholder remuneration could “ideally” include share buybacks.\nMoneta has a 100 percent free float and no dominant shareholder. Petrus Advisers holds 2.3 percent, Umek said.\nMoneta, the sixth largest Czech bank which debuted on the Prague bourse in 2016, has been paying shareholders an increased dividend to bring down excess capital - most recently proposing a payout of 104 percent of 2017 earnings. It is also monitoring for potential acquisitions.\nPetrus Advisers said in the April 24 letter the bank should be allowed to issue up to 25 percent of common shares over a three-year horizon to finance acquisitions.\nMoneta held its annual general meeting on April 25. The bank said in a statement releasing the shareholder letter that management would discuss Petrus Advisers’ proposals and respond within 30 days.
