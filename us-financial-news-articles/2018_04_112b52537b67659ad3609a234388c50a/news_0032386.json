(For an analysis, click on)\nCompleting the triple whammy of problems besieging Rusal, holders of the company’s debts are also growing restive.\nRusal’s dollar bonds slumped after the sanctions were imposed, and the company warned it could be in technical default because banks, trading platforms and clearing agents refuse to handle transactions linked to the issuer.\nRussian state-run lender Sberbank holds $4 billion in Rusal debt. The bank’s CEO, German Gref, said he had no immediate option to get rid of the Rusal debt on Sberbank’s books because there was no one to whom he could offload it.\nRusal accounted for 5.8 percent of world aluminum production last year, with output of 3.7 million tonnes. Europe accounted for 42 percent of its sales; Asia 17 percent and America 16 percent.\nWriting by Polina Devitt and Christian Lowe; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-17T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T01:40:15.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
