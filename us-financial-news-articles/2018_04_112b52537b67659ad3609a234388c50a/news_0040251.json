He will be instrumental in driving the firm’s continued international growth strategy, which centres on expanding the reach of its award-winning client lifecycle management solutions on a global scale.\nNiklas joins WDX as it celebrates an outstanding year of international success. Having launched its US operation early in 2017, WDX has forged an enviable name within the global wealth and investment management community. The firm has received a string of industry accolades for its pioneering WDX ONE functionality, with six awards secured in Switzerland alone*.\nNiklas comments, “I am thrilled to join the very strong team at WDX, and drive the global expansion strategy. By establishing a Swiss presence and legal entity in Zurich, which will be coupled with an office in Geneva later in the year and the launch of our New York office at 300 Park Avenue, we will be able to more effectively capitalize on the vast interest and pipeline we have in these two key markets.”\nHe adds “Scaling our efforts is the key focus and we will soon be announcing formal partnerships in both markets, through leveraging our relationship with Microsoft and their wider network combined with key industry players and thought leaders.”\nMost recently, Schroders Wealth, Cazenove Capital and a major Zurich based Capital Manager have deployed WDX ONE as the backbone of their digital strategy across Switzerland; as well as the UK, the Channel Islands and Asia. WDX’s new premises in Zurich will provide an opportune base from which to work with new and existing clients and to embrace the continued opportunities within the region.\nGary Linieres, CEO of WDX comments , “I am delighted to welcome Niklas to WDX. In the six years since our inception, we have made waves for our pioneering software and our consistent client focus. Niklas’s appointment underscores our commitment to furthering the breadth of WDX in our existing regions of operation and those which both we, and our clients, see as opportune markets for the future. We look forward to building on our success in Switzerland from our new base in Zurich, and enlisting Niklas’s outstanding international experience to further our growth ambitions.”\nWDX ONE has been consistently refined to empower wealth and investment managers to stay ahead of clients’ complex multi-jurisdictional needs at every stage; from prospecting, to onboarding and day-to-day client management. Flexible to the core, the platform adapts to firms’ existing technological capabilities to ensure a seamless and consistent client experience at every stage of the client lifecycle.\n*Awards\nWDX has received several industry titles in recognition of its success on an international scale.
