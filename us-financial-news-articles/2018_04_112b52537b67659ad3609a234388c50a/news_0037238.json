In fact it’s a bit cheaper than our previous incumbent. Why wouldn’t we want to do that?” \nSEUK’s chairman, Victor Adebowale, said several other businesses had expressed interest in joining the campaign. \n“What you’ve got to do is talk to the unconverted,” he told participants at an event in parliament. \n“If your story is good, why not tell it to someone that hasn’t heard it yet? That’s how we get to a billion.” \n($1 = 0.7029 pounds) Reporting by Lee Mannion @leemannion; editing by Claire Cozens and Katy Migiro.
