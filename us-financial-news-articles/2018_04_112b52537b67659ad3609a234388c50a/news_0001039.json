But while European stock markets continued to fall, led by technology shares, Wall Street rose.\nSpot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,334.59 an ounce after rising 1.3 percent on Monday. U.S. gold futures were 0.6 percent lower at $1,338.60 an ounce.\n\"It's a correction after yesterday's strong move,\" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch. \"There's a lack of conviction that prices will rise much further or can sustain levels of $1,350.
