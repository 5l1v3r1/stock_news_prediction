The next time we’ll start focusing on Brexit may be well into the third quarter so ahead of that we’re really left with economic data to focus on,” he said.\nBut some analysts say uncertainties over Brexit remain and that broad dollar weakness is keeping sterling above $1.40.\nAgainst the euro, the pound strengthened 0.2 percent on Monday to 87.04 pence\nTraders last week largely shrugged off tepid survey data and searched instead for more meaningful signs of economic weakness that could deter the BoE from its path of monetary tightening.
