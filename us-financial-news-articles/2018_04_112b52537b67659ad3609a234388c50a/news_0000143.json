These girls are so good.” \nThailand’s Ariya Jutanugarn also finished one shot out of the playoff. \nShe closed with birdies on the 16th and 17th holes but could not make birdie on the finishing par-5 18th. \nThe ANA Inspiration will end in a dramatic playoff for the second consecutive year, though last year’s version was marred by Lexi Thompson losing after a rules violation was called in by a spectator. \nThompson will not be a part of this year’s finish, though her presence was strongly felt as she received strong support from the California crowds. \n“Last year was definitely a learning curve. I learned overall how strong I was,” Thompson said.
