Equally important, we secured funding to advance these projects through a directed share issue of approximately 155 MSEK before transaction related expenses. The issue generated strong interest from Swedish and international investors, such as Gladiator and Nyenburgh Investment Partners, as well as current large shareholders.\nI took on the role as CEO of Medivir a little more than a year ago, and in these 12 months, we have continued the transformation of the company in order to create a cancer focused drug research and development company with a strong pipeline.\nWith the attention on MIV-818 for liver cancers in the first quarter, I would like to highlight this project as a fantastic example of Medivir's successful transformation into an oncology company. MIV-818 leverages both our experience in liver disease and with nucleotide science, built during our years in hepatitis C drug development, to bring a potential new treatment to liver cancer patients.\nWe chose MIV-818 as a candidate drug in November 2016, and just over one year later, we have completed the preclinical development that is necessary to allow us to advance into clinical studies, which we plan to initiate later this year. The move of MIV-818 into clinical development demonstrates our ability to use our 30 years of scientific experience to develop new drugs against cancer.\nWe are pleased with the attention from the scientist and physician community with acceptances of our presentations on MIV-818 at multiple conferences so far this year, including the HCC Summit, organized by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.\nWith the completed share issue earlier in the quarter, we are in a position not only to start and complete our planned phase I study for MIV-818, but also to advance our entire portfolio. We will continuously keep you informed of the progress of all these exciting projects. We are also planning a Capital Markets Day later this year with a full update on our development programs.\nWe are well-positioned to continue our journey towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company that brings transformative drugs to cancer patients. And now we can do it from an even stronger financial position.\nChristine Lind\nPresident and CEO\nThe information in this report comprises the information that Medivir AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
