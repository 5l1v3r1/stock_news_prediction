In recent years, however, campaigners for lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender rights have become increasingly vocal.\nThe ban coincides with a landmark case brought by gay rights campaigners to repeal Kenya’s law on gay sex on the grounds that it deprives sexual minorities of basic rights.\nThe film is adapted from an award-winning short story “Jambula Tree” by Ugandan writer Monica Arac de Nyeko.\nThe film commission used a hashtag, #KFCBbansLesbianFilm, that immediately sparked a barrage of supportive tweets from Kenyans who decried homosexuality.
