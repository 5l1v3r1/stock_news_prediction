(TSX / NYSE American: TMQ) (\"Trilogy\", \"Trilogy Metals\" or \"the Company\") is pleased to report its first quarter results for the period ended February 28, 2018. Details of the Company's financial results are contained in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and Management's Discussion and Analysis which will be available on the Company's website at www.trilogymetals.com , on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov . All amounts are in United States dollars unless otherwise stated.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nStrong working capital position of $12.6 million, with cash on hand of $12.1 million.\nAnnounced final drill results for the 2017 Bornite Project drill program and the results of a metallurgical test work program demonstrating that a high quality, 30% copper concentrate containing no deleterious metals can be produced from the currently defined in-pit resources at the Bornite Project.\nAnnounced $10 million program and budget for the Bornite Project in 2018 which has been fully funded by South32 Limited (\"South32\").\nAnnounced additional in-fill drill results for the 2017 Arctic Project drill program and the results of the Arctic Project Pre-Feasibility Study (\"Arctic PFS\") showing strong economics.\nAnnounced a wholly-owned subsidiary of South32 had become a new large shareholder of the Company and concurrently, Trilogy had given South32 participation rights in future financings to participate to a minimum of 20% to a maximum of 40% in future financings, private or public, to a maximum ownership of 19.9% in the Company. The right expires if South32 does not participate for the lesser of 20%, or that number of shares that would not put them past a 19.9% ownership interest in the Company, in any particular financing.\nArctic Project\nIn a press release dated February 20, 2018 we announced the results of the Arctic PFS for our Arctic Copper-Zinc-Lead-Silver-Gold Project located in the Ambler mining district of Northwestern Alaska. These results converted indicated mineral resources at the Arctic Project to probable mineral reserves.\nHighlights of the Arctic PFS are as follows:\nPre-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") 8% of $1,935.2 million calculated at the beginning of the three-year construction period and an Internal Rate of Return (\"IRR\") of 38.0% for the base case.\nAfter-tax NPV 8% of $1,412.7 million and after-tax IRR of 33.4% for the base case.\nInitial capital expenditure of $779.6 million and sustaining capital of $65.9 million for total estimated capital expenditures of $845.5 million over the estimated 12-year mine life. In addition, closure and reclamation costs are estimated at $65.3 million.\nEstimated pre-tax and after-tax payback of initial capital within 2 years for the base case at $3.00/lb copper. At $2.00/lb copper, pre-tax and after-tax payback of initial capital is 3 years.\nMinimum 12-year mine life supporting a maximum 10,000 tonne-per-day conventional grinding mill-and-flotation circuit to produce copper, zinc and lead concentrates containing significant gold and silver by-products.\nLife of mine strip ratio of 6.9 to 1.\nAverage annual payable production projected to be more than 159 million pounds of copper, 199 million pounds of zinc, 33 million pounds of lead, 30,600 ounces of gold and 3.3 million ounces of silver for life of mine.\nA capital intensity ratio on initial capital of approximately $6,200 per tonne of average annual copper equivalent produced.\nEstimated cash costs of $0.15/lb of payable copper (C1 cash costs include on-site mining and processing costs, road tolls and maintenance, transport, royalties, and is net of by-product credits).\nTotal \"all-in\" cash costs (initial/sustaining capital, operating, transportation, treatment and refining charges, road toll, and by-product metal credits) estimated at $0.63/lb of payable copper.\nManagement believes economic indicators justify moving forward with permitting and a feasibility study.\nBornite Project\nIn a press release dated December 4, 2017, the Company announced the final set of drill results at the Bornite Project from the 2017 exploration drill program and in a press release dated January 10, 2018 the Company announced the results of a metallurgical test work program demonstrating that a high quality, 30% copper concentrate containing no deleterious metals can be produced at the currently defined in-pit resource at the Bornite Project.\nIn a press release December 14, 2017, the Company announced that South32 Limited had committed to fund the second tranche of $10 million under an Option Agreement on the Company's Alaskan assets entered into on April 10, 2017 (\"Option Agreement\"). The funds were fully received during the quarter and maintain the Option Agreement in good standing.\nSelected Results\nThe following selected financial information is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nin thousands of dollars,\nexcept for per share amounts\nThree months ended\nSelected expenses\nFebruary 28,\n2018\n$\nFebruary 28,\n2017\n$\nGeneral and administrative\n345\n370\nMineral properties expense\n1,131\n639\nProfessional fees\n159\n125\nSalaries\n229\n239\nSalaries – stock-based compensation\n922\n395\nUnrealized (gain)/loss on held for trading investments\n(639)\n1,239\nLoss/(gain) on sale of investments\n774\n(3)\nLoss and comprehensive loss for the period\n2,946\n2,996\nBasic and diluted loss per common share\n$0.03\n$0.03\nFor the three months ended February 28, 2018, Trilogy reported a net loss of $2.9 million (or $0.03 basic and diluted loss per common share) which was comparable to a net loss of $3.0 million for the corresponding period in 2017 (or $0.03 basic and diluted loss per common share). However, there were notable variances in the following expenses.\nBoth realized and unrealized loss (gain) on held for trading investments had significant movements period-to-period. The investments consist of common shares and warrants in GoldMining Inc. (\"GMI\") acquired as consideration for the sale of Sunward Investments Limited (\"Sunward\") and its Titiribi gold-copper exploration project in Colombia. During the period ended February 28, 2018, the Company sold 1,360,000 (2017 – 410,000) common shares of GMI for proceeds of $1.4 million (2017 – $0.6 million) and realized a loss on sale of $0.8 million (2017 - $Nil). During the period, the Company recorded an unrealized gain on the common shares of GMI of $0.6 million (2017 - loss of $1.2 million).\nAdjusting for the realized and unrealized loss (gain) on held for trading investments, total expenses increased to $2.8 million for Q1 2018 compared to $1.8 million in Q1 2017. The increase is due to an increase in mineral properties expenses and stock-based compensation.\nWe incurred $1.1 million in mineral properties expense in Q1 2018 compared to $0.6 million in Q1 2017. The increase in mineral property expenses in 2018 was a result of the engineering, environmental and other consulting costs incurred in preparation of the Arctic PFS.\nThe increase in stock-based compensation is due to a higher share price contributing to an overall greater fair value for option grants and an increase in units granted in the period compared to the prior period.\nOutlook\nThe 2018 program and budget at the Bornite Project of $10 million was approved by a Technical Committee jointly represented by Trilogy and South32 and will include in-fill and off-set drilling to better define and expand the high grade copper resources at the Bornite Project. We are currently planning for the field season which we anticipate to start in May 2018.\nFor the Arctic Project, we will continue the ore sorting program that has been initiated in FY2017. With the release of the Arctic PFS results during the quarter and the filing of the National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report subsequent to quarter end, the Company will start looking into next steps for the Arctic Project which will be getting prepared for feasibility and permitting.\nWe will be continuing to work closely with The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (\"AIDEA\") (the proponent for the Ambler Mining District Industrial Access Project (\"AMDIAP\")) to advance the permitting process on the AMDIAP throughout 2018. The Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\"), as the lead federal agency for the Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\"), will be moving the project through the EIS process. BLM has reached the end of the scoping process and according to the notice of intent, will be delivering a draft EIS by March 29, 2019 with the final EIS due December 30, 2019. A record of decision is due within one month of the final EIS. BLM will be developing preliminary alternatives based on the project purpose and need over the next few months, taking into account the input received from the public and agency comments during the scoping phase that was recently completed on January 31, 2018.\nQualified Persons\nAndrew W.
