PICC is the parent of PICC Property and Casualty Co Ltd. \nPICC will become the fifth Chinese insurer to be listed in both Hong Kong and a domestic stock exchange, joining the ranks of China Life Insurance Co, Ping An Insurance Group of China, China Pacific Insurance Group and New China Life Insurance Co. The five companies are the largest insurers in the country. \nPICC has been planning a domestic listing for a number of years, according to people familiar with the group’s strategy. However, changes in China’s listing rules and temporary suspensions of IPOs after turbulence in China’s stock market had delayed the plan. \nShares of the insurer surged 6.5 percent in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, amid a firm broader market that was up 1.1 percent. \nThe deal will be underwritten by China International Capital Corp Ltd, Essence Securities, CITIC Securities Co Ltd and Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities, according to the prospectus posted by China’s securities regulator.
