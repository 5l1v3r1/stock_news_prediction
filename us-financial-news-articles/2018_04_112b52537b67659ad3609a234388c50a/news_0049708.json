Punishments include jail terms of up to three years.\nThe latest proposed legislation is aimed at protecting the reputation of martyrs - those who have given their lives for China or the Communist Party - and who are already publicly lauded in the country.\nThe official Xinhua news agency said that the second draft of the law mandates punishment for “people who profane the deeds and spirit of the heroes and martyrs and those who glorify wars or acts of invasion”.\nIt did not say what punishment they might receive.\nThe news agency said the wording was added following recent incidents where Chinese people had dressed in Japanese World War Two army uniforms and spread the pictures online “to glorify the war of invasion”, igniting widespread outrage in China.\n“The legislation aims to promote patriotism and socialist core values,” Xinhua said.\nParty history is a sensitive subject because so much of the party’s legitimacy rests on its position as claiming great historical achievements, such as leading China to victory over Japan during World War Two.\nChina and Japan have sparred frequently about their painful history, with Beijing often accusing Tokyo of not properly atoning for Japan’s invasion of China before and during the war.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T14:22:07.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
