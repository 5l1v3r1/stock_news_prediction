WARY OPTIMISM\nThe noodles were an unusually hit at a summit that many South Koreans are viewing with wary optimism.\nMany South Koreans hoped the first visit to the South by a leader from the North, would be a turning point for peace on the war-divided peninsula.\nSome people watching a large television screen beaming images of the leaders to a crowd in front of Seoul’s city hall cheered and jumped with joy when Kim - whose nuclear and missile tests last year stoked fear of war - crossed the border to shake hands with Moon.\n“I’m filled with emotion,” said Park Ha-seok, 60, as he watched the pictures being broadcast from the border village of Panmunjom. “I don’t expect a big change but this is a start.”\nThe two sides are technically still at war because the 1950-53 Korean war ended in a truce, not a full peace treaty.\nLee Ji-eun, a 32-year-old doctor and mother of a baby girl, said the pictures had made her unpack an emergency bag she had placed by her front door about six months ago in case of war.\n“The bag has my daughter’s diapers, a portable radio and a gas burner,” Lee said. “Now I find it funny that I told my babysitter to take this bag and my daughter to flee to the basement if there’s war.”\nFisherman Park Tae-won, who lives on a South Korean island just 1.5 km from the maritime boundary with the North, said he hoped the summit would lead to a relaxation of restrictions on going out to sea.\n“Please, we want to go fishing out there as much as we want, without the curfew on fishing only once a day,” he said.\nChoi Gwang-chun, who runs a restaurant in the South Korean town of Daejeon, is offering a special “unification liquor” cocktail made of Taedong beer, named after a North Korean river, and South Korean Halla soju, a distilled rice spirit named after a South Korean mountain.\n“Those who order ‘unification liquor’ will also get a ‘unification pizza’ topped with nuts in the shape of the Korean peninsula for free,” said Choi, whose father came from North Korea.\n“I plan to run this offer until the day South and North Korea unify,” he said. “I hope I don’t have to run it too long.” Additional reporting by Jane Chung, Joori Roh, Heekyong Yang and Ju-min Park; Editing by Malcolm Foster, Robert Birsel", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T12:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T14:14:55.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
