The Navy’s 2019 budget request seeks additional ships.\nThe two largest U.S. shipbuilders are General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.\nJennifer Boykin, president of Huntington’s Newport News Shipbuilding yard in Virginia, told reporters earlier this week that her company was hiring 400 employees a month in order to meet a goal of 23,000 later this year.\nHuntington Ingalls is in the running to build one, or possibly two aircraft carriers in the coming years, each of which could cost more than $13 billion. Geurts told the Congressional panel on Thursday the Navy could know more about that selection process and Huntington’s bid in the early summer.\nAs of Thursday, the U.S. Navy said it has 282 deployable battle force ships.\nReporting by Mike Stone in Washington; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T00:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T00:55:55.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
