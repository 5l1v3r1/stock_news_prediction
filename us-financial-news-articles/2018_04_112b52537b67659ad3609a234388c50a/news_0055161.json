Higher productivity would also be required, he said.\nNagy said the BUBOR (interbank rate), which is around zero now, can first start to increase around the end of 2019, “and, if this happens, then we can begin thinking about how to operate with the tools affecting either short or longer yields.”\nHe reiterated that “the end of 2020 would be the time when we can begin to think about” the level of the base rate.\nReforms would also be needed to lift economic growth above 4 percent in a sustainable way, as the effect of the central bank’s own stimulus measures could start to wane over the coming years, Nagy said.\nThe bank’s latest projections, based on the currently available policy framework, predict a slowdown in economic growth in the next two years.\nNagy said the central bank was firmly focused on 3 percent inflation, dismissing the view that it would be content to let inflation rise to 4 percent, the top of its target range, to boost the economy.\n“The tolerance band can be used, but its use is justified in cases when there is a temporary increase in inflation, followed by a swift return to 3 percent,” Nagy said.\nWhile domestic inflation remains subdued and expectations anchored, external developments and the steps of the ECB would have a bigger bearing on the conduct of policy, Nagy said.\n“The ECB is also running loose monetary conditions, but the market expects that this will end at some stage. Its timing, pace and the steps are very important and can have a big impact on us as well,” he said.\n“As long as the ECB maintains loose monetary conditions, the Hungarian central bank also has room to maneuver to maintain them. It follows that it is more likely that the NBH will take any steps only after the ECB moves.”\nNagy added that the central bank was pleased with the low volatility of the forint EURHUF=D3, adding that no major change, only fine-tuning, was expected in its policy toolkit.\nReporting by Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-25T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T20:18:12.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
