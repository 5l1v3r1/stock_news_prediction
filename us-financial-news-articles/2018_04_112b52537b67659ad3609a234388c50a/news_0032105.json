Related Coverage \nAt pains to present a united front despite their underlying differences and distinct styles - Merkel’s cautious, no-nonsense approach contrasts with Macron’s bold rhetoric - they stressed they would tackle a range of issues, including migrant policy. \nMacron reiterated a proposal made at the European parliament to subsidize local authorities who welcomed refugees. \n“We can’t let this or that country alone carry the burden of hosting and integrating (migrants),” he said. \nOn a European asylum system, Merkel said the two leaders agreed on many points, and concurred that offering incentives was a better approach than talking about penalties.

Kay Nietfeld/Pool via Reuters EURO ZONE REFORM \nMacron’s vision also includes turning Europe’s existing bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund (EMF), to act as a buffer in any future financial crises in the bloc, which was nearly torn apart in a debt crisis that took hold in 2009. \nHe has also suggested the euro zone have its own finance minister and, at one point, floated the idea of a budget for the currency bloc worth hundreds of billions of euros. \nGermany’s Social Democrats (SPD), Merkel’s junior coalition partner, sympathize with Macron’s call for solidarity. They want him to be rewarded for efforts to reform the French economy, well aware that a big chunk of French voters remain susceptible to far-right and far-left populists skeptical about the EU. \nBut Merkel’s larger conservative bloc insists on what they call the principle of ‘liability’, whereby individual member states carry responsibility for their own economic risks. \nMerkel said she was very optimistic about completing a banking union. Berlin’s focus has long been on banks first reducing the risks they take in lending. \n“We are also ready, perhaps not in the immediate future but in the longer term, to agree on a common deposit guarantee system,” said Merkel. “But we want liability and risks to be kept together.” \nUnderlining a sense of urgency for reform in Brussels, European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs Pierre Moscovici warned momentum could be lost for deepening euro zone integration if decisions are not taken at the June summit.
