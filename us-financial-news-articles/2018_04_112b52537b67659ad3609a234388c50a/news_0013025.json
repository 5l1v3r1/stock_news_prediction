It was Monroe’s second career triple-double and his first since Nov. 7, 2012 with the Detroit Pistons.\n“I believe in the guys in our locker room,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens told reporters when asked about his team’s chances in the playoffs without Irving. “I think they believe in themselves, and I think that’s the most important thing.”\nWith Toronto’s victory over Indiana, the Raptors clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and locked the Celtics into the second seed. Meanwhile, the Bulls missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons.\nSean Kilpatrick scored a team-high 24 points and Lauri Markkanen had 20 for Chicago, which had won three straight after a seven-game losing streak. The Bulls dropped three of four meetings with the Celtics this season.\nJabari Bird added a career-high 15 points for Boston. Jonathan Gibson, who signed with the Celtics earlier Friday, had nine points in his debut.\nAl Horford and Jayson Tatum rested for Boston.\nOmer Asik’s layup with 9:30 remaining had Chicago up 86-84, but Bird tied it with 9:18 left and Gibson’s 3 with 8:57 left started a 16-6 surge that put Boston up by double digits and put the game out of reach.\nBefore being ejected, Monroe’s three-point play with 39.3 seconds left in the third put the Celtics up five before the Bulls pulled within 79-76 after three.\nChicago was up 58-55 at halftime after leading by as many as 11 in the first half.\nChicago hosts Brooklyn on Saturday. Boston hosts Atlanta on Sunday.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-07T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-07T16:09:19.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
