Analysts surveyed by Reuters had forecast on average a 750 million riyal profit. \nMiner Ma’aden, which had surged 6.1 percent on Thursday because of soaring international aluminium prices, fell back 0.5 percent. \nBut Al Sagr Cooperative Insurance climbed 2 percent, rising sharply for a second straight day after saying it would discuss a possible merger with Wala’a Cooperative Insurance, which edged up 0.6 percent. \nDubai’s index slipped 0.1 percent as blue chip Emaar Properties dropped 0.7 percent to 5.60 dirhams, returning near a two-year low of 5.52 dirhams hit earlier this month. \nInvestment company Amanat Holdings, the best performer in Dubai, rose 2.9 percent. At a general meeting on Sunday, shareholders were expected to approve the distribution of 1.5 percent in cash dividends for 2017. \nAbu Dhabi National Energy Co (TAQA) was up 3.4 percent and was the most heavily traded stock in that market, continuing a sharp uptrend that began in March and based partly on strong oil prices. The stock has soared more than 50 percent since the end of March. \nIn Qatar, Doha Bank lost 0.7 percent despite reporting on Sunday 382 million riyals ($105 million) in first- quarter net profit, a 4.7 percent increase year-on-year, and beating the estimates of three analysts polled by Reuters who forecast 348 million riyals on average. The Qatar index closed 0.5 percent down. \nEgypt’s index climbed 0.7 percent as investment firm Qalaa Holdings soared 9.7 percent to a three-year high of 2.71 Egyptian pounds, rising above the March peak of 2.60 pounds. Early this month Pharos Research calculated a fair value of 3.00 pounds for the stock, which has been rising partly in anticipation of the planned trial start-up of its oil refinery this year. SAUDI ARABIA \n* The index shed 0.3 percent to 8,257 points. DUBAI \n* The index edged down 0.1 percent to 3,080 points. ABU DHABI \n* The index lost 0.5 percent to 4,682 points. QATAR \n* The index dropped 0.5 percent to 9,156 points. EGYPT \n* The index climbed 0.7 percent to 17,898 points. KUWAIT \n* The index ticked up 0.1 percent to 4,776 points. OMAN \n* The index edged up 0.03 percent to 4,761 points.
