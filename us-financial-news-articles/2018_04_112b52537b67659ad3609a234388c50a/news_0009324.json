Congressional candidates in Maryland and Kentucky have similarly withdrawn ads from Sinclair-owned stations, and a city councilman in Cincinnati made a similar promise , saying he will boycott the local news station and won’t ‘prop up’ their revenue by watching the channel.\nOn Wednesday, Sen. Durbin (D-Ill.) wrote to Sinclair CEO David Smith, asking him to shed light on the company’s “must run” stories. Meanwhile, Trump has come to the defense of the company, tweeting on Tuesday, “The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The “Fakers” at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!”\nThe Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast.
