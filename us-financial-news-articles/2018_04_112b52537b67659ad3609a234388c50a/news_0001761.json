The only way currently to keep patients receiving opioids safe is through continuous electronic monitoring.\"\n\"So, I share with PPAHS a commitment to having all patients receiving opioids in healthcare facilities continuously electronically monitored. My involvement with PPAHS will allow me to continue to pursue this objective and help ensure the safe use of opioids.\"\nPPAHS recently released on the PPAHS YouTube Channel, the AAMI video featuring Ms. Flack, Dr. Frank Overdyk, and Laura Townsend on the need for all hospitals to continuously monitor their patients receiving opioids.
