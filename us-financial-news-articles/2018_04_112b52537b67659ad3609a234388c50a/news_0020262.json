That’s got to go,” he said. \n“I feel like European basketball is more physical than the NBA is right now.” \nHe said he would like to see hand checking and other more physical forms of defense reintroduced so players would have to work harder for open shots. \n“It challenges players to improve their skill level because now if you can hand check and things like that, you really must be fundamentally sound,” he said. \n“You must be able to handle the ball to be able to get past defenders.” \nThe elimination of hand checking empowered smaller players and has led to a shift where the point guard, as opposed to the towering center standing near the basket, is frequently the most important player. \nBryant’s comments came on the last day of an NBA regular season where tensions between players and referees have been at an all-time high, with many of the league’s top athletes criticizing officials for being too involved. \nBryant said he understood that referees had a difficult job but said the league would improve if it selected and trained good people. \n“You have younger officials coming in. Some want to do the work, some don’t want to do the work. It’s just like anything else,” he said. \n“When officials are doing their job at the highest level, you never mention their name once in a broadcast,” he said. \n“That should be every official’s goal.” \nThe NBA playoffs tip off on April 14.
