The Padres concluded a 1-6 homestand.\nHand opened the ninth by issuing consecutive walks to Trevor Story and Chris Iannetta. The Rockies loaded the bases with no one out when second baseman Carlos Asuaje dropped the throw from third baseman Christian Villanueva on a sacrifice bunt.\nHand struck out pinch hitter Carlos Gonzalez. But he missed on four straight pitches to McMahon to force home Story. Hand struck out Charlie Blackmon for the second out before LeMahieu drove home Iannetta and Gerardo Parra with a single to right. All three runs off Hand (0-2) were unearned.\nAdam Ottavino (1-0) pitched two scoreless inning in relief of Rockies starter Tyler Anderson to get the win. Wade Davis got his fourth save of the season - and his third of the series - despite giving up a home run to Manuel Margot leading off the ninth.\nLeft-handed starting pitchers Anderson and Joey Lucchesi of the Padres put up all zeroes.\nAnderson, who lasted only 2 1/3 innings in his first outing, blanked the Padres on four hits and no walks with four strikeouts in six-plus innings. He worked out of a jam in the fifth when he struck out Austin Hedges and Chase Headley with two on to end the inning.\nAnderson departed after giving up a leadoff single to Hunter Renfroe to open the seventh. Adam Ottavino struck out Villanueva before Freddy Galvis singled to right. But Gerardo Parra threw out Renfroe trying to go to third and Galvis was thrown out trying to steal second.\nThe only hit off Lucchesi was Blackmon’s game-opening single. Lucchesi also issued three walks in the first two innings while throwing 45 pitches. But he ended his five-inning outing by retiring 10 straight Rockies, including six by strikeout.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T21:56:00.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
