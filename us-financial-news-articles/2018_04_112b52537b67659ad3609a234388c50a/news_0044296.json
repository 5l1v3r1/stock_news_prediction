The U.N. mission, known as MINUSMA, could not immediately be reached for comment. \nThe April 14 car bomb and rocket attacks on the heavily fortified bases by militants disguised as U.N. peacekeepers killed one U.N. peacekeeper from Burkina Faso and wounded seven French troops. \nThe raid, for which al Qaeada’s local affiliate JNIM claimed responsibility, marked a particularly daring assault amid an upsurge in jihadist violence in Mali and neighbouring countries. \nFrance’s defence ministry said at least 15 assailants were killed when it scrambled fighter jets and attack helicopters to respond. \nU.N. peacekeeping and French military forces in northern Mali have faced near-constant attack over the past year by determined and well-armed jihadist groups seen as the gravest threat to security across West Africa’s Sahel region. \nWestern-backed operations against the groups have inflicted significant casualties, yet the jihadists have savvily exploited political and ethnic tensions to recruit new members.
