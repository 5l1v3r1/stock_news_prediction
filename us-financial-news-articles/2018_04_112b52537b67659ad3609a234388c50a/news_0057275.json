During the first quarter, we completed four acquisitions - Metal Moulding and Aluminum Metals in February 2018, and Indiana Marine Products and Collins & Company in March 2018.\"\n\"Both our leisure family lifestyle markets and our housing and industrial markets are fundamentally strong with early indicators and demographic drivers pointing towards continued growth,\" stated Andy Nemeth, President. \"Based on the most recently available data, RV and marine retail sales and new housing formations are off to a solid start for the year, and match up well with recent historical seasonal trends and demand patterns. Attendance levels and excitement generated at the early spring industry retail and trade shows support our optimism about the sustainable long-term potential in our key markets, and we are committed to putting capital to work in alignment with our disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive improved performance and shareholder value while continuing to position ourselves to be able to fully support our customers.\"\nAs part of its allocation strategy, the Company invested $117.0 million in the aggregate in the first quarter of 2018 for acquisitions, stock repurchases, and capital expenditures.
