That’s been in flight under Bjarne for the last couple of years,” he told reporters. “As we roll forward I’m not expecting any significant change.” $1 = 1.2795 Canadian dollars Reporting by Matt Scuffham Editing by Susan Thomas", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-03T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-03T19:37:41.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
