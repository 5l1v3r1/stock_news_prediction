It said it continues to employ about 3,000 people in West Virginia. \n“We remain committed to a U.S. manufacturing base and plan to continue making the majority of the medicines we supply to the U.S in the U.S.,” Mylan said in a statement. \nGeneric drugmakers have seen profits shrink due to intensifying pricing pressure on the low-cost pharmaceuticals. \nMylan’s bottom line has also been hit by its decision to sell a generic EpiPen for about half the price of the branded product in response to public outrage in 2016. Consumers saw the price for a pack of two auto-injectors rise sixfold to $600 in less than a decade, making them unaffordable for a growing number of families. \nThe Morgantown plant is not involved in EpiPen production. EpiPens are manufactured for Mylan by Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) at a plant in St. Louis, which has experienced production problems that have led to shortages in some international markets, including Canada and Britain.
