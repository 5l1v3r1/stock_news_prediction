The feedback it receives from “credible sources” is “consistently positive ... about how we listen and respond to their needs,” it said.\n“The media have taken a handful of isolated cases, presented only one side of the story, and then extrapolated these to suggest systemic issues with our administration,” the ATO said.\nReporting by Paulina Duran; Editing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-10T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-11T17:58:31.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
