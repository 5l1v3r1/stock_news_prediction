During the subsequent walkout, the legislature passed several other revenue increases to benefit education, including a new tax on online sales and an expansion of the types of games permitted at casinos. \nOklahoma was the second state to hold a prolonged, statewide teachers strike just this year, after West Virginia, and with educators threatening imminent work stoppages in Kentucky and Arizona, it will likely not be the last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T03:11:25.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
