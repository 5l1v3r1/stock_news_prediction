Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $72.5 million, or $.83 per diluted common share (EPS), compared to $55.4 million, or $.64 EPS in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $49.0 million, or $.57 EPS, in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes $7.0 million ($.07 per share after-tax impact) of expenses related to the sale of Harrison Finance Company (HFC), the pending Capital One trust and asset management transaction, the brand consolidation project, and a one-time all hands bonus. The fourth quarter of 2017 included an estimated $19.5 million ($.22 per share impact) tax reform related re-measurement charge of the net deferred tax asset (DTA). The first quarter of 2017 nonoperating items included $6.5 million of acquisition costs related to the First NBC Bank (FNBC) transaction ($.05 per share), partially offset by a $4.4 million gain from the sale of selected Hancock Horizon funds ($.03 per share).\nHighlights of the company’s first quarter 2018 results (compared to fourth quarter 2017):\nReported earnings increased $17.0 million, or 31%; excluding the impact of the DTA re-measurement charge and nonoperating items, operating earnings increased $3.3 million, or 4% Loans increased $88 million, or 2%, linked-quarter annualized; net increase reflects a decline of $95 million related to the sale of the consumer finance company (HFC) Energy loans totaled $1.1 billion and comprised 5.5% of total loans; allowance for the energy portfolio totals $62.6 million, or 5.9% of energy loans Net interest margin (NIM) of 3.37%, down 11 bps; core NIM down 9 bps to 3.26% Operating expenses totaled $164.9 million, down 2% linked-quarter Efficiency ratio was 57.5% compared to 56.6% linked-quarter; the change is mainly related to the impact of tax reform on the TE adjustment Return on average assets (ROA) improved 26 bps to 1.08%; excluding nonoperating items and the 4Q17 DTA charge, operating ROA increased 7 bps to 1.17% Tangible common equity (TCE) ratio increased 7 bps to 7.80%\n“We are pleased with solid results for the first quarter of 2018,” said John M. Hairston, President & CEO. “Our reported ROA is above 1% and we accomplished another step towards achieving our newly announced corporate strategic objectives by realizing two of them this period – ROA (operating) of 1.17% and ROTCE (operating) of 15.56%. The positive impact from a lower provision for loan loss, lower operating expenses, and a lower tax rate led to those achievements, along with an improved level of operating EPS. Results also included the negative impact of tax reform on our TE income, the sale of our consumer finance business, typical first quarter seasonality and the impact of today’s rate environment on our capital ratios. However, even with those items, and the non-operating items related to an all-hands bonus and several significant projects, we made good progress toward attaining the new 2019 CSOs.”\nLoans\nTotal loans at March 31, 2018 were $19.1 billion, up approximately $88 million, or less than 1%, linked-quarter. Net growth reflects a decline of $95 million related to the sale of the consumer finance company during the first quarter. Net loan growth during the quarter continues to be diversified across the regions and also in areas identified as part of the company’s revenue-generating initiatives.\nAverage loans totaled $19.0 billion for the first quarter of 2018, up $189 million, or 1%, linked-quarter.\nEnergy\nAt March 31, 2018, loans to the energy industry totaled $1.1 billion, or 5.5% of total loans. The energy portfolio was relatively stable linked-quarter, and is comprised of credits to both the exploration and production (E&P) sector and the support and services sectors. Payoffs and paydowns of approximately $76 million and charge-offs of $7.6 million were partially offset by approximately $85 million in fundings.\nRecent higher oil prices are helpful in the recovery of credits impacted by the energy cycle, however the key to resolution of many of those credits, especially in support services, is stabilization of prices over the longer term.\nManagement continues to estimate that net charge-offs from energy-related credits could approximate up to $95 million over the duration of the cycle, of which approximately $81 million has been taken to-date. While we expect additional charge-offs in the portfolio, we continue to believe the impact of the energy cycle on our loan portfolio will be manageable, our reserve is adequate and our capital will remain solid.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $22.5 billion, up $233 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest-bearing demand deposits (DDAs) totaled $8.2 billion at March 31, 2018, down $77 million, or 1%, from December 31, 2017. DDAs comprised 37% of total period-end deposits at March 31, 2018.\nInterest-bearing transaction and savings deposits totaled $8.1 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2018, down $123 million, or 2%, from December 31, 2017. Time deposits of $3.1 billion were up $365 million, or 13%, while interest-bearing public fund deposits increased $68 million, or 2%, to $3.1 billion at March 31, 2018.\nAverage deposits for the first quarter of 2018 were $22.0 billion, up $281 million, or 1%, linked-quarter.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets (NPAs) totaled $468.3 million at March 31, 2018, up $67.5 million from December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, total nonperforming loans increased approximately $68.4 million, mainly related to an increase in restructured support nondrilling loans (TDRs), while foreclosed and surplus real estate (ORE) and other foreclosed assets decreased approximately $0.9 million. Nonperforming assets as a percent of total loans, ORE and other foreclosed assets was 2.45% at March 31, 2018, up 34 bps from December 31, 2017.\nThe total allowance for loan losses (ALLL) was $210.7 million at March 31, 2018, down $6.6 million from December 31, 2017. The decline reflects the sale of the consumer finance company during the first quarter. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to period-end loans was 1.10% at March 31, 2018, down 4 bps from 1.14% at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credits in the energy portfolio totaled $62.6 million, or 5.9% of energy loans, at March 31, 2018, as compared to $70.2 million, or 6.7% of energy loans, at December 31, 2017.\nNet charge-offs were $12.2 million, or 0.26% of average total loans on an annualized basis in the first quarter of 2018, down from $20.8 million, or 0.44% of average total loans in the fourth quarter of 2017. There were approximately $7.6 million of charge-offs related to energy credits in the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by energy-related recoveries of $3.3 million.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Hancock recorded a total provision for loan losses of $12.3 million, down from $15.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin (NIM)\nNet interest income (TE) for the first quarter of 2018 was $209.6 million, down $7.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease is related to a $4.2 million negative impact of tax reform on the TE adjustment, a $1.7 million reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans, a $3.3 million reduction due to 2 fewer business days in the first quarter and a $1.5 million reduction in income related to the sale of the consumer finance company.\nAverage earning assets were $25.1 billion for the first quarter of 2018, up $294 million, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The net interest margin (TE) was 3.37% for the first quarter of 2018, down 11 bps from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decline in the margin is related to an 8 bps negative impact on the TE adjustment from tax reform, a 3 bps negative impact from the reversal of interest on nonaccrual loans and a 2 bps negative impact related to the sale of the consumer finance company.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income totaled $66.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, down $3.4 million, or 5%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, and includes a loss on the sale of the consumer finance company of $1.1 million. Excluding the loss on the sale, noninterest income (operating) totaled $67.4 million, down $2.3 million, or 3%.\nService charges on deposits totaled $21.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, down $1.0 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank card and ATM fees totaled $14.5 million, up $0.2 million, or 2%, from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTrust fees totaled $11.3 million, up $0.3 million, or 2% linked-quarter. Investment and annuity income and insurance fees totaled $6.1 million, up $0.3 million, or 6%, linked-quarter.\nFees from secondary mortgage operations totaled $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, up $0.2 million, or 5%, linked-quarter.\nOther noninterest income totaled $10.6 million, down $2.2 million, or 17%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. Other noninterest income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $2.9 million gain related to a bulk sale of loans from the Peoples First acquisition.\nNoninterest Expense & Taxes\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $170.8 million, up $2.7 million, or 2%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, including $5.9 million of nonoperating expense related to the sale of the consumer finance company, the pending acquisition of Capital One’s trust and asset management business, the brand consolidation project, and a one-time all hands bonus. Excluding nonoperating items, operating expense totaled $164.9 million, down $3.1 million, or 2%. The discussion below excludes nonoperating items.\nTotal personnel expense was $96.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, down $3.2 million, or 3%, from the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease is mainly related to higher performance-based incentive pay in the fourth quarter, partly offset by higher seasonal personnel expense.\nOccupancy and equipment expense totaled $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, down $0.5 million, or 4%, from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAmortization of intangibles totaled $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, down $0.3 million or 5% linked-quarter. ORE expense totaled $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net gains on ORE dispositions that exceeded ORE expense by $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter reflects a more normal level of ORE expense.\nOther operating expense totaled $48.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $0.3 million, or 1%, from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 18%. Management expects the tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 to approximate 18%. The effective income tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate due primarily to tax-exempt income and tax credits.\nCapital\nCommon shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 totaled $2.9 billion, unchanged from year-end 2017. The tangible common equity (TCE) ratio was 7.80%, up 7 bps from December 31, 2017. Additional capital ratios are included in the financial tables.\nConference Call and Slide Presentation\nManagement will host a conference call for analysts and investors at 9:00 a.m. Central Time on Wednesday, April 18, 2018 to review the results.

The company’s banking subsidiary provides comprehensive financial products and services through Hancock Bank locations in Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida and Whitney Bank locations in Louisiana and Texas, including traditional, online, and mobile banking; commercial and small business banking; private banking; trust and investment services; certain insurance services; and mortgage services. More information is available at www.hancockwhitney.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release includes non-GAAP financial measures to describe Hancock’s performance. The reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are provided either in the financial tables or in Appendix A thereto.\nConsistent with Securities and Exchange Commission Industry Guide 3, the company presents net interest income, net interest margin and efficiency ratios on a fully taxable equivalent (“TE”) basis. The TE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of net interest income from certain loans and investments using the statutory federal tax rate to increase tax-exempt interest income to a taxable equivalent basis. The company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nThe company presents certain additional non-GAAP financial measures to assist the reader with a better understanding of the company’s performance period over period, as well as to provide investors with assistance in understanding the success management has experienced in executing its strategic initiatives. These non-GAAP measures may reference the concepts “core” or “operating.” The company uses the term “core” to describe a financial measure that excludes income or expense arising from accretion or amortization of fair value adjustments recorded as part of purchase accounting. The company uses the term “operating” to describe a financial measure that excludes income or expense considered to be nonoperating in nature. Items identified as nonoperating are those that, when excluded from a reported financial measure, provide management or the reader with a measure that may be more indicative of forward-looking trends in the company’s business.\nWe define Core Net Interest Income as net interest income (TE) excluding net purchase accounting accretion and amortization. We define Core Net Interest Margin as core net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. A reconciliation of reported net interest income to core net interest income and reported net interest margin to core net interest margin is included in Appendix A.\nWe define Operating Revenue as net interest income (TE) and noninterest income less nonoperating revenue. We define Operating Pre-Provision Net Revenue as operating revenue (TE) less noninterest expense, excluding nonoperating items. Management believes that operating pre-provision net revenue is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the company’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. A reconciliation of reported net interest income to operating pre-provision net revenue is included in Appendix A.\nWe define Operating Earnings as reported net income excluding nonoperating items net of income tax. We define Operating Earnings per Share as operating earnings expressed as an amount available to each common shareholder on a diluted basis. A reconciliation of reported net income to operating earnings is presented in the Income Statement table and a reconciliation of reported earnings per share – diluted to operating earnings per share – diluted is presented in Appendix A.\nImportant Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
