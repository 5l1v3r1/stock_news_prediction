This should set us up for Model 3 production of 3,000 to 4,000 per week next month,\" Electrek quoted Musk as saying.\n\"Another set of upgrades starting in late May should be enough to unlock production capacity of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by the end of June,\" he added.\nInvestors are closely watching to see if Tesla is able to meet long-delayed targets and quickly ramp up the Model 3, on which the company's future profitability rests. Tesla is pressured on a host of fronts after a fatality in one of its vehicles using its Autopilot system, a downgrade by Moody's, and a public spat between Musk and safety regulators.\nTesla's use of robots to assemble Model 3s has led to more complexity and delays, which Musk acknowledged last week in a tweet: \"Excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.\"\n\"Tesla's been trying to run full tilt,\" said Chaim Siegel, an analyst at Elazar Advisors, before Musk's letter was published. \"He's sleeping overnight on the production floor. I don't think there is any way they'd purposely want to slow production. It tells me something's not quite right.\"\nIn the letter to employees cited by Electrek, Musk said Tesla had built over 2000 Model 3s per week for three weeks, with 2250 made last week.\nTesla had previously targeted 2,500 Model 3s a week by the end of the first quarter and 5,000 by the end of the second quarter.\nMissed deadlines threaten the money-losing company's credibility with the market and its ability to raise cash. Musk has said no new funds are needed this year, although many analysts dispute that.\nMusk rallied employees in the letter, while warning departments or suppliers who missed the mark, saying they would need a \"very good explanation\" and a plan for fixing the problem presented directly to him.\nShares of Tesla, which ended 1.2 percent lower on Tuesday, rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading.
