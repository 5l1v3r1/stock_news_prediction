In some adults, the disease also causes joint pain, impaired mobility, tooth abscesses and hearing loss.\nLast month, Piper Jaffray analysts said in a note that they expected peak sales of $336 million in 2022 for the drug.\nCrysvita targets a protein whose excess production causes wasting of phosphate in the kidney. The drug binds the excess protein in patients to treat rickets in children and heal fractures in adults.\nThe company and Japan-based Kyowa Hakko Kirin entered into a collaboration and license agreement in August 2013 to develop and commercialize the drug.\nThe drugmaker is also developing Crysvita for tumor-induced osteomalacia, another rare disease that causes bone pain.\nAlong with the approval, the FDA also gave Ultragenyx a \"rare pediatric disease voucher,\" which can be redeemed at a later date to receive a priority review from the agency for another product.\nUltragenyx is also developing gene therapies that are in early-stage clinical trials for treating other rare disorders.\nThe shares of the California-based company were up 1.6 percent at $54.69 in late afternoon trading.\n(Reporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-17T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T20:40:53.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
