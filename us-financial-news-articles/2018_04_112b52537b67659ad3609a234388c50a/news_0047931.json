The FTI has forecast domestic car sales of 900,000 vehicles this year after a 13.4 percent jump in 2017, which was the first annual increase in five years. Annual domestic car sales contracted during 2013-2016, following the end of a government car subsidy scheme in 2012, when sales surged 81 percent. In March, car exports increased 4.7 percent year-on-year to 110,946 vehicles. The FTI forecasts car exports at 1.1 million this year after 1.14 million cars exported last year. Thailand is a regional vehicle production and export base for the world's top carmakers. The auto industry accounts for about 12 percent of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.
