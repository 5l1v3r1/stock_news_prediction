Its rivals include French conglomerate Kering ( PRTP.PA ), owner of Italian fashion brand-of-the-moment Gucci.\nCompanies with a wide array of businesses have been among the biggest winners of the luxury goods rebound, at a time of tough competition among labels to win over young, fickle consumers often influenced by social media.\nDemand from Chinese consumers, the industry’s single biggest client base, strengthened in 2017, after a crackdown on luxury gift-giving six years ago pummeled earnings.\nBut the industry remains vulnerable to geopolitical twists and turns, including tensions on trade between the United States and China. A strong euro has also been a headwind, in part as it can put off tourists shopping in Europe from spending.\nLVMH is due to hold a conference call with analysts on April 10.
