Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - April 17, 2018 Tottenham's Harry Kane celebrates scoring their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nA tame encounter sprung to life early in the second half when England forward Harry Kane fired Tottenham ahead with his 26th league goal of the season, but the advantage was short-lived as Brighton won a penalty within seconds of the restart. \nSpurs full back Serge Aurier clipped the heels of Jose Izquierdo and Pascal Gross managed to squeeze his spot-kick past keeper Hugo Lloris to the relief of the home fans. \nThe draw left fourth-placed Tottenham eight points clear of Chelsea in fifth, but last season’s champions have a game in hand in the battle to secure Champions League qualification. \nTottenham made a raft of changes to their team ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final with Manchester United at Wembley but manager Mauricio Pochettino was not making excuses.

Slideshow (8 Images) \n“What I was most delighted with was the character of the team to concede the way we did and then react the way we did,” Brighton manager Chris Hughton said. \nIt was a cagey first half as Brighton defended resolutely, sacrificing any attacking intent to keep Spurs at arm’s length. \nKane, who is second in the league scoring charts behind Liverpool’s Mo Salah (30), was reduced to glimpses of goal, while the only clear-cut opening fell to Son Heung-min. \nKane teed up the Korean, who made a sharp burst into the box and fired low towards the corner but his effort was brilliantly turned around the post by Mathew Ryan’s full-length save. \nThe match burst properly into life minutes after the restart when Tottenham took the lead and Brighton equalised in the space of a few moments. \nKane blasted home after Son showed quick feet to keep the ball in play and set up the England striker in the 48th minute. \nBrighton immediately surged forward and won a penalty when Aurier clipped the heels of Izquierdo as Brighton’s Colombia winger cut into the area. Spurs keeper Lloris got a hand to Gross’s spot kick but he could not keep it out.
