Robust demand for air travel drove a 5.9-percent year-over-year increase in quarterly total revenue to a record $10.4 billion.\nAmerican said enhancements to its fleet, notably an order of 47 Boeing 787s, will help improve fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs, saving the carrier money down the line.\nReferring to the spike in fuel expenses, American lowered its full-year earnings forecast to between $5 and $6 per share, from between $5.50 and $6.50.\nAmerican said it expects second-quarter unit costs, excluding fuel and special items, to rise 3.5 percent due to employee and benefit increases and other costs.\nThe Dow Jones U.S. Airlines Index was down 2.7 percent on Thursday, and has lost 11 percent this year, on results from American and rival Southwest Airlines.\nReporting by Alana Wise Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-26T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-27T16:45:12.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
