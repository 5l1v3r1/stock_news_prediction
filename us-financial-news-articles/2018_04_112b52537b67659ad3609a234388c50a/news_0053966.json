They pushed us to the limits. The two matches we played not at the Emirates but at (the) amazing old stadium (were) unforgettable. We had big matches, big fights, so thank you so much for that. Regrets? Little negative episodes.”\nOver the years Old Trafford has shaped Wenger’s career, with the Frenchman claiming his first big win in England there in 1998 and then suffering his biggest humiliation in losing 8-2 to one of Alex Ferguson’s best sides in 2011.\nIn that context, Sunday’s farewell on which nothing rests promises to be a low-key affair with Arsenal set to field a weakened team ahead of next week’s Europa League semi-final second leg against Atletico Madrid.\nBut Mourinho called on United’s fans to give Wenger a positive reception.\n“I hope he has a good reaction, if not good, not bad at all and from our club he is going to feel the respect we have,” said Mourinho.\n“Man United fans know that until 2004 for about a decade was between Man United and Arsenal, was between Sir Alex and Mr Wenger and I think that these great teams Arsenal had made Man United better and better.”\nMourinho also said there was “no chance” that keeper David de Gea would be allowed to leave the club in the close season.
