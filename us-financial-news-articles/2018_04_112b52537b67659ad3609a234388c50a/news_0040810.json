He did not specify when the new hours would take effect or how long the new policy would remain in place.\nTraders said under the current system, shippers could pay for additional time at the port beyond the regular 16 hours.\nOne Cairo-based trader called the new hours a “good move” to avoid extra costs, but said much of the current problem was also tied to a lack of storage space at Egypt’s crowded ports, something the new policy would not correct.\n“Some of the storage areas inside the port don’t have enough space to discharge the whole quantities,” he said.
