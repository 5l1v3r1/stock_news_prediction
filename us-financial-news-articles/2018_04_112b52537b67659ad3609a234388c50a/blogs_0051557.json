The last World Bank capital increase came in 2010.\nThe current hike comes with cost controls and salary restrictions that will hold World Bank compensation to \"a little below average\" for the financial sector, Kim said.\nHe added that there was nothing specific in the agreement that targeted a China lending reduction, but he said lending to China was expected to gradually decline.\nIn 2015, China founded the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and lends heavily to developing countries through its government export banks.\nThe agreement will lift China's shareholding in IBRD to 6.01 percent from 4.68 percent, while the U.S. share would dip slightly to 16.77 percent from 16.89 percent. Washington will still keep its veto power over IBRD and IFC decisions.\nKim said the increase was expected to become fully effective by the time the World Bank's new fiscal year starts on July 1. Countries will have up to eight years to pay for the capital increase.\nThe U.S. contribution is subject to approval by Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T12:30:32.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
