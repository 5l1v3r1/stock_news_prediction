The timeline, which we have set together with the Bulgarian National Bank is the first half of the year, “ Goranov told a news conference after a meeting of EU finance ministers.\nHe said that timeline for the application did not clash with expectations of Bulgaria’s prime minister that the Balkan country would be allowed into the ERM-2 — a stability test for the currency — within a year.\nGoranov said he expected Bulgaria would join the euro after spending the 24 months in the ERM-2 required by EU laws. There are now 19 countries that share the euro currency.
