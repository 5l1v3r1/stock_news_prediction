I don’t recall an action like this we have taken getting so much applause and so little pushback.”\nThe next day, Baal Guidorizzi forwarded the feedback to the broader CFPB enforcement team, the documents show.\n“Seems that the case was popular even in the banking community. I am hoping that this feedback will help balance some of the concerns about ‘industry’ reaction in our future work. Congratulations again to the team!” she wrote.\nWells had long been celebrated on Wall Street for its “cross-sell” ratio, which measured its ability to sell multiple products to each customer. But the metric had been questioned by envious rivals who struggled to achieve the same results.\nIn interviews after the Wells Fargo scandal erupted, executives from other banks told Reuters they believed Wells went awry by measuring employee performance through sales and product numbers in its retail operation, rather than using customer service metrics.\nThe bankers said at the time that while incentive programs differed, it was standard across the industry to incorporate customer feedback when considering employee rewards.\nWells has since changed the way it measure sales performance.\nA spokesman for the CFPB declined to comment. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
