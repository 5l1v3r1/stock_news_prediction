The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the GAAP financial measures, but should instead be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures used by Fortive in this release may be different from similarly-titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this release that are not strictly historical, statements regarding Fortive’s anticipated earnings, business and acquisition opportunities, anticipated revenue growth, anticipated operating margin expansion, anticipated cash flow, economic conditions, future prospects, shareholder value, and any other statements identified by their use of words like “anticipate,” “expect,” “believe,” “outlook,” “guidance,” or “will” or other words of similar meaning are “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The tax effect of such adjustments was calculated by applying our overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount of each adjustment (unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment). We expect to apply our overall estimated effective tax rate to each adjustment going forward, and, as such, we are applying the estimated effective tax rate to each adjustment for the forecasted periods to facilitate comparisons in future periods; and Excluding adjustments made to the 2017 provisional amount estimated in connection with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”).\nIf any additional subsequent adjustments are made in 2018 to the provisional amounts estimated for 2017 in connection with the TCJA, such adjustments will be reflected in the applicable GAAP financial measures corresponding to the reporting period during which such adjustments are determined. In the event of such adjustments to the provisional amounts, we will also exclude such adjustments in the non-GAAP historical adjusted net earnings, historical adjusted diluted net earnings per share, and historical free cash flow conversion ratio we disclose for the corresponding period (such exclusions, including such exclusions as noted above, the “TCJA Adjustments”).\nWhile we have a history of acquisition activity, we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation and that intangible assets related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.\nThe forecasted adjusted diluted net earnings per share does not reflect certain adjustments that are inherently difficult to predict or estimate due to their unknown timing, effect and/or significance, including, but not limited to, the TCJA Adjustments.\nThe TCJA Adjustments identified above have been excluded from the GAAP measures identified above because items of this nature and/or size occur with inconsistent frequency or occur for reasons that may be unrelated to our commercial performance during the period and/or because we believe the corresponding adjustments are useful in assessing our potential ongoing operating costs or gains in a given period. We will adjust for, and identify as significant, acquisition-related transaction costs, acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, and corresponding restructuring charges primarily related to acquisitions, in each case, incurred in a given period, if we determine that such costs and adjustments exceed the range of our typical transaction costs and adjustments, respectively, in a given period.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors by reflecting additional ways of viewing aspects of our operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors to understand the long-term profitability trends of our business, and facilitate comparisons of our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers.\nThese non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measures, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nCore Revenue\nWe use the term “core revenue” when referring to a corresponding GAAP revenue measure, excluding (1) the impact from acquired businesses and (2) with respect to core revenue measures, the impact of currency translation. References to sales attributable to acquisitions or acquired businesses refer to GAAP sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition less the amount of sales attributable to certain divested businesses or product lines not considered discontinued operations prior to the first anniversary of the divestiture. The portion of sales attributable to the impact of currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in sales (excluding sales impact from acquired businesses) after applying the current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nManagement believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to investors by helping identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitating comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We exclude the effect of acquisitions and divestiture related items because the nature, size and number of such transactions can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers. We exclude the effect of currency translation from sales measures because currency translation is not under management’s control and is subject to volatility. We believe that such exclusions, when presented with the corresponding GAAP measures, may assist in assessing the business trends and making comparisons of long-term performance.\nAdjusted Net Earnings\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions) March 30, 2018 March 31, 2017 Net Earnings (GAAP) $ 261.2 $ 199.7 Pretax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the three months ended March 30, 2018 ($25 million pretax, $21 million after tax), and in the three months ended March 31, 2017 ($13 million pretax, $9 million after tax) 25.0 13.3 Tax effect of the adjustments reflected above (4.5 ) (3.6 ) TCJA Adjustments (4.2 ) — Adjusted Net Earnings (Non-GAAP) $ 277.5 $ 209.4 Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share\nThree Months Ended March 30, 2018 March 31, 2017 Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (GAAP) $ 0.74 $ 0.57 Pretax amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the three months ended March 30, 2018 ($25 million pretax, $21 million after tax), and in the three months ended March 31, 2017 ($13 million pretax, $9 million after tax) 0.07 0.04 Tax effect of the adjustments reflected above (0.01 ) (0.01 ) TCJA Adjustments (0.01 ) — Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP)* $ 0.78 $ 0.60 * The sum of the components of Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share may not equal the total amount due to rounding.
