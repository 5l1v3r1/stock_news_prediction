They’ll have to open that series next week in Orange County.\nBrodin got the scoring started at 10:53 of the first period with his sixth goal, ripping a one-timer from the left point that bounced just before it reached the net and eluded Martin Jones.\nCullen upped the lead to 2-0 at 14:52, scoring his 11th goal from the doorstep. Moments after hitting the post from almost the exact spot, Cullen converted a blind feed from Tyler Ennis.\nBurns drew San Jose within a goal just 36 seconds later, wristing a shot from the right point off Devan Dubnyk and into the net for his 12th marker of the season.\nPavelski equalized at 16:32 with his 22nd tally, thanks to Mikkel Boedker. After pouncing on a giveaway, Boedker fed Pavelski, who skated into the slot and wired a wrister under Dubnyk’s arm.\nGranlund snapped the tie at 11:19 of the second period, notching his 21st goal. Rookie Jordan Greenway picked up his first NHL point with an assist, but Granlund did most of the work, skating from the blue line to the edge of the right circle and roofing a wrister.\nZucker made it 4-2 28 seconds later, taking Nino Niederreiter’s pass, skating into the slot and flicking a backhander over Jones. Zucker tacked on his 33rd goal at 15:25, finishing a 2-on-1 with a wrister to the stick side.\nTimo Meier tallied his 21st goal on a deflection at 18:50 of the third period for the Sharks, but Eric Staal chalked up his 42nd into an empty net at 19:34 for the Wild.\nDubnyk made 27 saves in the win. Jones finished with 14 before being removed to start the third quarter for Aaron Dell, who had four saves.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:17:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
