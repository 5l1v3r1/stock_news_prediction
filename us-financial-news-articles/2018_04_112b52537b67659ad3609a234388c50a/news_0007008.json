In 2016, the average debt in families in which the head of the household is age 75 or older was $36,757. That is up from $30,288 in 2010, according to a recent report by the non-profit Employee Benefit Research Institute in Washington.\nHigh balances and calls from collection agencies can leave many older Americans feeling helpless.\nThe average monthly Social Security check is $1,404, and more than 40 percent of single adults receive more than 90 percent of their income from that check, according to the government.\n\"There's just fewer options that you have at that stage of the game,\" said Justin Halverson, a financial advisor and co-founder of Great Waters Financial in Minneapolis. \nBut the situation is far from hopeless. Here's what you can do. \n1) Get your budget in order  John Lamb | Photodisc | Getty Images Mapping your expenses will help you see where, and if, you have room to chip away at your debt, financial experts say.
