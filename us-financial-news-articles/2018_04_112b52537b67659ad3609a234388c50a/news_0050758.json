Photo: Alexa Vachon for The Wall Street Journal Christian Funke is looking past the rooftop pool of his Leipzig-area home toward Markkleeberger See, a deep freshwater lake that has become a magnet for new villa construction in the heart of former communist East Germany.\n“All this is brand new,” says the 39-year-old oil and gas entrepreneur and Leipzig native, whose career has taken him from a North Sea oil rig to the Persian Gulf and many places in between.\nBy “new,” he means homes like his: a white-and-gray geometric mansion completed in 2013. But he also means the lake itself. A generation ago, it was an open-pit coal mine. Now, after an environmental cleanup, the lake, south of the city, is a symbol of the good life and of a vibrant housing market.\nGermany’s Real-Estate Boom Pushes East Revitalized cities are drawing homeowners to luxury properties Luxury living is making headway in the heart of former East Germany. Leipzig, in the midst of a real-estate boom, has seen the price of single family homes increase more than 65% between 2012 and 2017. The surge follows a citywide facelift, bringing new life to imposing old structures, like the city’s main train station, above. Alexa Vachon for The Wall Street Journal 1 of 26 • • • • • Germany is in the midst of a full-fledged real-estate boom, according to the most recent Global Residential Cities Index, compiled by Knight Frank, the U.K.-based real-estate company. Berlin is the fastest-growing major market in the world, with prices jumping more than 20% in 2017. Meanwhile, Hamburg, Munich and Frankfurt place in the top 10, according to the report.\nThat rise is heading eastward, where luxury living is making headway in revitalized cities beyond Berlin, with a wave of recently constructed, high-end homes and renovations of existing mansions and manor houses.\nMr. Funke shares his 3,500-square-foot villa with his partner, tax professional Sandra Richter, 36, and their 7-year-old twins, Quentin and Mika. The home, on a 1/6-acre lot, makes up for the lack of a yard with built-in amenities, including an outdoor sauna and a rooftop patio surrounding a pool.\nStill, the couple has decided to trade in their prime setting for a larger local lot farther from the lake. Their home has an asking price of $2.6 million.\nSandra Richter with her sons, Mika, left, and Quentin, center.

The price of single-family homes surged more than 65% between 2012 and 2017, according to the city’s Gutachterausschuss, which tracks all real-estate transactions.\nIn Dresden, known for its concentration of prewar villas, sales of homes and apartments over $1.2 million have doubled in the past five years, according to an analysis by Von Poll Immobilien, the Frankfurt-based real-estate agency.\nMore From Mansion\nMaking Your Vacation Home Your Full-Time Home April 26, 2018 This May Be the World’s Most Organized Kitchen April 24, 2018 The Trophy Homes Linked to Chinese Conglomerate HNA Group April 18, 2018 The wider boom reflects an attempt to recapture pre-Communist splendor from the 19th and early 20th centuries, while incorporating efforts to break entirely with the past.\nLeipzig was the logistical and geographical heart of Imperial Germany. In the years before World War I, the city commissioned the country’s most imposing public buildings, including its largest train station and town hall.\nIn the decades since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, it has become a linchpin in the country’s high-speed train network and largely incorporated into Western Germany’s industrial network, with major production facilities for both Porsche and BMW .\nIn Radebeul, near Dresden, this 10-bedroom villa, built in 1908, has an asking price of $2.4 million. Berlin Sotheby’s International Realty is handling the sale. Photo: Berlin Sotheby Pre-WWI apartment buildings have been painstakingly restored, and rising prices mean even an ordinary home is approaching the $900,000 threshold, says Mr. Funke’s real-estate agent, Lukas Hoepke of Engel and Völkers. And in a turn that would have been unimaginable a few decades ago, many of the area’s most expensive villas cluster around Markkleeberger See.\nLeipzig and Dresden are in Saxony, once an independent state on the eastern edges of German-speaking Europe. Farther north, in the old Prussian heartland around Berlin, some noble manor houses survived both WWII and the Communist regime, and once again offer country-house living.\nIn Golssen, a village about halfway between Berlin and Dresden, a fully restored, early-20th-century manor house has come on the market. The 12,500-square-foot mansion on a 3.8-acre lot, is listed at $1.2 million.\nEven the grandest Prussian manor house can pale beside a hillside villa in Dresden, By the late 19th century, large, fanciful villas began to spring up on former wine terraces above the Elbe River.\nThe historic heart of Dresden was largely destroyed during Allied air raids in February 1945, but the villas outside the center often survived with little more than blown-out windows. Many villas that were later converted into apartment buildings under communism have reverted to single-family homes.\nThe most prized Dresden villas traditionally have been in Weisser Hirsch, a hilltop area that first gained cachet as a spa. Villas here were meant to recall Florentine palaces and Swiss mountain lodges. Closer to the center of the city, retired German entrepreneur Rolf Suplicki decided to create a contemporary villa in the so-called Prussian Quarter, a late-19th-century neighborhood that mixed army officers’ mansions with high-end, multifamily residences.\nRolf Suplicki, a retired German entrepreneur, has his Dresden villa on the market for $2.7 million. Photo: Alexa Vachon for The Wall Street Journal Mr. Suplicki, a West German who moved east in the early 1990s, and his wife, a professor, converted a two-family built in the 1930s in a villa style into a one-bedroom luxury home. They paid $737,000 for the property in 2005, then did an $800,000 gut renovation. Much of the ground floor is now a huge open-plan kitchen, and the second floor contains a master suite. The 3,350-square-foot home, on a landscaped 3/5-acre lot, has an asking price of $2.7 million.\n“Everything in this house happens in the kitchen,” says Mr. Suplicki, whose chief hobbies are cooking and opera. His kitchen includes a 10-foot granite island with a customized inlay of induction stovetops from Switzerland. His house is about a half-hour walk from Dresden’s historic Semperoper, which held world premieres of operas by Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. After selling, Mr. Suplicki and his wife plan to move even closer to the opera, into a new attic conversion atop a historic Dresden building.\nCustomized luxury is on the menu in Leipzig, too, where Swen Krüger, director of operations for an international logistics company, and his wife, Ivonne, who works for the city, commissioned a striking bungalow, completed in 2013. Working with Leipzig architects, Atelier ST, the couple spent $1.1 million to create a 2,100-square-foot, single-story structure of four overlapping rectangles. The two share the three-bedroom, two-bathroom home, which spreads fan-like around their 1/3-acre lot, with their two children, ages 9 and 5.\nJust before the collapse of communism in November 1989, Leipzig was known for its Monday demonstrations—weekly signs of public resistance now viewed as its death knell. Mr. Krüger, now 43, remembers attending as a teenager with his mother, marching in a crowd of hundreds of thousands.\nThe new Leipzig can be found in the Krügers’ driveway, where a Porsche Cayenne is set to be replaced by a new, electric-powered BMW i3. “That, too, is made in Leipzig,” says Mr. Krüger of the BMW.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-25T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-25T20:14:45.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
