His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\nLeoner Aguirre’s trial was the first to result from a gang takedown that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called an example of how authorities should tackle MS-13.\nRepublican U.S. President Donald Trump has called MS-13 “savage” and has tied efforts to fight the gang, whose members include Salvadoran immigrants, to his initiatives targeting illegal immigration.\nMS-13 started in Los Angeles in the 1980s. It has grown into an organization with leadership in El Salvador that the U.S. Justice Department says has 30,000 members worldwide and 10,000 in the United States.\nProsecutors said Leoner Aguirre encouraged members of an MS-13 clique known as Enfermos Criminal Salvatrucha to attack and kill rival gang members and commit robberies. Leoner Aguirre himself attempted to commit two murders, prosecutors said.\nLeoner Aguirre, who illegally immigrated from El Salvador in 2013, was at the time of his federal conviction already incarcerated based on state charges stemming from one of the two alleged attempted murders, an April 2014 shooting.\nA state court judge in August 2015 sentenced him to four to five years in prison after he was convicted of assault with intent to kill. Leoner Aguirre’s federal sentence will begin after he completes his state sentence.\nTo date, 40 other people charged alongside Leoner Aguirre have either pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Chris Reese\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-10T02:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-10T02:28:29.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
