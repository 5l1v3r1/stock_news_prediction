Bottles are not affected outside of North America . \n“The safety of our consumers is our top priority. While the number of potentially-affected glass bottles is very small, we are recalling these Stella Artois packages as a precautionary measure,” said Christina Choi, Global Brand VP of Stella Artois. “Our team of technical experts has been working with our third-party glass bottle supplier to ensure this packaging flaw has been addressed.” \nStella, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch , says it does not expect the recall to have a notable effect on earnings—as the total number of affected bottles are less than 1% of the glass bottles sold in North America annually. \nWondering how you can tell if your six- or 12-pack is affected?
