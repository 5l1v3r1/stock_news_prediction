But a surge in wages amid a tightening labour market and lower tax rates suggested the setback is temporary.\n(Graphic: Global currencies vs. dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh )\n“The GDP came in much stronger (than expected) but the employment cost index was also stronger and that is what caused some of the negative reaction because that just brings up the whole wage pressure and inflationary argument again, and what the Fed is going to do,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.\n(Graphic: Emerging markets in 2018 - tmsnrt.rs/2ihRugV )\nThe Federal Reserve is scheduled to hold a two-day meeting next week, with an announcement on U.S. monetary policy expected on May 2. Traders currently see only a 6.9 percent chance of a 0.25 percentage point interest rate hike, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 11.15 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,311.19, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 2.97 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,669.91 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 1.12 points, or 0.02 percent, to 7,119.80.\nFor the week, the Dow lost 0.62 percent, the S&P edged down 0.01 percent and the Nasdaq declined 0.37 percent.\n(Graphic: MSCI All Country World Index Market Cap - tmsnrt.rs/2EmTD6j ) Slideshow (4 Images)\nEuropean shares closed Friday’s session with a slight advance, lifted by results from Spanish banks and a bounce in technology shares to secure their fifth straight weekly climb.\nThe pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.24 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.33 percent.\nYields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury debt fell for a second straight day after hitting a four-year high this week.\nTen-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.9605 percent, from 2.99 percent late on Thursday.\nBut the margin between U.S. shorter-dated Treasury yields and longer-dated ones shrank on investors’ scepticism about the global economy even as the United States fared better than other nations in the first quarter.\nThe dollar held steady, on track for its strongest week since November 2016. The solid week has lifted the currency to its highest since Jan. 11.\nThe dollar index .DXY fell 0.03 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.2 percent to $1.2125.\nSterling slumped to its lowest since March 1 against the dollar. Data showed Britain’s economy slowed much more sharply than expected in the first quarter of 2018, slashing market expectations of a Bank of England rate hike in May.\nSterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3776, down 0.99 percent on the day.\nThe South Korean won strengthened after the leaders of North and South Korea pledged to work for the “complete denuclearization” of the Korean peninsula. But U.S. President Donald Trump said he would maintain pressure on Pyongyang ahead of his own meeting with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un. Last year North Korea launched intercontinental ballistic missiles on July 4 and 28 and Nov. 29.\n“You like the headlines, they look very good. You want that stuff to happen but until you really see it start to happen, the Korea stuff is a wait and see attitude,” said Polcari.\nThe won strengthened 0.89 percent versus the greenback at 1,069.00 per dollar.
