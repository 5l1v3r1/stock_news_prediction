It is known for its elephants, black rhinos and giraffes, among many other species.\nReporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Editing by George Obulutsa and Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-28T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T19:06:30.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
