Some of the rubbish had been lying there for over a year, local media reported. \nThe Greenpeace report said there were on average 4.3 pieces of plastic fragments found in each mullet and the majority of plastic came from single use items like plastic cutlery and condiment bags. \nGreenpeace urged the Hong Kong government to quicken legislation to restrict the use of single-use plastics and announce an overall plastic reduction target. \nHong Kong, a city of more than 7 million people, deposits around two thirds of its 5.6 million tonnes of annual waste in landfill, very little is recycled.
