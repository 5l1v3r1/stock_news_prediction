REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nThe sentence will be a bitter blow for Park, who returned to the presidential palace in 2012 as the country’s first woman leader, more than three decades after she left it following the assassination of her father. \nHer ouster from office last year led to a presidential election won by the liberal Moon Jae-in, whose conciliatory stand on North Korea has underpinned a significant warming of ties between the rival neighbors. \nMoon’s office said Park’s fate was “heartbreaking” not only for herself but for the country, and added that history that was not remembered would be repeated. \n“We will not forget today,” the office said. \nPark is the latest former leader of South Korea to run afoul of the law. \nTwo predecessors, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted in 1996 of mutiny, treason and corruption and sentenced to long prison terms but both received presidential pardons and were freed after a couple of years. \nBut Moon took office pledging to end the practice of pardoning public and corporate officials convicted of corruption. WATERSHED? \nPark’s friend, Choi, was convicted and jailed for 20 years after a separate trial in February. \nThe chairman of the Lotte Group, the country’s fifth-largest conglomerate, Shin Dong-bin, was jailed for two years and six months. \nSamsung Group heir Jay Y. Lee was jailed for a similar term on charges of bribery and embezzlement but in a surprise decision in February, an appeals court freed him after a year in detention. \nPark’s supporters and opponents reflect divisions in a society still haunted by Cold War antagonism. \nMost supporters are older conservatives who remember her father’s authoritarian 18-year rule, beginning in 1961, when their country began its remarkable surge toward becoming an economic power. \nYounger, liberal voters, who staged months of protests against Park before her ouster, will be hoping the verdict will be a watershed in efforts by the new government to end the self-serving collusion between political leaders and the powerful conglomerates known as chaebol.

If you have nothing to hide, whether about management or succession, you don’t have to be bullied by the government.” Reporting by Hyonhee Shin and Heekyong Yang;   Soyoung Kim and Christine Kim; Editing by Robert Birsel", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-06T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-06T09:31:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
