Samna identified the kidnapped man as Joerg Lange, a humanitarian worker. \nHe provided no further details. Germany’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment. \nJihadist groups, including some affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State, have repeatedly attacked military and civilian targets along the porous border between Mali and Niger. \nIslamic State’s affiliate in West Africa claimed responsibility for an attack last October near the border that killed four U.S. special forces and at least four Nigerien soldiers. \nWestern powers, including France and the United States, have thousands of troops in the semi-arid Sahel region to combat what they see as a growing Islamist militant threat and also support a task force of five regional armies.
