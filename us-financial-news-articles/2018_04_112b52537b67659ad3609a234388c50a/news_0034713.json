REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood \nThe new facility will replace cramped Benazir Bhutto International Airport, voted the worst airport in the world in 2014 by the “Guide to Sleeping in Airports” website. \nThe new Islamabad International Airport, 30 kilometres from the capital, will be capable of serving 9 million passengers per year and 50,000 metric tons of cargo. \nIt has been under construction for more than a decade, encountering repeated delays and missing deadlines for opening dating back to 2016. The May 3 opening date itself is a delay from the previous deadline of Friday.
