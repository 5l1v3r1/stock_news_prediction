Yet the downturn in its established venues adds to pressures on Rank, whose Chief Executive Henry Birch resigned in March to take over the top job at online retailer Shop Direct.\nIt said it was putting in place measures to improve Grosvenor’s performance over the medium to long term but gave not details.\nIn 2016 Rank tied up with online gaming firm 888 Holdings to bid for William Hill in a cash-and-stock deal to create Britain’s largest multi-channel gambling operator by revenue, but the proposal was spurned by the target.
