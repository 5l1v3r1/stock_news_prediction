Across all Canadian issues there were three new 52-week highs and 33 new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Eldorado Gold , which rose 9.7 percent, after an arbitration panel in Greece gave a positive ruling to build a metallurgy plant to process concentrate mined from Skouries and Olympias. \n* The biggest decliner was First Quantum Minerals, down 4.5 percent. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc, Aurora Cannabis, and Wallbridge Min. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 19.12 million shares, while the total volume on Wednesday was 34.85 million shares.
