I hit some great shots and made some great putts. That’s what you’ve got to do around here. Very, very pleased with the way I finished today. \n“I really put my head down,” added Finau, whose closing rush lifted him to a seven-under 281 total. \nFinau said he had no regrets about the week. \n“The hole-in-one was spectacular, following up by the most embarrassing (moment) in my life. But it is what it is. I’ve got a lot of cool coverage from it,” he said. \n“The reach from what happened to me was pretty incredible. I wouldn’t change that. Yes, I was embarrassed, but hey, things happen. And obviously I was able to overcome it. \n“Who knows, if I’m healthy, if I played better, if I played worse. All I know is that I did my best for the circumstance that I had, and came out with a nice finish this week.” \nFinau, who had dislocated the ankle before popping it back in place during the Par-3 event, said it had been an unforgettable week. \n“To be on the back nine at Augusta on a Sunday, to be playing some good golf, it doesn’t get much better,” he said. \n“One of the highlights of my golfing career thus far has been this week. The adversity I was faced with on Wednesday, and now the way I finished today, you know, you can’t make this stuff up.” (Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-09T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T04:19:02.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
