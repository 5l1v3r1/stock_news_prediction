But I was craving something I could just sit down and watch,” he said. \nSnyder’s 22-minute film also focuses on healing rather than the shooters or the polarizing issues of gun control. \n“Notes from Dunblane” looks at the relationship between two Catholic priests in Newtown, Connecticut, and Dunblane, Scotland, over eerily similar shootings in elementary schools in both small towns in 2012 and 1996 respectively. \nNewtown’s Father Bob Weiss and Dunblane’s Father Basil O’Sullivan began writing to each other after the Newtown school shooting, sharing their struggles to explain and comfort the families of the children shot dead, many whom they also buried. \n“It really points to the epidemic of how many communities are now connected over this issue and how many people can name people they know who are affected by gun violence,” said Snyder. \nSnyder and McGrath hope their films will be shown at churches, schools, colleges and community centers and be available to all of those who struggle to get their lives back together. \nSnyder said that in making the film she came to understand “this need to reach out to those who have walked in these shoes that no-one can imagine (and) the impetus for them to help the next ones, to pay it forward.” \nReporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-23T15:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-23T15:25:34.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
