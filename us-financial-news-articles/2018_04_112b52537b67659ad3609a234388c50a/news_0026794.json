REUTERS/Mark Makela \nThe announcement from world’s biggest coffee company comes as it tries to cool tensions after the arrest of two black men at one of its Philadelphia cafes last week sparked accusations of racial profiling at the chain. \nProtesters have called for a boycott of the company, in what has become the biggest test yet for Chief Executive Kevin Johnson, who took the helm about a year ago.

REUTERS/Mark Makela \n“While this is not limited to Starbucks, we’re committed to being a part of the solution,” said Johnson, who has apologised for the “reprehensible” arrests of the two men and taken responsibility for the incident. \nAttorneys for the company said Johnson and the two men involved have “engaged in constructive discussions about this issue as well as what is happening in communities across the country.” \nWhile Starbucks has deftly navigated thorny issues such as gay marriage, gun control and Congressional gridlock, U.S. race relations have proven more challenging. \nIts 2015 “Race Together” campaign to foster a conversation on the topic following the high-profile police shootings of several unarmed black men stirred an intense social media backlash. \nStarbucks shares were up 0.6 percent at $59.81 in afternoon trading.
