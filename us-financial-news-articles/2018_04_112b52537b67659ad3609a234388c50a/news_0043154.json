Financial details were not disclosed.\nThe Irish company, which runs 110 stores plus websites in Britain and Ireland, plans to take on all the Toys ‘R’ Us units, staff and management in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\n“We are convinced that multi-channel toy retailing will develop positively and that we can successfully introduce and expand our brand in Europe,” co-founder Tony Smyth said.\nThe deal is subject to the approval of the U.S. court and relevant authorities, the statement said.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Ros Russell\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
