This was mainly due to population growth.\n- An estimated 25 million abortions (45 percent) each year were unsafe.\n- At least 22,800 women die from unsafe abortions each year. - The abortion rate has declined markedly in developed regions during the last 25 years. But the rate has remained roughly the same in developing regions.\n- Globally, a quarter of all pregnancies ended in abortion in 2010–2014.\n- The lowest rates were in Western Europe, North America and Northern Europe - 16, 17 and 18 women per 1,000 respectively.\n- Abortion rates are similar in countries where abortion is highly restricted and where it is broadly legal.\n- Most women who have an abortion do so because of an unintended pregnancy. An estimated 214 million women in developing regions have an unmet need for modern contraception.\n- In 2014, the annual estimated cost of providing post-abortion care in developing countries was $232 million. Projections suggest this would drop to $20 million if all abortions were provided safely.\nSources: The Guttmacher Institute, Reuters news agency, Thomson Reuters Foundation\nWriting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Claire Cozens.
