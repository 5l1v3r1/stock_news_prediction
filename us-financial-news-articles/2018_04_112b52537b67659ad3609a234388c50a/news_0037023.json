(NYSE:D), with SCE&G and its corporate parent, SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG), according to a new study done by one of the state's leading economists.\nThe benefits come from Dominion Energy's plan to provide direct cash payments and lower electric rates to SCE&G electric customers as well as the additional benefits created as the cash payments and customer savings work their way into the South Carolina economy.\nThe study was performed by Dr. Joseph C. \"Joey\" Von Nessen, a research economist in the Division of Research at the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina.\n\"The benefits of the Dominion Energy proposal go well beyond the immediate value of the $1.3 billion in cash payments to SCE&G electric customers,\" said Thomas F. Farrell, II, Dominion Energy chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"The payments and the extra money in customers' pockets from the lower rates will flow into the local economy in the form of billions of dollars in increased retail sales, new jobs, added wages and business investment.\"\nIn addition to the cash payments – equal to about $1,000 for the average SCE&G electric customer – Dominion Energy proposes to reduce electric rates by about 7 percent after the merger closing. It also would absorb $1.7 billion in costs for the abandoned V.C. Summer new nuclear project and purchase a natural gas-fired power station at no cost to customers.\nFarrell noted that some businesses would receive cash payments into the millions of dollars, providing funds for new capital investments. Non-profit organizations, government agencies and other electric customers also would benefit from the cash payments and lower rates.\nLabor income alone is expected to increase by approximately $4.6 billion for South Carolinians. This would be the result of customer savings being spent in the local economy, boosting overall demand, and creating \"additional employment opportunities associated with new contract labor, an increase in the number of hours for existing workers, and both temporary and permanent hires,\" the study found.\nDominion Energy previously identified more than $12 billion in customer benefits resulting from the cash payments, lower rates and reduced time customers would pay toward the abandoned nuclear project. The study takes into account that customers would then put much of the new money into the economy.\n\"This $18.7 billion total economic output estimate represents an economic multiplier or ripple effect of approximately 1.49,\" Dr. Von Nessen said. \"In other words, for every $100 that is provided to Dominion/SCANA customers in savings, it is estimated that a total of $149 in new economic activity will be generated across South Carolina.\"\nFive South Carolina counties could see economic benefits totaling more than $1 billion each. Charleston would see the greatest benefit, $4.9 billion. It is followed by Richland, $4.2 billion; Aiken, nearly $2 billion; Dorchester, $1.2 billion; and Beaufort, $1 billion. In all, the benefits would be seen in 24 counties in the state where SCE&G provides electric service. Benefits are based on the amount of electric sales in each county.\nEconomic Impact by County\nCounty\nAdded Economic Output\nCounty\nAdded Economic Output\nAbbeville\n$16,022,372\nFairfield\n$105,450,280\nAiken\n$1,966,540,844\nGreenwood\n$1,307,387\nAllendale\n$147,402,524\nHampton\n$166,372,956\nBamberg\n$63,546,375\nJasper\n$152,810,359\nBarnwell\n$177,095,282\nKershaw\n$5,626,104\nBeaufort\n$1,015,849,531\nLexington\n$2,553,974,972\nBerkeley\n$699,123,634\nMcCormick\n$29,512,198\nCalhoun\n$305,319,564\nNewberry\n$58,677,217\nCharleston\n$4,909,216,395\nOrangeburg\n$240,550,253\nColleton\n$258,009,612\nRichland\n$4,226,925,205\nDorchester\n$1,226,205,050\nSaluda\n$147,332,205\nEdgefield\n$214,637,699\nUnion\n$21,265,245\nDominion Energy and SCANA are in the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for the merger.
