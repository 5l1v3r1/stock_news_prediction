That has lifted the whole U.S. energy complex. [O/R]\n“We need well over $150 billion worth of investment in infrastructure in the United States to support the gas production that is coming online,” Hochstein said.\nShale oil producers, including those in the Permian Basin, “are reaching a point where they have to make a decision whether to restrain their production in oil because they don’t have the ability to evacuate their gas,” he said.\nThe problem is that the U.S. infrastructure was historically not built to handle shale oil and shale gas, which producers are able to ramp up quickly when prices rise, he said.\nThere has also been too little investment into liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, he said, which would provide an outlet for surplus gas.\nReporting by Sudarshan Varadhan and Florence Tan; Editing By Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-12T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T08:11:16.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
