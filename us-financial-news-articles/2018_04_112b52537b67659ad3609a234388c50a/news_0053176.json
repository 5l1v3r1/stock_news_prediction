Markets will be closed on Monday in Japan for a national holiday.\nFor the week, the Nikkei gained 1.4 percent and posted a fifth straight weekly gain, the longest winning streak since last fall. The index rose 4.7 percent for the month, the biggest monthly rise since last October.\nThe market has been supported by a weaker yen, earnings hopes and more recently on easing worries over a full-scale China-U.S. trade war.\nEarlier Friday, the Bank Of Japan kept policy steady but ditched a timeframe it had set for hitting an inflation target, in a surprise move analysts say is aimed at keeping market expectations for more stimulus in check.\nThe BOJ’s policy review had little sway on the stock market, but analysts say that investors are focused on the governor’s comments after the market close.\n“There are two ways to see this. Investors can expect easing to continue when there is no timeframe for an inflation target. But the market is also left wondered what the BOJ will do while other central banks around the world are tightening,” said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities.\n“The stock market has yet to digest the implication.”\nSemiconductor equipment maker Advantest and Kyocera , which makes electronic devices, jumped 14 percent and 13 percent, respectively, after forecasting strong profits this fiscal year. Kyocera also announced a share buyback plan.\nIn sharp contrast, industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp tumbled 9.3 percent after the company said it expects annual operating profit to fall 34 percent to 151.7 billion yen ($1.4 billion), citing trade friction and lean investment in technology.\nThe broader Topix advanced 0.3 percent to 1,777.23.
