FUJHY -0.30% said Friday its employees manipulated fuel economy figures on vehicles manufactured in Japan, expanding an inspection scandal that led the head of the company to resign his post.\nThe company said employees had changed fuel-economy data for an unknown number of vehicles, and that the misconduct may have begun as far back as 2002.\nSubaru said it examined available fuel economy test data from December 2012 to November 2017, and found 903 instances of data manipulation. The company also said employee interviews led the company to believe the practice went back farther but it could not confirm this.\nInspectors and foremen decided if fuel economy data should be changed, and issued orders to lower-level workers to change the readings, according to a brief report issued by Subaru Friday. Senior managers were not aware of the changes, according to the report.\nSubaru said it did not believe a recall was necessary, since its emissions standards are stricter than the relevant national rules. Exports to North America are not affected since the tests are conducted differently. The company is still examining whether exports to other locations might be affected by the data manipulation.\nThe disclosure is related to an admission in October that factory workers had improperly conducted quality inspection on production lines, resulting in a recall of 417,000 vehicles in Japan.\nPresident Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said in March he would step back from his role, but would retain his other title of chief executive officer. In Japan, the president is the most senior executive officer.\nMr. Yoshinaga has said that the scandal highlighted that Subaru was in need of a cultural overhaul, after discovering that workers ignored company procedures and that managers were not aware of the fact.\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-27T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-28T05:04:14.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
