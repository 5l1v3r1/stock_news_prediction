The value of those shares was unclear. \n“Immofinanz is starting a structured bidding process and invites investors to express their interest ... by 30 April 2018,” the company said. \nParties invited to the bidding process would get further information. The company gave no timetable for the process. \nThe disposal continues a welter of dealmaking in the Austrian property sector. \nU.S. real estate investment firm Starwood Capital Group on Wednesday launched bids for minority stakes in CA Immo and Immofinanz. \nHours after Starwood’s offers were published, Immofinanz said it had agreed to buy more than 29 percent of S Immo , the third property group on Austria’s blue-chip ATX share index. \nImmofinanz shares were up 0.4 percent, CA Immo stock was little changed and S Immo was down 2.9 percent by 1345 GMT. $1 = 0.8081 euros Reporting by Michael Shields; Editing by Francois Murphy and Elaine Hardcastle", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-19T17:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-19T17:45:23.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
