The company plans to double capacity at the smelter to 800,000 tonnes per year.\nThe smelter, run by Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper unit, is controlled by Vedanta Ltd, a majority-owned subsidiary of London-listed Vedanta Resources.\nThe unit is currently closed as part of a 15-day scheduled maintenance, which would likely to be extended, the company said on Tuesday.
