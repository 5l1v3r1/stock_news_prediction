(Photo: Mario Tama, Getty Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Citigroup reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations on Friday, as the company's results got a boost from lower corporate taxes and strong revenue from stock trading. Here is how the banking giant fared in the first quarter versus Wall Street expectations: Earnings: $1.68 per share vs. $1.61 expected by Thomson Reuters Revenue: $18.872 billion vs. $18.865 billion expected Net interest income: $11.17 billion vs. $11.26 billion forecast by StreetAccount Fixed income, currencies and commodities trading revenue: $3.4 billion vs. $3.68 billion expected Citigroup shares opened 1.4% higher on Friday. \"Our first quarter results demonstrate strength and balance across our franchise and position us well for the rest of the year,\" CEO Michael Corbat said in a release. \"During the quarter, we returned more than $3 billion in capital to common shareholders which helped drive a significant improvement in earnings per share.\" Citigroup's results also got a boost from lower taxes. Last quarter, Citigroup's effective tax rate fell to 24% from 31% in the first quarter of 2017. Revenue from Citigroup's fixed-income trading business fell 7% to $3.4 billion in the first quarter, but that was offset by a 38% hike in equity trading sales. Overall trading revenue grew by 3% in the first quarter to $5 billion. Citigroup said the sharp rise in stock trading revenue was a byproduct of increased market volatility in equity markets. The S&P 500 has posted 28 moves of at least 1%. The index posted just eight moves of that magnitude all of last year. The company also said its global consumer banking business saw a revenue increase of 7% to $8.4 billion amid \"growth across all regions.\" Revenue in North America rose 4% to $5.2 billion while Latin America sales gained 15% to $1.3 billion. However, Citigroup's net interest income and margin both fell just short of expectations. Net interest income totaled $11.17 billion for the first quarter, while net interest margin came in at 2.64%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T14:54:21.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
