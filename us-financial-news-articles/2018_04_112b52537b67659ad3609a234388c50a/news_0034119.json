One person was injured, media reports said.\nFlight 1380, a Boeing Co 737-300, was bound for Dallas Love Field in Texas from New York’s LaGuardia airport with 143 passengers and five crew on board, Southwest said in a statement. The airline did not immediately confirm engine damage.\n“All of a sudden, we heard this loud bang, rattling, it felt like one of the engines went out. The oxygen masks dropped,” the passenger, Kristopher Johnson told CNN. “It just shredded the left-side engine completely ... it was scary.”\nA spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment.\nReporting by Peter Szekely; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-18T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-18T18:07:39.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
