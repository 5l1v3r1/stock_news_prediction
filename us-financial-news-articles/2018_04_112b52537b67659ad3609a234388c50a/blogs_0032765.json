The project is expected to house up to 2 million people and contribute $30 billion to the economy annually, according to the Philippine newspaper the Inquirer. \nNew Clark City will be a “twin city” to Manila, says Heang Fine Wong CEO of Singapore-based urban planning company Surbana Jurong, linked to the capital via rail line and a new airport . “You’ll gradually see Manila becoming a different type of city, maybe more financial to support the New Clark City, and in New Clark City you’ll see new technology companies coming through,” he said. \nThe project will also focus on making sure that the new city is sustainable and resilient to natural disasters in an effort to avoid replicating Manila’s vulnerability to flooding and typhoon damage. \nFor more about urban design, watch Fortune’s video: \nDecentralizing the Philippines’ economy and shifting government ministries away from Manila is a key domestic policy plan of President Rodrigo Duterte, who in a speech last year warned that Manila, currently home to 13 million people, could become a “dead city” within 25 years. \nBut the future envisioned by the Philippines’ urban planners is far from a reality, with most of the planned projects still to be funded through public-private partnerships to alleviate the burden on Manila’s strained treasury. \nThe first phase is scheduled to launch in 2022.
