The network infrastructure like track is owned and managed by the government-owned Network Rail.\nThe Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, operated by British company Go-Ahead and France’s Keolis, was beset with delays, cancellations and strikes in 2016-17, prompting huge criticism from passengers and lawmakers.\nOn the East Coast line between London and Edinburgh, the government could end up taking over running services from Stagecoach after the UK transport company got its numbers wrong, forcing it to want to pull out early.\nThat particular franchise has already failed twice, in 2006 and again in 2009, when the government stepped in to run the line.\nIn a report, the PAC report criticises the DfT for being unrealistic on several fronts, awarding contracts to bidders who had over-promised and failing to recognise the impact of complicated rail upgrade projects.\nAnother problem was the small number of potential bidders for contracts, it added.\nThe idea that the franchising model is “broken” plays into the hands of the opposition Labour party who have pledged to nationalise industries like rail and water .\n“It is now clear that public ownership is the only sensible option for the future of rail,” said Andy McDonald, Labour transport spokesman.\nLast November, transport minister Chris Grayling proposed a shake-up of the franchise system, saying he was considering making some contracts smaller.\nThe next rail contract due to be awarded is for the South Eastern franchise, expected later this year.
