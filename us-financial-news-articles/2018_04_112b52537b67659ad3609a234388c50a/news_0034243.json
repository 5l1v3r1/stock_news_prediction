Trade sources said the fee was much higher than they had expected. \nThe move follows the launch of an anti-dumping investigation just over two months ago into imports of the ingredient used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu. \nThe government said it will issue a final ruling at a later date, but did not give a timeline. \nPrices of soymeal DSMcv1 and rapeseed meal CRSMcv1 used in animal feed jumped on the news as the move kindled concerns that China would also impose penalties on soybeans and other agricultural products from the United States as a trade spat escalates. \nThe government found the domestic industry was “substantially damaged” by U.S. sorghum imports that are being dumped into the country, it said.
