(NASDAQ: SHBI) reported net income of $4.058 million or $0.32 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $2.698 million or $0.21 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $2.800 million or $0.22 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017.\nWhen comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017, the main reason for the improved results was a decrease in the federal income tax rate of 35% to 21% which became effective on January 1, 2018. This lower enacted tax rate and the one-time adjustment for re-measurement of the net deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulted in a decrease in income tax expenses of $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2018. This reduction in income tax expense coupled with an increase of $590 thousand in noninterest income, was partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $830 thousand. When comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017, the primary reasons for the improved results were the previously mentioned decrease in federal income taxes, increases in net interest income of $2.4 million and noninterest income of $122 thousand, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expenses of $1.8 million.\n\"We are pleased to report financial results for the first quarter of 2018,\" said Lloyd L. \"Scott\" Beatty, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer. \"While earnings were below our expectations, we had an opportunity to remove a significant long-standing troubled debt from our books which resulted in a $379 thousand charge-off during the quarter. Excluding this charge off, the quarter was in-line with our target of $0.35 per share. Loan growth remained strong with $26.4 million added to the portfolio for the quarter, which translates to 9.7% annualized growth for 2018. We remain committed to positioning ourselves for growth and will continue to seek opportunities to improve earnings.\"\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets were $1.422 billion at March 31, 2018, a $27.7 million, or 2.0%, increase when compared to $1.394 billion at the end of 2017. The increase in total assets included increases in gross loans of $26.4 million and interest-bearing deposits with other banks of $19.0 million, offset by a decrease in cash and due from banks of $8.8 million and investment securities available for sale of $13.0 million which were used to fund loan growth for the quarter.\nTotal deposits decreased $25.7 million, or less than 2.1%, when compared to December 31, 2017. The decrease in total deposits was mainly due to a decrease in noninterest-bearing accounts of $4.5 million, checking accounts of $9.7 million and time deposits of $14.8 million, which were partially offset by an increase in money market and savings deposits of $3.3 million. Total stockholders' equity increased $1.2 million, or 0.8%, when compared to the end of 2017. At March 31, 2018, the ratio of total equity to total assets was 11.60% and the ratio of total tangible equity to total tangible assets was 9.55%.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 increased $254.7 million, or 21.8%, when compared to total assets at March 31, 2017. The primary factor contributing to the increase was the acquisition of three branches in the second quarter of 2017 which contributed $199.6 million of assets at March 31, 2018. Absent the branch acquisition, total assets have increased $55.1 million since March 31, 2017 which primarily resulted from an increase in gross loans of $110.0 million.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 increased $175.5 million, or 17.5%, when compared to March 31, 2017. The increase was the direct result of the deposits acquired in the branch purchase which had a balance of $193.0 million at March 31, 2018. Excluding the acquisition, deposits decreased $17.5 million.\nReview of Quarterly Financial Results\nNet interest income was $12.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $12.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $9.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net interest income when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was slightly lower by $40 thousand due to two fewer earnings days as well as increased interest expense on short-term borrowings of $213 thousand. This was partially offset by higher interest income of $135 thousand the result of higher yields on loans and taxable investment securities. The Company's net interest margin improved by 2 basis points to 3.83% over the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income when compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily the result of significant loan growth, with average loans increasing $225.4 million. The Company's net interest margin when compared to the first quarter of 2017 increased 12 basis points from 3.71%, the result of transitioning lower yielding assets to fund loan volume and higher yields on investment securities, partially offset by an increase in average short-term borrowings of $52.4 million which also reflected an increase of 135bps from fed rate increases.\nThe provision for credit losses was $489 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The comparable amounts were $545 thousand and $427 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The provision for credit losses slightly decreased in the first quarter of 2018 over the fourth quarter of 2017. The higher level of provision for credit losses when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to significant growth in the loan portfolio, offset by improving credit quality with decreases in total nonperforming assets of $2.6 million and troubled debt restructurings (\"TDRs\") of $3.1 million. Net charge-offs were $352 thousand for the first quarter of 2018, $59 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $226 thousand for the first quarter of 2017. The significant increase was primarily related to a TDR which required a charge-off of $379 thousand in which the underlying collateral was sold. This TDR was a long-standing problem credit with an approximate value of $3.1 million. The ratio of annualized net charge-offs to average loans was 0.13% for the first quarter of 2018, 0.02% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.10% for the first quarter of 2017. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was 0.89%, lower than the 1.00% at March 31, 2017 due primarily to acquired loans recorded at fair value that do not require an allowance for loan losses.\nNonperforming assets excluding accruing TDRs were $8.6 million at March 31, 2018, $7.4 million at December 31, 2017 and $11.2 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets including accruing TDRs at March 31, 2018 were $18.4 million, compared to $20.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $24.0 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in nonperforming loans when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to an increase in nonaccrual loans of $2.0 million and the decrease in TDRs were the result of the previously mentioned TDR which was removed in the current quarter. When comparing to the first quarter of 2017, the decreases in nonperforming assets and TDRs were the result of the continued work out efforts and charge-offs period over period. At March 31, 2018, the ratio of nonaccrual loans to total assets was 0.49%, compared to 0.36% and 0.75% at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. In addition, the ratio of accruing TDRs to total assets at March 31, 2018 was 0.68%, improving from 0.96% and 1.10% at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nTotal noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $590 thousand when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $122 thousand when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 was the result of higher insurance agency commissions, mainly from contingency payments which are typically received in the first quarter of each year and are based on the prior year's performance. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was due to increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $71 thousand, trust and investment fee income of $39 thousand, and other noninterest income of $137 thousand which consisted of other bank service charges of $109 thousand. These increases were partially offset by lower insurance agency commissions and contingencies of $125 thousand.\nTotal noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $830 thousand when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased $1.8 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase in noninterest expense compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to higher costs associated with employee benefits of $436 thousand, which included higher insurance premiums for group insurance and federal unemployment insurance which is usually paid in the first two quarters of the year.\nThe increase in noninterest expense from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to increases in salary and wages of $971 thousand, employee benefits of $277 thousand and other noninterest expenses of $472 thousand. These line items were impacted by the additional operation of four branches, three of which were acquired in the second quarter of 2017 and one newly opened branch in Onley, VA in the third quarter of 2017. Also impacting salary and wages were pay increases and bonuses implemented during the period on a higher employee base than a year ago. Employee benefits were mainly impacted by higher insurance premium costs for the current year. Other noninterest expenses increased due to operating expenses for the additional branches.\nShore Bancshares Information\nShore Bancshares, Inc. is a financial holding company headquartered in Easton, Maryland and is the largest independent bank holding company located on Maryland's Eastern Shore.
