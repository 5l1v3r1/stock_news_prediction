REUTERS/Michaela Rehle/File Photo \nLufthansa then said it has submitted a document setting out its ideas for a “new” Alitalia. “We can imagine further talks being held on this basis,” a spokesman said. \nAlitalia said it had received three bids. \nGermany-based Lufthansa had previously repeated that it would only be interested in a restructured Alitalia. \nEasyJet is teaming up with private equity firm Cerberus and Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) for its bid, Bloomberg reported, citing a source. Air France-KLM declined to comment and Cerberus was not immediately available for comment. \nAlitalia entered insolvency proceedings last year and the Italian government has since been seeking new investors. The sale process has been delayed as a result of last month’s elections.
