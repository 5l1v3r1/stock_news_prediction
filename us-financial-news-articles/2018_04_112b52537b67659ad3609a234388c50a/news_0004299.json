Built in 2001, the two-story, direct-entry, suburban-garden community offers residents high-quality amenities, including two swimming pools and tennis courts, all situated in a low-density setting on over 38 acres. The property, located at 2335 Broad Street in Durham, NC, is near major employment centers at Research Triangle Park, Duke University Health System and Duke University, and has direct access to the Durham Belt Line and ready transportation linkages to I-85 and the Durham Freeway. The property will be managed by Atlanta-based Pegasus Residential.\nThe joint venture will invest capital to upgrade interiors and amenities. Unit upgrades will include stainless steel appliances, washer and dryer installation, flooring upgrades and granite countertops in select units. Amenities will be enhanced by the addition of grilling stations, a fire pit and outdoor entertainment and seating areas.\n\"Our team is looking forward to executing our business plan,\" said Thomas Upson, Managing Director at McCann. \"We believe this property provides residents with a great living experience in close proximity to downtown without paying downtown Durham rates.\"\n\"We are excited to acquire another asset in the Durham market,\" said Matt Akin, President of McCann. \"Discovery on Broad fits our value-add strategy with near-term opportunities to significantly improve the overall positioning of the property, including upgrades to interior and common space amenities.
