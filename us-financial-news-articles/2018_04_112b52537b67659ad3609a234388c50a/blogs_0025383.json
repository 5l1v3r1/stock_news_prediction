The move provoked an outcry from marijuana friendly states, including Gardner's Colorado, in which the marijuana industry has flourished since 2000. \nAngry that Sessions had reneged on his pledge to leave marijuana states alone, Gardner promised to block all DOJ nominations, pending a resolution. \nSince then, he has held up about 20 Justice nominations, the Washington Post reported.\n\"Clearly, we've expressed our frustration with the delay with a lot of our nominees and feel that too often, senators hijack a nominee for a policy solution,\" White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told the Washington Post on Friday. \"So we're reluctant to reward that sort of behavior. But at the same time, we're anxious to get our team at the Department of Justice.\"\nTrump \"does respect Colorado's right to decide for themselves how to best approach this issue,\" Short added.\nGardner and other senators have been discussing legislation that would prevent federal government intervention in states that have legalized marijuana. Nothing has been finalized, according to Gardner's statement.\n\"My colleagues and I are continuing to work diligently on a bipartisan legislative solution that can pass Congress and head to the President's desk to deliver on his campaign position,\" Gardner said in a statement.\nThis move comes days after former Republican House Speaker John Boehner announced he would join the board of a medical marijuana holding company . Advocates have called this announcement a watershed moment for the marijuana industry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T21:45:59.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
