The purchase was announced on April 2.\n“The story here is it’s an orphaned business within GE, and equity sees the chance to refocus and realign it,” one of the sources said. “The business hasn’t kept up amid the pressures at GE.”\nThe financing includes a US$75m five-year revolving credit facility, a US$600m seven-year secured term loan with a first priority claim, and a US$175m eight-year secured term loan with a second priority claim, the sources said. The revolving credit will be undrawn at close.\nGoldman Sachs will lead the senior term loan alongside Barclays and Deutsche Bank, the sources said. The junior term loan will be privately placed with Canadian pension fund manager PSP Investments, they said. PSP is also participating in the revolving credit.\nPSP in 2015 launched a private debt platform, PSP Investments Holding USA LLC, which focuses on private placements and direct loans to leveraged borrowers. The fund, along with Ares Capital Management, provided a US$730m unsecured term loan in 2017 to KKR-owned US medical helicopter operator Air Medical Group Holdings to support its US$2.4bn purchase of ambulance services provider American Medical Response.\nSyndication of the new debt is expected in late May or early June following completion of audited carveout financials, the sources said.\nGoldman Sachs, Barclays and PSP declined to comment. Deutsche Bank and Veritas did not respond to requests for comment.\nVeritas is no stranger to the healthcare technology sector. The buyout shop acquired US healthcare data analytics company Verscend Technologies from Verisk Health for US$820m in 2016. It sold peer Truven Health Analytics, which it bought from Thomson Reuters for US$1.25bn in 2012, to IBM for US$2.6bn in 2016.\nThe deal will be marketed on adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of roughly US$135m, bringing the unit’s debt-to-Ebitda ratio to 4.4 times through the senior tranche and 5.74 times total, the sources said.\nEquity capitalization will total at least US$275m based on the US$1.05bn enterprise value. That amount does not account for financing fees and expenses or additional funds to add cash to the balance sheet that would push the equity amount higher, the sources said.\nThe acquisition is expected to close in third quarter of 2018.\nReporting by Andrew Berlin; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Jon Methven\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-13T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T20:44:48.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
