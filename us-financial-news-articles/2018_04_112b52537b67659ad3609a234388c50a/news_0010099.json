The Kingdom has plans in place to build up to 300 cinemas across the country over the next 12 years , announcing on Wednesday that AMC (amc) signed the first cinema operating license in the country. \nStarting with its first cinema, which will open in the capital Riyadh, AMC will show Black Panther from April 18. The choice is fitting, as the film has broke a series of historic boundaries itself. It had a record-breaking opening weekend , drew an unusually diverse audience , and broke $1 billion in sales in early March, becoming just the 16th film to ever reach that milestone. It has since become the tenth highest-grossing film in history , and it is the most-tweeted about film ever. \nAMC plans to open close to 40 cinemas across the country in the next five years.
