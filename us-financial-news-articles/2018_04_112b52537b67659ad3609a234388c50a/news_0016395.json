The right-hander was rewarded with his first major league win.\nMcCutchen finished with four RBIs for the Giants, who have won two in a row.\nBuster Posey had a homer for San Francisco while Panik had three hits and Austin Jackson two.\nThe Giants outhit the Dodgers 17-12.\nChase Utley homered for the Dodgers, who lost their fourth straight.\nBellinger, Forsythe, Utley and Corey Seager had two hits each for Los Angeles.\nAfter a season-opening, four-game series in which the losing team was shut out in every game, both clubs scored in multiple innings.\nThe Giants led three times — 1-0, 3-1 and 4-3 — only to be tied by the Dodgers each time.\nThe last time it occurred was in the seventh, when Utley homered off Giants reliever Sam Dyson for a 4-4 tie after the Giants had gone up one on Brandon Belt’s RBI double.\nPosey had a two-run homer for the Giants off Dodgers starter Rich Hill in the fourth inning for a 3-1 lead.\nBut Posey aided in the Dodgers’ rally in the sixth, allowing Seager to score and Forsythe to take third on a passed ball. Forsythe then scored the game-tying run on Enrique Hernandez’s infield out.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision.\nHill, who shut out the Giants for six innings in a 9-0 win last Sunday, allowed three runs and five hits in four innings. He walked two and struck out six.\nChris Stratton, the losing pitcher in Los Angeles last Sunday, gave up three runs, two of which were earned, in five innings. He allowed four hits and four walks and struck out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-08T12:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-09T17:10:09.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
