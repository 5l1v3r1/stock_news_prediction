REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo \nThe court of cassation, Egypt’s top court, rejected an appeal by Badie and others against verdicts issued against them last May in the case known in local media as “the Rabaa Operations Room” trial. \nThe case relates to a sit-in in Rabaa to support ousted President Mohamed Mursi who hailed from the Muslim Brotherhood. The sit-in, which began after the army ousted Mursi following mass protests against his rule, was forcibly dispersed by security forces, leaving hundreds dead. \nBadie and two others were sentenced to life imprisonment in the case, 15 others were sentenced to five years while 21 people were acquitted, sources said. \nThe defendants were charged with leading an illegally founded organisation, plotting to stir chaos and publishing false news among other crimes. \nAuthorities outlawed the Brotherhood after Mursi was ousted, and arrested thousands of its supporters. They also dissolved its Freedom and Justice Party, which Mursi led. \nDecisions made by the court of cassation are final and cannot be appealed. Saturday’s life sentence is the third against Badie.
