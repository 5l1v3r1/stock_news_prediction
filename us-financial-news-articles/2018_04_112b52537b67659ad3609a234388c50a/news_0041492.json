No arrests had been made yet related to Woodroffe’s death, he added.\n“We will not rest until both murders, of the indigenous woman as well as the Canadian man, are solved,” said Jimenez in a phone interview.\nJimenez said the man in the video was Woodroffe and that an autopsy of his body showed he died by strangulation after receiving several blows across his body.\nArevalo’s murder had prompted outrage in Peru following other unsolved murders of indigenous activists who had repeatedly faced death threats related to efforts to keep illegal loggers and oil palm growers off native lands.\nPolicing is scant over much of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon and villagers in far-flung provinces often punish suspected criminals according to local customs and without the involvement of state police and prosecutors.\n“Canada extends its deepest condolences following the reported assassination of‎ Olivia Arévalo Lomas, an Indigenous elder and human rights defender,” Global Affairs Canada, which manages Canadian foreign relations, said in a statement.\n“We are also aware that a Canadian ‎was killed in a related incident. Consular services are being provided to the family of the Canadian,” it added.\nReporting by Mitra Taj; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-22T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-22T20:31:25.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
