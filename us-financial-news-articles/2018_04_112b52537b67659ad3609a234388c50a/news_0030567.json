David Ige issued an emergency proclamation for the island where heavy rainfall damaged or flooded dozens of homes in Hanalei, Wainiha, Haena and Anahola.\nAbout 40 people — mostly tourists — were stranded Sunday at Hanalei Elementary School, where the American Red Cross had opened an evacuation shelter. They briefly ran out of food and water.\nCoralie Chun Matayoshi, chief executive officer of the Red Cross in Hawaii, said the county's Department of Parks and Recreation offered to deliver food to the evacuees by personal watercraft, but a nearby business was also dealing with flooding and unable to provide the supplies to be delivered. The Hawaii Guard offered to deliver food by air, but the weather kept the helicopters grounded.\nOfficials will continue rescue efforts when the weather improves.\nThe Kauai Fire Department was coordinating with the Coast Guard and the Honolulu Fire Department to provide air and search and rescue operations on the North Shore.\nThe National Weather Service recorded almost 27 inches (68 centimeters) of rainfall in a 24-hour period in Hanalei.\nKauai County spokeswoman Sarah Blane said county officials had to call in off-duty firefighters, police officers and lifeguards Saturday night to rescue about a half-dozen people who were trapped by rising floodwaters in Hanalei.\nThe American Red Cross opened evacuation shelters at Kapaa Middle School, the Church of the Pacific in Princeville and at the elementary school.\nThere were no immediate reports of injuries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-04-16T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-16T19:38:16.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
