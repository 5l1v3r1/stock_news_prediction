Combined with the agreement to acquire CryptoGlobal, that puts HyperBlock one step close to its goal of building a diversified crypto company in North America, he said. \nCryptoGlobal currently focuses on mining bitcoin, dash, ether and litecoin. \nThe mining of crypto-currencies is a process in which a global network of computers competes to solve complex algorithms. Those who are able to solve the mathematical problems are rewarded with new bitcoins. \n“Combining HyperBlock’s large-scale mining-as-a-service model with CryptoGlobal’s existing mining, custodial storage, and crypto trading businesses creates a strong foundation for both organic growth and growth through acquisition,” Walsh said. \nUnder the purchase agreement, HyperBlock said in a statement that the deal values CryptoGlobal common shares at 74 Canadian cents each, which represents a 48 percent premium to the closing price of CryptoGlobal’s stock on March 29. \nHyperBlock said the acquisition is expected to add to its cash flow over the next 12 months. \nHyperBlock expects to issue up to approximately 60.4 million common shares to CryptoGlobal shareholders in connection with the purchase. Upon closing of the transaction, CryptoGlobal shareholders will own about 25.2 percent of the combined company. \nHyperBlock said it will apply to be listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange upon completion of the acquisition, which is expected to occur at the end of May. \nWalsh will be CEO of the new company, with CryptoGlobal co-founders Rob Segal and James Millership and Blockchain Dynamics founder Chris McGarrigle joining him to lead the company, HyperBlock said. Segal will also join HyperBlock’s board of directors.
