On an annual basis, prices were up just 2.6 percent, the smallest 12-month increase since June 2016.\nThe major city of Toronto saw the biggest monthly decline, down 0.6 percent in its largest drop since February 2010, as builders cited unfavorable market conditions.\nThe Bank of Canada has raised interest rates three times since last July after years of low borrowing costs helped fuel Canada’s housing market.\nTighter mortgage rules that came into effect at the start of 2018 have hit homebuyers, while Toronto has continued to feel the effect of provincial government measures taken last year to rein in surging prices.\nPrices were unchanged in Vancouver, Canada’s most expensive housing market. Overall, seven out of 27 of the cities surveyed saw prices fall. The new housing price index excludes apartments and condominiums.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-13T18:01:44.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
