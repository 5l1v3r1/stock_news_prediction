The overall sales increase for the quarter reflects a 15.3% increase from acquisition-related volume and favorable foreign currency translation of 0.8%. Excluding these factors, organic growth was up 6.7% in the quarter, which was partially offset by a 1.0% impact from one-half less sales day in the quarter. Net income for the quarter increased 24.1% to $36.6 million from $29.5 million, and earnings per share rose 24.0% to $0.93 per share, compared with $0.75 per share in the prior year quarter. EBITDA for the quarter of $72.2 million increased 30.3% versus the prior year quarter.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net sales were $2.18 billion, an increase of 13.8% compared with $1.91 billion in the same period last year. Net income increased to $101.3 million from $80.9 million, and earnings per share increased 25.2% to $2.58 per share from $2.06 per share, last year.\nCommenting on the results, Applied’s President & Chief Executive Officer Neil A. Schrimsher said, “Our solid third quarter results reflect broad-based execution across our business groups, along with the expected two-month contributions from the recent acquisition of FCX Performance. We are excited about the significant opportunities for growth and our expanding value-added capabilities that further enhance our differentiation and provide benefits for all Applied stakeholders.”\nOutlook\nMr. Schrimsher added, “Given our performance year to date, and continued favorable industrial markets, we are raising our full-year earnings per share guidance to a range between $3.51 and $3.61 per share, on sales which are anticipated to be 17.5% to 18.5% higher year over year.” Updated EPS guidance includes ($0.03) to ($0.07) net impact of the FCX Performance acquisition, inclusive of the ($0.12) one-time transaction-related expense.\nDividend\nToday the Company also announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, payable on May 31, 2018, to shareholders of record on May 15, 2018.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Fiscal year to date, the Company has purchased 393,300 shares for a total of $22.8 million. At March 31, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization to purchase 1,056,700 additional shares.\nConference Call Information\nApplied will host its quarterly conference call for investors and analysts at 10 a.m. ET on April 26.

An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method can only be made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. Accordingly, interim LIFO calculations are based on management's estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs and are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory determination.\n(2) During fiscal 2018, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. As a result of this adoption, the condensed statement of consolidated income for the three months and nine months ended March 31, 2017 has been restated resulting in a decrease in selling, distribution and administrative expenses and increasing other (income) expense, net of $0.2 million and $0.6 million respectively; resulting in an increase to operating income for the same amount.\n(3) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in the U.S., making significant changes to U.S. tax law. In the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company revised its estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect the change in the federal statutory rate to a blended statutory rate for the annual period of 28.1%. We recognized a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax of $3.9 million, which is included as a component of income tax expense in the condensed statements of consolidated income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. We also remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the current fiscal year and the future. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was not material to the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.\n(4) On January 31, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition via merger of all of the outstanding shares of FCX Performance, Inc. (“FCX”), a Columbus, Ohio based distributor of specialty process flow control products and services. FCX operates 68 locations with approximately 1,000 employees. The total consideration transferred for the acquisition was approximately $784 million, which was financed by cash-on-hand and a new credit facility comprised of a $780 million Term Loan A and $250 million revolver (the “Credit Facility”), effective with the transaction closing. This Credit Facility was used to finance the transaction, as well as to repay the Company's existing term loan outstanding prior to the acquisition date.\nAPPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

EBITDA excludes items that may not be indicative of core operating results. The company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides meaningful information to assist shareholders in understanding financial results, assessing prospects for future performance, and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported results. This non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of operations that, when viewed with GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of the business. The company strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review company financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe reconciliation provided above reconciles EBITDA , a non-GAAP financial measure, with net income, a GAAP financial measure.\nSource:Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Tsfrd2V-6aP8okHjEA1GL75MORUJFZcZ3Mx2nW9Zl0ivomdjNjKsJ65iztrUAhf6e2GEEOK1aVdb1FXwjzXRSg==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d2e166c4-98da-433c-9e30-caa7234fa47a", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Tsfrd2V-6aP8okHjEA1GL34CSKhvm0TTBNiK2edvsZt5O9ICCWaKKxqbVxjtSiGaT1uxzwJe2C9xiCtoXmOFxA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Tsfrd2V-6aP8okHjEA1GL9oSh2cO3DrpDh3HoDQIrg1FXWn6VKz0vejhLg-HocbVl7N9bJReWPlccAeRXPIdVg=="], "published": "2018-04-26T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-26T14:11:57.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
