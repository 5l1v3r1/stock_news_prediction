As a result, the Insurance, HR and e-services division continued to post robust growth in the first quarter of 2018, while Healthcare professionals division revenues fell ahead of new product launches in the UK and US.\nAs a reminder, the Group's first-quarter and third-quarter revenue figures are typically slightly lower than what it generates in the second quarter and especially the fourth quarter.\nRevenue trends by division\nFirst quarter 2018\nFirst quarter In € million 2018 2017 Chg. L-f-l Chg. Reported Health insurance, HR and e-services 72.9 68.6 +6.4% +6.3% Healthcare professionals 38.0 40.3 (3.5)% (5.7)% Corporate and others 1.0 1.1 (6.5)% (6.5)% Cegedim 111.9 110.0 +2.6% +1.8% In the first quarter of 2018, Cegedim posted consolidated revenues from continuing activities of €111.9 million, up 1.8% on a reported basis. Excluding an unfavorable currency translation effect of 0.8%, revenues rose 2.6%. There was virtually no impact from acquisitions or disposals in this quarter.\nThe unfavorable currency translation effect of €0.9 million, or 0.8%, was chiefly due to the €0.5 million negative impact of the US dollar, which represents 2.6% of Group revenues, and the €0.3 million negative impact of the pound sterling, which represents 9.8% of revenues.\nIn like-for-like terms, Health insurance, HR and e-services division revenues rose by 6.4%, and Healthcare professionals division revenues declined by 3.5%.\nAnalysis of business trends by division\nHealth insurance, HR and e-services\nThe division's Q1 2018 revenues came to €72.9 million, up 6.3% on a reported basis. Currency translation had a negative impact of 0.1%. There were no acquisitions or divestments. Like-for-like revenues rose 6.4% over the period.\nThe Health insurance, HR and e-services division represented 65.1% of consolidated revenues, compared with 62.4% over the same period a year earlier.\nThe businesses that made the biggest contributions to growth were Cegedim SRH (HR management solutions), Cegedim e-business (digitalization and data exchange), sales statistics for pharmaceutical products, and the computerization of health insurance companies in the UK. This performance was partially offset by the impact of switching the health insurance company computerization activity over to a SaaS model in France, and by the timing of C-MEDIA campaigns (ad space in pharmacies and health & wellness shops).\nHealthcare professionals\nThe division's Q1 2018 revenues came to €38.0 million, down 5.7% on a reported basis. Currency translation had a negative impact of 2.1%. There was virtually no impact from acquisitions or divestments. Like-for-like revenues fell 3.5% over the period.\nThe Healthcare professionals division represented 34.0% of consolidated revenues from continuing activities, compared with 36.7% over the same period a year earlier.\nThe division was negatively affected by doctor computerization activities in the UK, the US and Spain ahead of new product launches. This impact was partly offset by computerization activities for doctors and allied health professionals in France. The stability of the pharmacy computerization business in France is particularly noteworthy.\nCorporate and others\nThe division's Q1 2018 revenues came to €1.0 million, down 6.5% on a reported basis and like for like. There was no currency impact and no acquisitions or divestments.\nThe Corporate and others division represented 0.9% of consolidated revenues from continuing activities compared with 1.0% over the same period a year earlier\nHighlights\nApart from the items cited below, to the best of the company's knowledge, there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group's financial situation.\nSale of Cegedim shares held by Bpifrance\nBpifrance Participations sold 1,682,146 Cegedim shares via an accelerated bookbuilding process to French and international institutional investors at a price of €35 per share on February 13, 2018. In the context of the transaction, the shareholders' agreement dated October 28, 2009, between Mr. Jean-Claude Labrune, FCB (the family holding company controlled by Mr. Labrune), and Bpifrance - as well as the concert between the parties - has been terminated. Following the sale, Cegedim's free float increased to 44% of capital (vs. 32% before the transaction).\nCompleted disposal of the Cegelease and Eurofarmat\nOn February 28, 2018, Cegedim announced that it had completed the disposal of Cegelease and Eurofarmat to FRANFINANCE of the Société Générale Group for an amount of €57.5 million plus reimbursement of the shareholder's loan account, which amounted to €13 million. Of this amount, Cegedim used €30 million to pay down its debt.\nThe parties have decided that Cegelease and the Cegedim Group will continue to collaborate in France under their current terms as part of a six-year collaboration agreement.\nAcquisition of Rue de la Paye in France\nOn March 30, 2018, Cegedim acquired French company Rue de la Paye via its Cegedim SRH subsidiary. The deal will enable the Group to market digital payroll solutions to 2 million SMEs and small businesses in France, including - importantly - thousands of healthcare professionals that are already Cegedim Group clients.\nRue de la Paye's 2017 revenues were equivalent to around 1% of Group 2017 revenues, and it earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group's consolidation scope in April 2018.\nTax\nOn February 21, 2018, Cegedim S.A. received notice that French tax authorities would perform an audit of its accounts covering the period January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016.\nSignificant post-closing transactions and events\nTo the best of the company's knowledge, there were no events or changes after the accounts were closed that would materially alter the Group's financial situation.\nOutlook\nCautiously optimistic for 2018\nBuilding on the efforts that it executed with success in 2017, Cegedim continues to pursue its strategy of focusing on organic growth, fueled by a policy of sustained innovation.\nFor 2018 the Group targets a moderate organic revenue and EBITDA margin growth. The Group does not issuing any earnings estimates or forecasts.\nPotential impact of Brexit\nIn 2017, the UK accounted for 10.9% of consolidated Group revenues from continuing activities and 14.0% of consolidated Group EBIT.\nCegedim deals in local currency in the UK, as it does in every country where it is present. Thus, Brexit is unlikely to have a material impact on Group EBIT.\nWith regard to healthcare policy, the Group has not identified any major European programs at work in the UK and expects UK policy to be only marginally affected by Brexit.\nThe figures cited above include guidance on Cegedim's future financial performances. This forward-looking information is based on the opinions and assumptions of the Group's senior management at the time this press release is issued and naturally entails risks and uncertainty.

The deal was finalized on February 28, 2018. As a result, the consolidated 2017 and Q1 2018 financial statements are presented according to IFRS 5, \"Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued\". IFRS 5 governs the accounting treatment for non-current assets held for sale.\nIn practice, their contribution to each line of Cegedim's consolidated income statement (before minority interests) is combined into the \"Net profit from activities sold or held for sale\" line, and the group share of their net profit is excluded from Cegedim's adjusted net profit. Earlier periods have also been restated so that the information presented is comparable.\nThe table below shows the impact of the restatement:\nin € thousands Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Change Revenue from continuing activities 111,941 109,989 +1.8% Revenue from assets held for sale 2,211 3,926 (43.7)% IFRS 5 restatement (182) (209) (13.2)% Group revenues 113,970 113,705 +0.2% Glossary\nBPO (Business Process Outsourcing): BPO is the contracting of non-core business activities and functions to a third-party provider.

This is reflected in the Group's revamped business model.

The term \"at constant exchange rate\" covers the fluctuation resulting from applying the exchange rates for the preceding period to the current fiscal year, all other factors remaining equal.\nRevenue on a like-for-like basis: The effect of changes in scope is corrected by restating the sales for the previous period as follows:\nby removing the portion of sales originating in the entity or the rights acquired for a period identical to the period during which they were held to the current period; similarly, when an entity is transferred, the sales for the portion in question in the previous period are eliminated.

EBIT corresponds to net revenue minus operating expenses (such as salaries, social charges, materials, energy, research, services, external services, advertising, etc.).
