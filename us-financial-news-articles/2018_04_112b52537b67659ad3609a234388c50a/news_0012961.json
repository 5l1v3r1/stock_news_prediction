It was little changed on Friday.\nFinancials and materials were the biggest weights on the benchmark with mining major BHP the main index’s biggest drag, down as much as 0.9 percent. Rival Rio Tinto lost as much as 1.3 percent to touch its lowest since Dec. 20.\nAmong financials, National Australia Bank and fellow lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd were down 0.6 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, as the sector index slipped 0.2 percent.\nOn Monday, mining infrastructure group Mineral Resources Ltd said it agreed to buy iron ore miner Atlas Iron via a scheme of arrangement, valuing Atlas at $215.2 million.\nAfter the deal was announced, Atlas Iron’s shares zoomed as much as 47.4 percent higher while those of Mineral Resources lost as much as 4.2 percent.\n“There is also a bid on the table for Santos, Beach Petroleum also under bid, so this is something we are certainly looking out for in current markets...it does show potential for improved valuation,” said CMC Markets’ McCarthy.\nMcCarthy added that Atlas’ small market cap meant the deal was not a significant play overall but added to the resource sector theme of smaller companies being vulnerable to takeovers.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.1 percent, or 5.83 points, to 8,387.44, hurt by weakness in consumer staples and utilities.\na2 Milk Company Ltd lost as much as 3.4 percent while Contact Energy Ltd was up to 0.8 percent lower.
