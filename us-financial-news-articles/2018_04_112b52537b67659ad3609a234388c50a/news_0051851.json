Total copper output fell to 18,862 ounces from 22,074 ounces a year ago. The company cut full-year guidance for copper to 70,000-75,000 tonnes from 80,000-90,000 tonnes expected earlier.\nNewcrest’s cost of gold production for the March quarter was $826 per ounce compared with $713 per ounce a year ago, on an all-in sustaining basis.
