Koza Ltd has the option to acquire 80 percent of the joint venture for a $1.95 million spend.\nKoza Ltd and GreenOre, which also has a project in Aberdeenshire in Scotland, entered into a joint venture agreement in 2017 on GreenOre’s wholly owned Ayrshire project, in southwest Scotland, and began drilling in the same year.\nThe plan now is to work on establishing the extent of the reserve after the 2017 drilling intersected “significant gold grades”, Koza Ltd said.\nThe Istanbul-listed parent of Koza Ltd is in a legal battle to eject Ipek and get the subsidiary’s assets, drained by protracted litigation, back under its control.\nKoza Altin is one of hundreds of companies seized by the Turkish authorities and is now managed by the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund. It was placed in receivership in October 2015 for alleged links to Gulen.
