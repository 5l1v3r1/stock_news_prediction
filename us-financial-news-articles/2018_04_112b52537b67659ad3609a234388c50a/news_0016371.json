The United States on Friday imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington's most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities. Shares of United Company Rusal Plc fell 40 percent in Hong Kong on Monday after it was included in the new list. \"Market concerns have that the sanction against Rusal and its own technical default assessment may lead to supply shortage in both aluminium and alumina,\" said Hong Kong broker Argonaut in a report. Rusal produced some 3.7 million tonnes of aluminium in 2017, about 7 percent of the world's total, Argonaut said. Its annual alumina production of 11.5 million tonnes was also about 7 percent of the global total, while it produced about 4 percent of the world's bauxite, the broker said. \"It is expected that (the aluminium price rise) will extend further,\" Argonaut said.
