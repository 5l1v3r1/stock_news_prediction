REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Blackstone has agreed to buy 16.65 percent of Hispania at 17.45 euros per share for a total of 315.4 million euros from funds QP Capital Holdings Ltd and QPB Holdings Ltd, Alzette said in a statement to the market regulator.\nBoth funds are run by billionaire investor and activist George Soros.\nIt will make a full-takeover bid at the same price, conditional on holders of 50 percent plus one Hispania share accepting the deal.\nHispania shares stood at 18.5 euros per share before trading was suspended late on Wednesday. At 0708 GMT, Hispania traded down 6.4 percent.\nThe offer is the latest in a string of Spanish investments by Blackstone, including the acquisition of HI Partners from Banco Sabadell ( SABE.MC ) and portfolios from Banco Popular.\nAround three quarters of Hispania’s business is in hotels and tourism.\n“This operation makes sense given the Hispania portfolio is up for sale ... and Blackstone has carried out similar operations in Spain recently,” Sabadell said in an investors note.\nReporting by Paul Day.
