Bernstein \nThey court documents also show that Mueller is specifically authorized to investigate Manafort’s ties to Ukraine’s former pro-Russia government. \nThe documents were filed in response to a motion by Manafort challenging Mueller’s authority to prosecute him. \nManafort does not currently face charges related to the 2016 presidential election or Russian interference. But he is charged with bank fraud, filing false tax returns, conspiring against the United States by plotting to launder money and failing to register as a foreign agent when he lobbied for the former Ukraine government.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nHis court action sought to have those charges dismissed, arguing that Mueller lacked the authority to investigate his dealings with Ukraine. \nNo one on either side of the case was available for comment early Tuesday. \nTrump has frequently declared no collusion occurred between his campaign and Russia.
