In August, the U.S. Treasury Department put him on a list of sanctioned Russian state-owned companies and so-called “oligarchs”, identified as close to President Vladimir Putin.\nAgents acting on behalf of the British courts petitioned the DIFC Courts to take control of the yacht, Dubai newspaper Gulf News reported, as parties working for Akhmedova had been searching for her husband’s assets globally so she could get payments as part of the settlement.\nReporting by Saeed Azhar; additional reporting by Kirsten Ridley in London; Editing by Noah Browning/Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-12T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-12T14:14:50.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
