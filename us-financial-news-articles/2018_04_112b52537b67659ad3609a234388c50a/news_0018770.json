That is the prerogative of parliamentarians and therefore, the rest who are speaking, are just making noises that will change nothing,” Njomo was quoted as saying. \nFinance Minister Henry Rotich downplayed Thursday’s exchange in parliament, saying the Treasury would present a new bill to lawmakers in June to remove the rate cap but still ensure lending rates are not too high. \n“I don’t think I would go by the discussions of yesterday... it is premature to conclude that parliament will not consider,” he told reporters on Friday. \n“We are going to propose a new bill which deals with credit management in this country.” \nHe said the new bill would deal with issues of consumer protection, access to credit by small businesses and the conduct of lenders. \nAsked if the bill would translate into consumers paying more for loans, Rotich said it would not; “We can’t introduce a bill that will worsen (things)... interest rates will come down.” \nThe cap had been a cosmetic solution that did not deal with the root causes of the high lending rates, leading to the unintended consequences like small firms being locked out of the credit market by lenders who say they cannot price risk properly while the cap is in place. \nThe government had said when it introduced the policy that banks were reaping high returns without benefiting customers. \nBut the central bank, bankers and economists have said the policy would stifle the lending needed to spur on the economy. \nWith the International Monetary Fund putting pressure on Kenya to drop or modify the lending cap, Finance Minister Henry Rotich said in March that it was unsustainable and the government was planning modifications.
