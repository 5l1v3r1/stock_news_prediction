The goal is to start operating them, with limited capabilities, in 2040.\nThe move to develop a new warplane is seen as a preliminary step towards overcoming differences that have left Europe struggling to maintain three competing fighter programmes - France’s Rafale, the Eurofighter - representing Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain - and Sweden’s Gripen.\nMerkel and Emmanuel Macron first unveiled plans for the new programme shortly after the French President’s election in May in a significant gesture designed to give fresh impetus to Franco-German relations in the aftermath of Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. Most defence experts believe the UK will eventually be invited to join the programme.\nThe statement of political intent is expected to be followed by an industrial declaration that sets out in greater detail how the partners, notably Dassault and Airbus, Germany’s defence aeronautics champion and a Eurofighter consortium member, will approach the multibillion-euro project.\nDassault Aviation has made a strong pitch to be the senior partner.\nFrance was originally part of the European Eurofighter consortium that includes Britain, Germany and Italy, but opted in the 1980s to develop its own independent Dassault-built Rafale fighter, partly in order to guarantee high-value work for its state-owned engine maker, now part of Safran.\nAirbus and Dassault declined comment ahead of the air show.\nGermany and France also plan sign a document at the air show in which they agree to explore the joint development of a new maritime surveillance aircraft, with a goal of making it operational by 2035, the German military sources said.\nThat programme, to be focused on anti-submarine warfare, surveillance and support, will be opened in the longer term to other countries in the European Union, NATO and elsewhere, the sources said.
