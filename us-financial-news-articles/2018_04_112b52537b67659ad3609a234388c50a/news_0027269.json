REUTERS/Peter Jones Lawyers representing a group of Tim Hortons franchisees sent a letter to Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains earlier this month alleging Restaurant Brands has not lived up to commitments including maintaining the rent and royalty structure of Canadian franchises.\nThe terms were part of the previous Conservative government’s agreement to clear the takeover of Tim Hortons, which is considered a Canadian icon.\nThe letter dated April 3 said franchisees are concerned Restaurant Brands is trying to increase its margins at their expense.\n“‎The Minister is aware of the concerns raised by the franchisees and looking into them,” said Bains’s spokesman Karl Sasseville. “We are monitoring compliance with the undertakings, as we do with all investments.”\nRestaurant Brands was formed in 2014 when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Tim Hortons. The company also owns Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen.\nPatrick McGrade, Tim Hortons spokesman, said the company has been told there is no investigation underway.\n“Every year we have reported to the government on meeting our undertakings, without complaint. We have always been and remain committed to doing good business in Canada,” McGrade said.\nThe relationship between Tim Hortons and its franchisees has become increasingly contentious.\nTim Hortons has also been dealing with the fallout of bad publicity from its reaction to minimum wage increases in the country. Many Tim Hortons franchises cut back on employee perks and benefits when the province of Ontario raised minimum wages by 21 percent to C$14 ($11.11).\nBy Friday afternoon, the stock was down 1.3 percent, while the benchmark Canada share index .GSPTSE was up 0.3 percent.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/reuters", "https://www.youtube.com/user/ReutersVideo", "https://www.linkedin.com/company/10256858/", "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters", "https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/privacy-statement.html", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "https://instagram.com/reuters/"], "published": "2018-04-14T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2018-04-14T13:24:19.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
