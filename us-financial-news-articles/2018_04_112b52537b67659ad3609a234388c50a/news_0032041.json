That was a share below the rate for the first two months of the year, which was the highest since June last year.\nFor the first quarter as a whole, China produced 8.12 million tonnes, a rise of 0.3 percent from the same period last year, according to the statistics bureau.\nSmelters in smog-prone northern Chinese cities were only allowed to return to full operating rates from March 15, after being ordered to cut production by at least 30 percent during the peak winter heating season that began in mid-November.\nBut not all were planning to ramp up output immediately, given low aluminium prices last month, the lengthy and expensive process of restarting smelters, and the emergence of new capacity from state-run producers in the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi regions.\nThe rising output will stir debate about the government’s efforts to shutter outdated, inefficient capacity as the country ramps up exports, adding to a global glut.\nProduction of a group of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel – rose 3.0 percent in March to 4.55 million tonnes from a year earlier.\nYear-to-date output was up 2.4 percent at 13.39 million tonnes. The other non-ferrous metals are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.
