The auction of $64 billion in Treasuries this week has also weighed on prices, which move inversely to yields. Traders typically sell Treasuries to push up the yield so they can buy it at a lower price at the auction in a practice known as \"concession.\" The U.S. Treasury is set to auction $30 billion in U.S. 3-year notes on Tuesday, $21 bln in reopened 10-year notes on Wednesday, and $13 billion in reopened 30-year bonds on Thursday. \"The combination of conciliatory Trump tweets on the trade front and the looming long-end supply ostensibly make it difficult to be constructive on Treasuries as the week gets underway,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. U.S. President Donald Trump predicted in Twitter posts on Sunday that China would take down its trade barriers, expressing optimism despite escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies that have roiled global markets in the past week. Trump's chief economic adviser, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, also eased fears of a trade war. He repeated in an interview on CNN's State of the Union show on Sunday, saying, \"This process might turn out to be very benign ... Maybe China will want to come round and talk in earnest - so far it hasn't, I hope it does.\" In mid-morning trading, U.S. 10-year yields rose to 2.800 percent, from 2.775 percent late on Friday. U.S. 30-year yields were also higher, at 3.040 percent , from Friday's 3.017 percent. U.S. two-year yields climbed to 2.290 percent, up from 2.274 percent late Friday. Despite the conciliatory tone from the U.S. government, China remained hostile. On Monday, it stepped up its attacks on the Trump administration over billions of dollars worth of threatened tariffs, saying Washington is to blame for trade frictions and repeating it was impossible to negotiate under \"current circumstances.\" This week, the Federal Reserve's minutes of its last policy meeting are due to be released, coming after Fed Chairman Jay Powell suggested a gradual pace of rate increases in the near term. \"The FOMC minutes to Powell's first meeting in March as chairman could be interesting. Given that the Summary of Economic Projections, dot plot, and the press conference from that meeting are already well-documented, the minutes may only provide just a little more color,\" said Action Economics in a research note.
