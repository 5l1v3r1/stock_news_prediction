It had bought ING Groep’s ( INGA.AS ) Malaysian insurance unit for $1.7 billion in 2010.\nHong Kong-based AIA’s annualized new premium posted growth of 19 percent to $6.09 billion in the year to Nov 30. Operating profit after tax rose to $4.65 billion from $3.98 billion a year ago.\nThe company said it would pay dividends of 74.38 Hong Kong cents per share, an increase of 17 percent.\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong and Rushil Dutta in Bengaluru; Editing by Chris Reese and Phil Berlowitz\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:44:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
