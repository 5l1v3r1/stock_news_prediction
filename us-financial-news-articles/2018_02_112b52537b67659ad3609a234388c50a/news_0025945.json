They were less half of that in 2015.\nPrivately-held JAB Holdings -- which owns doughnut makers Krispy Kreme as well as coffee brands and has a stake in consumer products group Reckitt Benckiser -- has meanwhile been spinning off its luxury and fashion investments.\nIt will retain an undisclosed minority stake in Bally. JAB had already sold off British fashion brand Belstaff as well as shoemaker Jimmy Choo.\nThe brand famed for its towering stiletto heels coveted by celebrities was snapped up last year for $1.2 billion by U.S. retailer Michael Kors, which has since said it wants to grow its business with more acquisitions in the sector.\nShandong Ruyi spent HK$2.22 billion ($283.88 million) on a controlling stake in Hong Kong menswear group Trinity Ltd at the end of last year.\nThe retailer and wholesaler’s brands include classic British menswear makers Kent & Curwen and Gieves & Hawkes, and Cerruti 1881, a Paris-based fashion house which also makes fragrances and watches.\nShandong Ruyi also bought London-based suit maker Aquascutum from Hong Kong’s YGM Trading Ltd last year for $117 million.\n$1 = 7.8203 Hong Kong dollars Reporting by Sarah White; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:21:16.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
