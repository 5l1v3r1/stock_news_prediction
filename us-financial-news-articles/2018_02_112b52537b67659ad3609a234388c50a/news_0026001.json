One of those guidelines included having another person present, the Lansing State Journal reported. \nMSU terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. Numerous women have alleged they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place, the memo said. \n“William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,” Engler said in a statement. \nOne of Strampel’s attorneys, Steven Stapleton, declined to comment on Friday. \nEngler also said MSU would not cover Strampel’s legal expenses in relation to the Nassar matter. \nThe move against Strampel marked the latest casualty from the scandal at MSU, which has also led to the resignation of the former MSU president and athletic director. The entire board of USA Gymnastics also resigned. \n“I sincerely hope the courageous survivors of Larry Nassar will see this as an unmistakable indication that things are changing quickly at Michigan State,” Engler said.
