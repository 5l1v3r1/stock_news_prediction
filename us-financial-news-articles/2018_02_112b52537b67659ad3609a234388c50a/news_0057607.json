SEAS -1.33% Chief Executive Joel Manby is stepping down, as the theme-park operator said Tuesday its marine parks drew fewer visitors and its losses widened in the latest quarter.\nSeaWorld didn’t give a reason for Mr. Manby’s sudden departure, other than to say that the board and Mr. Manby agreed it was the right time to identify a new CEO as the company intensifies its turnaround efforts.\nMr. Manby had been CEO since 2015, when he was hired away from a family-owned theme-park company to get SeaWorld back on track. \nSeaWorld Chief Parks Operations Officer John Reilly, who has been with the company for more than 30 years, will be the interim CEO, effective immediately. Board Chairman Yoshikazu Maruyama will serve as executive chairman until a permanent CEO is appointed, the company said.\nFewer tourists have visited SeaWorld’s properties since a 2013 documentary, “Blackfish,” raised concerns about its treatment of whales and orcas. SeaWorld’s stock, which hit an all-time high of $38.92 in July 2013, closed Monday at $15.74. \n\nThe Orlando, Fla.-based company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $20.4 million Tuesday, compared with a loss of $11.9 million a year ago. \nRevenue dropped slightly to $265.6 million as 120,000 fewer people attended the company’s parks during the quarter. But the company is finding new ways to get more money from each visitor and average revenue per visitor inched up more than a dollar to $62.32 in the latest quarter.\nSo far this year, attendance and season pass sales are up and its crucial SeaWorld San Diego park appears to be rebounding from a difficult 2017, the company said. \nSeaWorld said it would add 15 new rides across its parks this year, including a steel coaster in San Diego called the Electric Eel that would top speeds of 60 miles an hour. The company said new rides and events combined with an updated pricing plan meant to encourage upgrades should boost attendance.\nIn November, SeaWorld reported the largest quarterly attendance decline in at least four years, when its logged 730,000 fewer visitors. At the time, Mr. Manby said early results from an advertising blitz to repair the company’s image and highlight its conservational efforts were promising. \nShares in the company, down 16% over the past year, were inactive premarket. \nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T19:33:36.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
