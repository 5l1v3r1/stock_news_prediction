FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded April copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange slipped 1 percent to 52,820 yuan ($8,341.36) a tonne by 0208 GMT and is set to end February at around the same level it started the month. * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange inched up 0.1 percent to $7,028 tonne, having closed down 1.3 percent on Tuesday. * OTHER METALS: Shanghai zinc, nickel and lead were down 1 percent, 0.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively, with only aluminium in positive territory, rising 0.4 percent. * USD: The dollar stood near a three-week high against a basket of currencies on Wednesday, after Powell's upbeat views on the economy bolstered bets on further Fed interest rate hikes this year. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, weighing on prices. * CHINA: Growth in China's manufacturing sector in February slowed more than expected to the weakest in over 1-1/2 years as the Lunar New Year holidays disrupted business activity and tougher pollution rules curtailed factory output. * ALUMINIUM: The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it had made a final determination that imports of aluminum foil from China are being sold in the United States at less than their fair value and producers are benefiting from subsidies from Beijing. * NORNICKEL: Russian billionaire Vladimir Potanin's Cyprus-based firm Whiteleave, aluminium giant Rusal and Roman Abramovich's Crispian have agreed to delay a sale of a 2 percent stake in Norilsk Nickel by Abramovich to Potanin, a lawyer for Whiteleave said. * SCOTIA: Canadian lender Bank of Nova Scotia said on Tuesday it would keep its ScotiaMocatta metals trading business, ending months of speculation that it could be sold.
