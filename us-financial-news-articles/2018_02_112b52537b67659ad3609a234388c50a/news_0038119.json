Meanwhile, retail sales posted their largest decline since February 2017, according to data released the same day, pointing to weaker economic growth than expected.\nTom Roseen, the head of research services for Lipper, said stronger equities usually bode well for high-yield bonds but higher interest rates and mixed economic news is starting to spook the market.\n“People are worried about inflation,” he said.\n“We’re going to have volatility that pops around.”\nInvestors want to see a higher yield to compensate for increased uncertainty, according to Roseen.\nAcross the board, bond flows showed risk-averse sentiment.\nIn the most recent week alone, $1 billion exited emerging market debt funds and $790 million flowed out of corporate investment-grade bond funds. In both cases, this was the largest outflows since November 2016.\nTreasury funds, however, invested in safer government debt, taking in $1.3 billion.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; editing by Jennifer Ablan and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T00:16:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
