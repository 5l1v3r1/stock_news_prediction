This puts it at second place among OECD member countries, behind Finland.\nHowever, the self-supply rate for domestically-produced timber is only at around 30 percent, the company states, and Japan's forests are at risk due to insufficient maintenance.\n\"Although the large amounts of Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress planted after the Second World War have now reached the time for harvesting, they are being left in an un-maintained state as devastation of our domestic forests continues. It is crucial to use these trees and replant them after harvesting to encourage sustainability of forests,\" the company said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T10:43:52.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
