This is another step we are taking to help people make ends meet as we build a country that works for everyone.”\nA report by a committee of lawmakers earlier this month found that the current energy market is “broken” and penalizes customer loyalty.\nHome power bills have doubled in Britain over the past decade to an average of about 1,150 pounds ($1,500) a year.\nThe energy company Centrica said while it agreed that standard variable rates are a problem for customers because they have no end dates, price controls are the wrong solution.\n“We just do not agree with introducing price controls into a competitive market which will reduce competition and choice, and therefore impact consumers,” the company said in a statement.\nReporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T02:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T02:30:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
