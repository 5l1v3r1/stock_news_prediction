He was forced to step down as president this month by the ruling African National Congress (ANC), following a series of scandals. He has denied all wrongdoing.\nBut treasury officials sought to project a relatively optimistic outlook as they assessed economic prospects for the immediate future.\nSOME BASIC FOODS ZERO-RATED\nGigaba said poor households would be cushioned against the VAT rate rise through a zero-rating of basic food items such as maize meal and beans, and welfare payments increases.\nAnd the Treasury saw GDP growth at 1.5 percent this year, up from an estimated one percent last year, helped by a recovery in agriculture and improved investor sentiment.\nSouth African debt faces the risk of a downgrade to “junk” by Moody’s after downgrades to sub-investment grade by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch last year.\nMoody’s said it would make a ratings decision soon after the budget announcement.\nGigaba told a media briefing before the budget that Treasury had done enough to avoid a downgrade, by taking decisions to stabilise debt and reduce the budget deficit.\nAfter the speech, Gigaba told Reuters: “We will be able eventually perhaps in 18 months to 24 months to return to investment grade.”\nHe also said Treasury “had to strike a balancing act” by dealing with the economy’s problems rather than taking a populist, pro-growth programme to win the next election.\n‘ASSAULT ON THE POOR’\nBut opposition leader and head of the Democratic Alliance party Mmusi Maimane said the budget meant the cost of living for poor people would rise sharply.\n“This is a budget that is an assault against poor people. What we saw today is a consequence of nine years of mismanagement of the economy by the ANC.”\nThe ultra-left Economic Freedom Fighters, which has six percent of the seats in parliament, boycotted the speech. It demanded that Gigaba, a Zuma ally, be removed.\nThe Treasury said South Africa faced a 48.2 billion rand revenue gap in the current 2017/18 fiscal year ending in March, down from an earlier estimate of 50.8 billion rand, and that the revenue shortfall was expected to continue into the medium term.\nIn a sign that it was mostly middle to high income earners who were targeted by the tax increases, the Treasury said the excise duty on luxury goods would be raised to nine percent from seven percent, among other taxes.\nThe budget deficit is expected to narrow to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2020 from 4.3 percent in the 2017/18 fiscal year, while gross debt is seen narrowing to 56 percent of GDP in the 2020/21 fiscal year from nearly 60 percent seen in the October mid-term budget statement.\n($1 = 11.6359 rand)\nAdditional reporting by Wendell Roelf and Alexander Winning in Cape Town; Editing by James Macharia\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T15:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T15:50:16.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
