This meant ditching cheeseburgers and chocolate milk from the kids' menu. \nWhile these items are still available for purchase, McDonald's will not list them on the menu, thus making less likely that these items will be ordered, it said. \n\"McDonald's commitment to balanced Happy Meals allows our two companies to collaborate on new ways to bring the magic of Disney to McDonald's consumers,\" Tiffany Rende, senior vice president of corporate alliances at Disney, said in a statement Tuesday. \nDisney first developed its nutrition guidelines in 2006 and expanded the initiative in 2012. The company seeks to promote the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, as well as limiting the number of calories, saturated fats, sugars and sodium consumed. \nDisney has also issued new standards for how food is advertised to kids and families. \nMcDonald's expects to be in-line with Disney's nutrition guidelines by the summer just in time for the release of \"Incredibles 2.\" The burger chain plans to promote \"Wreck-It Ralph 2: Ralph Breaks the Internet\" in November. \nThis isn't the first time that McDonald's has tinkered with its Happy Meals. In recent years, the company has cut the size of its fries, ditched antibiotics from its chicken nuggets, added fruit options and removed soda from the Happy Meal. \nSince 2013, McDonald's has seen a 14 percentage point increase in Happy Meals ordered with water, milk or juice as their beverage, the company says. \nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misstated sales trends related to Happy Meals over the last four years. It also misidentified a wire service as the source of that incorrect information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T00:20:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
