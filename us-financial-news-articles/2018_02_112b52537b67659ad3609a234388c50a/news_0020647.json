He included a map showing where the car was supposed to end up and where it’s actually headed—near the orbit of the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter \nMusk’s announcement came hours after t he successful launch of the SpaceX Falcon Heavy from Cape Canaveral, Fla . The rocket, which is the world’s largest and capable of carrying more than 140,000 pounds of cargo, is ferrying the Tesla and its passenger, a mannequin SpaceX calls Starman. The launch, the first test of the Falcon Heavy rocket, is intended to pave the way for future SpaceX missions. Third burn successful.
