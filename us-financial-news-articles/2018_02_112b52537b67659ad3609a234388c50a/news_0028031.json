It could indeed lead to a dangerous spillover,” a spokeswoman for the European Commission said on Monday.\nAn injured woman is carried on a stretcher after an airstrike in the besieged town of Douma in eastern Ghouta in Damascus, Syria, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/ Bassam Khabieh ‘HUNDREDS OF CIVILIAN DEATHS’\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is visiting Jordan and Turkey this week as part of a Middle East tour to discuss issues that include Syria. U.N.-led diplomacy toward ending the conflict is making little or no progress.\nThe Kremlin said on Monday that U.S. support in stabilizing Syria had been inadequate, but without spelling out how. “There is a shortage of this help,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nSlideshow (4 Images) On Saturday, U.N. rights chief Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein said that Syrian and Russian airstrikes in rebel-held areas of Idlib and eastern Ghouta had killed 230 civilians in the past week and that they might constitute war crimes.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said on Monday that air strikes had killed 15 more civilians, including three children, and injured another 85 in eastern Ghouta since Saturday.\n“I am again appealing to all parties, and those with influence over them, to listen to us and to the affected population: end this intolerable human suffering,” Za‘tari said.\nThe United Nations called on Feb. 6 for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire of at least a month across the country.\nMore than 700 patients in the besieged Damascus enclave of eastern Ghouta now await medical evacuation, said Elizabeth Hoff, World Health Organisation (WHO) representative in Syria.\nThe WHO, a United Nations agency, has sent 11 requests to the Syrian foreign ministry since last May, but only 29 of the most critical cases were evacuated in late December, Hoff said. The Jaish al-Islam rebel group released 29 detainees in eastern Ghouta at the time, as part of a deal with the government.\n“This is a political issue which cannot be resolved with humanitarian efforts,” Hoff told Reuters in Geneva on Monday, speaking from Damascus. “Unfortunately the list of patients is only growing.”\n“The security situation is very bad, there are not sufficient medical teams on the ground. They haven’t got supplies. We have not been able to deliver anything since November 28,” she added.\nReporting By Angus McDowall in Beirut and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva, additional reporting by Gabriela Baczynska in Brussels and Maria Tsvetkova in Moscow; editing by John Stonestreet, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:07:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
