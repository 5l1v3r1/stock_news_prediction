It was trading at $1.3873 by 0943 GMT, still up 0.3 percent on the day but below where it was trading before the inflation numbers.\n“It (the data) has not exactly blown the doors off,” said Mizuho’s head of hedge fund FX sales, Neil Jones.\n“Some people were thinking the annual figure could actually come in above the 3 percent level, which is one of the reasons Cable (sterling/dollar) was catching a bid this morning, so maybe there was some disappointment relative to expectations.”\nBritish government prices fell and yields rose. March gilt futures were down about 20 ticks compared with their level before the inflation data was published, while German bund futures were up.\nBritain’s FTSE 100 turned slightly negative after sterling rose, last trading 0.1 percent lower.
