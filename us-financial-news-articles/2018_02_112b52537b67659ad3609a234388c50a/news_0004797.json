We used very sensitive devices to detect possible respiratory reactions,” Thomas Kraus, director of the institute, told the news conference on Friday. \n“These are reactions of the immune system which can be measured with sensitive methodology, but which are far from a danger to a subject, because they are very quickly reversible ... There were no lasting changes.” \nKraus, who specializes in occupational and environmental medicine, said “at the time, we had no idea” about the monkey testing. \n“In hindsight it has to be said EUGT’s behaviour was problematic,” he told reporters. \nEUGT, created by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW in 2007, was disbanded last year. The carmakers have since condemned EUGT’s work and suspended employees who were working for the group.
