An OID of 93 is a deep and painful discount,” a syndicate head said.\nThe steep discount and high margins helped to attract new money to the deal, with some investors drawn to the large yields on offer.\nIt was the second flex offered on the loan, which was launched with guidance of 500bp over Euribor, with a 99 OID before being widened initially to 575bp over Euribor with a 96 OID as the deal struggled in syndication.\nInvestors are cherry-picking larger or better perceived credits in the market amid a flurry of new issuance in January.\nThis has been acerbated in light of recent wider macro volatility that has seen a brutal global sell-off in stocks.\n“We ended playing it at 93. At that price point the economics are fundamentally a lot more attractive. The banks went to 96 on it and this week given the volatility elsewhere I think realised they needed to go lower,” an investor said.\nWhile the initial price adjustment was just within the flex terms agreed between the banks and sponsor Sun European Partners, the final terms were not.\nThe banks had already lost some fees on the initial adjustments when they had to pay up to offer soft-call protection of 102 for 12 months, from initial guidance of 101 for six months.\nOther significant document changes in the initial adjustment, such as the introduction of a leveraged covenant to take the borrower to covenant-loose from covenant-lite, were accepted by the sponsor without expense to the banks.\nMORE GENEROUS The flex terms agreed by Sun with the banks had been more generous on this financing than conventional deals in Europe’s leveraged loan market to take account of a number of issues including sector and the fact that flower grower Afriflora sources its products from its 500 hectares of farmland in Ethiopia.\n“I just can’t understand why this deal came to our market. African risk isn’t exactly our expertise,” a second investor said.\nThe company has corporate and issue ratings of B2/B, with a recovery rating of 3.\nSun European Partners agreed to buy Afriflora, alongside founders the Barnhoorn family, from KKR late last year. Afriflora produces over 1.1bn roses a year.\nSun previously bought Finlays Fresh produce in 2015, subsequently rebranding it to Flamingo. It is the second largest supplier of flowers and vegetables in the UK, according to banking sources.\nThe debt was issued through Zara UK Midco Limited.
