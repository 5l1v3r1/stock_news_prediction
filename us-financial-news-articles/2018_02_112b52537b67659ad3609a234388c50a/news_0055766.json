REUTERS/Toru Hanai ”Since Abenomics began (in 2012), our stance on Japanese stocks has been to ‘buy-on-dips’. But with their valuations at lofty levels, we are no longer increasing our stock portfolio.\n“As the end of Goldilocks markets approaches, we have to prepare ourself for tumbles in share prices,” he said.\nNippon Life expects the dollar could fall further against the yen but given it is approaching levels in line with its fair value in purchasing power parity terms, it is ready to buy dollars below 105 yen, Ozeki said.\nThe dollar fell to a 15-month low of 105.545 yen JPY= last week compared with 112.71 yen at the end of last year, on investor risk aversion following a slide in global stock prices.\nOzeki said the company does not expect a major market crash yet but added a real test for markets will come when the combined balance sheet of the world’s three biggest central banks -- the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan -- start to shrink.\nRight now, while the Fed started to trim its balance sheet, the ECB and the BOJ are still gobbling up bonds.\n“(After the latest market volatilities,) everybody is trying to see if any bubbles are formed anywhere...I would think government bonds are the most expensive and what comes next will be a burst of the government bond bubble, even if not right away,” he added.\nThe firm has total assets of 67.4 trillion yen ($630 billion).\nEditing by Jacqueline Wong\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:34:56.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
