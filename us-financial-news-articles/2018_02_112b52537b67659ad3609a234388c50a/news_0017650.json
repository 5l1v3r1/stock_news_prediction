It said a combined system was the most feasible. \nBut developing digital currency payment systems could pose a challenge to global transaction service provide SWIFT, it said. \nChina’s central bank has been exploring the issuance of a sovereign digital currency, even as it ratchets up a crackdown on privately issued digital currencies. \nFan Yifei, a vice central bank governor, had said recently China should consider adopting a “two-tier” system in issuing digital currencies, in which both the central bank and financial institutions become legitimate issuers. \nChina has taken a string of steps in recent months to clamp down on the cryptocurrency market, including closing exchanges and banning so-called initial coin offerings - digital, token-based fundraising rounds. \nOn Monday, the Financial News, which is run by the central bank, said the PBOC would monitor overseas websites of virtual currency trading platforms to curb risks caused by a rush of investment following the ICO ban.
