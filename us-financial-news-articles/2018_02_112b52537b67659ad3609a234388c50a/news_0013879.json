The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent to 2,654.25 and the Nasdaq 0.4 percent to 6,993.47.\nReporting by Tanya Agrawal; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Patrick Graham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:52:14.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
