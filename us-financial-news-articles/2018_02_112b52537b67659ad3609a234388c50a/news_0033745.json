Representatives for the Japan Blockchain Association could not be immediately reached for comment.\nLast month, hackers stole about $530 million from Tokyo-based cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck Inc, in one of the biggest-ever heists of digital currency.\nThe Coincheck heist exposed flaws in Japan’s system and raised questions over the country’s dash to regulate the industry - a sharp contrast to clampdowns by countries like South Korea and China.\nReporting by Takahiko Wada, Writing by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T04:32:09.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
