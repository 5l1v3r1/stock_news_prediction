The price of uranium, which has fallen to about $22 per pound — down from more than $100 in the mid-2000s — would \"discourage any investment in new claims,\" said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association.\nColorado-based Energy Fuels asked for a reduction of Bears Ears last year in a public comment, but spokesman Curtis Moore said in a statement that the company has higher priorities elsewhere. He noted the lands were open to claims for 150 years prior to   creating the national monument in 2016.\n\"There probably isn't any land available for staking that would be of much interest to anyone,\" Moore said.\nIn Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument — part of a major coal reserve that a company was preparing to mine before President Bill Clinton protected the lands in 1996 — has been made available again but it appears unlikely any company will immediately jump at the chance this time.\nOut-of-state demand for Utah's coal had led to a drop in coal production to about 14 million tons in 2017, down from about 27 million tons in the mid-2000s, said Michael Vanden Berg, energy and mineral program manager at the Utah Geological Survey.\n\"If a new mine were to open, it would be competing with existing mines in Utah for limited demand,\" Vanden Berg said.\nPopovich called it \"doubtful given market conditions and other factors\" that companies interested in coal would put in a lease request.\nVanden Berg noted that a potential coal port in Oakland, California, could open up an Asian market and that technology could be developed to change market forces.\nThere's some potential for oil and gas at Grand Staircase, Vanden Berg said. But Kathleen Sgamma, president of an oil and gas industry group called Western Energy Alliance, said heavy oil shale in the area would require an intensive mining operation that doesn't make sense in today's market.\n\"There's no fracking trucks at the border waiting to rush in,\" Sgamma said.\nPresident Trump downsized the Bears Ears National Monument by about 85 percent and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument by nearly half. It earned him cheers from Republican leaders in Utah who lobbied him to undo protections by Democratic presidents that they considered overly broad.\nBears Ears, created nearly a year ago, will be reduced to 315 square miles (815.85 sq. kilometers). Grand Staircase-Escalante will be reduced from nearly 3,000 square miles (7770 sq. kilometers) to 1,569 square miles (4063.71 sq. kilometers).\nConservation groups called it the largest elimination of protected land in American history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T07:32:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
