REUTERS/Edgar Su Lee said Yun had been training on home ice for about two years and knows the curves and turns of the Olympic Sliding Centre better than anyone.\n“At first, we were a bit confused but now we know the track well and have practised runs almost perfectly,” the coach said.\n“People often think that home advantage is simply having more opportunities than others, but actually it is more about making no mistakes to improve records.”\nYun practised twice on Tuesday at the Olympic Sliding Center in Pyeongchang and ranked second in each training run, but he did not show up for official training heats on Wednesday.\nYun will make his first two runs on Thursday and the final two on Friday when the medalists will be decided.\n“I‘m sure he’ll run his best race tomorrow. Today he had a good rest,” the 40-year-old Lee said.\n(This version of the story has been corrected to clarify slider’s aim is to win S.Korea’s first gold medal in men’s skeleton in first paragraph)\nReporting by Jane Chung, Additional reporting by Ian Ransom, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T06:35:55.040+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
