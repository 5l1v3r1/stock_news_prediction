(\"BUFF\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BUFF) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by General Mills Inc. (\"GIS\") (NYSE: GIS). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, shareholders of BUFF will receive $40.00 in cash for each BUFF share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether BUFF's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $52.00, or $12.00 above the offer price. Additionally, according to the acquisition announcement, there are several strategically compelling and financial benefits for GIS in this transaction, including:\nExpansion of its brand portfolio with the addition of BUFF, a leading brand with strong customer base to its product range; Entry into the highly attractive $30 billion pet foods market, which has consistently generated 3-4% growth; and Meaningful improvements to GIS's growth and margin profile.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether BUFF shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and future growth prospects.
