The lease expansion increases CHN’s occupancy to 74% of the space through February 2026 and increases the property’s total occupancy to 90%. Ranked among the nation's most integrated healthcare systems, CHN is Central Indiana's leader in providing convenient access to exceptional healthcare services, where and when patients need them—in hospitals, health pavilions and doctor's offices, as well as workplaces, schools and homes.\n“Since inception in 2003 our portfolio’s occupancy has been 96% or greater which is a testament to our team’s credit underwriting and asset management capabilities,” said Bob Cutlip, President of Gladstone Commercial. “With no more leases expiring in 2018 and less than 4% of forecasted lease expirations between now and the end of 2019, the portfolio is well positioned for future growth.”\nAbout Gladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ:GOOD):\nGladstone Commercial is a real estate investment trust focused on acquiring, owning and operating net leased industrial and office properties across the United States.
