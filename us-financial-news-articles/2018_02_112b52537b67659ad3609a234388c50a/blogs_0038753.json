The plans don't have to meet the Affordable Care Act's consumer protections, or offer a robust benefit package.\nThat means short-term policies will come with lower premiums. The administration is hoping that will help several million consumers who buy individual plans but aren't eligible for subsidies under the Obama health care law.\nCritics say short-term policies will draw healthy people away from the health law's insurance markets, potentially making them less stable and raising subsidy costs for taxpayers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:40:27.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
