The French state is Renault’s biggest shareholder with a 15 percent stake.\nA spokesman for the company declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\nRenault owns 43.4 percent of Japanese alliance partner Nissan ( 7201.T ), which in turn controls Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ) through a 34 percent holding.\nRenault Chief Competitive Officer Thierry Bollore is often cited as favorite to be named as second-in-command.\n(This version of the story corrects the title to chief competitive officer in final paragraph)\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:42:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
