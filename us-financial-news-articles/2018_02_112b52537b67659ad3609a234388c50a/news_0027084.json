Many of them gave her a standing ovation. \nChoi, who finished sixth with 65.73 points -- a personal best -- said she was surprised and pleased with her score. \n“This was my first Olympics so I was very nervous, but so many people came and cheered for me that I was able to compete and it was a very good experience,” she told reporters.

Slideshow (2 Images) \nChoi won her Olympic berth after a difficult off season in 2017 during which she struggled with foot pain adjusting to new skates, which required considerable tinkering. \nHer mother, who had been ill with cancer for some time, died last June, a month before the first competition that selects South Korean skaters for the Olympics. Choi said at the time that she had contemplated dropping out. \nOn Sunday she said that she had finally adjusted to the shoes. \n“And I am very thankful to my mother, who is watching me from Heaven,” she added.
