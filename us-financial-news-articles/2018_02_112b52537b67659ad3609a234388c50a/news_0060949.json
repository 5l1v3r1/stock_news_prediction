The retail and catering sectors posted sales of 926 billion yuan ($146 billion) during the holiday.\nReporting by Stella Qiu and Beijing Monitoring Desk Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:46:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
