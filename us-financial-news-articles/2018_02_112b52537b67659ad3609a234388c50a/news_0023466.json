The stock has sunk nearly 37 percent since the Jarden acquisition.\nThe slate nominated by Starboard includes Jarden’s co-founders Martin Franklin and Ian Ashken. They were part of Newell’s board and resigned in January.\nJames Lillie, former Jarden CEO, is also part of Starboard’s slate.\n“We find it extremely disappointing that Newell’s current directors not only own very few shares of the company, but have lacked the confidence to buy shares in the company following its recent precipitous decline,” Starboard said in the letter.\nNewell declined to comment on Monday’s news and pointed Reuters to its statement on Friday confirming that it had received notice from Starboard of its intention to nominate directors.\nReporting by Nivedita Balu and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:02:28.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
