Trump has denied there was any collusion, and Russia has denied it tried to influence the contest.\nThe hearing is the second sealed proceeding on Gates’ legal representation. U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson has not yet ruled on whether Shanlon Wu, Walter Mack and Annemarie McAvoy, the three lawyers seeking to drop their representation of Gates, can withdraw from the case.\nVeteran Washington lawyer Thomas Green was spotted at the courthouse with Gates at a hearing on Feb. 14, but he has not filed a notice with the court saying he is representing Gates.\nThe rift with the lawyers comes amid some news media reports that Gates is working toward a plea deal.\nFriday’s closed hearing will take place two days after a sealed filing by the special counsel that suggests new criminal charges have been lodged in the case. The nature of the charges is unknown and it is unclear when the filing will be unsealed.\nAdditional reporting by Doina Chiacu in Washington; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Jonathan Oatis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T17:24:26.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
