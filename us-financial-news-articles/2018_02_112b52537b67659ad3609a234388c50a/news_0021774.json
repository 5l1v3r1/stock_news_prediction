Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index showed little change, down 0.03 percent in afternoon trade, while Chile's benchmark IPSA jumped 0.44 percent. Among major regional equities markets, only Mexico's IPC was significantly in the red, falling 0.17 percent after government data showed a contraction in investment in November. Argentina's small and volatile Merval index led gains, popping 2.65 percent, due to optimism about the end of a slide in major markets as well as an ongoing rally in local energy stocks. \"The U.S. market stopped sliding, and that helped the Merval,\" said one Buenos Aires-based trader. \"The recovery in the short-term could last a few days.\" Among currency markets, the Chilean peso was the major winner, jumping 0.87 percent after the central bank posted a January trade surplus of $1.21 billion, up 7 percent from the previous year as prices for key export copper improved. The Mexican and Argentine peso currencies, as well as the Brazilian real, all slumped fairly modestly, thanks to a strengthening global dollar.
