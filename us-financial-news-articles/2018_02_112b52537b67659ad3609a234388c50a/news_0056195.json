(NASDAQ:VLRX), a medical technology company which offers patients with type 2 diabetes V-Go® Wearable Insulin Delivery device , a simple, affordable, all-in-one insulin delivery option that is worn like a patch and can eliminate the need for taking multiple daily shots, today announced financial results for the three months and full 2017.\n2017 Highlights:\nRevenues in the fourth quarter grew 21% year-over-year to $5.8 million from $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which represented a 14% sequential increase from $5.1 million in the third quarter and a 4% increase to $20.2 million for the full 2017 from $19.6 million for the full year 2016;\nGross margin for the fourth quarter was 45.2%, compared to 37.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016, a year-over-year improvement of 810 basis points and 40.3% for the full year 2017 compared to 35.5% for the full year 2016, an improvement of 480 basis points;\nOver 14 million V-Go's have now been distributed to and used clinically by patients as of December 31, 2017;\nAdvanced development of V-Go Link, a one-way Bluetooth communication accessory for V-Go that will provide insulin use information to patients and their healthcare providers.\n\"We are delighted in the Company’s performance throughout 2017, and very excited with the positive prescription trends we experienced in the second half of the year,” said John Timberlake, President and Chief Executive Officer of Valeritas. “Our high-touch and higher-service sales and marketing strategy generated growth in our targeted accounts during every quarter in 2017 and enabled the Company to return to top-line revenue growth during the last two quarters of the year.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.8 million, a 21% increase from $4.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and a 14% sequential increase from $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2017. This represents the Company's third consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth and its second consecutive quarter with increasing year-over-year revenue growth. This overall growth was primarily due to an increase in new prescriptions in targeted accounts. Total and new prescriptions in targeted accounts increased by 24% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 32% year-over-year. As with the third quarter of 2017, there was continued stabilization of total and new prescriptions in accounts that were not targeted by the Company's sales representatives.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.6 million, an increase of 47% as compared to $1.8 million in the same period in 2016, with gross margin increasing by 810 basis points from 37.1% basis points to 45.2%. The increase in gross margin was driven mainly by improved manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies and a slight increase in our V-Go's net price as compared to the same periods in 2016.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $12.9 million (which excludes a one-time expense of $3.7 million for impairment of assets), a 27% increase from $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Increased operating expenses were driven primarily by increased investment in the Company’s commercial initiatives, including the expansion of the Company's sales force in April 2017 and an increase in Research and Development (R&D) primarily related to continued development of the V-Go Link.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $14.9 million as compared to a net loss of $9.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 57%. The increase in net loss was due primarily to an increase in operating expenses and the one-time impairment expense of $3.7 million partially offset by an increase in gross profit due to increased revenue and lower cost of goods sold.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue for increased 4% to $20.2 million, from $19.6 million for the 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to a slight increase in V-Go's net price as compared to 2016. Overall prescription volume for the year was slightly down due to a decline in prescriptions in our non-targeted accounts offset by growth in total prescriptions in our targeted accounts in 2017.\nGross profit for the full year 2017 was $8.2 million, or 40.3% gross margin, up from $6.9 million, or 35.5% gross margin for the full year 2016. The increase in the Company’s gross margin was primarily due to manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies, overhead cost-reductions and a slight increase in net price for V-Go.\nOperating expenses for the full year 2017 were $49.7 million (which excludes a $3.7 million one-time expense for impairment of assets), an increase of 22% from $40.7 million in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the Company’s commercial initiatives including the expansion of the Company's field-based sales force in April 2017, an increase in R&D primarily related to the Company's V-Go Link, a Bluetooth product program, stock compensation expenses and impairment costs.\nNet loss for the full year 2017 was $49.3 million, compared to $46.4 million for the prior year, an increase of 6%. The increase was primarily due to the increase in operating expenses related to the expansion of the sales force and the one-time impairment expense partially offset by an increase in gross profit due to increased revenue with lower cost of goods sold.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $26.0 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $9.9 million as of December 31, 2016.\nGuidance\nThe Company expects 2018 revenue to be between $26 and $28 million. As previously discussed, the Company ended 2017 with a gross margin of 45% for the fourth quarter. The Company expects quarterly gross margin to increase on an annual and sequential basis in 2018, ending the year with a gross margin near 50% for the fourth quarter of 2018. These expectations are based on, among other things, the assumption that there will be continued growth in the Company's targeted accounts and no further decline in the Company's non-targeted accounts.\nConference Call Information\nValeritas will hold a conference call to discuss the results today, Monday, February 26, 2018, at 4:30 PM ET.
