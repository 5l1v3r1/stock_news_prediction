REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach “I have been nervous, I haven’t been able to train for this,” Bjoergen told Norwegian television.\n“But I just had to grind and wear out her (Nilsson‘s) legs, and I did that. She didn’t manage the last turn and I‘m surprised I managed it. She was on my heels in the last uphill,” Bjoergen added.\nBjoergen received plenty of plaudits from her competitors following her historic achievement.\n“She is an absolute legend, it’s really, really cool to see her race every single time, she just skis with absolute control,” American racer Jessica Diggins told Reuters.\nThe United States continue their wait for a first cross-country medal since 1976. Sophie Caldwell struggled on the first leg, leaving her team mates with too much to do and they eventually finished fifth behind Finland.\nEditing by Clare Fallon and Clare Lovell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:11:22.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
