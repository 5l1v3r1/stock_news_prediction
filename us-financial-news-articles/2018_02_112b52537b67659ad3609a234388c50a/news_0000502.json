The project, which has led to natural gas shortages this winter, will continue through 2018 to further curb air pollution.\nThe CEC expects a total of 120 gigawatts (GW) of new power capacity will be installed in 2018. Of which, 70 GW will come from non-fossil-fuel power plants.\nIt also forecasts China’s total installed power generation capacity will reach 1,900 GW by the end of 2018. With Beijing’s effort to promote clean energy, coal-fired power capacity will account for 53.6 percent of total power capacity, down 1.5 percentage points compared to 2017.\nThe world’s second-biggest economy aims to install 200 GW of power generation capacity, with 77 GW from clean energy sectors, by 2020.\nReporting by Ruby Lian in SHANGHAI, Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason in BEIJING; Editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:18:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
