The Dons had lost 16 in a row to ranked opponents since then.\nSaint Mary’s (24-4, 13-2) dropped out of a first-place tie with Gonzaga (14-1) with just three games remaining.\nThe Gaels had embarrassed USF 79-43 in an earlier meeting in Moraga, Calif. The 43 points represented the season-low for both USF and a Saint Mary’s opponent.\nSaint Mary’s led by as many as 11 points in the rematch, 27-16, on an Evan Fitzner layup with 7:34 remaining in the first half.\nBut the Dons, who entered the game just 3-3 at home in conference play, closed within 38-35 by halftime, then battled the powerful Gaels on better-than-even terms throughout the second half.\nMcCarthy’s critical hoop came after Saint Mary’s star Jock Landale gave the Gaels their final lead of the night at 56-55 with a pair of free throws with 4:43 remaining.\nFrankie Ferrari hit two key hoops down the stretch for the Dons, who pulled away in the final seconds with six free throws.\nFerrari had a game-high 20 points to lead the Dons, who had gone 0-4 against ranked opponents this season, losing those games by a total of 73 points.\nFerrari hit seven of his 11 shots and found time for a game-high seven assists.\nJordan Ratinho added 13 points for USF, while reserve Jimbo Lull contributed 10 points and a game-high seven rebounds to the win.\nUSF outshot Saint Mary’s 46.0 percent to 42.9 percent.\nLandale had a team-high 19 points for Saint Mary‘s, which was coming off a 78-65 home loss to Gonzaga on Saturday that had created the tie atop the conference standings.\nFitzner finished with 17 points and Emmett Naar 16 to complement a team-high five assists for the Gaels, who took their first road loss in conference play after seven wins.\nThe Gaels shot just 4-for-14 from 3-point range.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:51:11.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
