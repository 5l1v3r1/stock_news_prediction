Maybe you can align with us? #EUDoesntSuck”\nTimmermans, who is first vice president to Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, is overseeing new EU legislation now in the works to cut down on plastic waste. Those laws will, once passed, apply to Britain until Brexit is fully implemented.\nThe remark was also an ironic reference to suggestions that Prime Minister Theresa May will propose that Britain retain “regulatory alignment” with the EU in many areas to ease trade after Brexit in March 2019. Many EU governments view that idea of alignment in certain sectors with scepticism.\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:28:16.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
