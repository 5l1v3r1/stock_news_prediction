The movie starts in three weeks and we never took acting classes,'” Sadler said. \n“(Eastwood) was like ‘Don’t worry about it. We’re just going to go and do it.' So he just kept it simple and said ‘Be yourself and we’re just going to capture it’,” he added. \nThe trio were on a train from Amsterdam to Paris on a European vacation on Aug. 21, 2015 when a suspected Islamist militant opened fire on passengers.

Two other passengers were wounded and the attacker was arrested when the train stopped. \nStone is glad the film also honors the other people who sprang into action. In the film, many of the passengers are the same people who were on the train in 2015.   \n”A lot of the times the story is depicted that we were the only ones who did anything,“ he said. ”For them to be honored for what they did in such a big way is awesome because it’s something we’ve always wanted but we just didn’t know how we could do that. \n“We just wanted to get it right and I think we did,” Stone added. \nSkarlatos said shooting the movie “helped us close a chapter in our lives and move on.” \nBut the trio is also hoping it opens other doors. \n“Hopefully this launches movie careers for all three of us,” said Sadler. “We’re all trying to pursue acting. We’ve kind of caught the acting bug and he (Eastwood) gave us the confidence to do it.” Reporting by Rollo Ross; Editing by Jill Serjeant and Sandra Maler", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T22:46:47.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
