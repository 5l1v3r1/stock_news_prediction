Baird in Milwaukee. “Some of what we saw yesterday suggests we are near at least a short-term low. Then the question is what the rallies look like after that.”\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.51 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,419.26, the S&P 500 lost 2.99 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,645.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 13.34 points, or 0.19 percent, to 6,980.86.\nAdditional reporting by April Joyner, Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinead Carew in New York, Shounak Dasgupta, Tanya Agrawal in Bengaluru; Editing by Susan Thomas, Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:00:05.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
