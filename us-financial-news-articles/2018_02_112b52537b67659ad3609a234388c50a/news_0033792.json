Its indiscriminate design caused it to spread further, affecting other European and Russian business.”\nMoscow has previously denied being behind the NotPetya attack.\nReckitt, a consumer goods maker, as well as Danish shipping company AP Moller-Maersk S/A, were amongst those affected with the total cost of the attack running into hundreds of millions of pounds.\nBritish defence minister Gavin Williamson said the attack was part of a new era of warfare and Britain had to be ready to respond. “We must be primed and ready to tackle these stark and intensifying threats,” he said in a statement.\nBritain has recently become more vocal about the threat posed by Russia at a time when some members of the ruling Conservative Party have expressed concern about the impact of cuts to defence spending.\nLast November, Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russia of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media.
