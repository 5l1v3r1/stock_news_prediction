If legal channels were opened up, they would be able to learn skills before traveling and during their stay overseas, it said.\nAlmost three in four Afghans who return home after seeking sanctuary abroad are forced to flee again due to fresh fighting, the Norwegian Refugee Council said in January.\nA big influx of returnees from Pakistan and Iran would challenge the government and aid agencies, as Afghanistan is already struggling with large numbers of internally displaced people, the United Nations has said.\n(This version of the story refiles to fix typo in paragraph 1.)\nReporting by Jared Ferrie.
