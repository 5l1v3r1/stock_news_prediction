We work closely with law enforcement, and did so in this matter, to identify, investigate and stop improper or potentially illegal activity.\" \nPayPal and its mobile payments app Venmo recently warned users of possible delayed money transfers due to increased scrutiny of money transfers. \nOne of the earliest uses of the most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin , was for buying illegal goods and services online in an anonymous part of the internet called the dark web. CNBC reported in August that criminals are finding that bitcoin is actually more traceable than originally thought, and are moving to other cryptocurrencies. But financial authorities from India to the U.S. Treasury have said they are focused on preventing illegal activity in cryptocurrencies. \nA second indictment released Friday said defendant Richard Pinedo operated an online service called \"Auction Essistance\" whose services included evading the security features of large online digital payment companies. \nPinedo also sold bank account numbers, registered in his own name or purchased online, which were often created using stolen identities, the indictment said. His operations affected \"hundreds of bank account numbers\" and Pinedo himself collected \"tens of thousands of dollars, and more than $1,000 during one-year period, through the sale of these bank account numbers.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T22:46:22.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
