We murdered babies in their cots?”\nHe added: “Certainly the scale and intensity of the attacks feels out of proportion to the level of culpability.”\nBut on Tuesday Goldring apologised, saying he had been under stress after giving many interviews and thinking of the good work Oxfam was still doing around the world.\n“I should not have said those things. It is not for Oxfam to judge issues of proportionality or motivation,” he told the committee.\n“I wholeheartedly apologise for those comments, and commit to work in that greater public interest.”\nOn Monday, the charity released the findings of an internal investigation that found the country director in Haiti, Roland Van Hauwermeiren, had admitted using prostitutes at his residence during a relief mission before resigning in 2011.\nAllegations of sexual misconduct have shaken the aid sector, with Haiti’s president calling for investigations of other groups.\nBritain and the European Union are reviewing the funding of Oxfam, one of the world’s biggest disaster relief charities.\nLast week, Van Hauwermeiren said he felt ashamed, but added that some of the allegations in a Times newspaper report which first broke the story were untrue, and denied paying for sex with prostitutes.\nTwigg said the International Development Committee would conduct a full enquiry into the issue of sexual exploitation in the aid sector.
