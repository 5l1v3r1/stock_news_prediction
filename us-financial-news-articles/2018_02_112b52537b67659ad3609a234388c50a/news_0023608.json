It brought back to my mind that the race is finished only when you go through the finish line on the fourth run and not earlier.”\nOvernight leader after Monday’s opening runs, Geisenberger built on her slender lead with a blazing third run of 46.28 seconds, piloting her sled with model German efficiency.\nAs a statement, it was almost as loud as the rowdy finish-line terrace, and none came close to answering it.\nLuge – – Women’s Singles Competition – Olympic Sliding Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 13, 2018.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann There was still a mountain to climb, however, and it was Eitberger rather than Huefner who threw caution to the wind to soar into the gold medal position ahead of Geisenberger’s finale.\nIt did precisely nothing to rattle the champion who romped to victory with fire in her eyes, her nation’s sixth consecutive gold in the event dating back to the 1998 Nagano Games.\nSochi bronze medallist Erin Hamlin, the United States’ first Olympic medal winner in luge, bowed out with a sixth-place finish in her fourth and final Games.\nA day after the anniversary of the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died in a training accident before the Vancouver opening ceremony, a heavy crash by Hamlin’s team mate Emily Sweeney sent a scare through the venue.\nSweeney lost control and bounced off the sides of the track before losing her sled and hammering into a wall.\nShe lay motionless for a few moments before being helped off the track by medical staff and the final run was suspended for about 10 minutes.\nAfter a long inspection by trainers, she got to her feet and walked groggily away, raising a cheer from spectators and relieved clapping from team mates down at the finish.\nReporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:14:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
