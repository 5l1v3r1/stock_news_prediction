In August, Bloomberg said that Facebook is working on at least two separate speaker devices with Apple \"Siri-style\" voice assistants, and at least one has a laptop-like screen that could be released as soon as the spring. Business Insider also reported that Facebook was working on a product called Aloha .\nWe do know that Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook's CEO, has a keen interest in smart homes. Zuckerberg created a smart personal assistant, Jarvis, and has a fully rigged automation system in his home. \nFacebook is also expanding its ambitions in music and video on a grander scale. Facebook agreed to a music deal with Sony earlier this year , and has talked to media buyers about expanding its \"Watch\" video tab to compete with YouTube .\nFor more on the report, see the latest in Digitimes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T19:40:00.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
