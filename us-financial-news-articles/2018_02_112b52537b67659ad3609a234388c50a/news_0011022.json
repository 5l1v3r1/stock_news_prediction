We have not come to any conclusion yet but this is something we are looking at very closely,” Airbus sales chief Eric Schulz told a news conference. \nSchulz, making his first appearance since being recruited from Rolls-Royce to replace retired sales chief John Leahy, shrugged off concerns about the ability of the supply chain to keep up with higher production rates. \n“I think the supply chain will be able to cope and we will be able to raise rates as needed in the market,” he said. \nHis comments match confidence from rival Boeing as the industry responds to growing demand for medium-haul jets. \nIn an interview with Reuters, a senior Boeing official said the U.S. company was confident in demand for its 737 MAX jet, the latest version of which was rolled out on Monday.“There is upward pressure (on production rates) because we are oversold,” Marketing Vice President Randy Tinseth said. \n“If you want a (737) MAX today, we are talking 2023,” he added, referring to long waiting times for new jets. \nJust as airlines overbook seats, planemakers typically sell more aircraft than they plan to produce to protect themselves from airlines going bankrupt or failing to take delivery.

I don’t think so. 140 a month, I don’t think that is possible at the moment,” AerCap ( AER.N ) Chief Executive Aengus Kelly told Reuters when asked whether the market could support such levels of production. \nEven so, he expected Airbus and Boeing, who make up the bulk of the $140 billion a year jet market, to exercise restraint. \n“If the market can take it, they will give it. If the market won’t take it, they won’t,” he said. \n“What is much more important for the manufacturers is not what they say they do, and not what the orders are but what they are delivering,” Kelly said. “If you look back over the last 20 years what you see is a very strong correlation between traffic growth and deliveries,” he added.
