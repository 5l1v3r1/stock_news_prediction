The NTSB is still investigating whether the train braked prior to impact.\nA passenger on the garbage truck, 28-year-old Christopher Foley, was killed and two others on the truck were injured, according to police. The NTSB has not been able to interview the 30-year-old driver of the truck.\nNo lawmakers were seriously injured but a Minnesota representative, Jason Lewis, was taken to a hospital as a precaution and released.\nFILE PHOTO: Emergency first responders work at the scene of the crash where an Amtrak passenger train carrying Republican members of the U.S. Congress from Washington to a retreat in West Virginia collided with a garbage truck in Crozet, Virginia, U.S. January 31, 2018. Justin Ide/Crozet Volunteer Fire Department/Handout via REUTERS The train had hundreds of passengers onboard at the time of the accident, NTSB board member Earl Weener said.\nThe NTSB has not yet downloaded the forward locomotive video camera or event data recorder. The board said that when it reviews the video data it should be able to determine if the signals at the crossing were working or if the truck was moving.\nThe train was taking lawmakers to the annual retreat in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, just west of the Virginia state line. Amtrak said the collision occurred at 11:18 a.m. in Crozet, a tiny town between the college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, and White Sulphur Springs.\nThe Virginia Department of Transportation said the intersection where the crash occurred had flashing signals and gates to prevent motorists from getting on the tracks as trains approach.\n(This story corrects headline and first two paragraphs to reflect that NTSB is still investigating whether the train started braking before hitting the truck, instead of saying that the train braked before the crash.)\nReporting by David Shepardson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T01:11:40.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
