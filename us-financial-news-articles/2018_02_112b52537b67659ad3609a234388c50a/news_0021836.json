Inflation expectations are diminishing progressively. Short-term pro-inflationary risks have abated,” the central bank said in a statement.\n“This year annual inflation is much less likely to exceed 4 percent. In this environment the Bank of Russia will continue to reduce the key rate and may complete the transition from moderately tight to neutral monetary policy in 2018.”\nInflation is seen holding below 4 percent in 2018 and remaining close to that level next year, the bank said.\nThe rouble firmed to 57.92 versus the dollar after the rate decision, compared to a rate of 58.11 shortly before.\nLower rates are likely to please Russian voters by making consumer credit and mortgages cheaper in the run-up to a presidential election on March 18, when incumbent Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win a further six years in power.\nThe central bank cut its key rate six times last year as inflation, once stubbornly stuck at double-digit levels, slowed. January marked its lowest level since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nMORE CUTS IN PIPELINE Bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said last week the key rate could be brought to a “neutral” level of 6 or 7 percent sooner than previously planned.\nVTB analyst Alexander Isakov said he did not expect a significant market reaction to Friday’s decision, but said the central bank had clearly telegraphed the action it would take at its next rate-setting meeting on March 23.\n“The Bank of Russia’s new signal says that the decision in March is practically predetermined: the Bank of Russia will continue with policy easing,” Isakov said.\nVTB now sees the central bank cutting the key rate to 7 percent by the end of the first half of the year, he added.\nThe central bank’s ability to stick to its rate-cutting policy has been helped by a U.S. decision to hold off imposing sanctions on Russian sovereign debt.\nThe bank stopped short of commenting directly on Friday on the possibility of future U.S. sanctions, but said it would continue to monitor risks to inflation “posed by external factors”.\nThe Kremlin will hope that a more buoyant economy, supported by cheaper credit, will encourage voters long frustrated with lower living standards to turn out in larger numbers to vote in next month’s presidential election.\nIn its statement, the central bank acknowledged greater uncertainty in global financial markets, amid a rout in global equity markets sparked by inflation fears.
