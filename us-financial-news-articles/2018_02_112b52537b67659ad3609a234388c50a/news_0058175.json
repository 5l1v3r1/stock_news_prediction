TASE officials declined to comment.\nBen-Zeev has said he was in talks with a number of exchanges but did not say who or how many, adding “I believe that we will have for sure” a deal with an exchange by mid-April.\nThe Tel Aviv exchange aims to become competitive, cheaper and more efficient after seeing around 200 de-listings over the past decade and trading volumes slump. In 2017 stock trading averaged 1.4 billion shekels ($402 million) a day, up slightly from 2016 on a rise in IPOs but below 2 billion shekels in 2010.\nReporting by Steven Scheer, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T22:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:46:59.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
