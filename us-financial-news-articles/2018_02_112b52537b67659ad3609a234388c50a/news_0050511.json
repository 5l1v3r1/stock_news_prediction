Sales volumes at its main product lines should grow in the low to mid single-digit percentage range, faster than the overall economy, the company said.\nThat echoed confidence voiced by German cement maker HeidelbergCement, which on Tuesday predicted economic growth would fuel building material sales this year.\nQuarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) more than doubled to 879 million euros, above the 840 million euros expected on average in a Reuters poll of analysts.\nThe industry’s past budgets for investment in areas such as foam chemicals, car seats and heat insulation turned out to be too conservative, and a number of technical setbacks and disruptions from Hurricane Harvey exacerbated supply shortages.\nA share buyback programme, which boosted the share price when it was began last year, would probably be continued beyond 2019, when Covestro plans to ask shareholders for renewed permission to do so at the annual meeting, the CEO said.\nAnalysts and investors are looking for clues as to how long the boom will last. Companies such as DowDupont and Saudi Aramco are ratcheting up investment plans to bring greater chemical output capacity on stream.\nCovestro said 2018 EBITDA would likely be around the previous year’s level, while the first-quarter number would be significantly above the year-earlier level.\n$1 = 0.8076 euros Reporting by Ludwig Burger and reporting by Patricia Weiss, editing by Christoph Steitz, Maria Sheahan, Larry King\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:43:40.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
