The company ended merger talks with rival Sprint Corp ( S.N ) late last year. \nIn 2018, T-Mobile said it expects to add between 2 million and 3 million subscribers who pay a monthly bill. Analysts called the numbers conservative. \n“Management always guides conservatively,” said Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research, in a research note. He noted that in 2017, T-Mobile exceeded the high end of its initial expectations on subscriber additions. \nBut Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in a note that cable companies’ entry into the wireless market posed concerns about future growth. Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) already sells mobile service and Charter Communications Inc ( CHTR.O ) plans to enter the market. \n“It is not unreasonable to think that the two cable operators could capture a third of all market growth,” he wrote. “It is not unreasonable to assume that even go-go T-Mobile will see slower subscriber growth.” \nShares were down 2.5 percent to $60.50 in mid-morning trading. \nThe company said it added 891,000 phone subscribers in the fourth quarter, compared with 933,000 a year earlier. \nT-Mobile’s net income was $2.71 billion, or $3.11 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, up from $390 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. \nExcluding items, the company earned 48 cents per share. \nRevenue rose 5.1 percent to $10.76 billion. Analysts, on average, were expecting revenue of $10.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nLast month, the wireless carrier said it had closed on its acquisition of Layer3 TV, a startup that has marketed itself as a next-generation cable service, for an undisclosed amount. It has plans to launch a new streaming service this year.
