Lublin \nWith 16 months until his planned retirement and no successor in sight, Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Robert Iger may extend his tenure for a third time, according to people close to the company. \nSince former chief operating officer and presumed Iger successor Tom Staggs departed last spring, Disney’s board has made no public comments about its progress or process to find a new CEO. \nInside Disney DIS, +1.40% , few think any executives are currently poised to ascend. There also is a widespread belief that it would be difficult for an outsider to get their hands around the world’s largest media conglomerate in less than a year and a half. “The prevailing theory is that Bob will have to extend to train his replacement,” said one Disney executive. “There will be a steep learning curve for whoever comes in and no one believes Bob or the board wants to set someone up to fail.” \nA further extension of Iger’s tenure may be discussed March 8, when Disney holds its annual shareholder meeting, and its directors typically meet.
