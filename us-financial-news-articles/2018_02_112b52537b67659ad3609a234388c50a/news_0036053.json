Everything went well, so just fantastic.”\nThe fifth skier out, Feuz had promised a “full-on attack” of the relatively benign 2.85km piste at the Jeongseon Alpine Center and he duly topped the timesheets with his one minute 40.43 seconds run.\nBut his execution was far from perfect, the 21-year-old said a touch ruefully.\n“We didn’t train on this slope for four days so it was very difficult with the conditions,” he said.\n”I slipped once on the middle part with my inside ski so that was tough.\n“It was in the middle section after the second big jump on the left turn ... and I got pushed to the side and this is where Axel got his three or four tenths of a second.”\nIt was still a competition worthy of an Olympics, the Swiss said, and he could only be philosophical about being beaten by Norwegian great Svindal and Jansrud, the bronze winner at Sochi.\n“To lose against these two Norwegians, there are worse things to happen to me,” he said.\n”They have been on top for years and years.\n“Axel has been hurt several times and we know that on a run like this he is always extremely dangerous, so the two Norwegians are top of my list of competitors.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:48:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
