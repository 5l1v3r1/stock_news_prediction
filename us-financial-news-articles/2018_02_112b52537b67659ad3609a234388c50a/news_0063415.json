(NASDAQ:AKAO), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative infections, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and provided an update on its corporate and clinical development activities.\n\"We gained considerable momentum in 2017 that culminated with FDA acceptance of our plazomicin NDA submission and positive results from our first clinical trial of C-Scape, our second antibacterial product candidate,” said Blake Wise, Achaogen's Chief Executive Officer. “There remains a significant unmet need for the treatment of serious bacterial infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and we look forward to the potential approval of plazomicin this year and the opportunity to make plazomicin available to hospitals and patients in need.”\nRecent Highlights and Upcoming Milestones\nPlazomicin Approval Application (United States) : The FDA accepted for review the Company's New Drug Application (NDA) for plazomicin for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI), including pyelonephritis, and bloodstream infections (BSI) due to certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. Plazomicin previously received FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by certain Enterobacteriaceae in patients who have limited or no alternative treatment options. Plazomicin PDUFA Date : The plazomicin NDA has Priority Review and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is June 25, 2018. Should plazomicin receive approval by the target action date, the Company expects to launch plazomicin soon thereafter. The FDA recently upgraded the status of the plazomicin fill manufacturer, the Pfizer CentreOne McPherson facility, to Voluntary Action Indicated (VAI), clearing a regulatory path for approval of plazomicin out of this facility. The FDA is currently planning to hold an advisory committee meeting to discuss the application.\nPlazomicin Approval Application (European Union) : Achaogen currently plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency in the second half of 2018.\nC-Scape Phase 1 Clinical Trial : Positive top-line results from a Phase 1 clinical trial of C-Scape demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated across all doses studied in the clinical trial, with no drug-drug interaction between ceftibuten and clavulanate when dosed in combination.\nC-Scape Components : C-Scape is an oral combination of ceftibuten, an approved third generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, an approved beta-lactamase inhibitor. C-Scape was awarded Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) status by the FDA for the treatment of cUTI.\nC-Scape Phase 3 Program : Achaogen plans to meet with regulatory agencies in the first half of 2018 to seek agreement on the details of the C-Scape development plan that would include initiating, in 2018, a pivotal trial in patients with cUTI.\nOther Corporate Milestones\nRefinanced an existing $25.0 million debt line with Solar Capital with a new $50.0 million secured debt line with Silicon Valley Bank, which has an interest-only period until at least February 2020. Thermo Fisher Scientific received an Acceptance Review Notification for its 510(k) submission for its assay enabling therapeutic drug management (TDM) of plazomicin. The notification from the FDA confirms that the submission contains all of the necessary information needed to proceed with the substantive review.\nFourth Quarter and Year 2017 Financial Results\nCash Position : At December 31, 2017, Achaogen had $164.8 million in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to $145.9 million at December 31, 2016. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, Achaogen refinanced a $25.0 million secured debt line it had with Solar Capital with a new $50.0 million secured debt line with Silicon Valley Bank. The Company also issued 2,144,454 shares of common stock under its at-the-market equity facility for net proceeds of $24.0 million.\nRevenue : Contract revenue totaled $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $10.7 million for the same period of 2016. Contract revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.2 million compared to $41.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in contract revenue during the fourth quarter and 2017 was primarily due to lower Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) contract revenues. As of December 31, 2017, $11.0 million remains on Option 1 of the BARDA C-Scape contract. Achaogen derived all of its revenue from funding provided under Gates Foundation and U.S. government contracts in connection with the research and development of product candidates.\nResearch and Development (R&D): R&D expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $29.5 million, compared to $17.9 million reported for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses during the quarter was attributable to increased personnel and facility-related costs as net headcount increased, external expenses related to plazomicin product supply and pre-launch activities, C-Scape and early research programs. For the full year 2017, research and development expenses were $95.6 million, compared to $74.0 million for the full year 2016. The increase in 2017 R&D expenses was primarily attributable to increased personnel and facility related costs, increased expenses related to C-Scape and early research programs, offset by decreases related to the plazomicin program.\nGeneral and Administrative (G&A): G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $14.5 million, compared to $4.9 million for the same period in 2016. For the full year 2017, G&A expenses were $41.9 million, compared to $17.1 million for the full year 2016. The increase in G&A expenses for the quarter and the year 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel and facility-related costs, and in costs related to preparation for the commercialization of plazomicin.\nChange in warrant and derivative liabilities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a $5.9 million gain compared to a $17.0 million loss for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily related to non-cash gain for the revaluation of warrants issued in the private placement of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in June 2016.\nNet Loss : Achaogen reported a net loss of $36.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $29.7 million for the same period in 2016. Diluted net loss was $0.98 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to diluted net loss of $1.04 per share for the same period of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $125.6 million, or $3.17 per share, compared to a net loss of $71.2 million, or $3.00 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 42.5 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nConference Call\nThe Company and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.
