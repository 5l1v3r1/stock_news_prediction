Against the euro, however, the dollar is likely to be capped, with U.S.-German yield differentials and monetary policy thoughts to dictate direction.”\nThe dollar was a shade higher at 109.590 yen after rising 0.5 percent overnight. It had gone to as low as 108.460 the previous day during wild swings in global equities.\nThe euro inched up 0.05 percent to $1.2383 after slipping to a two-week low of $1.2314 the previous day.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 89.646, nudged away from a two-week peak of 90.034 set overnight.\nThe Australian dollar was 0.15 percent lower at $0.7893 but still some distance away from a one-month low of $0.7835 plumbed on Tuesday.\nThe pound was little changed at $1.3956 after touching a low of $1.3838 overnight, its weakest since Jan. 19.\nU.S. stocks, the source of the recent global market tumult, bounced about 2 percent on Tuesday after suffering the biggest one-day sell-off in more than six years.
