Though Western countries have said Nasheed’s action against the judge was against the law, they also raised concerns over his trial, which they called unfair.\nNasheed is currently in Britain on medical grounds but is seeking to contest elections against Yameen due by October, posing a big threat to the current president.\nNasheed, a graduate of Britain’s Liverpool University, is well connected in the West and has been able to bring pressure against Yameen’s administration.\nHe even got the help of human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, married to Hollywood actor George Clooney, to expose alleged human rights violation by Yameen’s administration.\nWhat are Yameen’s options now?\nSo far, Yameen has ignored the order, although he has stopped short of saying he will not obey it. He fired two police chiefs who said they would uphold the court verdict last week, however, and continues to jail opposition members.\nOn Sunday, police raided the home of Hassan Saeed, the head of the judicial administration department, which the opposition said was considering a corruption investigation into Yameen. The Supreme Court later annulled the arrest warrant against Saeed.\nMembers of the ruling party have also sought to shut down an independent TV station accusing it of spreading “discord,” sparking a call from the U.S. embassy in Columbo, Sri Lanka, for Yameen’s government to respect the freedom of the press.\nBut in terms of the order, Yameen has limited options. His administration can seek to arrest the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and other judges on corruption allegations, targeting them the same way he has gone after opposition members, Western diplomats who are closely following developments told Reuters.\nThat would allow him to reverse the Supreme Court ruling, but at the risk of exacerbating a constitutional crisis. Close allies of Yameen say his main concern is that former President Nasheed and former Vice President Ahmed Adeeb have said they can prove the current president engaged in past corrupt deals if they are released. Yameen has denied any corruption allegations.\nBut importantly, the army is supporting the president. On Sunday several police and soldiers said in a live broadcast they were ready to sacrifice their lives “in the defense of the lawful government”.\nThe combined opposition says they fear a military takeover of the islands to preserve Yameen’s grip on power.\nWhat is the international reaction so far? What about domestically?\nYameen has ignored calls from the United States and India, among other nations, to heed the court decision on Nasheed. When the Commonwealth pressed Yameen to uphold the rule of law, his government voted for the Maldives to quit the Commonwealth.\nHe has also disregarded all international calls to solve the political crisis through dialogue.\nChina, which has boosted its investments in the Maldives, has so far been silent. But the country is expected to slow down any deals, given concerns about political stability.\nMale, the capital of the Maldives, experienced some minor clashes between protesters and the police, but the streets were quiet over the weekend.\nYameen has sought in the past to suppress protests, and on Sunday the Maldives National Defence Force (MNDF) said it would stop activities that “openly threaten the security and safety of the Maldives”.\nReporting by Rajendra Jadhav and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Rafael Nam and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T22:21:21.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
