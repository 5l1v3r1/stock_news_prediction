CNBC.com Getty Images Eddie Zelaya helps Carmen Ledesma as she shops for a BBQ grill at the Lowe's store on March 1, 2017 in Hialeah, Florida. \nLowe's is giving more than 260,000 hourly employees a one-time bonus of up to $1,000 due to new tax legislation. \nThe payouts are determined on a sliding scale based on a worker's length of service, Lowe's said. Full-time employees will receive more than part-time workers. \nHere's what that sliding scale looks like, a source told CNBC. Lowe's declined to comment on these amounts. Less than 2 years: Full-time employees = $150; Part-time employees = $752 to 4 years: Full-time employees = $200; Part-time employees = $1005 to 9 years: Full-time employees = $300; Part-time employees = $15010 to 14 years: Full-time employees = $500; Part-time employees = $25015 to 19 years: Full-time employees = $750; Part-time employees = $375 20+ years: Full-time employees = $1,000; Part-time employees = $500 \nThe bonuses will be paid later this month, Lowe's told its employees earlier this week. \nThe North Carolina-headquartered company also said it expects to book additional net tax expenses of roughly $75 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This charge, coupled with the bonus payouts, is expected to reduce fourth-quarter earnings by about 14 cents a share, Lowe's said. \nLowe's said it will provide more details on other investments from tax savings in the coming weeks. Lowe's is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:08:24.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
