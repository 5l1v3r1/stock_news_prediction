Its indiscriminate design caused it to spread further, affecting other European and Russian business.”\n“RUSSOPHOBIC CAMPAIGN”\nTariq Ahmad, a junior minister at the foreign ministry, said the attack cost European firms and organizations hundreds of millions of pounds.\n“The Kremlin has positioned Russia in direct opposition to the West: it doesn’t have to be that way,” he said. “We call upon Russia to be the responsible member of the international community it claims to be rather then secretly trying to undermine it.”\nDenmark’s defense minister Claus Hjort Frederiksen was Quote: d as saying he also believed the cyber-attack originated in Russia. ”The Russians have lifted this to a higher level where it’s just about causing damage like in a military attack,” Frederiksen told Ritzau news agency.\nMoscow has previously denied being behind the NotPetya attack. On Thursday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia “categorically denies the allegations”.\n“We consider (them)... groundless. This is nothing more than a continuation of a Russophobic campaign that is without proof,” Peskov told a conference call with reporters.\nThe Washington Post newspaper reported in January that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency attributed the NotPetya attack to Russian military hackers.\nBritish defense minister Gavin Williamson said on Thursday the attack was part of a new era of warfare and Britain had to be ready to respond. “We must be primed and ready to tackle these stark and intensifying threats,” he said in a statement.\nBritain has recently become more vocal about the threat posed by Russia at a time when some members of the ruling Conservative Party have expressed concern about the impact of cuts to defense spending.\nIn November, Prime Minister Theresa May accused Russia of meddling in elections and planting fake stories in the media.\nAdditional reporting by Katya Golubkova in MOSCOW, Andrea Shalal in MUNICH, Teis Jensen in COPENHAGEN and Dustin Volz in WASHINGTON; Editing by William Maclean, Gareth Jones and Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T10:18:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
