It’s a little tough for them because they’ve gotten away with murder for 25 years. But we’re going to be changing policy,” he said. \nTrump said his administration will impose a “reciprocal tax” to charge other countries - “some of them are so-called allies but they’re not allies on trade.” \nRetailers and trade associations have fought a Republican proposal on how imports are taxed because they believe it hurts their businesses and would lead to higher prices for consumers on basic items such as food and clothing. \nRepublicans in the U.S. House of Representatives, as they began to assemble a tax reform plan last year, proposed imposing a 20 percent border-adjustment tax on imports that was designed to offset the value-added tax refunds that some countries grant to their exporters. \nBut the idea was dropped after it ran into stiff opposition from retailers and other industries that depend on imported materials. The National Retail Federation called it a “bad tax” that would “drive up the prices of countless products Americans use every day.” \nLast April on Fox Business Network, Trump suggested that if he said the U.S. would charge a 10 percent or 20 percent border tax “everyone goes crazy, because they like free trade” and added: “But when you say ‘reciprocal tax,’ nobody can get angry ... OK, you say, ‘whatever you charge, we’re charging.'” Reporting by David Shepardson, David Lawder, Makini Brice; editing by Grant McCool", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T20:29:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
