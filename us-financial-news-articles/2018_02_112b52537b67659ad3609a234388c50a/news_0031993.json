Authorities, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund have warned debt levels are a serious threat to the Swedish economy.\nHowever, prices fell in the last few months of 2017 amid a surge in building and tougher mortgage rules.\nThe HOX index is based on a statistical model that compensates for different types of homes sold during various periods to give a better picture of underlying price trends.
