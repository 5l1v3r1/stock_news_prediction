This year it plans to add 700 new stores with a goal of reaching 13,000 by 2021, targeting tourist destinations.\nThe company plans capital expenditure of 9.5-10 billion baht for store expansion, renovation, and investments in new projects in 2018.\nLast week, its cash-and-carry subsidiary Siam Makro Pcl reported 14 percent growth in net profit from a year earlier, reaching 6.18 billion baht.
