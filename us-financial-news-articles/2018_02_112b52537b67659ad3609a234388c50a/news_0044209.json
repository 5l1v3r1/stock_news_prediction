(\"Navios Holdings\" or \"the Company\") (NYSE:NM), a global, vertically integrated seaborne shipping and logistics company, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nAngeliki Frangou, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"I am pleased with the results of the full year and fourth quarter of 2017. For the full year, we reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $463.0 million and $126.8 million, respectively. For the fourth quarter, we reported revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $128.5 million and $46.7 million, respectively. Rates for dry bulk vessels have improved materially, and in Q4 2017 we began to enjoy the effects of healthier charter markets.”\nAngeliki Frangou continued, \"We are expanding our fleet capacity and creating market exposure at an opportune time. During the past nine months, we added nine younger vessels (eight kamsarmaxes and one cape) and sold two older vessels, thereby increasing fleet capacity and improving the average age of our fleet by 11%. We did this using modest capex, as we chartered in the kamsarmaxes, three with favorable purchase options. Also, our chartering strategy created market exposure for 73% of our 22,684 available days in 2018.\"\nHIGHLIGHTS – RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nFleet update – Renewal and Expansion\nNavios Holdings controls a fleet of 72 vessels totaling 7.3 million dwt, of which 39 are owned and 33 are chartered-in under long-term charters (collectively, the \"Core Fleet\"). The fleet consists of 21 Capesize, 31 Panamax, 18 Ultra Handymax and two Handysize vessels, with an average age of 7.7 years, basis fully delivered fleet.\nNavios Holdings agreed to charter-in eight Panamax vessels, five of which under long term time charters and three of which under bareboat charters with purchase options. In January 2018, Navios Holdings took delivery of the first vessel. The remaining seven vessels are expected to be delivered at various dates though the first quarter of 2020.\nIn February 2018, Navios Holdings acquired Navios Equator Prosper, a 2000 built 171,191 dwt vessel, previously a chartered-in vessel, for an acquisition price of $10.0 million.\nFollowing the above transactions, Navios Holdings has increased its fleet capacity by 11% and decreased the average fleet age, basis fully delivered fleet, by 11%. In addition, 70% of the chartered-in fleet has purchase options.\nAs of February 12, 2018, Navios Holdings has chartered-out 65.2% of available days for 2018, out of which 27.0% on fixed rate and 38.2% on index or profit sharing. The average contracted daily charter-in rate for the long-term charter-in vessels for 2018 is $12,952.\nThe above figures do not include the fleet of Navios Logistics and vessels servicing contracts of affreightment.\nExhibit II provides certain details of the Core Fleet of Navios Holdings.

(3) Adjusted Basic Loss per Share for the three months ended December 31, 2016 exclude items referred in footnote (2) as well as a benefit of $46.6 million following the completion of the Series G and Series H Exchange Program. Revenue from dry bulk vessel operations for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $78.6 million as compared to $56.5 million for the same period during 2016. The increase in dry bulk revenue was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in the time charter equivalent (“TCE”) per day by 45.7% to $12,305 per day in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $8,445 per day in the same period of 2016; and (ii) an increase in available days of our fleet by 253 days, mainly due to an increase in long-term charter-in fleet available days.\nRevenue from the logistics business was $49.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $43.0 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) a $11.7 million increase in revenue from the port terminal business mainly due to the commencement of operations at the new iron ore terminal and (ii) a $1.3 million increase in revenue from the cabotage business mainly due to an increase in operating days. The overall increase was partially mitigated by (i) a $4.8 million decrease in revenue from the barge business mainly due to the expiration of certain iron ore transportation contracts; and (ii) a $1.3 million decrease in sales of products mainly due to a decrease in the Paraguayan liquid port's volume of products sold.\nNet Loss of Navios Holdings was $51.6 million and $242.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net Loss was affected by the items described in the table above.

The $15.0 million decrease in Adjusted Net Loss was mainly due to (i) an increase in Adjusted EBITDA by $17.6 million and (ii) an increase in income tax benefit of $2.0 million. This overall increase of $19.6 million was partially mitigated by (i) an increase in interest expense and finance cost, net by $3.6 million; (ii) an increase in depreciation and amortization by $0.8 million; (iii) an increase in amortization for deferred drydock and special survey costs of $0.1 million; and (iv) an increase in share-based compensation expense of $0.1 million.\nNet loss of Navios Logistics was $0.2 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA of Navios Holdings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $17.6 million to $46.7 million as compared to $29.1 million for the same period of 2016. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to (i) a $29.0 million increase in revenue and (ii) a $3.3 million decrease in direct vessel expenses (excluding the amortization of deferred drydock and special survey costs). This overall increase of $32.3 million was partially mitigated by (i) a $7.4 million decrease in equity in net earnings from affiliated companies; (ii) a $2.0 million increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest; (iii) a $1.9 million increase in general and administrative expenses (excluding share-based compensation expenses); (iv) a $1.9 million increase in other income/ (expense), net; and (v) a $1.5 million increase in time charter, voyage and logistics business expenses.\nEBITDA of Navios Logistics was $15.0 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $7.1 million for the same period in 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Results (in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share data and unless otherwise stated):\nThe information for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 presented below was derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the respective periods.\nYear\nEnded Year\nEnded December 31, December 31, 201 7 201 6 (unaudited) (unaudited) Revenue $ 463,049 $ 419,782 Net Loss $ (165,910 ) $ (303,823 ) Adjusted Net Loss $ (107,971 ) (1 ) $ (106,130 ) (4 ) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 50,784 $ 36,920 EBITDA $ 68,813 $ (62,827 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 126,752 (1 ) $ 129,173 (3 ) Basic Loss per Share $ (1.50 ) $ (2.54 ) Adjusted Basic Loss per Share $ (1.01 ) (2 ) $ (1.14 ) (4 )\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 exclude (i) $36.3 million of impairment losses of one vessel and an intangible asset; (ii) $14.2 million impairment losses on the sale of Navios Ionian and Navios Horizon; (iii) $4.7 million non-cash impairment losses relating to our affiliates; and (iv) bond extinguishment losses of $2.7 million.

The increase in dry bulk revenue was mainly attributable to (i) the increase in TCE per day by 18.1% to $9,705 per day in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $8,220 per day in the same period in 2016; and (ii) an increase in available days of our fleet by 1,525 days, mainly due to an increase in long-term charter-in fleet available days.\nRevenue from the logistics business was $212.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $220.3 million for the same period during 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to (i) a $22.9 million decrease in revenue from barge business mainly due to the expiration of certain iron ore transportation contracts and (ii) a $4.5 million decrease in revenue from the cabotage business mainly due to a decrease in operating days of the cabotage fleet. The overall decrease was partially mitigated by (i) a $17.2 million increase in port terminal revenue due to the commencement of operations at the new iron ore terminal and (ii) a $2.5 million increase in sales of products mainly due to an increase in the Paraguayan liquid port's volume of products sold.\nNet Loss of Navios Holdings was $165.9 million and $303.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The $1.9 million increase in Adjusted Net Loss was mainly due to (i) an increase in interest expense and finance cost, net of $6.1 million; (ii) a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $2.4 million; (iii) an increase of $1.0 million in share-based compensation expense; and (iv) an increase of $0.9 million in amortization for deferred drydock and special survey costs. This overall increase was partially offset by (i) an increase in income tax benefit of $4.5 million; and (ii) a decrease in depreciation and amortization of $4.0 million.\nNet Income of Navios Logistics was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.2 million for the same period in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA of Navios Holdings for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $2.4 million to $126.8 million as compared to $129.2 million for the same period of 2016.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. Adjusted Loss and Adjusted Basic Loss per Share represent Net Loss and Basic Loss per Share, excluding certain items as described under “Earnings Highlights”. We use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as liquidity measures and reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable U.S. GAAP liquidity measure. EBITDA is calculated as follows: net cash provided by operating activities adding back, when applicable and as the case may be, the effect of (i) net increase/(decrease) in operating assets, (ii) net (increase)/decrease in operating liabilities, (iii) net interest cost, (iv) deferred finance charges and gains/(losses) on bond and debt extinguishment, (v) (provision)/recovery for losses on accounts receivable, (vi) equity in affiliates, net of dividends received, (vii) payments for drydock and special survey costs, (viii) noncontrolling interest, (ix) gain/ (loss) on sale of assets/ subsidiaries, (x) unrealized (loss)/gain on derivatives, and (xi) loss on sale and reclassification to earnings of available-for-sale securities and impairment charges. Navios Holdings believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are a basis upon which liquidity can be assessed and represents useful information to investors regarding Navios Holdings’ ability to service and/or incur indebtedness, pay capital expenditures, meet working capital requirements and pay dividends. Navios Holdings also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used (i) by prospective and current lessors as well as potential lenders to evaluate potential transactions; (ii) to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates; and (iii) by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented to provide additional information with respect to the ability of Navios Holdings to satisfy its respective obligations, including debt service, capital expenditures, working capital requirements and pay dividends. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as measures of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements, the definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA used here may not be comparable to those used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as an analytical tool, and therefore, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of Navios Holdings’ results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the amounts necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt and other financing arrangements; and (iii) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures. Because of these limitations, among others, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a principal indicator of Navios Holdings’ performance. Furthermore, our calculation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation.\nNavios Logistics EBITDA is used to measure its operating performance.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA of Navios Holdings (including Navios Logistics) and EBITDA of Navios Logistics on a
