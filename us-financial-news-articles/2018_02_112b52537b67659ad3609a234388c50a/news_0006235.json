Previous investors Greylock and Index also participated. The company will use the new capital to fuel its ongoing growth in the enterprise.\nFigma's mission is to make design accessible to anyone in the world. Over the past decade technology has made software easier and cheaper to develop and profoundly changed how consumers engage with digital experiences. Yet, the way these experiences are created has not kept pace.\nAs the only cloud-based tool for design, prototyping and collaboration, Figma offers a new way of achieving a shared understanding around design that results in great user experiences and happier teams. Since launching out of stealth in 2016, Figma simplified collaboration across the entire design process for thousands of companies and millions of users, including designers, developers, product manager, marketers and others.\n\"Figma makes the design process more open and collaborative, so teams can develop and bring new products to market faster,\" said Mamoon Hamid, general partner and managing director at Kleiner Perkins. \"In many respects, Figma's traction and potential remind me of Slack at this stage. I'm thrilled to be joining Figma's board to help the company navigate its exciting future.\"\nFigma is Hamid's first investment since joining Kleiner Perkins as General Partner in August 2017. His previous investments include high-growth enterprise SaaS companies such as Box, Slack, and Intercom.\n\"We're only at the beginning of our journey, and I can't imagine a better partner than Kleiner Perkins and Mamoon,\" said Dylan Field, Figma's CEO. \"Mamoon meshes well with Figma's culture and will bring another level of rigor to Figma's data-driven operations.\"\nFigma's customer base spans individual designers to teams at Fortune 50 companies. While Figma's users share many common challenges, larger teams face additional complexity. Figma will be using this round to invest in innovations to continue to make the adoption of open design seamless.\nAbout Figma\nFigma is the open design company founded in 2012 by Dylan Field and Evan Wallace. With our cloud-based screen design tool, teams achieve a shared understanding around design without worrying about syncing, exporting or installing software. Anyone involved in the product development process can share always up-to-date files with a link. That makes it easy to collaborate on the latest designs and prototypes and see their code attributes. Figma has simplified collaboration across the entire design process for thousands of companies like Microsoft, Slack and Uber and millions of users, including designers, developers, product managers, marketers and others.
