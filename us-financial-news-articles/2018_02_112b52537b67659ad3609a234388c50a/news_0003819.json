Hebei will strictly carry out the production restriction issued by central government,” the statement said.\nUnder Beijing’s winter production restrictions, steel mills were ordered to cut output by as much as 50 percent from mid-November to mid-March, as part of the country’s effort to combat air pollution.\nSome local media reported on Wednesday that the production curb on steel sectors would be extended until mid-May.
