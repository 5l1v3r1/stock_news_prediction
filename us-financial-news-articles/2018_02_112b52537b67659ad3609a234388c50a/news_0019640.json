Fourth quarter and full year highlights include:\nRevenue of $1.78 billion, at the high end of previously provided guidance Software revenue up 1% driven by cloud revenue growth of 6%; Full year net ACV of $67 million, up 46% from $46 million in the prior year GAAP diluted EPS of $(0.38), includes $130 million non-cash charge related to US tax reform; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.92, at the high end of previously provided guidance Services gross margin expansion of 280 basis points Full year cash flow from operations of $755 million, and free cash flow of $453 million, both within previously provided guidance $300 million share repurchase planned for 2018 with $125 million completed to date 2018 guidance announced\n“Our fourth quarter results were consistent with our guidance and reflect continued momentum in strategic areas such as cloud and Services margin expansion,” said Chairman and CEO Bill Nuti. “While ATM revenue was lower than expected in 2017, growth in unattached software, cloud, and recurring revenues, allowed us to build a stronger foundation going into 2018. NCR continues to position itself as one of the world’s largest cloud companies facilitating omni-channel commerce and digital transformation, and our SaaS solutions are gaining traction as evidenced by consistent double digit net ACV growth. We enter 2018 excited about the year ahead and confident in our company strategy. As such, we are also announcing our repurchase of up to $300 million of shares in 2018.”\n“Going forward, we are focused on improving execution and we will leverage our growing strength in cloud, combined with our end-to-end smart edge hardware and services solution assets to deliver unmatched value in the markets we serve, as businesses of every size undergo Omni-Channel, digital enablement, and channel transformation journeys,” said President and COO Mark Benjamin. “As we do this in 2018, we will also prioritize driving sustainable margin improvement in our hardware and services segments via specific programs targeted at driving higher productivity, process efficiency, and, using technology as an enabler. As we finalize these restructuring programs, we plan to achieve run-rate savings of approximately $150 million per year by 2020.”\nIn this release, we use certain performance metrics as well as certain non-GAAP measures, including presenting certain measures on a constant currency and adjusted constant currency basis. The performance metrics include net annual contract value (or Net ACV) and the non-GAAP measures include free cash flow and others with the words “non-GAAP,” “adjusted,” or “constant currency” in their titles. The performance metrics are listed and described, and the non-GAAP measures are listed, described, and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, under the heading “Performance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures” later in this release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operating Results\nRevenue\nFourth quarter revenue of $1.78 billion was down 1% year-over-year. Foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable impact on the revenue comparison of 2%.\nThe following table shows the revenue by segment :\n$ in millions 2017 2016 % Change % Change\nConstant\nCurrency\nSoftware License $ 95 $ 103 (8 %) (10 %) Software Maintenance 96 96 — % (2 %) Cloud 156 147 6 % 6 % Professional Services 161 156 3 % 1 % Software Revenue $ 508 $ 502 1 % — % Services Revenue $ 619 $ 598 4 % 2 % ATM $ 303 $ 385 (21 %) (22 %) SCO 131 132 (1 %) (1 %) POS 218 177 23 % 20 % IPS 3 8 (63 %) (63 %) Hardware Revenue $ 655 $ 702 (7 %) (9 %) Total Revenue $ 1,782 $ 1,802 (1 %) (3 %) Software revenue was up 1% primarily due to cloud revenue growth of 6% and professional services revenue growth of 3%. This was partially offset by lower software license revenue of 8% due to lower software license revenue associated with lower hardware sales.\nServices revenue was up 4% driven by hardware maintenance and implementation services growth as a result of continued momentum in channel transformation trends.\nHardware revenue was down 7% due to a 21% decline in ATM revenue and a 1% decline in SCO revenue, partially offset by a 23% increase in POS revenue. ATM revenue reflected the lower backlog starting the quarter, but was better than expected. SCO revenue was roughly flat, as expected, but grew 66% sequentially from the third quarter of 2017. POS revenue continued its momentum and was up significantly in the quarter due to product replacements and new product introductions.\nGross Margin\nFourth quarter gross margin of $515 million increased 8% from $479 million. Gross margin rate was 28.9%, up from 26.6%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our annual pension mark-to-market adjustment was $1 million of benefit compared to $38 million of cost in the prior year.\nFourth quarter gross margin (non-GAAP) of $527 million decreased 1% from $530 million. Gross margin rate (Non-GAAP) was 29.6%, up from 29.4%. The increase in gross margin rate (non-GAAP) was primarily due to continued focus on productivity improvements in our Services segment, partially offset by lower software license revenue, decreased ATM volumes and new product introductions.\nExpenses\nFourth quarter operating expenses of $334 million increased from $333 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, our annual pension mark-to-market adjustment was $29 million of expense compared to $47 million of expense in the prior year.\nFourth quarter operating expenses (non-GAAP) of $284 million increased from $266 million. The increases in expenses were due to increased sales investment as we expand our strategic offers and go-to-market strategy.\nOperating Income\nFourth quarter operating income of $181 million increased 24% from $146 million. Operating margin rate was 10.2%, up from 8.1%. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded our annual pension mark-to-market adjustment which was $28 million compared to $85 million in the prior year.\nFourth quarter operating income (non-GAAP) of $243 million decreased 8% from $264 million. Operating margin rate (non-GAAP) was 13.6%, down from 14.7%. Operating margin rate (non-GAAP) reflected lower software license revenue, decreased ATM volumes and increased sales investment partially offset by continued services margin expansion. For the full year, operating margin rate (non-GAAP) increased and is expected to expand in 2018.\nOther (Expense)\nFourth quarter other (expense) of $50 million decreased 12% from $57 million. Fourth quarter other (expense) (non-GAAP) of $50 million decreased 11% from $56 million. These decreases were primarily due to higher foreign currency losses in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense and Impact of US Tax Reform\nFourth quarter income tax expense of $164 million increased from $17 million. Income tax expense includes a $130 million non-cash charge related to the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. The non-cash charge represents a provisional amount and NCR’s current best estimate, which may be refined and adjusted over the course of 2018.\nFourth quarter income tax expense (non-GAAP) of $49 million increased from $36 million in the prior year. Income tax expense (non-GAAP) increased due to more favorable discrete benefits in the prior year period.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR\nFourth quarter net loss from continuing operations attributable to NCR was $35 million decreased from net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR of $68 million in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR (non-GAAP) of $142 million decreased from $168 million.\nCash Flow\nFourth quarter cash provided by operating activities of $484 million decreased from $525 million. Free cash flow was $402 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to $449 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter cash flow was strong, but was lower than the prior year due to a $100 million working capital improvement in the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year cash provided by operating activities was $755 million, and full year free cash flow was $453 million, both within previously provided guidance.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring 2018, NCR plans to repurchase up to $300 million of its common stock under its previously authorized share repurchase programs, and has repurchased shares of its common stock for approximately $125 million through the date of this release.\nFull Year 2018 Outlook\nIn 2018, our revenue growth is expected to be 0% to 3%. Our GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $2.08 to $2.48, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $3.30 to $3.45. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 24% for 2018 compared to 25% in 2017. The decrease is due to the expected impact of U.S. tax reform. Free cash flow is expected to be approximately 90% of non-GAAP net income.\nTo accelerate our transformation journey, we are evaluating programs to prioritize driving sustainable margin improvement in our hardware and services segments targeted at driving higher productivity, process efficiency, and, using technology as an enabler. As we finalize these programs, NCR expects to incur a related pre-tax charge over the next two years in the range of approximately $200 million to $250 million, with $100 million to $150 million in 2018, that will be included in income from operations. The cash impact of the restructuring plan is expected to be approximately $150 million to $200 million over the next two years, with $100 million in 2018. We plan to achieve run-rate savings of approximately $150 million per year by 2020. The estimate of the pre-tax charges and cash impact has been included in our 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance.\nQ1 2018 Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, revenue growth is expected to be down 1% to up 2%, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.16 to $0.29, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.41 to $0.47.\nNCR will provide additional information regarding its first quarter and full year 2018 guidance during its fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast.\n2017 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nA conference call is scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. (EDT) to discuss the fourth quarter 2017 results and guidance for first quarter and full year 2018.

Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. The Company does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nPerformance Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nPerformance Metrics. The term “net annual contract value” or “net ACV” for any particular period means NCR’s net bookings for cloud revenue during the period, and is calculated as twelve months of expected subscription revenues under new cloud contracts during such period less twelve months of subscription revenues under cloud contracts that expired or were terminated during such period, adjusted for twelve months of expected pricing discounts or price increases from renewals of existing contracts. Net ACV is a forward-looking measure that NCR tracks and discloses as an indicator of potential cloud revenue growth in future periods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures. While NCR reports its results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, or GAAP, in this release NCR also uses the non-GAAP measures listed and described below.\nNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS), Gross Margin (non-GAAP), Gross Margin Rate (non-GAAP), Operating Expenses (non-GAAP), Operating Income (non-GAAP), Operating Margin Rate (non-GAAP), Other (Expense) (non-GAAP), Income Tax Expense (non-GAAP), and Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (non-GAAP). NCR’s non-GAAP diluted EPS, gross margin (non-GAAP), gross margin rate (non-GAAP), operating expenses (non-GAAP), operating income (non-GAAP), operating margin rate (non-GAAP), other (expense) (non-GAAP), income tax expense (non-GAAP), and net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR (non-GAAP) are determined by excluding, as applicable, pension mark-to-market adjustments, pension settlements, pension curtailments and pension special termination benefits and other special items, including amortization of acquisition related intangibles, from NCR’s GAAP earnings per share, gross margin, gross margin rate, expenses, income from operations, operating margin rate, other (expense), income tax expense and net income from continuing operations attributable to NCR, respectively. Due to the non-operational nature of these pension and other special items, NCR’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate year-over-year operating performance. NCR also uses operating income (non-GAAP) and diluted EPS (non-GAAP), to manage and determine the effectiveness of its business managers and as a basis for incentive compensation. NCR believes these measures are useful for investors because they provide a more complete understanding of NCR’s underlying operational performance, as well as consistency and comparability with NCR’s past reports of financial results.\nFree Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow as a Percentage of Non-GAAP Net Income (or Free Cash Flow Conversion Rate). NCR defines free cash flow as net cash provided by/used in operating activities and cash flow provided by/used in discontinued operations less capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, additions to capitalized software, discretionary pension contributions and pension settlements. NCR’s management uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the Company and believes it is useful for investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the Company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures which can be used for, among other things, investment in the Company’s existing businesses, strategic acquisitions, strengthening the Company’s balance sheet, repurchase of Company stock and repayment of the Company’s debt obligations. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since there may be other nondiscretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure. NCR also describes the ratio of free cash flow to non-GAAP net income (or free cash flow conversion rate), which is calculated as free cash flow divided by non-GAAP net income. NCR’s management targets an annual free cash flow conversion rate at or above the range described in this release because management believes that a conversion rate at or above that range represents the efficient conversion of non-GAAP net income to free cash flow for its business. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate do not have uniform definitions under GAAP and, therefore, NCR’s definitions may differ from other companies’ definitions of these measures.\nConstant Currency, IPS Divestiture and Adjusted Constant Currency. NCR presents certain financial measures, such as period-over-period revenue growth, on a constant currency basis, which excludes the effects of foreign currency translation by translating prior period results at current period monthly average exchange rates. Due to the overall variability of foreign exchange rates from period to period, NCR’s management uses constant currency measures to evaluate period-over-period operating performance on a more consistent and comparable basis. NCR also presents certain financial measures on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes both the effects of foreign currency translation, as described above, and the results of NCR’s Interactive Printer Solutions (IPS) business for the comparable prior period after completion of the sale of the business (which results were previously included in NCR’s Hardware segment). NCR completed the sale of all but the Middle East and Africa assets of its Interactive Printer Solutions (IPS) division to Atlas Holdings LLC on May 27, 2016. NCR’s management believes that presentation of financial measures without these results is more representative of the company’s period-over-period operating performance, and provides additional insight into historical and/or future performance, which may be helpful for investors.\nNCR’s definitions and calculations of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly-titled measures reported by other companies and cannot, therefore, be compared with similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for, or superior to, results determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the tables below.\nReconciliation of Gross Margin (GAAP) to Gross Margin (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Gross Margin (GAAP) $ 515 $ 479 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 13 13 Pension mark-to-market adjustments (1 ) 38 Gross Margin (Non-GAAP) $ 527 $ 530 Reconciliation of Gross Margin Rate (GAAP) to Gross Margin Rate (non-GAAP)\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 Gross Margin Rate (GAAP) 28.9 % 26.6 % Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 0.7 % 0.7 % Pension mark-to-market adjustments — % 2.1 % Gross Margin Rate (Non-GAAP) 29.6 % 29.4 % Reconciliation of Operating Expenses (GAAP) to Operating Expenses (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Operating Expenses (GAAP) $ 334 $ 333 Transformation/Restructuring Costs (3 ) (3 ) Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles (16 ) (15 ) Acquisition-related costs (2 ) (2 ) Pension mark-to-market adjustments (29 ) (47 ) Operating Expenses (Non-GAAP) $ 284 $ 266 Reconciliation of Income from Operations (GAAP) to Operating Income (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Income from Operations (GAAP) $ 181 $ 146 Transformation/Restructuring Costs 3 3 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 29 28 Acquisition-related costs 2 2 Pension mark-to-market adjustments 28 85 Operating Income (Non-GAAP) $ 243 $ 264 Reconciliation of Operating Margin rate (GAAP) to Operating Margin rate (non-GAAP)\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 Operating Margin rate (GAAP) 10.2 % 8.1 % Transformation/Restructuring Costs 0.2 % 0.2 % Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 1.6 % 1.6 % Acquisition-related costs — % 0.1 % Pension mark-to-market adjustments 1.6 % 4.7 % Operating Margin rate (Non-GAAP) 13.6 % 14.7 % Reconciliation of Other (Expense) (GAAP) to Other (Expense) (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Other (Expense) (GAAP) $ (50 ) $ (57 ) Divestiture and liquidation losses — 1 Other (Expense) (Non-GAAP) $ (50 ) $ (56 ) Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense (GAAP) to Income Tax Expense (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Income Tax Expense (GAAP) $ 164 $ 17 Transformation/Restructuring Costs 2 2 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 9 9 Acquisition-related costs 1 — Pension mark-to-market adjustments 3 7 Divestiture and liquidation losses — 1 Impact of U.S. tax reform (130 ) — Income Tax Expense (Non-GAAP) $ 49 $ 36 Reconciliation of Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (GAAP) to\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (non-GAAP)\n$ in millions Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Net (Loss) Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (GAAP) $ (35 ) $ 68 Transformation/Restructuring Costs 1 1 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 20 19 Acquisition-related costs 1 2 Pension mark-to-market adjustments 25 78 Impact of U.S. tax reform 130 — Net Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to NCR (Non-GAAP) $ 142 $ 168 Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings Per Share (GAAP) to Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP)\nQ4 2017\nActual\nQ4 2016\nActual\n2017\nActual\n2016\nActual\nQ1 2018\nGuidance (2)\n2018\nGuidance (2)\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (GAAP) (1) $ (0.38 ) $ 0.43 $ 1.01 $ 1.80 $0.16 - $0.29 $2.08 - $2.48 Transformation/Restructuring Costs 0.01 0.01 0.13 0.13 0.05 - 0.09 0.50 - 0.75 Acquisition-related amortization of intangibles 0.13 0.12 0.51 0.53 0.10 0.42 Acquisition-related costs 0.01 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.01 0.05 Deemed dividends related to Blackstone transaction — — 0.39 — — — Divestiture and liquidation losses — — — 0.03 — — Pension mark-to-market adjustments 0.16 0.50 0.16 0.50 — — Impact of U.S. tax reform 0.85 — 0.84 — — — Diluted Earnings Per Share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.92 $ 1.07 $ 3.20 $ 3.02 $0.41 - $0.47 $3.30 - $3.45 (1) Non-GAAP diluted EPS is determined using the conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock in the calculation of weighted average diluted shares outstanding.
