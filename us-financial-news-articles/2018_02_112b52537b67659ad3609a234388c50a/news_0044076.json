The composites plant, a joint $100 million investment with Albany International, was built to meet record order books for new LEAP engines and an increase in production rates requested by planemakers, especially Boeing’s 737 MAX.

It’s a possibility and will depend on demand,” Petitcolin told reporters. The new plant, the third joint venture between the firms, was officially inaugurated on Wednesday but already delivered its first parts in October. It makes 3D woven composite fan blades for the LEAP engine from CFM International.
