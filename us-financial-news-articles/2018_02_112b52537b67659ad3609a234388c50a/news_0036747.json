The result enabled Washington State to share the Pac-12 basement with California.\nViont‘e Daniels contributed 10 points for the Cougars, which won despite making just 40.3 percent of their field-goal attempts and only 7-of 29 from 3-point range. Washington State was also outrebounded 39-33 but converted 15 Buffs turnovers into 18 points.\nMcKinley Wright IV and Dallas Walton each scored 16 points to pace Colorado, while Namon Wright hit for 12. The Buffaloes (15-11, 7-7) shot poorly, sinking only 40 percent from the field and 3 of 18 on 3-pointers. They did a good deal of work at the foul line, canning 26 of 35 attempts.\nKing was held to nine points, nearly five under his average, although he did grab a game-high 11 rebounds.\nNeither team led by more than four points in a first half that featured four ties and five lead changes. Washington State edged out to a 25-21 lead with 6:09 remaining after Flynn canned a jumper, but Colorado rattled off eight unanswered points and grabbed a 29-25 advantage when Wright converted a three-point play at the 4:59 mark.\nThe Buffaloes didn’t score for the half’s remainder. The Cougars weren’t able to take full advantage of that drought, though, managing only five points. A foul shot by Kwinton Hinson with one second left enabled Washington State to take a 30-29 edge into the locker room.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T14:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T14:50:14.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
