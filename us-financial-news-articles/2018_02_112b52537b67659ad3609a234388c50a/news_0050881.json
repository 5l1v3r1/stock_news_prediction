Oil product stockpiles, including gasoline and distillate fuels, are all expected to decline.\nDespite the rising U.S. output, overall oil markets remain well supported due to healthy demand growth and supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that started last year to draw down excess global inventories.\n\"A roughly balanced market is anticipated in calendar year 2018, with the risks around that view tilted towards surplus,\" mining and energy giant BHP said in its economic and commodity outlook for the year, published this week.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Tom Hogue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T11:08:21.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
