The Pistons shot 52.4 percent from the field while Miami connected on 48.4 percent of its shots.\nMiami’s starting center, Hassan Whiteside, missed the game with an illness. Detroit’s bench was depleted by the absences of rookie guard Luke Kennard (foot) and Dwight Buycks (illness).\nSmith scored 16 first-half points as Detroit led 54-50 at halftime. Drummond also reached his double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds.\nDragic scored 15 third-quarter points, giving Miami a 77-76 edge. The Pistons got on a roll at the start of the fourth, going on an 8-0 run in the first two minutes. Galloway made a jumper, and Drummond supplied a putback and a layup sandwiching a Tolliver dunk.\nThe Heat reeled off seven unanswered points midway through the quarter to tie it at 93-all. Wayne Ellington’s 3-pointer with 4:16 left gave Miami a 99-96 lead. Stanley Johnson’s three-point play moved Detroit back in front 101-99.\nDrummond’s dunk in transition off a Griffin feed made it 105-101. Griffin’s first points of the second half, a three, gave Detroit a seven-point lead. A Smith 3-pointer clinched the Detroit win.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:43:34.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
