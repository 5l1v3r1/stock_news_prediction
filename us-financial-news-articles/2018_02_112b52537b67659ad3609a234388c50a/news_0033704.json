Getting out of that mindset is quite helpful to commodities,” Jeffrey Sherman, deputy chief investment officer at DoubleLine, said about the multiyear decline in the broad commodities market which bottomed in January 2016.\nIndeed, the Consumer Price Index, a key indicator of inflation trends, jumped 0.5 percent in January, well above market expectations, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday.\nThe Broad Basket fund category invests across the breadth of the commodities markets: metals (e.g., nickel, copper), energy products (e.g., crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, natural gas) agricultural products (e.g., cotton, sugar, soybeans, wheat, live cattle).\nThe demand for commodities has also filtered through hedge funds. Hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by Credit Suisse.\nMajor money managers DoubleLine and Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco) have expressed their bullishness around commodities.\nIn a Dec. 5 webcast, DoubleLine chief executive Jeffrey Gundlach, known as Wall Street’s Bond King, told investors that commodities were attractive relative to U.S. stocks, which have been in a multiyear bull market.\nWall Street had wildly volatile trading last week that pushed the market into correction territory. Since Thursday, the S&P 500 has surged 4.56 percent, its strongest four-session performance since mid-2016. The index remains down about 6 percent from its record high on Jan. 26.\nGundlach also said in December that commodities prices historically have surged late in past economic cycles. Assets of the DoubleLine Strategic Commodity Fund, launched in May 2015, have grown from around $30 million as recently as last December to the current $207 million.\nMihir Worah, Pimco’s CIO of asset allocation and real return, has said “we know historically commodities do well in the late stages of an expansion as supply bottlenecks fail to keep up with demand growth.” (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:57:20.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
