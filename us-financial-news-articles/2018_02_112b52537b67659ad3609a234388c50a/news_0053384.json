O‘Keeffe decided that Ryan Crotty would have scored a try in the corner but for a head-high tackle by the Chiefs’ replacement loose forward Lachlan Boshier, who was subsequently sin-binned in the season-opener for both teams. Boshier was the third player handed a 10-minute penalty by O‘Keeffe during the intense encounter with Crusaders’ flyhalf Richie Mo‘unga and prop Alan Ala‘alatoa both spending time on the sidelines for the defending champions during the first half. The major sub-plot prior to the match had focussed on whether Damian McKenzie or Mo‘unga, who are considered to be the main flyhalf contenders to backup Beauden Barrett for the All Blacks later in the season, stamped their authority on the game. Both made searing breaks into open field. Both kicked intelligently and allowed their backlines to function. McKenzie’s pace, instinctive play and attacking from closer to the line created issues for the Crusaders defence. Mo‘unga looked the more composed under pressure. Mo‘unga, however, also received the Crusaders’ first yellow card after he made a try-saving tackle but was then adjudged by O‘Keeffe to have committed a professional foul by playing the ball while on the ground. The Crusaders, however, did not concede while he was sidelined and actually extended their lead to 19-3 when Jordan Taufua scored his side’s third try after Matt Todd and Mo‘unga had both crossed earlier in the opening spell. Chiefs captain Sam Cane then gave his side the spark they needed when he was put into the open from 30-metres out and crashed over in the tackle of George Bridge. O‘Keeffe then dispatched Ala‘alatoa to the sidelines -- for a head-high tackle on McKenzie with a swinging arm -- which allowed the visitors to exploit the extra man and put winger Solomon Alaimalo across to head into the break at 19-17 down. Neither side was able to break down the defences in the second half until McKenzie slotted his second penalty to put the Chiefs ahead for the first and only time of the game. Crusaders’ captain Sam Whitelock then swung the game back his side’s way when he smashed over for their fourth try and then turned down kickable penalties in the final 15 minutes to set up attacking lineouts, one of which led to the penalty try. Bridge and replacement winger Manasa Mataele then grabbed two intercept tries to blow the scoreline out as the hosts capitalised on Waikato’s attempts to launch long-range attacks.
