The most successful U.S. ski racer of all time said tragedies like the one at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman opened fire on Wednesday, had become depressingly routine in the United States. “I feel like these headlines are all too often the first thing I see when I wake up,” she told reporters after her super-G race on Saturday. “I can’t understand it and it’s so devastating for everyone in Florida and everyone involved.” “I am sending them my best. America is behind you.” Vonn finished sixth in Saturday’s super-G but is set to compete in the women’s downhill, where she is a favorite, on Wednesday.
