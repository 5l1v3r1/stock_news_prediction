Yakult also announced a 36 billion Japanese yen ($335.76 million) share buyback program in which Danone will participate.\nThe French group will retain a 7 percent stake in Yakult.\nAlong with Swiss food group Nestle and Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever, Danone has been facing investor pressure to boost shareholder returns.\nDanone has lagged behind the growth of some rivals, largely due to weakness in its European dairy business in the face of sluggish demand and private label competition.\n$1 = 107.2200 yen Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta Editing by Laurence Frost\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:38:54.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
