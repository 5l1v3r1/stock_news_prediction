Switzerland, the fourth EFTA member, doesn’t belong to the EEA. \nNorway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, which is seeking to attract more oil firms to explore in the Arctic Barents Sea, taxes companies heavily when they start producing. \n“This means that if income is derived from petroleum activity taxed at a rate of 78 percent, the state, through the tax system, should cover a corresponding share of the cost incurred to earn this income,” the ministry said. \nWithout such a “neutral” system, the high rate on income could hinder profitable investments, it added. \nBellona was not immediately available for comment, but said in its complaint that “the state, in its capacity as tax collector, cannot be viewed as a market operator that may trade benefit for future gain.” Reporting by Nerijus Adomaitis; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:27:04.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
