Ares, CVC Credit and HSBC joined as arrangers.\nThis is the third deal in the Park Square Capital and SMBC joint venture since it launched in mid-2017 to provide unitranche loans to European mid-market companies. At the time, Thomson Reuters LPC reported it was targeting a size of €3bn.\nThe joint venture reunited two former GE colleagues, Howard Sharp, Park Square’s head of mid-market direct lending and Owen Verrier-Jones, SMBC’s head of sponsor coverage and origination, who both joined their respective firms from GE Capital in 2015.\nCVC acquired Wireless Logic from ECI Partners in 2015, backed with a £75m financing provided by Ares Management and GE Capital, split between a £65m unitranche facility and a £10m working capital and acquisition facility.\nWireless Logic is a leading European machine to machine and internet of things managed services platform provider.\nEditing by Christopher Mangham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:32:09.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
