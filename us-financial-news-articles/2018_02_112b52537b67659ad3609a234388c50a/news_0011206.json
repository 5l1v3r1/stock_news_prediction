Against the euro, however, the dollar is likely to be capped, with U.S.-German yield differentials and monetary policy thoughts to dictate direction.” \nThe dollar was 0.2 percent lower at 109.310 yen after rising 0.5 percent overnight. It was still comfortably above the low of 108.460 reached the previous day during wild swings in global equities. \nAgainst the yen, a perennial haven in times of risk aversion, the dollar had been put on the defensive when equities slid at the start of the week. \nWall Street shares bounced about 2 percent on Tuesday after suffering the biggest one-day sell-off in more than six years. [.N] \nFocus remains on U.S. stocks, which were the source of the latest turbulence in global markets and currencies. \nThe recent surge in long-term U.S. bond yields to four-year highs had helped trigger the slide in the equity market, and while yields have pulled back from those peaks, they still remain elevated. \n“The 10-year Treasury yield has nudged back ahead of today’s auction. Depending on how the auction goes, U.S. equities could face renewed pressure,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. \nFollowing soft demand for a $26 billion three-year sale on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury will auction $24 billion of 10-year government bonds later on Wednesday. \n“Global stocks are expected to remain on a nervous footing going forward,” Noji said. \nThe Australian dollar was 0.2 percent lower at $0.7889 but still some distance away from a one-month low of $0.7835 plumbed on Tuesday. \nThe pound nudged up 0.05 percent to $1.3961 after touching a low of $1.3838 overnight, its weakest since Jan. 19. \nThe Swiss franc, a perceived safe haven along with the yen, was steady at 0.9355 franc per dollar after losing 0.45 percent overnight.
