REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini The Canadian team will look to Osborne-Paradis for leadership following last month’s withdrawal from the Games of Erik Guay, Canada’s most successful Alpine skier, with back pain just two days after being selected for the team.\nThat opens the door for newcomers like 23-year-old Broderick Thompson, who qualified for his first Olympics in the first two downhills of the season, and said the course’s grippy snow favours the Canadian team’s strength as turners.\n“We push each other every day and try to make each other faster,” he said.\n”We spend a lot of time together and we’re really close.\n“We get on each other’s nerves every once in a while but you’re always there for each other.”\nThe men’s downhill will be held on Sunday.\nReporting by Rory Carroll\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:30:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
