The pay controversy has been a major news story in Britain.\nBBC managers deny there is systemic gender discrimination on pay at the corporation.\nDirector-General Tony Hall, appearing before the media committee just after Gracie, said the BBC would introduce pay transparency so that staff would know what pay levels were for different jobs and where they sat within pay bands.\n“AS WELL AS ANY MAN”\nFILE PHOTO - A woman is reflected as she passes the BBC's Broadcasting House in London, Britain July 19, 2017. REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo Gracie, 55, who has reported on China for three decades and speaks fluent Mandarin, said that during a protracted grievance procedure the BBC sought to justify her pay being lower than that of male peers by saying she was “in development”.\nShe described that as an insult.\nGracie said that when she took on the job of China editor in late 2013 she was given assurances that she would be paid equally to men in equivalent roles.\nFILE PHOTO - A man enters BBC New Broadcasting House in London November 11, 2012. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor “I knew I would do the job at least as well as any man,” she said.\nBut last July she discovered that she was in fact paid significantly less than her two direct male counterparts.\nGracie told the lawmakers she had been offered a hefty pay rise but had turned it down because her fight was not about money, it was about ensuring the BBC changed its practices and delivered equal pay for equal work for all men and women.\n“All I want is for them to say ‘we value your work in China equally with your male peers,'” she said.\nShe added that having spent much of her career standing up to censorship, harassment and intimidation by the Chinese state, she could not live with herself if she did not stand up for the truth within the BBC.\n“The profoundest sense I have of who I am as a BBC journalist is to report the truth as I find it. If they don’t report the truth how can we?” she said.\nEditing by Stephen Addison\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:16:16.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
