Makes one consider what could be coming if 10s push over 3 and 30s (30-year Treasury bond) over 3.22 percent.” \nThe 10-year yield is currently trading around 2.83 percent. Gundlach said it is “hard to love bonds at even a 3 percent” yield. “Rising interest rates are a problem and the U.S. is in debt and there is massive bond supply,” Gundlach said. \nLos Angeles-based DoubleLine oversees $118 billion in assets under management, as of December 2017.
