(“Key Technology”) (NASDAQ GM: KTEC ) common stock in connection with the proposed acquisition of Key Technology by Duravant LLC and its affiliate (“Duravant”) announced on January 25, 2018 (the “Complaint”). The Complaint, which alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against Key Technology, its Board of Directors (the “Board”), and Duravant, is captioned Franchi v. Key Technology, Inc., Case No. 4:18-cv-5027 (E.D. Wash.).\nIf you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff’s counsel, Seth D. Rigrodsky or Gina M.
