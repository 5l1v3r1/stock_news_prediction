It’s going to be difficult but I‘m excited for it.”\nTennis - Australian Open - Women's Singles Final - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 28, 2018.

I come in here, and from the first moment, I was super happy, and kind of proud, and having very positive vibes,” the Frenchwoman, who ended her 15-match losing streak, said.\n“Like last year I felt like I haven’t left this place. St Petersburg is definitely magic for me, and I feel like home, like this is my home.”\nFifth seed Julia Goerges also marched on to the last-eight on her debut in the tournament after overcoming Italian qualifier Roberta Vinci 7-5 6-0.\nGoerges had never beaten Vinci in three previous meetings dating back to 2010 but she grew in confidence in a difficult first set, before recording her second bagel of the year to claim the victory.\nThe German will next face 18-year-old Russian qualifier Elena Rybakina for a place in the semi-finals.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T20:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:13:12.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
