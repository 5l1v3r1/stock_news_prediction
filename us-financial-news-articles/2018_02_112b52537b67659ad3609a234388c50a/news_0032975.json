A benchmark deal is usually upwards of $500 million.\nThe deal would also mark the first sukuk mandate for Ibdar Bank, formed in 2013 through a three-way merger of smaller Islamic lenders, as it expands its capital markets business.\n“More and more companies are becoming institutionalized and will seek to tap the sukuk market,” said Daredia.\n“A majority of sukuk issuers are sovereigns but our focus is to bring more corporates to the market. This can help develop the sukuk primary markets and also trading activity in the secondary markets.”\nThe lender aims to bring on board one or two international banks and regional partners as joint lead managers for the deal, he added.\nSaudi Arabia issued a debut $9 billion international sukuk in April last year while starting sales of riyal-denominated sukuk in July.\nThose sukuk are part of government plans to diversify its sources of finance and plug a budget deficit, but also provide a pricing benchmark that is encouraging some local companies to tap the market.
