Farm economics continue to be under pressure and impact sales negatively,” Novozymes said in a statement.\nNovozymes increased its 2017 dividend by 12.5 percent to 4.50 crowns per share, well above market expectations of 4.19 crowns.\nThe company said it expects 2018 organic sales growth between 4 and 6 percent. It reported 4 percent growth in 2017.\n$1 = 6.0052 Danish crowns Reporting by Boleslaw Lasocki; Editing by Thyagaraju Adinarayan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T06:10:02.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
