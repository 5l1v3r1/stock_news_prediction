Kaplan told a business conference in Frankfurt on Thursday. \nKaplan, a non-voting member of the Fed’s policy committee, predicted that unemployment would dip below 4 percent this year, suggesting stress in the labor market. \n“2018 will be a strong year in the United States,” Kaplan said. “Our Dallas Fed forecasts for GDP were somewhere between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent.” \n“We think we’re at or near full employment in the U.S.. We’d expect headline unemployment to dip below 4 percent during this year,” he said. \nReporting by Balazs Koranyi and Francesco Canepa; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T11:38:12.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
