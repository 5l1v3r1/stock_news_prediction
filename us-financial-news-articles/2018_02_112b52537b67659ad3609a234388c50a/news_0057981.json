The company also provided its initial guidance for 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Key Metrics\nPortfolio Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) - Increased 1.1 percent, slightly above guidance, to $120, compared to the 2016 fourth quarter, for Chatham’s 40, wholly owned hotels. Average daily rate (ADR) improved 0.8 percent to $159, and occupancy grew 0.4 percent to 75.3 percent. Portfolio RevPAR declined 0.5 percent, excluding four Houston hotels where RevPAR rose 23.5 percent, benefiting from demand attributable to Hurricane Harvey. Net Income - Rose $2.8 million to $5.5 million. Net income per diluted share was $0.12 versus $0.07 in the 2016 fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA - Equaled last year’s $26.3 million. Adjusted FFO - Decreased $1.0 million, or 5.7 percent, to $16.0 million versus $17.0 million in the 2016 fourth quarter. Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.36 versus $0.44 in the 2016 fourth quarter, compared to guidance of $0.35-$0.38 per share. Excluding the impact of the fourth quarter equity offering, two hotel acquisitions and one sold hotel, pro-forma Adjusted FFO per share would be $0.38, above consensus and at the upper end of its guidance. Operating Margins - Declined 260 basis points to 43.3 percent. Hotel EBITDA margins were off 80 basis points to 35.9 percent.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nThe following is a summary of the consolidated financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. RevPAR, ADR and occupancy for 2017 and 2016 are based on hotels owned as of December 31, 2017 ($ in millions, except per share, RevPAR, ADR, occupancy and margins):\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $5.5 $2.7 $29.7 $31.7 Diluted net income per common share $0.12 $0.07 $0.73 $0.81 RevPAR $120 $118 $133 $132 ADR $159 $158 $167 $164 Occupancy 75% 75% 80% 81% Adjusted EBITDA $26.3 $26.3 $126.7 $128.0 GOP Margin 43.3% 45.9% 47.4% 48.6% Hotel EBITDA Margin 35.9% 36.7% 40.3% 41.2% AFFO $16.0 $17.0 $86.3 $89.0 AFFO per diluted share $0.36 $0.44 $2.14 $2.30 Dividends per share $0.33 $0.33 $1.32 $1.38 2017 Highlights\n“We had a very productive fourth quarter from a strategic and operations perspective, achieving RevPAR growth at the upper end of our range, generating pro-forma FFO per share above consensus and importantly executing on our strategic directive to recycle capital and position Chatham to take advantage of future growth opportunities,” stated Jeffrey H. Fisher, Chatham’s president and chief executive officer. “2017 was a very successful year for Chatham. We raised $151 million of equity at a weighted average price of $21.59 per share, acquired three, high-quality hotels for $132 million, entered into an agreement to acquire an under-development hotel in the 2018 second quarter for $21 million and sold one hotel for $33 million. We produced RevPAR growth of 0.7 percent and adjusted FFO per share of $2.14, above the midpoint of our original 2017 guidance while reducing our leverage to 34 percent from 40 percent one year ago.\n“We are pursuing ways to deliver incremental value through opportunistic capital activities, along with asset sales, and investing those proceeds into hotel acquisitions or developments in higher growth markets with higher cash-on-cash returns,” Fisher highlighted. “Our adjusted EBITDA is projected to increase approximately 2 percent in 2018 and we expect these transactions will be accretive to our net asset value and FFO per share on a fully-invested basis.”\nOperating Results\n“Our fourth quarter operating results were strengthened by strong performance at our Houston and Florida hotels attributable to increased demand following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma,” stated Dennis Craven, Chatham’s chief operating officer. “At this time, most hurricane-related business has ended as displaced residents and hurricane-related professionals have either finished their work or found alternative housing. I commend our operations team at Island Hospitality who did a fantastic job managing our inventory, maximizing performance and taking care of our guests during a difficult time.\nFourth quarter RevPAR performance for certain key markets:\nSilicon Valley RevPAR rose 1.1 percent to $164 as demand continues to outpace new supply. Four Houston hotels experienced a 23.5 percent RevPAR gain due to increased demand related to Hurricane Harvey. Two Florida hotels saw RevPAR rise 17.0 percent due to hurricane-related demand, as well as increased inbound travelers favoring south Florida. RevPAR at the company’s three Washington D.C. hotels rose 5.2 percent. Hotels acquired in 2017 produced a 2.6 percent RevPAR gain. Two Los Angeles-area hotels experienced a RevPAR increase of 2.8 percent. RevPAR at the company’s three Boston hotels decreased 0.5 percent. RevPAR at Chatham’s two San Diego hotels declined 11.6 percent as one hotel was under renovation during the quarter.\n“The quarter was a bit noisy with two acquisitions and one disposition,” Craven commented. “Looking specifically at our 36 comparable hotels which exclude the hotels acquired and sold in the fourth quarter, operating margins were down 220 basis points, but hotel EBITDA margins only decreased 50 basis points as we benefited from some favorable property-tax settlements that will benefit us moving forward.”\nStrategic Recycling Program and Hotel Investments\nChatham continuously evaluates its hotel portfolio to enhance returns and cash flow. Chatham is actively pursuing acquisitions and intends to use the proceeds from any asset sales to acquire hotels. In September, the company acquired the 131-room Hilton Garden Inn Portsmouth Downtown in N.H., for $43.5 million, or approximately $332,000 per room.\nIn December, Chatham sold the 145-suite Homewood Suites by Hilton Carlsbad, Calif., for $33 million, or approximately $228,000 per suite. Chatham sold the hotel at an approximate 6.5 percent net operating income capitalization rate (after an assumed annual capital reserve of 4.0 percent of total hotel revenues) based on trailing 12 month performance. In connection with the sale, the buyer assumed a $20 million CMBS loan that carried an interest rate of 4.3 percent.\nAlso in December, Chatham acquired the 219-suite Embassy Suites by Hilton in Springfield, Va., for $68 million, or approximately $310,000 per suite, at a year one net operating income capitalization rate of approximately 7.5 percent. The superior-quality hotel has been ranked as the top hotel within the Embassy Suites brand each of the last three years.\nIn November, the company acquired the 96-room Courtyard by Marriott Charleston Summerville, S.C., for $20.2 million, or approximately $210,000 per room, and contracted to acquire an adjacent hotel under construction, the 96-room Residence Inn, for $21 million. Chatham estimates it acquired the Courtyard at a year one net operating income capitalization rate of approximately 8.0 percent. These hotels are located in Nexton, an emerging mixed-use community in the heart of a rapidly expanding area just outside of Charleston. The hotels will be the highest quality and closest hotels to Volvo’s first American factory which is expected to open in 2018. Volvo has already announced plans for a second factory on its nearby campus.\n“The Carlsbad hotel sale was the first under our capital recycling initiative announced earlier this year,” Fisher remarked. “Our goal is to opportunistically sell assets when we believe we can re-deploy those proceeds into high-quality hotel investments that earn greater yields in higher growth markets, thus enhancing our net asset value. Our fourth quarter activity reflects our strategy, and we intend to continue in 2018.”\nDuring the fourth quarter, the company substantially completed the renovations of the Homewood Suites hotels in Bloomington, Minn., and Brentwood, Tenn. The company commenced the renovation of the Residence Inn San Diego Mission Valley, Calif., and expects to complete its renovation during the 2018 first quarter. The company invested approximately $30.2 million in hotel upgrades in 2017.\nCapital Markets & Capital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had net debt of $531.1 million (total consolidated debt less unrestricted cash). Total debt outstanding was $540.5 million at an average interest rate of 4.6 percent, comprised of $508.5 million of fixed-rate mortgage debt at an average interest rate of 4.6 percent and $32.0 million outstanding on the company’s $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which currently carries a 4.2 percent interest rate.\nChatham’s leverage ratio was approximately 34.0 percent at December 31, 2017, based on the ratio of the company’s net debt to hotel investments at cost. The weighted average maturity date for Chatham’s fixed-rate debt is February 2024 with the earliest maturity in 2021. As of December 31, 2017, Chatham’s proportionate share of joint venture debt and unrestricted cash was $165.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively.\nOn December 31, 2017, as defined in the company’s credit agreement, Chatham’s fixed charge coverage ratio, including its interest in the two joint ventures with Colony NorthStar, was 3.2 times, and total net debt to trailing 12-month corporate EBITDA was 5.5 times. Excluding its interest in the two joint ventures, Chatham’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.5 times, and net debt to trailing 12-month corporate EBITDA was 4.8 times.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Chatham issued five million common shares at a price of $21.90 per share. The company also sold 0.5 million shares under its at-the-market (“ATM”) and direct stock purchase (“DSPP”) programs at a weighted average price of $21.38 per share.\nJoint Venture Investments\nDuring the 2017 fourth quarter, the Innkeepers and Inland joint ventures contributed Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO of approximately $3.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively, compared to 2016 fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA and FFO of approximately $3.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Both Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO were $0.1 million above the company’s previous guidance for the quarter.\nChatham received distributions from its joint venture investments of $1.2 million during the 2017 fourth quarter.\nDividend\nChatham currently pays a monthly dividend of $0.11 per common share. Chatham’s 2017 dividend per share of $1.32 represented approximately 62 percent of its 2017 adjusted FFO per share. Based on the midpoint of its guidance for 2018, an annual dividend of $1.32 per share represents an adjusted FFO per share payout ratio of 71 percent.\n2018 Guidance\nThe company provides guidance, but does not undertake to update it for any developments in its business. Achievement of the results is subject to the risks disclosed in the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe company’s 2018 guidance reflects the following assumptions:\nIndustrywide RevPAR growth of 0 to 3 percent in 2017 Marriott International forecast North American RevPAR growth of 1 to 2 percent; Hilton Hotels & Resorts provided systemwide RevPAR growth of 1 to 3 percent STR projected industry RevPAR growth of 2.7 percent. Acquisition of the 96-room Residence Inn by Marriott Charleston Summerville, S.C., on July 1, 2018 for $21.0 million Renovations commencing at the following hotels: Homewood Suites Billerica, Mass., and Hyatt Place Pittsburgh in the first quarter Residence Inn Mountain View, Calif., and Residence Inn Tysons Corner, Va., during the second quarter Homewood Suites Dallas, Texas during the third quarter Residence Inn Sunnyvale, Calif., #1, and the Homewood Suites Farmington, Conn., in the fourth quarter No additional acquisitions, dispositions, debt or equity issuance\nFisher concluded, “our guidance does not reflect any future acquisitions, developments or reinvestment of any asset sale proceeds or additional leverage capacity. We have an active acquisition pipeline and we fully intend on growing our portfolio and adding FFO per share. We will add earnings in 2019 from the ramp-up of the Residence Inn Charleston Summerville. Our hotels are in excellent condition as we have been investing in our hotels throughout the cycle. The impact of new supply on our results is lessening and if new tax policy spurs incremental economic growth and lodging demand, we are in a great position to outperform and get back to growing margins.”\nQ1 2018 2018 Forecast RevPAR $121 to $123 $131 to $134 RevPAR growth -3.5% to -2.0% -1.5% to 0.5% Total hotel revenue $70.4 to $71.4 M $310.0 to $315.9 M Net income $1.5 to $2.6 M $25.8 to $32.2 M Net income per diluted share $0.03 to $0.06 $0.56 to $0.70 Adjusted EBITDA $25.2 to $26.3 M $125.7 to $132.1 M Adjusted FFO $15.3 to $16.4 M $84.1 to $90.5 M Adjusted FFO per diluted share $0.33 to $0.35 $1.80 to $1.94 Hotel EBITDA margins 35.4% to 36.0% 38.7% to 39.7% Corporate cash administrative expenses $2.5 M $9.6 M Corporate non-cash administrative expenses $0.9 M $4.3 M Interest expense (excluding fee amortization) $6.4 M $26.5 M Non-cash amortization of deferred fees $0.3 M $1.4M Income taxes $0.0 M $0.0 M Chatham’s share of JV EBITDA $2.8 to $3.1 M $15.3 to $16.3 M Chatham’s share of JV FFO $0.6 to $0.9 M $5.9 to $6.9 M Weighted average shares/units outstanding 46.6 M 46.6 M Funds from operations (FFO), Adjusted FFO (AFFO), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Additional information about Chatham may be found at chathamlodgingtrust.com.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIncluded in this press release are certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles). The company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: (1) FFO, (2) Adjusted FFO, (3) EBITDA, (4) Adjusted EBITDA and (5) Adjusted Hotel EBITDA. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss as prescribed by GAAP as a measure of its operating performance.\nFFO As Defined by NAREIT and Adjusted FFO\nThe company calculates FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, impairment write-downs, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs), and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures following the same approach. The company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it measures its performance without regard to specified non-cash items such as real estate depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on sale of real estate assets and certain other items that the company believes are not indicative of the property level performance of its hotel properties. The company believes that these items reflect historical cost of its asset base and its acquisition and disposition activities and are less reflective of its ongoing operations, and that by adjusting to exclude the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that also report using the NAREIT definition.\nThe company calculates Adjusted FFO by further adjusting FFO for certain additional items that are not addressed in NAREIT’s definition of FFO, including other charges, losses on the early extinguishment of debt and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities that it believes do not represent costs related to hotel operations. The company believes that Adjusted FFO provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA\nThe company calculates EBITDA for purposes of the credit facility debt as net income or loss excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; and (4) unconsolidated real estate entity items including interest, depreciation and amortization excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate. The company believes EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating its operating performance because it helps investors compare the company’s operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from its operating results. In addition, the company uses EBITDA as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by further adjusting EBITDA for certain additional items, including other charges, gains or losses on the sale of real estate, losses on the early extinguishment of debt, amortization of non-cash share-based compensation and similar items related to its unconsolidated real estate entities, which it believes are not indicative of the performance of its underlying hotel properties entities. The company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure that may facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures.\nAdjusted Hotel EBITDA is defined as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, corporate general and administrative, impairment loss, loss on early extinguishment of debt, interest and other income and income or loss from unconsolidated real estate entities. The Company presents Adjusted Hotel EBITDA because the Company believes it is useful to investors in comparing its hotel operating performance between periods and comparing its Adjusted Hotel EBITDA margins to those of our peer companies. Adjusted Hotel EBITDA represents the results of operations for its wholly owned hotels only.\nAlthough the company presents FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they are useful to investors in comparing the company’s operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, these measures have limitations as analytical tools. Some of these limitations are:\nFFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the company’s cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the company’s working capital needs; FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect funds available to make cash distributions; EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on the company’s debts; Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may need to be replaced in the future, and FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; Non-cash compensation is and will remain a key element of the company’s overall long-term incentive compensation package, although the company excludes it as an expense when evaluating its ongoing operating performance for a particular period using adjusted EBITDA; Adjusted FFO, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not reflect the impact of certain cash charges (including acquisition transaction costs) that result from matters the company considers not to be indicative of the underlying performance of its hotel properties; and Other companies in the company’s industry may calculate FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA differently than the company does, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nIn addition, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA are not measures of the Company’s liquidity. Because of these limitations, FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on its GAAP results and using FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA only supplementally. The Company’s consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe company’s reconciliation of FFO, Adjusted FFO, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Hotel EBITDA to net income attributable to common shareholders, as determined under GAAP, is set forth below.\nForward-Looking Statement Safe Harbor\nNote: This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities regulations.
