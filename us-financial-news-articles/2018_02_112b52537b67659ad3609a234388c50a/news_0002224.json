It submitted a formal application to operate a live hog contract early last year.\nThe hog futures approval also comes ahead of a long-awaited crude oil futures contract, for which regulatory approval is expected soon.\nChina consumes about 55 million tonnes of pork a year, half of the global total, but production is highly cyclical. Futures will help pig farmers hedge the risks of price swings in the highly volatile market, the exchange said in its statement.\nRapid industrialisation in pig farming in China is giving way to larger, more standardised producers, which will make it easier to develop a contract based on the live animal.\nAround 200 companies were producing more than 50,000 hogs a year in 2016, it said, about 8 percent of the national output.\nThe Dalian exchange will still need a final go-ahead from the State Council, or Chinese cabinet, before commencing trading.
