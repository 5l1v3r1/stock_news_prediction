Since 2002-03, however, funding for the program has dropped 25 percent per student, even as the threat of mass shootings has risen.\nThe current budget includes $64.4 million for an eighth straight year, according to state figures. Before the shooting, Governor Rick Scott had proposed adding $10 million next year.\nINADEQUATE SECURITY Some parents have expressed anger that security measures at Stoneman Douglas were not more robust.\n“Who do they have on campus? I think there’s only one security person,” said Elana Cohn, 45, who has a child at the school. “That’s for a school with 3,200 students.”\nSchool officials in Broward County, where Stoneman Douglas is located, did not respond to requests for comment on security and Safe Schools funding.\nIn many ways, last Wednesday’s massacre highlighted the limits of school security measures, both physical, such as fencing and officers, and preventative, such as counseling.\nLike many other schools, Stoneman Douglas has a single entry point that requires proof of identity before a visitor can enter the sprawling campus during school hours.\nBut as dismissal time approaches each day, exterior gates are opened to allow students to leave, said Jerry Graziose, the district’s former head of school safety. That appears to be how the accused shooter, 19-year-old former Stoneman Douglas student Nikolas Cruz, entered the campus without being stopped.\n“At dismissal, unfortunately, you’ve got to open the gates to let everyone out,” Graziose said. “You’ve got 3,000 people.”\nSome parents said there had to be a better solution.\n“Security was not adequate,” said Angela Burrafato, 51, who has one child at the school. “We know we can get around the single-point front door entrance, and it’s a problem.”\n‘DUAL ROLE’ STAFFERS\nSafe Schools funding helps districts pay for school resource officers, or SROs, who are sworn law enforcement personnel assigned from local police departments.\nOn Wednesday, Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel told reporters that the SRO assigned from his office to the school, Deputy Scott Peterson, was on campus but did not discharge his weapon. His response, like that of others, will be “looked at and scrutinized,” Israel said, without giving more details.\nThe Sun-Sentinel reported last week that Peterson, who has been at the school since 2009, was elsewhere on the 45-acre campus at the time of the shooting.\nState data shows that Broward County had 160 SROs in 2016, the latest year available, including 39 for the district’s 30 high schools. That is comparable to or greater than the number in other large districts.\nSome staffers hold a dual role as security specialists or campus monitors. They are unarmed but have some training, Graziose said. One such employee at Stoneman Douglas, Aaron Feis, was shot to death while sheltering students.\nJared Moskowitz, a Democratic Florida state representative and Stoneman Douglas graduate, said one officer was not enough.\n“It’s like a mini-college,” he said. “If you’re on one side of campus, it takes minutes to get to the other side, and this whole thing was over in five minutes.”\nOn Wednesday, Israel, the Broward County sheriff, told reporters that some deputies would begin carrying single-shot rifles on school grounds.\nU.S. President Donald Trump suggested during a meeting on Wednesday with surviving students that arming teachers and other staff could help prevent school massacres.\nINTERVENTION PROGRAM Broward County received nearly $6 million this academic year from the Safe Schools program. While districts statewide spend more than 80 percent of those funds on SROs, Broward was an exception, devoting less than half the money on officers, although it may use local funds to help pay for SROs.\nInstead, the district dedicated millions of safe school dollars on an intervention program, where suspended students who would otherwise be sent home are diverted to off-campus centers, where teachers, counselors and social workers are assigned.\nThe effort earned Broward national attention as a leader in alternative discipline that disrupts the “school-to-prison pipeline” by giving troubled children a chance to stay in school.\nIt was not clear whether Cruz, who had a history of infractions before being expelled from Stoneman Douglas in 2017, benefited from that program. The Washington Post reported that he was sent to in-school suspension as well as off campus, citing school records.\nSince the shooting, school administrators across the country have said that more counseling is needed when students have emotional problems.\nBut Lee, the school administrators association president, acknowledged there was no foolproof way of stopping a determined gunman, without turning school campuses into something akin to military installations.\n“I really don’t know how you prevent someone who is bent on destruction from carrying it out to some degree,” he said. “We want to be an education system. We don’t want to be a mini-prison.”\nReporting by Joseph Ax in New York; Additional reporting by Zachary Fagenson in Parkland, Fla., Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Jonathan Allen and Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Frank McGurty, Peter Cooney and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T14:14:36.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
