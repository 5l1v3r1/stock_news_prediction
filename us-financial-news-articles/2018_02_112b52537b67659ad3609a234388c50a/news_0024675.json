From 2017-2018, the conference and trade show drew more than 5,000 cannabis professionals and 275 industry-leading exhibitors.\nThe decision to relocate the event to Boston was influenced by the November 2016 election when Massachusetts voters approved Ballot Question 4, legalizing the adult-use of cannabis. Retail sales of legal cannabis are expected to begin in Massachusetts in July and are projected to reach $450 million in its first six months of sales. Recent reports from cannabis industry analysts also project statewide sales to reach $1.2 billion by 2021, bringing in approximately $240 million in state and local tax revenue. Many are these projections are attributed to Boston's high population density and close distances between states in the Northeast. Cross-border sales are expected to be more of a phenomenon in Massachusetts than in Western states that have legalized cannabis.\nAt this time, all of the New England states have either decriminalized or legalized cannabis. Similar to Massachusetts, Maine legalized the adult-use of cannabis during the November 2016 election. Earlier this year, Vermont made history when its Governor and House of Representatives signed into law and voted to legalize full legalization measures. New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island have all decriminalized cannabis and adopted medical cannabis programs.\n\"There is a massive opportunity in New England to build a robust, thriving cannabis industry and as the industry's only national trade association, it's our responsibility to ensure the success of these newly legalized markets,\" explains Aaron Smith, Executive Director of NCIA. \"To promote the growth of a responsible and legitimate cannabis industry we rely on three foundational pillars: advocacy, education, and community. Our conferences and trade shows are a full expression of these pillars, and we look forward to supporting the growth of the Northeastern cannabis markets.\nFor more information and updates about Seed to Sale Show 2019, please subscribe to NCIA's newsletter by visiting www.SeedToSaleShow.com .\nRepresenting well over 1,500 member-businesses nationwide, the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) is the largest cannabis trade association in the U.S. and the only one representing cannabis-related businesses at the national level. NCIA promotes the growth of a responsible and legitimate cannabis industry and works toward a favorable social, economic, and legal environment for that industry in the United States.\nContact: Bethany Moore, Communications and Projects Manager\n(303) 223-9727 â€“ 190234@email4pr.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ncia-announces-new-location-for-seed-to-sale-show-2019----boston-feb-12-13-300596732.html\nSOURCE National Cannabis Industry Association", "external_links": ["http://thecannabisindustry.org/?utm_source=NCIA&utm_medium=release&utm_campaign=LD17&utm_content=20170516", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ncia-announces-new-location-for-seed-to-sale-show-2019----boston-feb-12-13-300596732.html", "https://thecannabisindustry.org/", "http://www.seedtosaleshow.com/"], "published": "2018-02-12T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T19:23:45.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
