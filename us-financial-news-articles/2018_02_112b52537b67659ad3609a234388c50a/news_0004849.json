Between 1950 and 2017, the barometer has been correct 58 of 67 times, or approximately 87 percent, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac.\nIt has also been accurate in predicting the market's direction in recent years. Since 1980, the January Barometer has correctly predicted the S&P 500's year-end direction 68 percent of the time.\nThe S&P 500's strong performance in January could also signal further gains in February, according to analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\"February tends to be a trend following month,\" they said in a note to clients. \"When January is up, which is the case in 2018, February has tended to do better, up 60.7% of the time with an average return of 0.47%.
