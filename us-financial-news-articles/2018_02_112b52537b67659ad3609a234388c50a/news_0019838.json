IranAir expects to start receiving custom-built Airbus aircraft next year.\n“The delivery of Boeing will be in 2018 and Airbus in 2019. We have no problem with the financing of the deals,” Sharafbafi said.\nIranAir has agreed to buy 80 aircraft from Boeing and 100 from Airbus but only a handful have been delivered amid what bankers describe as a shortage of financing for Iran, due to the reluctance of Western banks to risk U.S penalties.\nIndustry sources say another key sticking point is that IranAir has been slow to pay deposits, which are needed for Boeing and Airbus to start building new jets.\nAirbus sales chief John Leahy said in January that its schedule for deliveries to Iran could slip.\nBoeing has yet to publish the Iran order officially, a step which the company says it can only take if it has a downpayment.\nSo far IranAir has received three brand-new Airbus jets originally built for other airlines that could not take delivery, and 8 new ATR turboprops.\nIt is able to purchase planes under the 2015 deal to open up trade in exchange for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities.\nEven after the accord, all exports of Western aircraft to Iran need licences from the U.S. Treasury because of the number of U.S. parts. Current licences expire at the end of 2020 and would need to be extended to complete the planned deliveries.\n“Whether the licences will be renewed, we have to wait and see: it depends on the United States,” Sharafbafi said.\nIran has accused the United States of dragging its feet over the steps needed to implement the nuclear deal, which has been publicly criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump.\nReporting by Parisa Hafezi, John Irish; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T19:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:37:34.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
