The exchange did not say which cryptocurrencies those were.\nSix of the transactions have been voided. Zaif is trying to rectify the issue with the seventh customer who attempted to transfer the bitcoin from the exchange, a spokesperson told Reuters.\nThe issue was discovered on February 16 and Zaif made the public aware on February 20 via a blog on its website.\nZaif apologized and said there will be no impact on customers.\nThe Japanese exchange is one of the 16 that are registered with the government. Zaif's parent company had faced checks last month, according to Reuters, as regulators feared it could be vulnerable to a cyberattack.\nTech Bureau Corp has yet to respond to a request for comment when contacted by CNBC.\nIt comes after Japanese exchange Coincheck had over $500 million of cryptocurrency stolen last month.\nJapan is one of the markets that has been quite open to cryptocurrencies , while other countries like China and South Korea have taken a tougher stance. Last year, Japan allowed merchants to begin accepting bitcoin as payment if they wanted.\nThe country is now looking to create regulation around the exchanges. But Reuters reported that the 16 exchanges that are currently registered with the Japanese government will create a self-regulating body that will be overseen by Japan's Financial Services Association.\nWATCH: If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxes show chapters If you own bitcoin, here's how much you owe in taxes 4 Hours Ago | 02:00", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T13:57:22.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
