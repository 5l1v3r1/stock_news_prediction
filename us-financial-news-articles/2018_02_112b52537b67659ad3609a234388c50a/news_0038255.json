DACA was implemented in 2012 by Democratic former President Barack Obama.\nIf the justices agree to hear the appeal by the Republican president, they likely would not rule on the case until late June.\nIf they turn away the appeal, Alsup’s nationwide injunction blocking Trump’s plan to rescind DACA would remain in effect while legal challenges to the president’s action proceed. Alsup’s injunction was issued in a lawsuit led by California’s Democratic attorney general.\n'Dreamers' react as they meet with relatives during the 'Keep Our Dream Alive' binational meeting at a new section of the border wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in Sunland Park, U.S., December 10, 2017. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/Files Under Trump’s order, DACA would begin phasing out on March 5. If Alsup’s decision remains in place, DACA beneficiaries would be able to reapply for protections past that deadline, although the administration is not processing new applications.\nOn Tuesday, a second U.S. judge issued a similar injunction ordering the Trump administration to keep DACA in place.\nProtecting the Dreamers is of paramount importance to Democrats and some Republicans. Trump himself has backed legislation that would give them a path to citizenship but also would curtail legal immigration.\nIn a Twitter post on Friday, Trump sought to blame Democrats for the problems created by his order, writing, “Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.”\nUnder DACA, about 700,000 young adults receive protections for two-year periods, after which they must reapply. An estimated 1.8 million people are eligible for the program.\nTrump’s move to rescind DACA prompted legal challenges by Democratic state attorneys general and various organizations and individuals in multiple federal courts. His administration argued that Obama exceeded his powers under the Constitution when he bypassed Congress and created DACA.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T18:15:26.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
