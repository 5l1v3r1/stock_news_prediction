MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed as U.S. bond yields crept up towards four-year highs.\nAnalysts said they expected global markets to stabilise, but said caution would remain in India amid continued worries that accelerating inflation would force the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates.\nThe RBI on Wednesday held rates steady and kept its policy stance at “neutral”, with analysts saying the central bank’s future action would depend on inflation.\n“Market is into a trading zone with a broad-based recovery. The worst, as far as downside concerns and short-selling, is more or less done. But at the same time, the markets are not in clear waters yet with concerns over inflation,” said Dharmesh Kant, an independent market expert.\nThe broader NSE index was up 1.21 percent at 10,603.85 as of 0541 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 1.31 percent higher at 34,529.79.\nPharma and realty stocks gained with the Nifty Pharma index and the Nifty Realty index climbing over 2.5 percent each.\nShares of Cipla surged as much as 6.85 percent after the country’s fourth-largest drugmaker by revenue reported a 7 percent jump in quarterly profit on Wednesday.\nIT service exporters Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd climbed over 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively.
