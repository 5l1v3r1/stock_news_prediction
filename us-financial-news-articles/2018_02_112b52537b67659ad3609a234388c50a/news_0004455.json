The Palace of Westminster was almost completely destroyed by a fire in 1834 and it was rebuilt in 1852. The Big Ben bell was installed in the clock tower seven years later.\n($1 = 0.7013 pounds)\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T12:33:47.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
