He survived being given out leg before wicket to Kagiso Rabada before he had scored when a review showed he had got the faintest of edges to the ball. \nAfter that he was sublime as he put on 139 for the second wicket with Shikhar Dhawan (76 from 63 balls) to lay the platform for India’s sizeable score. \n“You’re always looking for someone to bat until the end and it’s amazing if you do it as the captain,” Kohli said at the post-match presentation.

These are the times you’re tested mentally as well as physically.” \nWhen South Africa captain Aiden Markram (32) and innings top-scorer JP Duminy (51) put on a rapid 78 for the second wicket, the hosts were given hope.

Yet again we were not up to the mark. We’ve only got ourselves to blame, we have to try harder,” Markram said. \n“We’ve come across them (the spinners) before and if after all that time we’re still struggling to pick them, it speaks of their quality.” Reporting by Nick Said; Editing by Toby Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:15:18.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
