(NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing neoantigen cancer vaccines, today announced that Ali Behbahani, M.D., a partner in the healthcare group at New Enterprise Associates (“NEA”), has joined its board of directors. NEA was a lead investor in Genocea’s $55 million concurrent public offerings completed in January 2018.\n“Ali is a highly respected life science investor, and we are thrilled to welcome him to our board of directors,” said Chip Clark, president and chief executive officer of Genocea. “We know his breadth and depth of experience will prove invaluable to us as we advance our mission to create next-generation cancer vaccines and use our unique ATLAS technology to identify and characterize neoantigens.”\nDr. Behbahani has been at NEA since 2007, where he specializes in investments in the biopharmaceutical, medical device, specialty pharmaceutical, and healthcare services sectors. Prior to joining NEA, he worked as an intern and later as a consultant in business development at The Medicines Company. He previously held positions as a Venture Associate at Morgan Stanley Venture Partners and as a Healthcare Investment Banking Analyst at Lehman Brothers. Dr. Behbahani conducted basic science research in the fields of viral fusion inhibition and structural proteomics at the National Institutes of Health and at Duke University. He concurrently earned his M.D. from The University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and his M.B.A. from The University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, where he graduated with Honors and was a Palmer Scholar. He graduated summa cum laude and received his bachelor’s degrees with distinction in Biomedical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Chemistry from Duke University.\nAbout Genocea Biosciences, Inc.\nGenocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing vaccines and immunotherapies. While traditional immunotherapy discovery methods have largely used predictive methods to propose T cell targets, or antigens, Genocea has developed ATLAS™, its proprietary technology platform, to identify clinically relevant antigens of T cells based on actual human immune responses. Genocea uses ATLAS in immuno-oncology applications to develop neoantigen cancer vaccines, while also exploring partnership opportunities for general cancer vaccines and a vaccine targeting cancers caused by Epstein-Barr Virus. Genocea expects to begin clinical development of its first neoantigen cancer vaccine, GEN-009, in 2018. Genocea is exploring strategic alternatives for GEN-003, its Phase 3-ready immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of genital herpes.
