We are also a very serious and loyal and active shareholder in Sanofi, but in case we will be ready and I‘m sure if it was not enough, we have many love letters from banks that have said that they would love to lend us some money.” \nAgon added that any decision to sell was in Nestle’s hands. \n($1 = 0.8149 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:18:08.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
