As of April 2017, men were paid on average 34 percent more than women at Aberdeen, and 42 percent more than women at Standard Life.\nThe figures show a larger gap than for insurer and asset manager Aviva, which published a gender pay gap below 30 percent last month.\nSLA also separately announced on Friday several board changes, including the departure by the end of 2019 of chairman Gerry Grimstone, 68, who became Standard Life chairman in 2007.\nA former government official, Grimstone has been deputy chairman of Barclays since 2016. He is also a former chairman of financial services lobby group TheCityUK.\nJulie Chakraverty, Lynne Peacock and Akira Suzuki will retire from the board at its next annual general meeting.\nReporting by Carolyn Cohn and Huw Jones; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:10:20.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
