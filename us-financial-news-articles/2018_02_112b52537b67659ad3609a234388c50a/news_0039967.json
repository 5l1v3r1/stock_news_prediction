The game then finds a similarly skilled person to play the same levels. Whoever has the highest score takes the cash. \nGames typically cost under $1 to play and winners usually walk away with a $3 to $4 in their pocket for a victory. Players who just wish to compete against others for fun can also play without paying. \nBecause WorldWinner walks a thin line between amusement and gambling, it doesn’t offer cash tournaments in 10 states—Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. \nRovio launched the original Angry Birds game in 2009, and has since released at least 25 variations of the game, including Star Wars , Transformers , and Rio -themed versions. In 2016, it co-produced The Angry Birds Movie for $100 million, bringing in nearly $350 million in ticket sales. A 2017 IPO, though, was disappointing for investors.
