The others were Daberas, Sendelingsdrift and Southern Coastal.\nDiamond mining generates 20 percent of the southern African country’s export earnings.\nReporting by Nyasha Nyaungwa; writing by Nqobile Dludla; editing by James Macharia and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T17:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:04:31.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
