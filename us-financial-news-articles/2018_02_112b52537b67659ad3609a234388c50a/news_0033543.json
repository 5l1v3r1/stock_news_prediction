We will present our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Net Income for our fiscal year 2018 results including the impacts of new accounting standards and will provide a separate reconciliation to results prior to the impacts resulting from any new accounting standards, including ASC 606. Finally, the Non-GAAP adjusting line items should not be relied upon individually, as we are not guiding on individual line items, but upon the total operating income metrics, as included within our guidance table above.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP. However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items, when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. Management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of athenahealth and compare it against past periods, make operating decisions, and serve as a basis for strategic planning. These non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors.\nManagement defines “ Non-GAAP Operating Income ” as the sum of GAAP operating income before stock-based compensation expense; amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development; amortization of purchased intangible assets; integration and transaction costs; and exit costs, including restructuring costs; and “ Non-GAAP Operating Margin ” as Non-GAAP Operating Income as a percentage of total revenue.\nManagement excludes or adjusts each of the items identified below from the applicable non-GAAP financial measure or metric referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item:\nStock-based compensation expense and amortization of capitalized stock-based compensation related to software development — excluded because these are non-cash expenditures that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of our business, and also because the total amount of the expenditure is partially outside of our control because it is based on factors such as stock price, volatility, and interest rates, which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expenses are incurred.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets — purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition. Accordingly, this item is not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nIntegration and transaction costs — Integration costs are the severance payments and retention bonuses for certain employees related to specific transactions. Transaction costs are costs related to strategic transactions. Accordingly, management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations, and therefore, these costs are not considered by management in making operating decisions. Management does not believe such charges accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred.\nExit costs, including restructuring costs — represent costs incurred as a result of strategic realignments including those related to workforce reductions, termination of certain lease or other agreements, and non-cash charges related to the write down of certain assets. Management does not believe such costs accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such costs are incurred.\nGain or loss on investments — represents unrecognized or recognized gains or losses on the fair value, sales, conversions of our investments, such as marketable securities and More Disruption Please (“MDP”) Accelerator investments. Management does not believe such gains or losses accurately reflect the performance of our ongoing operations for the period in which such gains or losses are reported. Upon adoption of new accounting standards effective for 2018, we present gains or losses on investments in Other (income) expense on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Net Income which is not included in Operating Income but is included in the subtotal Income before income tax provision.\nNon-GAAP tax rate — our statutory tax rate of 25% is applied to normalize the tax impact to our Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share based on the fact that a relatively small change in pre-tax GAAP income (loss) in any one period could result in a volatile GAAP effective tax rate.\nSource: athenahealth, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_sGecTtqesj2qaizBdm1WUaTGSKAIukkoOSAjJ0zUPCQANm8K5gCZAIpdd8YNgd27Qj3tiPu28LFQQcVamTRDRansemBfj-cWGwjLUEr1Sc=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WEvu71PA_H_dGE9W8lOCgwHroZNagYO-RRAaCUSa4DblifPFMvGFlY-kJzbuxIGuc1_W1QtefkrIsA0h4OgJQ91EtYQuyCJGW4BSXeUsygl-dtfgUWdWwtOpAHluwLeam_7Dm7ul5dt5d1f8AAjsIQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MHPlHqHPC3aE_hCda2-3doXwh0oNtwIzAAO0g5ugkuOVTsYPbzSsq6D-NpGCerELARtMV9Xv7kpov8L9-KWGK4rSVc1Xpn8GLmBrXvQeTi8=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=_sGecTtqesj2qaizBdm1WcYYg9gz2kZRw62STt9PS6HSFCPCU1AzU_g-EpcQ-DF4Acnr8V08jUsytF8r20zOuSlwKQLsyl7AQexmTyZIiww=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/d832ace5-030b-4c42-aa61-6eabb9de70f0", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tKa3SXCYW6rVncWmbjHATe6APfYT__DRyKqIQ57eW38CIIt6I8DPYcr8dHqGugsFf2KqVNQTy48sDMZrcHAfAxwpODnUha_COFQ3Wqi0I6o=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=7xmghlR36hl3Bqq9iw2_BiLD-C5YbtVQsq3xA2M-5W3LytY1hqBY7VckFbpJYRBL7YyyJt9ibk1o-6MyMr4C_63BTDr53nHkJXxDuije7PI=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kMdjmyFX3wyuWKbPGN2IUbIs7aj7dG_JVL3Why4hgGg_TrJ98zdhyZfxvPZJPmUeaXpFV7NPUsShHoiLifyoVQ==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=tKa3SXCYW6rVncWmbjHATe6APfYT__DRyKqIQ57eW394GRj_uImTNjZTQ6jyAGKq2ptRFLIXs1L6Tubd9s3O5b4oVwY4Ou2lzF0qXhGIM9A="], "published": "2018-02-15T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T01:51:38.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
