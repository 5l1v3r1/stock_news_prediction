This specifically hurts ABN and other Dutch banks as they typically have a large mortgage loan book. \nABN said its risk-weighted assets were to increase by 35 percent under the new regime, which was agreed by international regulators in December but still has to be approved by the European Commission. The final outcome of the rules was still uncertain, the bank said. \nTo manage the transition, ABN will maintain a target of 17.5 percent to 18.5 percent for its core capital adequacy ratio in 2018, as it aims for a 13.5 percent ratio of capital to risk weighted assets under the new rules. The ratio stood at 17.7 percent at the end of last year, while the minimum requirement is 10 percent. $1 = 0.8073 euros Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T09:37:54.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
