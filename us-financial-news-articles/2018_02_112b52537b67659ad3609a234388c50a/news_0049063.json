The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has designated sulopenem as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) for its oral and IV formulations for the treatment of uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections (uUTI and cUTI), as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections (CIAI).\nAbout Iterum Therapeutics Limited\nIterum Therapeutics Limited is an Irish clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing differentiated anti-infectives aimed at combatting the global crisis of multi-drug resistant pathogens to significantly improve the lives of people affected by serious and life-threatening diseases around the world.
