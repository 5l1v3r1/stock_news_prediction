It’s a challenge every time the law of the state is respected only if compatible with religious tenets.”\nPhilippe also promised better screening of people hired as coaches sports centers.\nThe scale of the challenge was highlighted by a report for the Interior Ministry.\nThe report by a senior civil servant warned that sectarian sentiment or behavior was rising in parts of France, notably in poor urban areas where Muslims more openly resented or challenged obligations of secular public life.\nHe cited examples of young Muslim girls being kept away from school swimming, sculpture classes and choir activities frowned upon by some of the country’s estimated 5 million Muslims.\nThe report also highlighted fears about the number of young people being taken out of secular state-funded schools to teach them at home or put them in strictly faith-based schools.\nPhilippe said some 74,000 pupils entered schools outside of state system last year, calling the trend worrying if small compared with 12 million in education. The report said the number concerned had doubled in five years.\nSuch opt-out schools need licensing and that would be made tougher by law shortly, Philippe said.\nReporting by Brian Love; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:28:24.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
