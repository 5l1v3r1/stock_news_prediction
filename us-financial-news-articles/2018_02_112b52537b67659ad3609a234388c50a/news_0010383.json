REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration But the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has since fallen dramatically and on Monday was down by 11 percent to $7255 at 1719 GMT on Bitstamp, extending losses from Friday amid worries of a global regulatory clampdown.\nCREDIT RISK The decision on whether to allow credit card users to buy cryptocurrencies is a credit risk decision made by the card-issuing banks, a spokesman for Mastercard said.\nA sign is seen outside a branch of Lloyds Bank in central London February 3, 2014. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/Files A spokeswoman for Chase bank said it is not currently processing credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies because of the volatility and risk involved, while a Citi spokeswoman confirmed a similar ban, but did not give a reason.\nThe bans extends only to credit card purchases, with debit card users still able to buy cryptocurrencies.\n“Across Lloyds Bank, Bank of Scotland, Halifax and MBNA, we do not accept credit card transactions involving the purchase of cryptocurrencies,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said in an email.\nLloyds did not say how it planned to enforce the ban, although the Telegraph newspaper reported on Sunday that its credit card customers will be blocked from buying Bitcoin online through a “blacklist” that will flag sellers.\nA spokeswoman from the Royal Bank of Scotland declined to comment on the bank’s policy.\nEurope’s biggest bank HSBC did not respond to requests for comment on whether it permits credit card purchases of cryptocurrencies.\nConcerns about the use of Bitcoin and other such currencies extend beyond the use of credit cards for borrowing.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May has said Britain should take a serious look at digital currencies such as Bitcoin because of the way they can be used by criminals.\nAdditional reporting by Anjuli Davies in London and Jesus Aguado in Madrid; Editing by Peter Cooney and Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T16:33:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
