Analysts reckon any further positive forecasts on the economy might prompt investors to add positions in the undervalued currency.\nING analysts predicted more sterling upside in the medium-term, having revised their end-2018 forecast to $1.45.\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nGraphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nReporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv"], "published": "2018-02-07T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:43:47.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
