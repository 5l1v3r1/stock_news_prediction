Under FOB contracts, the buyer procures the vessel and is responsible for all shipping costs.\nThe industry is worried that time is running out to make adjustments before the rules come into effect, Sinadia said, noting that it would be difficult to do so without the guidelines.\nIndonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) Secretary-General Togar Sitanggang said in an interview on Jan. 24 that there were several problems with the new rules, noting there were not enough Indonesian-flagged food-grade tankers, and that Indonesian insurers may lack capacity.\n“If we’re selling CPO (crude palm oil), free-on-board at Belawan port, does this mean our buyer has to use Indonesian vessel? That is ridiculous.”\nThe palm oil industry is awaiting guidance on when foreign vessels can be used if local vessels are unavailable, he said.\n“There should be no obstacles, but if we must do this and that, it could hold up exports,” he said.\nThe new rules could add to freight costs, Sitanggang said, if shipping companies were unable to find cargo for their return trips to Asia.\n“If their ships are empty, of course they’ll ask for a higher price from us.”\nAccording to Oke Nurwan, Director General of Foreign Trade at the Ministry of Trade, while most domestic shipping uses Indonesian-flagged vessels very little is exported on Indonesian ships.\n“It can’t be like that any more,” Nurwan said on Jan. 25, adding that the government wanted the domestic shipping sector to compete more with multinationals.\n“If (the government) didn’t intervene there would be no trigger, so we made it mandatory,” he said.\nReporting by Bernadette Christina Munthe; Writing by Fergus Jensen; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:02:07.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
