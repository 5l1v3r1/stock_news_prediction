He said he did not accept the views of some that this would prove impossible.\n“I don’t believe that that is the case and next week I shall make a speech in which I shall set out our view of how it is possible to include services within such a trade deal,” Hammond told lawmakers in parliament.\nThe services sector accounts for almost 80 percent of British economic output.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by William Schomberg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T02:16:47.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
