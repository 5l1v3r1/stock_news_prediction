Competitors can charge 0.112799 peso per minute for mobile calls to their networks, it said.\nRival AT&T Inc calculated that for every peso cent America Movil can charge for interconnection fees, the company’s competitors in Mexico would collectively pay about $20 million per year.\nAmerica Movil was not available to comment.\nSlim holds about two-thirds of mobile phone subscriptions in Mexico.
