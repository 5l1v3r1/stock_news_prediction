Of 1,200 people interviewed in their homes, 22 percent did not respond.\nThe results show a similar trend to a poll published by Parametria last week, which also showed Anaya gaining slightly but had Lopez Obrador with a larger lead.\nThe July 1 election could be the first time that independent candidates make in onto the ballot. Thursday’s poll showed Margarita Zavala, wife of former President Felipe Calderon, halved her share of the vote since the previous survey to just 4 percent.\nReporting by Miguel Angel Gutierrez and Christine Murray; Editing by Alison Williams and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:07:39.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
