According to the Phoenix Wealth and Affluent Monitor, by Phoenix Marketing International, there were a total of 7.2 million millionaire households in 2017 — up 6% from 2016. Phoenix defines millionaire households as those with $1 million or more in investible assets. Of course, the most populous states had the most millionaires. But Phoenix also ranked states by millionaires per capita. For the seventh year in a row, Maryland ranked first with the highest number of millionaires per capita — with more than 1-in-12 households having $1 million or more. New Jersey ranked second, also with just about 1-in-12 households being millionaires. Connecticut ranked third, followed by Hawaii, Alaska, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. California had the most millionaires in total — 885,000 — but it ranked 10th in terms of per capita.

David Thompson, managing director of Phoenix Affluent Market, said the state rankings show that wealth creation continues to be concentrated in big urban centers on the coasts — around New York, Boston, Washington and Los Angeles. Those states also tend to lean Democratic in their politics. \"Those metro areas will continue to generate and mint new millionaires,\" he said. Maryland has dominated the list for so long because of the growth in the Washington suburbs of government-related contractors, lobbyists and consultants, he said.

While millionaires are currently clustered in high-tax, Democratic states, new limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes could drive more of the wealthy to lower tax states like Florida, Texas and Nevada. \"I do think we will see some migration, especially from the East Coast,\" he said. \"Those who may already have second homes in Florida and the South could move. I think that could accelerate.\" Multimillionaires did even better last year. The number of households worth $5 million or more surged 8% to 1.1 million. That was the fastest growth in six years. \"The rich are definitely getting richer and controlling more and more of the wealth,\" Thompson said. The main driver of all that added wealth was investing. He said the wealthy have \"better access to the best investment vehicles and better access to the advice\" on how to invest. State ranking of millionaires In the annual ranking of millionaires per capita by state, the 2017 Phoenix Wealth & Affluent Monitor found only a few changes in the top 10 states: Maryland (7.87%) – remained #1, where it has been since 2011 New Jersey (7.86%) moved up one place in 2017 Connecticut (7.75%) moved down one place Hawaii (7.57%) – unchanged from 2016 Alaska (7.50%) – unchanged from 2016 Massachusetts (7.41%) – unchanged from 2016 New Hampshire (7.36%) – unchanged from 2016 Virginia (6.98%) – unchanged from 2016 Delaware (6.62%) up one place from 2016 California (6.61%) – up one place from 2016. © CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.
