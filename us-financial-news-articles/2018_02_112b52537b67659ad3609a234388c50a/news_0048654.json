REUTERS/Omar Sobhani “I can’t go to school because of your corruption. I can see you,” is the message on a mural of a girl on blast walls near the interior ministry.\nAnother mural, of a black SUV with its windows tinted, takes a dig at the powerful and privileged.\n“What are you carrying, that your windows are black?” reads the message. “You don’t have a license plate and don’t stop for searches.”\nSlideshow (4 Images) A painting of a shoeshine boy says: “Don’t set off an explosion here, innocent people get killed.”\nOther murals extol the city’s street-sweeper “heroes”, encourage anti-polio efforts, and call for women’s rights.\nSharifi says he always gets permission for his work, though it can be a struggle. The group gets commissions from Afghan and international groups for “awareness raising and advocacy” and sells smaller artworks.\nRecently, on a cold, grey morning, the ArtLords were at the American University of Afghanistan, working on a mural on the tightly guarded campus to highlight resilience against violence.\nA 2016 militant attack on the university killed 16 people and shattered its image as an island of liberalism and learning.\nStudents came to help paint a picture of a young man and woman picking up their books, with a phoenix rising and the words: “I am back because education prevails”.\n“Kabul has been surrounded with blast walls which infuriate people but this art has a message of hope,” said student Faisal Imran, who took his turn with a brush.\nReporting by Robert Birsel\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T03:29:51.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
