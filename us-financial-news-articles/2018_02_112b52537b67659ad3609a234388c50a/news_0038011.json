A sports ministry official at that time said they took it simply for a replacement, but another South Korean player told reporters that Griffin wanted to keep it for herself.\nHowever, on Thursday, a spokesman for South Korea’s ice hockey association said the puck would instead be sent to the Hall of Fame.\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation’s Hall of Fame, located in Toronto, was established to honor leading players, coaches and officials, and displays hockey artifacts and memorabilia from around the world.\nLast month, the two Koreas agreed to field a combined women’s ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics as Seoul is trying to use the Games to re-engage with their neighbor and resolve tensions over the North’s nuclear arms ambitions.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Dan Burns; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:34:48.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
