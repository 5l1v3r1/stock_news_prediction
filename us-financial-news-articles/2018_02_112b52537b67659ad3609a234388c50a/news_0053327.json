generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP measures\"). Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, income per diluted share or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.\nWe define EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and accretion. We define adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude non-cash and non-recurring items as well as other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the agreements governing our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities. We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our performance compared to other companies in our industry because it eliminates the effect of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending, as well as certain items that are not indicative of our performance on an ongoing basis. Management uses adjusted EBITDA to measure the performance of our core operations at the consolidated, segment and business unit levels and as a metric for a significant portion of our management incentive plans.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment, excluding expenditures for significant new municipal contracts and significant purchases of land for future landfill airspace), net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. We define adjusted free cash flow as free cash flow excluding restructuring payments, capital markets costs, and non-recurring items. Management uses adjusted free cash flow to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash to fund its activities on an ongoing basis, and we believe adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors in evaluating our performance compared to other companies in our industry because it eliminates the effect of restructuring payments, capital market costs, and other non-recurring items, which are not indicative of our ability to generate cash on an ongoing basis.\nWe define adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share as net income (loss) from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude non-cash and non-recurring items. We believe adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We believe that these measures are useful in evaluating our operations as these measures are adjusted for items that affect comparability between periods.\nIn fiscal 2014, we made a strategic decision to enter into fuel derivatives as economic hedges of a rise in the price of diesel fuel for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. We have not entered into fuel derivatives since fiscal 2014 when the economic hedges for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 were put in place and have no present intention to enter into fuel derivatives. We therefore believe that excluding realized losses from fuel derivatives provides useful additional information for investors to evaluate comparability among periods and is consistent with how management evaluates performance. In fiscal 2016, we entered into interest rate caps as economic hedges of a rise in interest rates for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018 and the nine months ended September 30, 2019. We believe that excluding realized and unrealized gains and losses from interest rate derivatives from our adjusted EBITDA provides useful additional information in evaluating ongoing financial performance of the business as these derivatives represent a risk management tool to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates and are viewed by management as a financing cost similar to interest expense. We also purchased additional interest rate caps in fiscal 2017 to hedge the risk of rising interest rates from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2021. These interest rate caps qualify for hedge accounting and realized gains and losses will flow through interest expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA.\nADJUSTED EBITDA\nThe following table calculates adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion adjusted for certain other costs (in millions except percentages):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n42.0\n$\n(20.1)\n$\n38.3\n$\n(30.4)\nIncome tax benefit\n(39.8)\n(22.9)\n(41.2)\n(25.7)\nInterest expense\n23.3\n27.5\n93.0\n130.2\nDepreciation and amortization\n71.9\n57.5\n269.8\n246.9\nLoss on debt extinguishments and modifications\n3.7\n64.7\n3.7\n64.7\nAccretion on landfill retirement obligations\n4.3\n3.2\n15.4\n13.0\nAccretion on loss contracts and other long-term liabilities\n0.1\n0.1\n0.4\n0.4\nEBITDA from continuing operations\n105.5\n110.0\n379.4\n399.1\nEBITDA adjustments:\nAcquisition and development costs\n0.1\n0.5\n1.3\n0.7\nStock based compensation\n1.8\n1.5\n9.7\n5.5\nGreentree expenses, net of estimated insurance recoveries\n3.3\n—\n11.1\n—\nEarnings in equity investee, net\n0.3\n0.2\n0.3\n(0.3)\nRestructuring charges\n—\n—\n3.4\n0.8\nLoss on disposal of assets and asset impairments\n0.3\n0.6\n11.4\n1.8\nUnrealized gain on derivatives\n(3.2)\n(8.0)\n(1.5)\n(18.5)\nCapital market costs\n0.6\n(0.1)\n1.0\n7.1\nRealized loss on derivatives\n0.5\n3.0\n2.0\n14.9\nOther\n(0.4)\n—\n—\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n108.8\n$\n107.7\n$\n418.1\n$\n411.1\nRevenue\n$\n384.4\n$\n352.0\n$\n1,507.6\n$\n1,404.6\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n28.3\n%\n30.6\n%\n27.7\n%\n29.3\n%\nADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW\nThe following table calculates free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n61.4\n$\n45.3\n$\n308.8\n$\n237.0\nPurchases of property & equipment (a)\n(46.1)\n(46.8)\n(174.8)\n(171.0)\nProceeds from the sale of property & equipment\n0.4\n1.1\n2.2\n3.3\nFree cash flow\n15.7\n(0.4)\n136.2\n69.3\nAssumption of long-term care and closure reserves, net (b)\n2.0\n—\n(20.0)\n—\nRestructuring payments\n0.4\n0.4\n0.8\n2.1\nPayment to retired executive\n—\n—\n6.2\n—\nGreentree costs, net of insurance recoveries\n1.0\n—\n5.7\n—\nCapital market costs\n0.6\n0.4\n0.9\n7.7\nAdjusted free cash flow\n$\n19.7\n$\n0.4\n$\n129.8\n$\n79.1\nRealized loss on derivatives\n0.5\n3.0\n2.0\n14.9\nAdjusted free cash flow excluding realized loss on derivatives\n$\n20.2\n$\n3.4\n$\n131.8\n$\n94.0\n(a) Excludes the impact of land purchased for future airspace of $3.1 million during first quarter 2017 and the purchase of a facility related to a municipal contract of $8.7 million during third quarter 2017.\n(b) The Company received a cash payment of $24.0 million during first quarter 2017 that is included in net cash provided by operating activities in exchange for assuming certain post-closure liabilities of a closed portion of a landfill and became responsible for expenditures related to a gas infrastructure system.

Statements that address activities, events or developments that we intend, expect or believe may occur in the future are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and are subject to safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements do not guarantee future performance and may involve risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied in those forward-looking statements.\nThere are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. Such risks, uncertainties and factors include those set forth under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nExamples of these risks, uncertainties and other factors include, but are not limited to:\nour ability to achieve future profitability will depend on us executing our strategy and controlling costs;\nfuture results may be impacted by the expiration of net operating losses (NOLs);\nour tax position may be affected by recent changes in the U.S. tax law\nwe operate in a highly competitive industry and the inability to compete effectively with larger and better capitalized companies and governmental service providers;\nour results are vulnerable to economic conditions;\nwe may lose contracts through competitive bidding, early termination or governmental action;\nsome of our customers, including governmental entities, have suffered financial difficulties affecting their credit risk, which could negatively impact our operating results;\nour financial and operating performance may be affected by the inability in some instances to renew or expand existing landfill permits or acquire new landfills. Further, the cost of operation and/or future construction of our existing landfills may become economically unfeasible causing us to abandon or cease operations;\nwe could be precluded from maintaining permits or entering into certain contracts if we are unable to obtain sufficient third-party financial assurance or adequate insurance coverage;\nour accruals for our landfill site closure, post-closure and contamination related costs may be inadequate;\nour cash flow may not be sufficient to finance our high level of capital expenditures;\nour acquisitions, including our ability to integrate acquired businesses, or that the acquired businesses may have unexpected risks or liabilities;\nthe seasonal nature of our business and \"event-driven\" waste projects that could cause our results to fluctuate;\nAdverse and destructive weather conditions that could result in higher fuel costs, higher labor costs, reduced municipal contract productivity and higher disposal costs;\nwe may be subject in the normal course of business to judicial, administrative or other third-party proceedings that could interrupt or limit our operations, result in adverse judgments, settlements or fines and create negative publicity;\nfuel supply and prices may fluctuate significantly and we may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers;\nfluctuations in the prices of commodities may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\nincreases in labor and disposal costs and related transportation costs could adversely impact our financial results;\nefforts by labor unions could divert management attention and adversely affect operating results;\nwe depend significantly on the services of the members of our senior, regional and local management teams, and the departure of any of those persons could cause our operating results to suffer;\nwe are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations and, if our technology fails, our business could be adversely affected;\na cybersecurity incident could negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers;\noperational and safety risks, including the risk of personal injury to employees and others;\nwe are subject to substantial governmental regulation and failure to comply with these requirements, as well as enforcement actions and litigation arising from an actual or perceived breach of such requirements, could subject us to fines, penalties and judgments, and impose limits on our ability to operate and expand;\nour operations being subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as well as contractual obligations that may result in significant liabilities;\nfuture changes in laws or renewed enforcement of laws regulating the flow of solid waste in interstate commerce could adversely affect our operating results;\nfundamental change in the waste management industry as traditional waste streams are increasingly viewed as renewable resources and changes in laws and environmental policies may limit the items that enter the waste stream, any of which may adversely impact volumes and tipping fees at our landfills. Alternatives to landfill disposal may cause our revenues and operating results to decline;\nrisks associated with our substantial indebtedness and working capital deficit;\nrisks associated with our ability to implement our growth strategy as and when planned; and\nthe other risks described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of our 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe above examples are not exhaustive and new risks may emerge from time to time.
