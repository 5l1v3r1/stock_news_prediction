One of them, leading ship broker Howe Robinson Partners, said it “was at a loss” to explain why the exchange was replacing one fixed weight system with another that would omit 12 percent of the global dry bulk fleet.\n“The removal will almost certainly misrepresent the market, because handysize rates are less volatile than those of larger ships,” Howe Robinson said in a report.\nThe new weighting of the BDI, which has been published by the exchange in various forms since 1985, will comprise 40 percent capesizes, 30 percent panamaxes and 30 percent supramax ships.\n“It’s fair to say that the Baltic dry is now being set up to service financial derivatives more than industry purposes,” said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst with trade association BIMCO.
