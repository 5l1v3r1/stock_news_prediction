Frederik Andersen saved 26 of 29 shots as Toronto snapped its four-game winning streak and lost to the Bruins for the first time in seven straight regular-season meetings.\nThe winning streak was the Maple Leafs’ longest since a six-game surge from Nov. 6 to Nov. 18, which included back-to-back wins against the Bruins on Nov. 10 (3-2 OT) and Nov. 11 (4-1).\nBruins captain Zdeno Chara played in his 1,400th career game, making him the fourth European-born player and the 13th NHL defenseman to reach the milestone.\nBoston rookie Charlie McAvoy made his return 12 days after a heart procedure sidelined him for four games.\nBergeron’s team-leading 22nd goal from the high slot put Boston up 1-0 with 15:31 to play in the opening period. Marner tied it with his ninth goal on a power-play slap shot above the circle with 11:47 left in the first.\nPastrnak’s 21st goal, a wrist shot on a power play, with 10:38 to go in the second put the Bruins up for good. Krug’s eighth goal on a one-timer with 3:13 left in the period gave Boston some insurance.\nSchaller scored his seventh goal on an empty-netter with 1:39 left.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:42:25.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
