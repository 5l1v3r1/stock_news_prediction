Buchwald also oversees a variety of other Libor manipulation.\nSchwab and its outside lawyer Thomas Goldstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neal Katyal, who according to court records argued on the banks’ behalf, did not immediately respond to similar requests.\nLibor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is used by banks to set rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from each other.\nBanks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide. Last July, the head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data underpinning it.\nThe case is Charles Schwab Corp et al v Bank of America Corp et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-01189.\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T19:19:49.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
