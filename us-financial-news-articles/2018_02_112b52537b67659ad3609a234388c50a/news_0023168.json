We went out there with a job and we’re very happy that we did it,” he said, although he added they were a little disappointed at their score. \nA boisterous crowd of supporters chanted “USA! USA!” before the skate and much of the audience was clapping along with their routine. \nOlympic Athletes from Russia Ekaterina Bobrova and Dmitri Soloviev, part of the Russian team that won gold at the 2014 Sochi Games, were third with 74.76 points and lifted their team into third place overall on 21 points. \n“We had trouble with our rumba,” Soloviev told reporters. “Of course we’re disappointed because we worked on this element more than on the others.” \nJapan was in fourth overall on 19 points. \nThe first day of the team competition, which included the men’s and pairs short programmes, were marked by falls by Canada’s Patrick Chan and American jumping ace Nathan Chen, although the overall team scores were lifted by the later pairs results. \nThe women are set to skate their short programme later on Sunday, after which the top five nations will proceed to the free section of the team competition. \nThe pairs competition will cap the day of team competitions on Sunday, with the final rounds on Monday.
