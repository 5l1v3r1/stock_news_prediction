Mills played 17 minutes.\nGreen made three of his 3-pointers as the Spurs opened a 25-5 lead less than 10 minutes into the game, the first of their six-game “rodeo trip” taken annually when the San Antonio stock show and rodeo occupies the AT&T Center.\nAlex Len had 14 points, Josh Jackson had 13 and Dragan Bender had 12 for the Suns, who tied the worst margin of defeat in franchise history. Phoenix played without leading scorer Devin Booker (hip) for the second consecutive game.\nDejounte Murray had 14 points and three assists for the Spurs before leaving with a sprained ankle midway through second quarter, and Tony Parker had 13 points as the Spurs completed a sweep of the four-game season series.\nAldridge made 10 of 14 field-goal attempts and Green and Mills were each 6 of 9 against a Suns lineup that also was missing 7-footer Tyson Chandler, who sat out because of a neck injury.\nThe Spurs had a 62-44 rebounding edge and limited Phoenix to 34 percent shooting from the field.
