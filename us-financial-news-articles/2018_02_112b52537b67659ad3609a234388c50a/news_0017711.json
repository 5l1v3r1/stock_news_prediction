He had been hospitalised following an illness that began during a private trip to Egypt. \n“I know my brother is not well. It seems to be a question of weeks,” Prince Henrik’s brother, Étienne de Monpezat, said to Danish newspaper BT on Friday. \nCrown Princess Mary, who is Frederik’s wife, visited him in hospital in Copenhagen on Friday along with two of her children, the newspaper also said. Princess Mary was born in Australia. \nBorn Henri Marie Jean André de Laborde de Monpezat in France in 1934, Prince Henrik married Queen Margrethe in 1967 and they have two sons, the Crown Prince and Prince Joachim. \nThe Royal House in September said Prince Henrik had been diagnosed with dementia. \nThat announcement came after Prince Henrik had been the centre of controversy as he had announced that he did not wish to be buried next to his wife, saying he was unhappy she never acknowledged him as her equal. \nCrown Prince Frederik is a member of the International Olympic Committee.
