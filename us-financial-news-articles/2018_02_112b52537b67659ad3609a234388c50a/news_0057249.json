Press officials with Aramco Asia did not immediately comment.\nRussia beat Saudi Arabia to be the top oil supplier to China for the second year in a row in 2017. Robust demand from small, independent refineries boosted demand for Russian oil due to its smaller cargo size and proximity, while the Saudis banked on larger state refiners as key clients.\nIn May last year, Aramco signed a preliminary agreement with Norinco to build a refining and petrochemical project in Panjin.\nReporting by Chen Aizhu; Editing by Manolo Serapio Jr.\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T17:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:17:24.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
