I’ve worked so hard for the 500 and it was taken away from me,“ said the Scot whose first DQ in Sochi was for knocking into Fontana. ”I got crashed into in the semi and so got lane four (for the final)...I know it’s short track and you have to prepare for his but it hurts.\n“It’s out of my control. I got knocked over and that’s that. When it’s something you’ve worked on, for someone to knock you over, it seems so unfair....at least I can go home and think I didn’t make any mistakes but it still sucks.” In Sochi and its aftermath Christie was similarly keen to lay the blame elsewhere, despite getting herself into a bad position in the third race - leading to her disqualification - with the same tactics she used in the first. She was also disqualified from her second race for inexplicably moving too far infield at the finish and missing the line.\nAt the time she said she received abuse on social media and for a long while said she considered giving up the sport.\nBut she fought back well to establish herself among the world’s best and one of Britain’s few realistic medal hopes in Pyeongchang.\nChristie, who also raced in the Vancouver Olympics and is a 10-times European champion, can still deliver on that front but was not in the mood to think about it too much on Tuesday. “Hopefully, I can come back again, I can reset, I’ve got a week until my best distance (she races over 1000m and 1,500m),” she said. “But right now I can’t see living with this feeling.” (Writing by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:28:12.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
