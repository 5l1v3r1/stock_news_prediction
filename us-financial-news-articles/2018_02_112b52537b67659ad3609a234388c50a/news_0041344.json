Europe, Japan and Global Equity Funds all took in over $2.5 billion apiece, offsetting redemptions from U.S. Equity Funds, he says, adding that Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland and UK equity funds all took in over $200 million. One expection was Italy, which recorded outflows for the 10th week running, as the March 4 general elecion approaches. In the previous week redemptions from EPFR-tracked Europe Equity Funds hit an 80-week high. (Danilo Masoni) OPENING SNAPSHOT: EUROPEAN SHARES GALLOP AHEAD (0820 GMT) It looks like investors have turned their attention from bond yields and rising inflation to the strong earnings picture in Europe, as the STOXX 600 powers ahead this morning thanks to a slew of well-received company results. Rounding up a couple of early standout performers, Dutch oil storage company Vopak , French satellite operator Eutelsat and utility EDF are all up 4 to 12 percent after their updates. Swedish defence firm Saab is down around 11 percent, however, after proposing a lower than expected dividend. Danone's shares are also up only a modest 0.7 percent following   Here's your opening snapshot: (Kit Rees) WHAT'S ON OUR RADAR BEFORE THE EUROPEAN OPEN (0749 GMT) European shares are expected to open higher and snap a three-week losing streak on Friday as volatility calms down and investors put aside worries over inflation that sparked a heavy sell-off in global equities earlier in the month. Futures on top European country indexes were up 0.4-0.6 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark was up more than 2 percent so far this week. The STOXX however is still down around 7 percent from the 2 1/2 year peak hit in January. According to the latest data from Thomson Reuters, European fourth quarter earnings are seen rising 14.6 percent. That's a big upwards revision from last week's 11 percent growth forecast and follows 15 weeks marred by a string of downgrades. The revision has brought Europe to just below the 14.8 percent growth rate expected for the S&P 500, although \"earnings beats\" in the U.S. stand at 78 percent vs 50 percent in Europe.

(Danilo Masoni) CONSUMER STAPLES: FOOD FOR THOUGHT (0741 GMT) Yesterday we had full-year results from Nestle's, which dropped after forecasting only modest organic sales growth, whereas Danone has come out today saying that it is aiming for further sales and profit growth in 2018. Analysts are saying that Danone's full-year results have come in slightly ahead of consensus, but there is still work to be done. \"FY18 guidance is for DD EPS growth, which implies confidence on margins but not necessarily on the top line. We see good progress being made here, but ongoing negative momentum in Fresh Dairy testifies to the continuing challenges ahead,\" analysts at Jefferies say in a note. It has been a little difficult of late separating stock-specific weakness among consumer staples from the broader concerns around the impact of rising bond yields on the sector, but as you can see from the chart below their valuation premium has come down somewhat this year.
