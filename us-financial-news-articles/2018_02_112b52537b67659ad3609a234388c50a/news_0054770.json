Another suspect had been targeting troops on anti-terrorism patrols and had acquired bomb-making equipment, Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins announced last month.\n“Because the Islamic State is disappearing, people are seeking to stage attacks in western countries as a distraction from its defeat,” the minister said.\nThe military patrols were introduced nationwide following the January 7, 2015 attacks on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. They were stepped up later that year after the Nov 13 attacks in which 130 people were killed at the Bataclan concert hall and other sites around Paris.\nReporting by Yann Le Guernigou.
