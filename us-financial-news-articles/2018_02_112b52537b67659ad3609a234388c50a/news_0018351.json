Nearly 20 percent of reviews on Amazon's Brazilian marketplace are negative, compared with 10 percent in Mexico and just 4 percent in the United States, according to e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse.\nComplaints in Brazil often focus on delayed or cancelled orders - a problem dramatically reduced in other countries when Amazon itself packs and posts orders of third-party goods stored at its warehouse facilities.\nIn an early sign of Amazon's Brazilian logistics push, the company posted more than a dozen listings for distribution jobs in the country to LinkedIn last year, including \"Site leader, Fulfillment Center\".\nThe new warehouse site outside of Sao Paulo, in the municipality of Cajamar, looks to be a step in that direction.\nThere San Francisco-based logistics company Prologis Inc has offered a 50,000-square-meter space to Amazon in a new industrial park that hosts DHL and Samsung, according to sources, who said adaptation of the warehouse had not begun.\nPrologis, which also partnered with Amazon on a mega-warehouse north of Mexico city last year, declined to comment.\nThe preparations in Brazil come as Luft, the local logistics operator for Amazon's book business, readies a move into another Prologis site nearby in Cajamar, sources said, leaving its current 12,000-square-meter facility in the city of Barueri.\nAmazon registered in October to conduct operations in Cajamar, according to municipal records seen by Reuters.\nThe new logistics investment could spell trouble for rivals.\nMercado Libre has been a success story among Latin America tech start ups: its shares have nearly tripled since 2014, bringing its market capitalization to more than $15 billion.\nMagazine Luiza's stock has risen sixfold in each of the past two years as it shifted its rolled out an ambitious e-commerce strategy built on its brick and mortar stores.
