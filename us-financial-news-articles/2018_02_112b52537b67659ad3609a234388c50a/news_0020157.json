Actually I know,” he said.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. snowboarder Shaun White trains on the slopestyle snowboard course during practice for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Rosa Khutor, Russia February 4, 2014. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo “It’s like I said, it’s not just about one big trick, it’s about the whole run and I definitely have a couple of things in mind that I’ve been working on that I like to iron out and here’s the time to basically do it and try to put it in my run.”\nWhite has had a rocky preparation for the Games needing 62 stitches to his face after a horrific training crash in New Zealand late last year.\nHe then skipped the X Games, drained by an illness, after qualifying for the Olympics.\n“I took my time getting better and I feel great. Now I get the chance to show my best,” said White, adding his biggest challenge was not his fitness.\n“Honestly you know, the biggest hurdle to clear was just the mental game. Physically I feel stronger than I’ve ever felt before,” he said, seated at a news conference with the entire U.S. halfpipe team.\n”I feel more like I know who I am and I know my riding and my abilities. It’s just the kind of mental mindset of having won and then having to win after winning and win again after winning.\n“It is a great problem to have, but it’s finding that motivation, it’s finding that drive.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T07:27:26.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
