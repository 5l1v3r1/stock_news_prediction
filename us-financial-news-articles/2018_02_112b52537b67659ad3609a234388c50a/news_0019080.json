The Company’s net investment income was $0.16 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.16 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) was $6.60 per share as of December 31, 2017, compared to $6.72 as of September 30, 2017.\nOn February 6, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.15 per share, payable on April 12, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 27, 2018.\nMr. James Zelter, Apollo Investment’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “During the December quarter, we continued to successfully execute on our strategy by repositioning the portfolio into core assets and reducing our funding costs. The significant drivers of the decline in NAV for the quarter include 1) an unrealized mark-to-market loss our oil hedge which protects us against significant declines in the price of oil, partially offset by gains on our oil investment marks, 2) a realized loss associated with the redemption of higher cost debt which has a payback period of approximately one year, and 3) a loss on our investment in Solarplicity Group, among other factors. We are pleased to announce that subsequent to quarter end, we sold a majority of our investment in Solarplicity Group, a non-core asset that we had been actively seeking to exit, and whose exit we believe greatly enhances the quality of our portfolio and meaningfully reduced our non-core assets.” Mr. Zelter continued, “Additionally, we continued to actively repurchase stock below NAV during the quarter and have continued to do so in the March quarter. Since the inception of the stock repurchase program, we have repurchased approximately $119 million or 8.5% of shares outstanding through this shareholder friendly initiative.”\n(1) On October 16, 2017, the Company redeemed $150 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due 2042. The Company recognized a realized loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately $(5.8) million or $(0.03) per share during the three months ended December 31, 2017. (2) Subsequent to quarter end, a significant portion of the Company’s first lien secured debt investment in Solarplicity Group Limited was repaid at a price, slightly below the fair value as of December 31, 2017. The repayment reduced the Company’s exposure to Solarplicity Group Limited by approximately $106.4 million, assuming the same currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2017. Based on the fair value mark as of December 31, 2017 and including estimated escrowed amounts, the retained portion of the Company’s investment in Solarplicity Group Limited is approximately $16.4 million.
