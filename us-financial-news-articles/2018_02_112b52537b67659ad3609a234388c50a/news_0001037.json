De Beers, a unit of Anglo American ( AAL.L ), completed the sale of its Kimberley mines and assets two years ago as it focuses on its $2 billion Venetia project in South Africa’s Limpopo province. \n“One of the strengths that we’ve got is that we have a database with fairly reliable information from about the mid-1950s onwards,” Barton said. \n“Using that database we then apply the latest thinking and the latest technology. So a lot of our focus is around Kimberley where we used to mine. All the easy diamond deposits around the world have been found and that’s why you need to use new technology.” \nOn the Venetia project, Barton said that it was 35 percent complete and slightly under-budget, with first production still expected in 2021. \nSouth Africa accounts for about 9 percent of global diamond production and is ranked 5th behind Russia, Botswana, Canada and Angola. \nDe Beers was founded in 1888 by buccaneering businessman and British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. His statue was removed from the University of Cape Town in 2015 after it became a focal point for protesters who said it was a relic of the colonial past.
