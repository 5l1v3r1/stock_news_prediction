But the accusations have become exceptionally shrill as diplomacy has collided with passion. \nFather Bernardo Cervellera, head of the AsiaNews agency, which specialises in China, accused Archbishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, the head of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, of being “naive”. \nIn an interview this week, Sanchez Sorondo praised China, saying that Chinese today were those who are perhaps best implementing Church teachings on social issues, such as concern for the environment and human dignity.

Critics have blasted the deal because it would involve accepting the legitimacy of bishops appointed by the government.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon File Photo \nThe war of words also reached the stratosphere of Church hierarchy, cardinal versus cardinal. \nThe Vatican rebuked Cardinal Joseph Zen, 86, the outspoken former bishop of Hong Kong, after he accused it of “selling out” China’s underground Catholics to the communists. Zen, known for his feistiness, did not take it lying down. \nHe accused the Vatican’s chief diplomat, Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, of speaking “nonsense,” after Parolin said in an interview that the aim of dialogue was the greater good and that the Vatican understood the “pain” of Chinese Catholics. \nZen retorted in his blog on Monday: “Oh! This man who lacks faith, how would he understand what is real pain?!” \nA Vatican source has said the deal could be signed in the next few months. The clerical gloves are expected to stay off at least until then.
