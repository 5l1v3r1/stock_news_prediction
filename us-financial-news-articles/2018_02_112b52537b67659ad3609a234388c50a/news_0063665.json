He stopped all three shots he faced in the shootout, helping the Lightning earn a fourth consecutive win.\nVasilevskiy improved to 37-12-2 as Tampa Bay increased its Atlantic Division lead to five points over the second-place Maple Leafs.\nIt was the second straight game in which Point, who fired a shot over the right shoulder of Toronto goalie Frederik Andersen, scored the game-winner in a shootout.\nTyler Johnson, Adam Erne and Chris Kunitz scored in regulation for Tampa Bay, which lost NHL leading scorer Nikita Kucherov (82 points) in the first period due to an upper-body injury.\nIt was the eighth shootout goal in 13 career attempts for Point, who is also 3-of-5 this season.\nAndersen finished with 39 saves for Toronto. Marner had a goal and an assist while Tyler Bozak and James van Riemsdyk also scored for the Maple Leafs. Morgan Rielly added two assists.\nKunitz gave the Lightning a 1-0 lead just 1:41 into the game when he deflected Andrej Sustr’s wrist shot from the top of the slot through Andersen’s pads for his third goal in the past five games and 11th of the season.\nToronto answered with a pair of goal just 63 seconds apart. The first was by van Riemsdyk, his 26th goal of the season, on the rebound of a shot by Ron Hainsey. Marner followed with his 17th when Jake Gardiner’s crossing pass hit his right skate and was redirected through Vasilevskiy’s pads.\nTampa Bay rebounded to take a 3-2 lead in the second period with back-to-back goals by Johnson and Erne. Johnson rebounded his own shot and quickly went behind the net and wrapped the puck inside the post on Andersen’s stick side for his 18th goal of the season.\nErne picked up his second goal of the season when he intercepted a clearing pass by defenseman Roman Polak and then whirled around between the circles and wristed a shot past Andersen’s stick side.\nBozak then tied it 3-3 with a power-play goal at 5:27 of the third period, one-timing a crossing pass from Marner off Vasilevskiy’s right arm.\nMarner was hooked on a breakaway by Victor Hedman and rewarded a penalty shot with 6:02 left. However, Vasilevskiy stopped the shot, deflecting the puck wide with the toe of his left skate.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:19:09.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
