There’s a lot of highs and lows during the tournament but just stay focused and maintain composure and hopefully it will turn out your way’,” Ryan told reporters.\nIce Hockey – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men Preliminary Round Match - U.S. v Slovakia - Gangneung Hockey Centre, Gangneung, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Ryan Donato (16) of the U.S. celebrates after scoring a goal against Slovakia. REUTERS/Brian Snyder Donato senior was the second-highest scorer for the U.S. team who finished fourth at the 1992 Games in Albertville and he also happens to be Ryan’s coach at Harvard.\nIt all adds up to some pretty serious hockey DNA in the Donato family and Ryan heeded his father’s words when he chose a low, hard wrist shot to score his first goal against Slovakia.\n“Don’t shoot so high any more, don’t go top shelf,” Ted Donato told his son, although he wasn’t the only person to make that suggestion.\n“I think we probably mentioned that to him too, but we’ll give his dad credit for that one,” U.S. coach Tony Granato said with a laugh.\n“He can have it for sure. And if he wants to call back with any other tips for him before the Russian game he can do that.”\nReporting by Dan Burns, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:04:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
