Revenues rose more than 11 percent to 122.5 billion pesos from nearly 110 billion pesos in the last quarter of 2016.\nFemsa controls Coca-Cola Femsa, the world’s largest Coke bottler, which reported a $1.2 billion net loss in the fourth quarter, hampered by a change in the reporting of its results in Venezuela.\nHigher fuel costs in Mexico, higher labor costs and depreciation in Central America also took a toll on Coke Femsa’s results.\nFemsa said its retail division, which operates OXXO convenience stores, saw revenues rise 10 percent, but it noted that sales at stores open for at least a year had slowed.\n$1=19.6595 pesos Reporting by Sheky Espejo; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:52:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
