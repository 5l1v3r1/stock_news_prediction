He arrived on Monday and started hearing victims’ testimony on Tuesday.\nBefore his trip to Chile, Scicluna heard testimony in New York from a witness in the case against Bishop Juan Barros, accused by several men of covering up sexual abuse of minors by his mentor Father Fernando Karadima.\nThe Karadima case has gripped Chile and several groups in the country protested Pope Frances’ decision to appoint Barros bishop of Osorno in 2015.\nScicluna was due to hear testimony from victims until his scheduled departure from Chile on Friday.\nReporting by Fabian Cambero; Writing by Cassandra Garrison; Editing by Hugh Bronstein and Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:00:20.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
