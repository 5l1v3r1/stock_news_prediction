The Company also announced that it will host a conference call on Wednesday, February 28, 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial and operating results.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") oil prices averaged $55.40 per barrel, Northwest Pipeline (\"NWPL\") natural gas prices averaged $2.60 per MMBtu and NYMEX natural gas prices averaged $2.93 per MMBtu. The Company had derivative commodity swaps that settled in the fourth quarter of 2017 for 8,125 barrels of oil per day tied to WTI pricing at $57.69 per barrel, 10,000 MMBtu of natural gas per day tied to NWPL regional pricing at $2.96 per MMBtu and no hedges in place for NGLs.\nBased on preliminary unaudited results, the Company expects to realize a cash commodity derivative gain of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter due to positive derivative positions. The Company expects its fourth quarter commodity price differentials to benchmark pricing – before commodity derivative gains and taking into account delivery location and quality adjustments – to average approximately: WTI less $2.44 per barrel for oil and NWPL less $0.28 per thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\") for natural gas. The Denver-Julesburg Basin oil price differential averaged WTI less $2.51 per barrel in the quarter. NGL prices averaged approximately 44% of the WTI price per barrel of oil during the quarter.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's hedge position as of February 7, 2018:\nOil (WTI)\nNatural Gas (NWPL)\nPeriod\nVolume\nBbls/d\nPrice\n$/Bbl\nVolume\nMMBtu/d\nPrice\n$/MMBtu\n1Q18\n9,250\n52.99\n5,000\n2.68\n2Q18\n10,000\n53.28\n5,000\n2.68\n3Q18\n10,500\n53.92\n5,000\n2.68\n4Q18\n10,500\n53.92\n5,000\n2.68\n1Q19\n5,750\n54.25\n2Q19\n5,750\n54.25\n3Q19\n4,750\n54.07\n4Q19\n4,750\n54.07\nRealized sales prices will reflect basis differentials from the index prices to the sales location.\nThe Company estimates that the weighted average common basic and diluted shares for the fourth quarter will be approximately 83.1 million. At December 31, 2017, the common shares outstanding were approximately 110.4 million.\nThe Company plans to issue its fourth quarter 2017 financial and operating results press release after the market close on Tuesday, February 27, 2018.
