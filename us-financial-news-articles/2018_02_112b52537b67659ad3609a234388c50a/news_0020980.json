This was a business worth fighting for and that’s certainly what I sought to do during my time as chief executive.”\nUnder questioning from lawmakers Cochrane said that net debt was too high at the end of 2016 and the company was trying to reduce it before it faced a deterioration of cash flow after March 2017.\nReporting by Paul Sandle and Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T18:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:39:53.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
