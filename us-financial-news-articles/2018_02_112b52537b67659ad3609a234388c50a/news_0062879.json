Encompass Health is poised for continued success with strong operating and financial platforms and substantial free cash flow to deploy towards value creating growth opportunities.\"\nConsolidated results\nGrowth\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nDollars\nPercent\n(In Millions, Except per Share Data)\nNet operating revenues\n$\n1,019.7\n$\n949.9\n$\n69.8\n7.3\n%\nIncome from continuing operations attributable\nto Encompass Health per diluted share\n0.61\n0.68\n(0.07)\n(10.3)\n%\nAdjusted earnings per share\n0.70\n0.72\n(0.02)\n(2.8)\n%\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n151.4\n135.0\n16.4\n12.1\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n208.2\n198.8\n9.4\n4.7\n%\nAdjusted free cash flow\n91.5\n80.0\n11.5\n14.4\n%\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nCash flows provided by operating activities\n657.2\n634.4\n22.8\n3.6\n%\nAdjusted free cash flow\n467.6\n474.5\n(6.9)\n(1.5)\n%\nRevenue growth was driven by volume growth in both of the Company's operating segments.\nThe decrease in income from continuing operations attributable to Encompass Health per diluted share and adjusted earnings per share resulted from an increase in the effective income tax rate. Income from continuing operations attributable to Encompass Health per diluted share includes the application of the lower income tax rate to the Company's net deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nRevenue growth was the primary driver of the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities and Adjusted EBITDA for both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\nAdjusted free cash flow increased in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to increased Adjusted EBITDA and favorable working capital changes.\nAdjusted free cash flow for full-year 2017 decreased compared to full-year 2016 primarily due to increased cash payments for taxes (due to exhaustion of the Company's federal net operating loss in the first quarter of 2017) and increased maintenance capital expenditures in 2017.\nSee attached supplemental information for calculations of non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measure.\n\"Adjusted free cash flow for 2017 exceeded our expectations and resulted from strong operating performance and the favorable impact on net working capital attributable to the decline in pre-payment claims denials,\" said Doug Coltharp, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Encompass Health.\nInpatient rehabilitation segment results\nGrowth\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nDollars\nPercent\nNet operating revenues:\n(In Millions)\nInpatient\n$\n784.7\n$\n740.9\n$\n43.8\n5.9\n%\nOutpatient and other\n26.1\n26.7\n(0.6)\n(2.2)\n%\nTotal segment revenue\n$\n810.8\n$\n767.6\n$\n43.2\n5.6\n%\n(Actual Amounts)\nDischarges\n43,910\n41,474\n2,436\n5.9\n%\nSame-store discharge growth\n3.9\n%\nNet patient revenue per discharge\n$\n17,871\n$\n17,864\n$\n7\nâ€”\n%\n(In Millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n207.1\n$\n197.6\n$\n9.5\n4.8\n%\nRevenue - Revenue growth resulted from strong volume growth. Holiday-related timing differences favorably impacted discharge growth and negatively impacted revenue per discharge. Discharge growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 5.9% compared to 1.4% discharge growth in the fourth quarter of 2016. Same-store discharge growth was 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Discharge growth from new stores resulted from the Company's joint ventures in Gulfport, Mississippi (April 2017), Westerville, Ohio (April 2017), and Jackson, Tennessee (July 2017), as well as the opening of wholly owned hospitals in Modesto, California (October 2016) and Pearland, Texas (October 2017).\nOutpatient and other revenue decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 notwithstanding $1.9 million in provider tax recoveries. Adjusted EBITDA - The increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the inpatient rehabilitation segment resulted primarily from revenue growth. Lower group medical expenses also contributed to growth in Adjusted EBITDA. The year-over-year decline in group medical expenses favorably impacted salaries and benefits as a percent of net operating revenues and served to offset the impact of compensation increases and the ramping up of new stores on this ratio. Other operating expenses increased as a percent of net operating revenues primarily due to increased provider tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the impact of favorable franchise tax recoveries in the fourth quarter of 2016. Bad debt expense as a percent of net operating revenues decreased from 1.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 1.0% in the fourth quarter of 2017 due primarily to a reduction in new pre-payment claims denials.

The decrease in revenue per episode resulted from Medicare reimbursement rate cuts partially offset by changes in patient mix and reconciliation payments attributed to various alternative payment models (e.g., BPCI; ACOs).\nThe increase in hospice and other revenue primarily resulted from acquisitions completed in 2016.

In addition, the Company will post supplemental information today on its website at http://investor.encompasshealth.com for reference during its February 27, 2018 earnings call.\nThe financial data contained in the press release and supplemental information include non-GAAP financial measures, including the Company's adjusted earnings per share, leverage ratio, Adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted free cash flow. Reconciliations to their most comparable GAAP measure, except with regard to non-GAAP guidance, are included below or in the Q4 Earnings Form 8-K. Readers are encouraged to review the \"Note Regarding Presentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included in the Q4 Earnings Form 8-K which provides further explanation and disclosure regarding the Company's use of these non-GAAP financial measures.\nExcluding net operating revenues, the Company does not provide guidance on a GAAP basis because it is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the future impact of items that are deemed to be outside the control of the Company or otherwise non-indicative of its ongoing operating performance. Such items include government, class action, and related settlements; professional feesâ€”accounting, tax, and legal; mark-to-market adjustments for stock appreciation rights; gains or losses related to hedging instruments; loss on early extinguishment of debt; adjustments to its income tax provision (such as valuation allowance adjustments and settlements of income tax claims); items related to corporate and facility restructurings; and certain other items the Company believes to be non-indicative of its ongoing operations. These items cannot be reasonably predicted and will depend on several factors, including industry and market conditions, and could be material to the Company's results computed in accordance with GAAP.\nHowever, the following reasonably estimable GAAP measures for 2018 would be included in a reconciliation for Adjusted EBITDA if the other reconciling GAAP measures could be reasonably predicted:\nProvision for doubtful accounts - estimate of 1.6% to 1.9% of net operating revenues Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and fees - estimate of $147 million to $157 million Amortization of debt-related items - approximately $7 million\nThe Q4 Earnings Form 8-K and, when filed, the 2017 Form 10-K can be found on the Company's website
