REUTERS/Khalil Ashawi On Thursday, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag said he believed there was no deal in place between the Syrian government and the YPG.\n“We have information that they have not reached a deal,” Bozdag said in a televised interview.\nHowever, the YPG commander of a Kurdish-held enclave in Aleppo said the government had regained control over districts there after the militia pulled out to help relieve Afrin.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Earlier on Thursday, a witness and a war monitoring group said government forces had moved into the enclave.\nAssad has repeatedly said he wants to take back every inch of Syria, but the state had tolerated Kurdish control over the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsoud area and nearby Aleppo neighborhoods that the YPG captured from rebels in late 2016.\nThe government and the Kurdish forces control more of Syria than any other side in the war, and any signs of deals between them are closely watched.\nBoth Assad and the YPG regard Turkey as an enemy. Ankara was one of the biggest powers supporting anti-Assad rebels early in the war, and is now targeting the Kurdish militia, which it sees as an offshoot of the PKK insurgency it is fighting at home.\nTurkey launched its air and ground offensive on Afrin last month, seeking to drive out the YPG, which it deems a security threat along its border.\nThe offensive began slowly as Turkey and its allies struggled to gain ground in the hilly region, but it has begun advancing more quickly.\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S.-backed alliance of militias of which the YPG is the strongest part, complained in a statement on Thursday of Turkish air and artillery attacks on the region. Turkey has also accused the YPG of shelling civilian areas.\nReporting by Ellen Francis in Beirut and Tuvan Gumrukcu in Ankara; Writing by Angus McDowall; Editing by Peter Graff and Kevin Liffey\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T21:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T21:45:11.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
