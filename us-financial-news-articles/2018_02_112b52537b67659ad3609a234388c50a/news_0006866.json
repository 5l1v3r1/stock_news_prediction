The good thing is most of the increase looks to be allocated for development projects,” economist Keith Jefferis told Reuters.\nThe spending figure excludes statutory expenditure, such as public debt and pensions payments, which are approved under a separate law. Statutory expenditure stood at 6.98 billion pula in the 2017/18 financial year.\nAccording to a budget planning paper released by the finance ministry last October, the deficit is seen widening to 8 billion pula in the 2018/2019 fiscal year leading to cumulative budget gap of 15 billion pula by 2020.
