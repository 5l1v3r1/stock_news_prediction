If members vote ‘no’ to the coalition deal, a new election looks the most likely option.\nThe most urgent matter for the SPD is to get a new leader in place after Martin Schulz said last week he would quit to allow the party to regroup.\nThe frontrunner is Nahles, a plain-speaking 47-year-old former labour minister with a left-wing slant and strong oratory skills, but the manner in which Schulz appeared to anoint her angered many members.\nIn particular, plans for her to take over with immediate effect on a caretaker basis until a party conference expected in March has led to resistance as it breaches party procedure.\nThe SPD steering committee and board meet later on Tuesday to decide on a temporary successor to Schulz and some members have complained it looks like a stitch-up.\nThe mayor of the northern city of Flensburg, Simone Lange, said she would stand against Nahles. The post was “of great importance for the whole party and the whole country and should not be decided by a small internal group,” wrote Lange, according to her letter widely cited by German media.\nThe Berlin branch of the SPD also opposes Nahles’ appointment as caretaker leader.\n“LACK OF DISCIPLINE”\nOther senior party members back Nahles and urged the party to put its house in order quickly.\n“Every one of us would be well advised to put the interests of the party and country above personal ambition. End the lack of discipline in the SPD!” one of the party’s deputy leaders, Ralf Stegner, told the Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung.\nIn a cartoon on Tuesday, the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily showed Nahles with a whip riding an SPD snail.\nSchulz ditched plans to take the post of foreign minister after fierce criticism from some former allies, not least because he had vowed not to serve in a cabinet with Merkel.\nThat leaves open who from within the SPD may take up that post. Media have speculated that one option might be Katarina Barley, a former SPD general secretary and family minister, or SPD veteran Thomas Oppermann.\nEurope’s biggest economy has been without a formal government since the Sept. 24 election and investors are worried about a delay in policymaking, both at home and in Europe.\nThe turmoil in the SPD can only distract from criticism of Merkel from within her own party after she handed the foreign and finance ministries to the SPD to get a coalition deal.\nAn INSA poll published on Tuesday showed the SPD at a record low of 16.5 percent, only 1.5 percentage points ahead of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Merkel’s conservative bloc was also down 1 point at 29.5 percent.
