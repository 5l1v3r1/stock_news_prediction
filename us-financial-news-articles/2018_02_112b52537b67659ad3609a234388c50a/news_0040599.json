Thomson Reuters Foundation / Isabella Howell “Rather than launching yet another report on the fashion system, we wanted to create a powerful example of how fashion can be at its best,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nCONSUMER POWER After living as refugees in Gambia and Kenya during the 1990s, Sydney-Davies and her mother moved to Britain in 2000.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Obsessed with style as a child, she decided to start her own clothing brand after graduating with a degree in fashion. But she realised she could not afford to make clothes in Britain.\n“I thought rather than go to China or India, where I know nothing about the working conditions, why not make clothes in Sierra Leone?” she said, fiddling with her colourful braids.\nSydney-Davies set up a shack in the capital, Freetown, and spent a month teaching seven men and women how to make clothes.\nKnowing her employees personally and ensuring they are paid a decent wage is a source of pride for Sydney-Davies.\n“There is no system in (Sierra Leone) to guarantee workers’ rights or monitor supply chains - so ensuring working conditions were adequate was very important for me,” the designer said.\nSydney-Davies, whose latest collection “Gold Rush” includes dresses made of recycled plastic, said she wanted her designs to make the wearer feel like a “king or queen”.\nHer ambition is to inspire more entrepreneurs to start businesses in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, and build a huge factory there which would be open to other designers.\nAs for the global fashion industry, Sydney-Davies said consumers have a responsibility to hold big brands to account.\n“Without the consumer, the fashion industry is nothing,” Sydney-Davies said. “If consumers’ attitudes and behaviours change, it will force businesses to rethink how they operate.”\nReporting by Zoe Tabary @zoetabary, Editing by Kieran Guilbert.
