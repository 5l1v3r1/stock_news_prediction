A “no” vote would likely lead to new elections, prolonging uncertainty in Europe’s most populous country and economic powerhouse.\nThe SPD has slid into disarray since its leaders struck the coalition deal last week, blighted by bitter divisions over whether to join the coalition, a loss of confidence in outgoing leader Martin Schulz and discontent over the succession process.\nSeeking to restore order, Schulz resigned with immediate effect on Tuesday and party leaders installed Scholz as caretaker SPD chairman. They also confirmed that they recommended parliamentary floor leader Andrea Nahles as Schulz’s longer-term successor.\nThe manner in which Schulz originally anointed Nahles as his successor - without broad consultation - rankled with many in the party and resulted in Scholz being appointed as interim leader on Tuesday.\nAn extraordinary party congress will be held on April 22 to pick a new leader, likely Nahles.\nScholz played up the SPD’s achievements in coalition negotiations with Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) and her Bavarian allies, at which the centre-left party won the powerful finance ministry to the frustration of many in the CDU.\n“One has only to look at the discussion in the CDU to know that we must have got it right somehow,” said Scholz.\n“Not only has a Bavarian politician passed the pinnacle of his career, but probably a woman from the north too,” he added in a dig at Merkel and Horst Seehofer, leader of the arch-conservative Bavarian sister party (CSU) to Merkel’s CDU.
