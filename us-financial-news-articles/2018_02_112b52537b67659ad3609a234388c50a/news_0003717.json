Unfortunately I will not be at 100 percent ready for next week. If I play it would lead to additional risks and complications.” \nLocal favourite Dimitrov will be replaced by Swiss Stan Wawrinka, who is trying to resurrect his career after suffering a knee injury. \n“On back of disappointing news of Dimitrov injury, great that triple grand slam champion Stan Wawrinka will play Sofia Open,” the tournament director Paul McNamee said on Twitter. \nSouth Korea’s Chung Hyeon will also miss the tournament after failing to recover from the foot injury that forced him to retire from his Australian Open semi-final against Roger Federer.
