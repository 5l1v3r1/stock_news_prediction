Tough, tough questions. I would tell you that we’re looking at all of those possibilities,” Hayes said.\nThe CEO’s comment comes nearly a month after he indicated that a review was possible only after the closure of its acquisition of avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins Inc ( COL.N ) by the third quarter of 2018.\nHayes said on Wednesday if the company were to split, its aerospace business would have about $45 billion to $50 billion in sales, Otis elevators unit about $12 billion to $13 billion, and the climate-control business about $17 billion to $18 billion.\n“That’s the question for the board. That’s the question we continue to study,” he said.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:48:10.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
