[nL2N1MS0MC]\nBefore joining the White House, Carroll, a lawyer, worked for the Ford Motor Co. He has also held posts at the U.S. Treasury and Justice Department.\nTrump has been criticized for his response to the opioid epidemic. He has yet to declare it a national emergency as he pledged to do in August following a recommendation by a presidential commission.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids were responsible for more than 33,000 U.S. deaths in 2015, the latest year for which data is available. Estimates show the death rate has continued rising.\nReporting by Eric Beech; editing by Eric Walsh and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T01:45:53.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
