Revenue was $328.9 million in this year’s fourth quarter compared to $330.2 million in the comparable period last year. Operating income was $47.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $43.3 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Foreign currency translation increased revenue by approximately 3%, operating income by approximately 2% and earnings per share by approximately 1% in the fourth quarter.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.03 compared to $2.74 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue was approximately $1.4 billion in both 2017 and 2016. Operating income was $167.8 million and $185.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on full year 2017 revenue, operating income or earnings per share.\nThe reported results include restructuring and other costs and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Legislation”), which are described in more detail under “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Amounts” below. Restructuring and other costs reduced operating income by $2.9 million ($4.7 million after-tax or 11 cents per share), in this year’s fourth quarter and $48.1 million ($42.5 million after-tax or 96 cents per share), for the full year of 2017. The impact of the 2017 Tax Legislation on net earnings was $18.4 million, or 42 cents per share, in both the current quarter and full year of 2017. In 2016, restructuring and other costs reduced operating income by $6.2 million ($4.2 million after-tax or 9 cents per share), in the fourth quarter, and $26.1 million ($21.1 million after-tax or 47 cents per share), for the full year of 2016.\nThe adjusted results, discussed below, eliminate the impact of restructuring and other costs, and the 2017 Tax Legislation, and enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s performance when viewed together with our GAAP results. Refer to “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Amounts” below. Sensient’s adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations increased approximately 5% to 84 cents in this year’s fourth quarter, compared to 80 cents in the comparable period last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $50.3 million, compared to $49.5 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Foreign currency translation increased adjusted operating income by approximately 2% and adjusted earnings per share by approximately 1%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $3.42, an increase of approximately 6.5%, from last year’s result of $3.21. Adjusted operating income was $215.9 million for the full year of 2017 compared to $211.7 million in the comparable period last year. Foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on either full year 2017 adjusted operating income or adjusted earnings per share.\nCash provided by operating activities was $69.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $71.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2017 and 2016 cash flow results included proceeds of $20 million and $40 million, respectively, from accounts receivable securitization transactions. The Company repurchased 300,000 shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2017 and approximately 1.1 million shares for the full year. Including dividend payments, the Company returned approximately $140 million to shareholders in 2017.\nBUSINESS REVIEW\nThe Color Group reported revenue of $126.2 million in the quarter and $119.7 million in last year’s fourth quarter, an increase of 5.4%. Segment operating income increased 11.4% to $25.5 million in the quarter from $22.9 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Foreign currency increased both revenue and operating income by approximately 3% in the quarter. The Group’s higher profit was driven by continued strong results in Cosmetics and solid performances by the Food Color businesses in North America and Asia.\nFor the full year, the Color Group reported revenue of $526.4 million, an increase of 4.4% from $504.1 million reported in the comparable period last year. Segment operating income increased 7.2% to $113.4 million compared to $105.8 million reported in 2016. Foreign currency translation increased both revenue and operating income by approximately 1% in 2017.\nThe Flavors & Fragrances Group reported fourth quarter revenue of $178.5 million compared to $187.1 million reported in the comparable period last year. Segment operating income was $24.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to $28.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Group’s lower results were primarily due to the carryover of higher than expected costs incurred at one site involved in restructuring. While the operational and sales backlog issues experienced at this site earlier in 2017 have been addressed, the costs involved were higher than expected and have reduced the Group’s fourth quarter results. Outside of this one site, the business performed well with good profit growth from the BioNutrients, European Sweet and European Savory businesses. Foreign currency translation increased revenue by approximately 2% in the quarter and had a minimal impact on operating income. The impact of the two divestitures that occurred in the first quarter of this year, decreased revenue by approximately 4% in the quarter.\nThe Flavors & Fragrances Group reported revenue of $746.9 million and $795.8 million for the full years of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Segment operating income was $114.3 million in 2017 and $124.1 million in 2016. Foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on both revenue and operating income in 2017. The impact of the two divestitures that occurred in the first quarter of this year, decreased revenue by approximately 3% in 2017.\nThe Asia Pacific Group reported revenue of $31.9 million, an increase of 3.7% compared to $30.8 million reported in the comparable period last year. Segment operating income was $6.0 million and $6.1 million in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign currency translation increased segment revenue and operating income by approximately 2% and 3%, respectively. For the full year of 2017 and 2016, revenue was $123.2 million and $121.2 million, respectively. Segment operating income was $20.8 million and $23.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foreign currency translation increased both revenue and operating income by approximately 1% in 2017.\nCorporate & Other, which includes the restructuring and other costs, reported operating costs of $8.2 million in the current quarter and $14.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, the Corporate & Other segment, had operating costs of $80.7 million compared to $67.9 million in 2016. The higher Corporate & Other costs in 2017 are primarily attributable to higher restructuring and other costs, which principally relate to the non-cash losses from the divestitures of two businesses in the year.\n“The Company delivered adjusted earnings per share growth of 6.5%, and the Color Group had a strong year,” said Paul Manning, Chairman, President and CEO of Sensient Technologies Corporation. “With our restructuring now complete, I am confident Sensient will deliver strong results in 2018, and I remain very optimistic about the Company’s future.”\n2018 OUTLOOK\nSensient expects diluted earnings per share for 2018 to be between $3.70 and $3.90.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full year financial results at 10:00 a.m. CST on Friday, February 9, 2018.
