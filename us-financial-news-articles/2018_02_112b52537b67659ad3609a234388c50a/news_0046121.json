Deutsche Boerse warned in October that profit for 2017 was “very likely” to fall short of its target.\nThe earnings are the first since Theodor Weimer assumed the helm of the German stock exchange as its chief executive at the start of the year, and he sounded an optimistic note for 2018.\nHe forecast revenue growth of at least 5 percent and said he doesn’t expect further headwinds.\n“Our efficient cost management will ensure the scalability of our business model so that we expect at least 10 percent net income growth for 2018,” Weimer said.\nWeimer aims to open a new chapter after Deutsche Boerse was beset by an insider trading scandal, a failed merger with its London counterpart and a profit warning.\nThe exchange hopes that Britain’s departure from the European Union will offer Deutsche Boerse an historic opportunity to expand its business and secure a larger portion of the euro clearing business.\nWeimer will speak on Deutsche Boerse’s earnings and strategy at an annual press conference on Wednesday.\nDeutsche Boerse said it would propose a 2017 dividend of 2.45 euros per share, up 4 percent from the previous year.
