X-ray shows no damage, according to team doctor Jacob Swanberg,” the team wrote in an email to Reuters, a day after the crash during the final jump in Hedberg’s first run at the snowboard slopestyle qualifications.\nThe 24-year-old Hedberg was taken from the slopes in a neck brace after Friday’s accident.\nHedberg broke his neck last March in an accident during an event in Italy and underwent surgery. He returned to competition last November.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:10:05.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
