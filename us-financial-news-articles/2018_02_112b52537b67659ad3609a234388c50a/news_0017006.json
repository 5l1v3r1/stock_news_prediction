We consider the workers as our own children and treat them accordingly. We are supporting the police probe.”\nOn its website Dollar Industries describes itself as one of India’s leading knitwear companies, employing almost 600 people and exporting clothes to the Middle East and Nepal.\nIndia is one of the world’s largest textile and garment manufacturers, supplying local and international markets.\nCampaigners say workers in the industry are mainly young women from poor, illiterate and low-caste communities, who work up to 12 hours a day, and often face intimidation, sexual remarks and harassment.\nT.G. Vinay, the administrative head of Dindigul district, where the mill is based, said it would be “of serious concern” if Balasubramani had been 14 years old. He said the case is being investigated.\n“We are awaiting our own probe report and will intensify measures to ensure girls don’t drop out of school, and more frequent inspection of factories takes place to prevent such incidents,” he said.\nA local rights group, the Serene Secular Social Service Society, said it had documented the deaths of at least 10 workers at mills in western Tamil Nadu in the past four months.\n“Instead of trying to improve labour conditions, mills are buying the silence of families by giving a small, one-time compensation for the deaths,” said S. James Victor, director of the Dindigul-based charity.
