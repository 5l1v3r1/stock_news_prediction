Even before this, the countries had a series of disputes over gas prices, with the Kremlin accusing Ukraine of diverting supplies to domestic consumers that were supposed to transit to European Union countries.\nRussia therefore wants to ship gas by alternative transit routes as much and soon as possible. It is planning to boost capacity of an existing undersea pipeline to Germany, a project known as Nord Stream 2, which together with TurkStream would remove the need to send any gas via Ukraine.\nAny serious delay to TurkStream, a project promoted by President Vladimir Putin, could deepen doubts among some Western analysts that it will ever be built in its current form.\nTurkStream is designed to deliver more supplies to Turkey, the biggest buyer of Russian gas after Germany. More significantly for Moscow, it is also designed to extend across Turkey to the borders of southern Europe, thus opening up a new transit route for Russian gas.\nGazprom, which did not respond to a written request for comment, wants to complete the pipeline’s construction in 2019 so time is of the essence.\nA second source said the permit problem might be related to talks between Gazprom and Turkish state company Botas about a possible discount for Russian gas. “It looks like Gazprom will have to give in (to Botas),” the source said.\nFILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan during a news conference following their talks in Sochi, Russia May 3, 2017. REUTERS/Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool/File Photo A third source in the Turkish energy industry told Reuters that Botas and Gazprom had yet to set up a joint venture they were meant to form for the land-based part of TurkStream. This was why a construction permit had not yet been issued, the source added.\nBotas and the Turkish Energy Ministry declined to comment.\nFor TurkStream map, click on bit.ly/2EIYRdu\nTROUBLED BIRTH\nFILE PHOTO: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Gazprom Chief Executive Alexei Miller inspect the work on the Turkish Stream gas pipeline project aboard the Pioneering Spirit pipeline-laying ship in the Black Sea near Anapa, Russia June 23, 2017. Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Kremlin/File Photo via REUTERS Gazprom has already started laying the undersea TurkStream lines, to Turkey and southern Europe respectively, beneath the Black Sea. The pipes, with a combined capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, have yet to reach land.\nOn Monday, TurkStream’s operating company said Gazprom had already built 884 km (550 miles) of the two lines, almost half the pipeline’s entire subsea portion.\nGazprom already supplies gas to Samsun on Turkey’s Black Sea coast via an underwater pipeline called Blue Stream with a capacity of 16 bcm per year.\nTurkStream’s birth has been troubled. Gazprom was forced to abandon plans for a total of four TurkStream lines after failing to agree on an entry point into southern Europe.\nTalks between Moscow and Ankara about the project were also suspended in October 2015 after the Turkish military downed a Russian warplane near the Turkish-Syrian border.\nPutin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan eventually mended their relations and agreed to revive trade ties a year later.\nRussia and Turkey have since begun to cooperate with Iran on trying to find a solution to the Syrian crisis. Putin and Erdogan are in regular contact on this and other issues.\n($1 = 0.8102 euros)\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin and Oksana Kobzeva in Moscow and Ece Toksabay in Ankara; Editing by Andrew Osborn and David Stamp\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:03:56.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
