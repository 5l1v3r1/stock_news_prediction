Augustin 10 to go with a team-high nine assists for Orlando, which lost its third straight on the road.\nGordon had exploded for 40 points when the Magic won 121-108 at home over Oklahoma City in November. The teams split their season series.\nThe Magic connected on seven 3-pointers, including three by center Vucevic, while taking as much as eight-point lead in the first quarter.\nOrlando totaled 12 3-pointers in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T11:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:39:58.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
