They argued in court that Breitburn had low-balled its valuation in order to favor creditors who stood to gain control over its assets.\nBreitburn's reorganization plan envisioned splitting its assets into two companies, one created through a $775 million rights offering and the other through a debt-for-equity swap.\nA group of unsecured creditors led by Elliott Management Corp and WL Ross & Co were set to own Breitburn's Permian Basin reserves in Texas through their participation in the rights offering, while creditors with $793 million of debt would own a second company with oil reserves in California, the Rocky Mountains, the U.S. Midwest and Southeast.\nFollowing news of the Lime Rock bid, the equity committee asked the court to reopen the record to submit the new evidence and called for a hearing on Feb. 13.\nThe stakes are high for the equity holders because Breitburn is structured as a \"master limited partnership,\" which provides tax advantages when the company is profitable.\nBut when such companies file for bankruptcy, investors who hold their units can lose an entire investment and still be hit with a tax bill because the debt canceled in the bankruptcy is treated as income.\nBreitburn said it has given Lime Rock until March 9 to complete due diligence.
