We do not fix the path of interest rates in advance. What is fixed is our remit and rates change with the economy.”\nBroadbent said he thought the surge in stock market volatility this week reflected the fact that investors had not properly priced in the possibility that stronger economic growth can also generate inflation pressures.\nOn the outlook for Britain’s economy, Broadbent said he thought income growth in real terms would return in the current quarter and that inflation was now pretty close to its peak.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:05:59.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
