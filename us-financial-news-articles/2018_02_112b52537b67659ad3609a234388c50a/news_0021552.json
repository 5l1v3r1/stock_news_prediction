That said, the size and market dominance of some of the tech firms raise many of the usual concerns about the potential effects of monopoly power on prices and competition,” Wilkins said.\nCountries must also look at how to develop skilled workforces through training and bringing more people into the labor market, she said.\nRegulators will need to be proactive in understanding new technologies and incentives for businesses in order to make good policy decisions, Wilkins said.\n“We will need to judge wisely when it is best to use public policy tools to manage risks and when to let private enterprise work its magic,” she said.\nWilkins said the Bank of Canada is currently looking at what impact digitalization and automation might be having on the labor market and the transmission of monetary policy.\nThe central bank is also evaluating the best way to measure inflation, given the effects digitalization are having on consumer habits.\nWilkins did not touch on where Canadian interest rates may be headed in her speech. The Bank of Canada has raised rates three times since last July amid strong jobs and economic growth. Markets largely expect the bank to hold steady at its next meeting in March but another hike is nearly fully priced in by May.
