The superseding indictment says that Manafort wired more than 2 million euros to the unnamed former European politicians. Manafort created the “Hapsburg group” for the former politicians to appear to provide independent assessment of Ukrainian government actions. The group was managed by a former European chancellor, which the indictment identifies as “Foreign Politician A,” in coordination with Manafort.
