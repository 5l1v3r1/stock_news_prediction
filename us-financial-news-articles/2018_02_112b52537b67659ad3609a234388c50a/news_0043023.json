It had initially said investors would be offered up to a total 23.4 million shares.\nUp to 54 percent of Instone shares will be freely traded following the flotation, which raises around 428 million euros and gives the company a market capitalisation of about 795 million euros.\nOther flotations expected in the coming months include Siemens’s Healthineers business, which sources have said is likely to come in March in what may be Germany’s biggest IPO this year. Brake systems maker Knorr-Bremse and Deutsche Bank’s asset management arm DWS are seen as hot on its heels.\nDeutsche Bank and Credit Suisse organised the flotation of Instone with the help of Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas and Unicredit.
