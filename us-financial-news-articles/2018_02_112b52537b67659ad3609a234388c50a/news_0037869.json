Bernstein Some Democrats said the indictments should end President Donald Trump’s insistence that Russian meddling was “fake news.” “This is a VERY well done hoax,” Senator Brian Schatz said on Twitter in a jab at President Donald Trump.\nOther lawmakers called for the immediate imposition of sanctions on Russia that Congress passed overwhelmingly last year that Trump has yet to enact.\nFILE PHOTO: Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) speaks during a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 13, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein In addition to Mueller’s probe, three congressional committees are investigating Russia and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow.\nRussia denies meddling, and Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion, most recently on Friday.\nSome Republicans want Mueller to resign, although others have joined Democrats in calling for legislation to prevent Trump from firing him.\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee wrote a memo accusing federal investigators of bias against Trump in obtaining a surveillance warrant. Democrats were furious after Trump declassified the Republican document but refused to make public their own memo seeking to debunk it.\nOn Friday, Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of House Intelligence, who commissioned the Republican memo, said it was “gratifying” to see the indictments, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government “a pressing threat to American interests.”\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the panel’s top Democrat, called the indictments “a significant step forward.” He also said the indictment “leaves open the vital question of whether Americans, including any associated with the Trump campaign, knowingly played a role in Russia’s active measures campaign.”\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:15:40.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
