The combined event brings together a downhill stage and then slalom section, testing the all-round skills of skiers. After the opening 30 runners, Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal was second fastest, 0.07 seconds behind Dressen, with Austrian Matthias Mayer third and another Norwegian, Kjetil Jansrud, in fourth place, 0.27 seconds off the lead. Svindal has strong all-round skills but admits to being a little rusty in the slalom. “The conditions are faster now and it’s a bit bumpy, I think the wind polished it off a bit,” he told reporters. “I’ve been practising super-G (because of the cancellations) but maybe I should have been practising slalom because It’s been over two years since I last did it.” Following two days of weather postponements, the Alpine action finally got under way at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre but the strong winds remained a factor.

REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler Organisers opted to go ahead with an adjusted downhill stage, racing lower down the course at the designated super-G start and using the ‘blue wind line’ which made for easier jumps. Dressen was first out and completed the course in one minute, 19.24 seconds and Hirscher, second down, was 1.32 seconds slower.

REUTERS/Dominic Ebenbichler Hirscher, whose all-round skills have delivered six successive overall World Cup titles with a seventh currently within his grasp, will be delighted to go into his favoured slalom stage within touching distance of the lead. The winds soon got up and caused problems on the relatively benign jumps, however. Russian Pavel Trikhichev and American Ryan Cochran-Siegle both crashed out after clipping gates and France’s Victor Muffat-Jeandet struggled in the conditions to leave himself 2.33 seconds behind Dressen. “My run was not so good, I don’t know why. Maybe I went too hard, I made some mistakes on the line. Maybe the conditions weren’t so good but now I have to focus on the slalom. In the combined you never know,” Muffat-Jeandet told reporters. Italian Peter Fill somehow managed to land safely when the wind caught him midway through a jump and forced him into an awkward position. The slalom stage is scheduled to start at 3 p.m. (0600 GMT) Reporting by Simon Evans and Nick Mulvenney; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T06:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T08:11:47.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
