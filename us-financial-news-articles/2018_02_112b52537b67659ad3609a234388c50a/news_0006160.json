The murder of a police officer is a death-penalty-eligible crime in Colorado.\nDearing did not enter a plea at Wednesdayâ€™s hearing, and his court-appointed attorneys declined to comment on the case.\nGumm, 31, was gunned down last Wednesday after he and other deputies responded to reports of an assault in progress near the city of Thornton, about 10 miles north of Denver.\nDearing fled from officers and was later cornered by police when he allegedly opened fire on them with a handgun, striking Gumm in the chest, investigators said.\nGumm was wearing a bullet-proof vest, Adams County Sheriff Mike McIntosh said last week.\nAdams County District Judge Patrick Murphy ordered Dearing held without bond until at least a preliminary hearing scheduled for April. The judge also set a hearing for next month to hear several motions filed by defense lawyers.\nSome 128 law enforcement officers died on the job in the United States in 2017, according to the nonprofit National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\nReporting by Keith Coffman in Denver; Editing by Sharon Bernstein and James Dalgleish\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:37:17.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
