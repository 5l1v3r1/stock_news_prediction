The investigation sought to determine whether the imports posed a threat to national security.\nOn Feb. 16, Ross reported that steel is in fact important to U.S. national security, and current import flows are adversely impacting the steel industry.\n\"[T]he Secretary of Commerce concludes that the present quantities and circumstance of steel imports are 'weakening our internal economy' and threaten to impair the national security as defined in Section 232,\" the department said.\n— CNBC's Kayla Tausche and Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T03:35:31.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
