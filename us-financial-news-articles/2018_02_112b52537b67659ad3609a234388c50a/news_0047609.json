The 24-year-old, who has played in all 27 of Swansea’s league games so far, sustained a knee injury in the warm-up before last weekend’s FA Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday. It was initially thought he would be out of action long term, but the club said he had been cleared to resume training. “After seeing a specialist and undergoing an MRI scan, the influential defender is set to rejoin his team-mates on the training ground ahead of the Brighton clash,” Swansea said on their website. (www.swanseacity.com) Swansea are unbeaten in their last five league matches, winning three and drawing two, to climb one point clear of the relegation zone in 16th position.
