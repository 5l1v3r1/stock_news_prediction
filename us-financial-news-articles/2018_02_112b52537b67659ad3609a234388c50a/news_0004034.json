At Woolwich Crown Court, Osborne was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, with police and prosecutors saying it was an act of terrorism. \nIt was the fourth incident blamed on terrorists in Britain in the space of three months and it followed three Islamist attacks. \nOsborne, who had not previously expressed far-right views, developed an obsession with Muslims after watching the BBC programme “Three Girls”, a drama broadcast last May about events in Rochdale, northern England, where white girls were abused by gangs of mainly British Pakistani men. \nThis hatred was subsequently fuelled by online research into extreme right-wing figures and groups, police said. \nOsborne will be sentenced on Friday.
