Despite official results that show Kenyatta received 1.4 million more votes, Odinga claims he won elections in August, which the Supreme Court nullified on procedural grounds.\nRepeat elections were held in October, but Odinga boycotted them, claiming they would be unfair.\nAdditional reporting by George Obulutsa and Humphrey Malalo; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T07:58:01.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
