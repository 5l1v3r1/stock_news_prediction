U.S. crude settled up 34 cents at $61.68 a barrel.\n* But the market’s gains were tempered by a drop in gold producers as gold futures fell 0.3 percent to $1,347.70. Agnico Eagle Mines was among the biggest drags on the index, down 3.9 percent at C$54.12, while First Quantum Minerals declined 2.7 percent to C$20.81.\n* Shares of cannabis companies also came under pressure the day after Canadian government officials said the planned July start date for legalized recreational marijuana was set to be delayed further.\n* Canopy Growth dropped 5.3 percent to C$26.50, while Aphria Inc slumped 5.5 percent to C$14.06. Aurora Cannabis was among the most actively traded companies, down 6.6 percent at $10.13.\n* Separately, the province of Alberta said recreational marijuana will be sold in licensed private retail stores to be overseen by a government regulator. The federal government has left the details of how to sell cannabis up to the provinces.\n* Among the day’s corporate earnings, Air Canada rose 1.3 percent to C$24.64 after it reported better-than-expected profit and said it expects a joint venture with Air China to be wrapped up this spring.\n* The TSX posted 7 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 19 new 52-week highs and 21 new lows. Volume on the TSX index was 215.29 million shares.
