Machenaud converted. \nThe scrumhalf added a penalty in the 10th minute to increase the lead as the visitors proved more aggressive. \nThomas also defended well as he ran across the field to kick the ball out after Stuart Hogg had threatened with a clever through ball. \nHowever, the Scotland backs showed their talent with Maitland at the completing end of a well-worked try on the left side. Laidlaw converted to reduce the arrears to three points. \nBut Thomas chipped the ball into space on his right wing and collected it after Laidlaw was deceived by the vicious rebound before touching down between the posts, setting up Machenaud for a routine conversion. \nScotland responded when Jones burst through the defence after the hosts had unsettled France with some high-tempo moves. \nAlthough Scotland dominated, Machenaud opened a six-point advantage with a last-second penalty at halftime. \nReplacement Serin traded a couple of penalties with Laidlaw early in the second half. \nLaidlaw added another at the hour as Scotland breathed down France’s neck. \nThe visitors lacked discipline under high pressure and Laidlaw slotted two other penalties to put Scotland ahead for the first time of the game. \nHe added his sixth penalty with three minutes left, forcing France to go for a converted try in order to avoid a seventh defeat in eight games. \nThat try never came as Scotland had the upper hand in a ruck in their 22 metres. \nThey next host England on Feb. 24 as France will take on Italy the previous day in a game that might give the losers the dreaded wooden spoon.
