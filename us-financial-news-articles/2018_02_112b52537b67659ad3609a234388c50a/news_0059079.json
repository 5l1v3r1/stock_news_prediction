He has also, until now, had access to the president’s daily brief, a top-secret intelligence report.\n“He’s a valued member of the team and he will continue to do the important work that he’s been doing since he started in the administration,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on Tuesday.\nThe change comes at a time of mounting tensions between Mr. Kelly and the president’s family in the White House. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have chafed under the staff chief’s initial reorganization of the West Wing that restricted their access to the president. Mr. Kelly’s changes to the security clearance process put him on a direct collision course with Mr. Kushner.\nMr. Kushner was among several officials who had their interim clearances downgraded from Top Secret/SCI-level to Secret, the official said. The officials received the memos informing them of the change on Friday, the official said. The memos were reported by Politico.\nMr. Kushner is also set to lose his spokesman, Josh Raffel, who a White House official said will leave the West Wing in the next two months. The official said Mr. Raffel had told Mr. Kushner in recent months that he planned to address family obligations and return to the private sector.\nMore\nTrump Aide Hicks Declines to Answer Some House Panel Questions Justice Department’s Internal Watchdog to Probe FBI Surveillance of Ex-Trump Adviser Kushner Spokesman Raffel Set to Leave White House Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter Mr. Kelly announced changes to the White House security clearance policy after the president privately expressed frustration with his staff chief over the handling of a former senior official who remained on staff with interim security clearance for more than a year despite accusations of physical abuse from two former wives. The official, former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, resigned this month after the allegations, which he has denied, became public.\nMr. Kelly’s policy curtailed the amount of time White House officials can hold an interim clearance and discontinued interim clearances for some officials whose background checks have been pending since June 2017 or before. More than a dozen top officials, including Mr. Kushner, have held interim clearances for more than a year, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.\nA spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s legal team said in a statement: “It is not uncommon for these clearance reviews to take this long in a new administration, and that the current backlogs are now being addressed. No concerns were raised about Mr. Kushner’s application.” The spokesman said Mr. Kelly’s new clearance policy wouldn’t affect Mr. Kushner’s ability to “do the very important work he has been assigned by the president.”\nMr. Trump on Friday said that Mr. Kushner’s clearance would be a decision for his staff chief .\nMr. Kelly declined to comment on specific officials’ security clearance but said in a statement: “As I told Jared days ago, I have full confidence in his ability to continue performing his duties in his foreign policy portfolio including overseeing our Israeli-Palestinian peace effort and serving as an integral part of our relationship with Mexico.”\nRelated Video When it comes to the Russia investigation, the word \"Collusion\" gets thrown around a lot. But there's not a lot of clarity on what it actually means. Is it illegal? Is it grounds for impeachment? We asked a law professor to explain. Photo Illustration: Drew Evans/The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Kushner’s White House role has come under increased scrutiny in recent months as special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election focuses on a number of episodes during the campaign that involved Mr. Kushner. Mr. Trump has denied collusion by his campaign, and Moscow has denied meddling.\nNewsletter Sign-up Both Mr. Kushner and his spokesman, Mr. Raffel, interviewed with the special counsel late last year. Mr. Kushner’s personal lawyer, Abbe Lowell, earlier this month hired Peter Mirijanian, a veteran of prior White House investigations, to handle press relations for the law firm’s clients. Mr. Mirijanian wasn’t hired to work specifically on Mr. Kushner’s case, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMr. Raffel was first hired last spring to serve as a spokesman for the Office of American Innovation, a White House office headed by Mr. Kushner that was assigned the task of replicating private-sector efficiency inside the federal government.\nHis role grew as he served as a spokesman for Mr. Kushner as well as Ms. Trump, one of the president’s daughters and a White House adviser. In the fall, he was promoted to deputy communications director.\nIn a statement provided by the White House, Ms. Trump called Mr. Raffel “honest, passionate and thoughtful.” Mr. Cohn called him a “trusted partner,” and White House Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt called him an “integral part of our peace team.”\nWrite to Michael C.
