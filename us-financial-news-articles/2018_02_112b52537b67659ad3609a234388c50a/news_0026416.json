The fact we were behind for most of the game shows the heart of the squad,” said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \n“We were more direct and we got our rewards. We were up against a very good defence and it takes a huge effort (to break it).” \nFrance took a dream start as Thomas slalomed through the Scottish defence and touched down after a dazzling 45-metre run. Machenaud converted. \nThe scrumhalf added a penalty in the 10th minute to increase the lead as the visitors proved more aggressive.

Laidlaw converted to reduce the arrears to three points. \nBut Thomas chipped the ball into space on his right wing and collected it after Laidlaw was deceived by the vicious rebound before touching down between the posts, setting up Machenaud for a routine conversion. \nScotland responded when Jones burst through the defence after the hosts had unsettled France with some high-tempo moves.

Related Coverage No discipline, no victory, says France captain Guirado \nThe visitors lacked discipline under high pressure and Laidlaw slotted two other penalties to put Scotland ahead for the first time of the game. \nHe added his sixth penalty with three minutes left, forcing France to go for a converted try in order to avoid a seventh defeat in eight games. \nThat try never came as Scotland had the upper hand in a ruck in their 22 metres. \nThey next host England on Feb. 24 as France will take on Italy the previous day in a game that might give the losers the dreaded wooden spoon.
