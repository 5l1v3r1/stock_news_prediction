Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Commission have urged Germany to invest more and boost economic activity.\nAccording to Fuchs, the new coalition government is unlikely to change its fiscal policy. However, a new finance minister represents a change in tone towards the euro zone.\nAdam berry | Getty Images News | Getty Images Scholz told Der Spiegel over the weekend that Germany \"doesn't need to dictate to other European states how they run themselves.\" Berlin's previous finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, often criticized countries in the euro area, including Greece and other bailout countries, for not following a sound fiscal policy.\nNonetheless, the next four years are not going to be easy for Chancellor Merkel, Fuchs said, amid the rising support for populist parties and the need to find a potential replacement for Merkel, who is set to start her fourth mandate in the chancellery.\n\"We have to face the reality and the reality is that now we have another grand coalition,\" Fuchs said, pointing out that both the CDU and the SPD have lost support in recent years and have become \"much smaller.\"\n\"Merkel is 62 years old now, plus four, makes it up to 66 years and I guess then at the end of this term, we will see a new leader in the CDU,\" Fuchs said, noting that it's \"very difficult\" to see at this point who could replace Merkel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:13:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
