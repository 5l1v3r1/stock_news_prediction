The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, lost 1.1 percent. \nOf the index’s 10 main groups seven were in negative territory. \nIn the financial sector, Toronto Dominion Bank fell by 0.9 percent and Royal Bank of Canada was down 0.8 percent. \nCanada’s trade deficit unexpectedly ballooned to C$3.19 billion ($2.55 billion) in December as imports grew faster than exports for the second month in a row, data from Statistics Canada indicated on Tuesday.
