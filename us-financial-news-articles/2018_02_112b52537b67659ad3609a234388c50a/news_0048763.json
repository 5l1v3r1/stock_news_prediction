It said it had uncovered “additional criminal conduct” by Manafort in connection with a series of “bank frauds and bank fraud conspiracies” related to a mortgage on his property in Alexandria, Virginia.\nThe special counsel’s office said his proposal to post his Alexandria home to secure his bond was also flawed, because that home and another in Bridgehampton New York are both securing a $9 million loan and could be confiscated in the event of a foreclosure.\nThe judge’s order on Thursday did not mention the fraud allegations, but she agreed Manafort would need to post additional security because the Alexandria home “has already been pledged in its entirety as collateral” for the mortgage.\nHer order gives him another chance to come back with a fresh bail proposal, and permits him to include as collateral a condominium he owns in Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York City, if he shows proof his mortgage payments are current.\nReporting by Sarah N.
