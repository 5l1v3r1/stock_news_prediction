The result, due to be announced on March 4, is wide open.\nReporting by Andreas Rinke; Writing by Paul Carrel; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:07:44.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
