The investment will add four production lines and create 320 jobs, the company said in a statement. Denso said the plant will have one new production line devoted to gasoline direct injectors and the other three for fuel pumps. In October Denso, Toyota Motor Corpâ€™s largest supplier, said it would invest $1 billion in its Maryville, Tennessee, plant to develop vehicle electrification and safety systems, creating around 1,000 jobs. Last month, Toyota and Mazda Motor Corp announced a $1.6 billion joint venture assembly plant in Alabama that will employ up to 4,000 workers and produce 300,000 vehicles a year.
