The bank’s lending rates are international-standard and less than any bilateral loan, Ostfield said. Projects must be commercially viable to qualify for loans. “We always give priority only to quality projects, and there is no bureaucracy in approving and sanctioning loans, meaning our loan-backed projects can be implemented quickly,” she said. AIIB is dedicated to develop infrastructure, especially energy, roads and communications, transport and few other projects in the region, Ostfield said. China is the largest financier, followed by India and then Russia, she said.
