That feeling of being able to cross the line and having Kikkan tackle me was the coolest thing ever,” she added.\nFor Randall it was a well-deserved payoff for years of traveling alone on the World Cup circuit, struggling to gain a foothold for the U.S. in the face of European dominance.\nCross-Country Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Team Sprint Free Finals - Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 21, 2018 - Jessica Diggins and Kikkan Randall of the U.S. celebrate. REUTERS/Carlos Barria “It’ a dream come true ... I got to see in 2013 when we won the world championships that a team gold is worth far more than any individual accolade,” Randall said.\n“What really kept me going over the last four years was to try and contribute to a team medal here, and to do it here with Jessie one more time, it’s amazing.”\nThe 35-year-old was given a place in the relay team ahead of younger prospects, and she used all her experience to keep cool under pressure.\nHowever, she admitted to an attack of nerves as her 26-year-old partner headed for the final straight.\n“It was a nail-biter all the way up to that finish line. When Jessie won I looked over at the scoreboard and saw United States number one, and just let out a big scream and just ran over and tackled Jessie,” Randall said.\nRandall may have been the underdog for many years, but the confidence of Diggins at these Games has ushered in a new era for the sport in America.\n“It’s a dream come true for her and a dream come true for the U.S. cross-country skiing team,” Diggins’s mother Deb told Reuters.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T20:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T18:03:57.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
