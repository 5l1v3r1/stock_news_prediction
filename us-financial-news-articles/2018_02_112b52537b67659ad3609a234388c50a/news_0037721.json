Globally, approximately 30% of patients with NSCLC present with Stage III disease and we are excited to launch the first immunotherapy into this setting.\"\nScott J. Antonia, M.D., Ph.D., Chair of the Thoracic Oncology Department at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Florida and investigator in the PACIFIC trial, said: \"Until now, treatment guidelines have recommended that patients with unresectable Stage III lung cancer undergo a period of active surveillance following chemoradiation therapy until disease progression. Given that up to 89% of patients will progress to metastatic disease, it is important that there is now a new option that can give patients more time without disease progression. The PACIFIC trial data supporting today's approval of IMFINZI will change how we treat these patients.\"\nThe approval of IMFINZI is based on the positive PFS data from the Phase III PACIFIC trial in which IMFINZI demonstrated an improvement in median PFS of 11.2 months compared to placebo, representing a 48% reduction in relative risk of progression or death vs placebo in all patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. The PACIFIC trial is ongoing to evaluate overall survival (OS) in unresectable Stage III NSCLC. Detailed interim results of the PACIFIC trial were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine .\nPFS (co-primary endpoint) 1,6\nIMFINZI\n(N=476) 2\nPlacebo\n(N=237) 2\nNumber (%) of patients with event\n214 (45%)\n157 (66%)\nMedian in months\n(95% CI)\n16.8\n(13, 18.1)\n5.6\n(4.6, 7.8)\nHazard Ratio\n(95% CI) 3,4\n0.52 (0.42, 0.65)\np-value 3,5\n<0.0001\n1 Blinded Independent Central Review\n2 Among the ITT population, 7% in the IMFINZI arm and 10% in the placebo arm had non-measurable disease as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1\n3 Stratified by sex, age, and smoking history\n4 Pike estimator\n5 Compared with allocated α of 0.0104 (Lan DeMets spending function approximating O'Brien Fleming boundary) for interim analysis\n6 Time from randomization to the first documented tumor progression, or death in the absence of progression. Randomization in the PACIFIC trial occurred up to 6 weeks after completion of at least two cycles of concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT).\nIMFINZI can cause serious, potentially fatal adverse reactions. In patients on IMFINZI, the most common adverse reactions (greater than or equal to 20% of patients) were cough (40%), fatigue (34%), pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (34%), upper respiratory tract infections (26%), dyspnea (25%), and rash (23%). Discontinuation after concurrent CRT due to adverse events, regardless of causality, occurred in 15% of patients receiving IMFINZI vs 10% of patients receiving placebo.\nThe recommended dose of IMFINZI is 10 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes every two weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 12 months.\nOn September 28, 2017, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology were updated to include IMFINZI for the treatment of patients with unresectable Stage III NSCLC with no disease progression after two or more cycles of concurrent CRT.\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\nThere are no contraindications for IMFINZI ® (durvalumab).\nIMFINZI can cause serious, potentially fatal adverse reactions including immune-mediated pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis or diarrhea, endocrinopathies, nephritis, rash or dermatitis, other immune-mediated adverse reactions, infection, and infusion-related reactions.

Serious adverse reactions occurred in 29% of patients receiving IMFINZI. The most frequent serious adverse reactions (≥2% of patients) were pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis (7%) and pneumonia (6%). Fatal pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis and fatal pneumonia occurred in <2% of patients and were similar across arms.\nThe safety and effectiveness of IMFINZI have not been established in pediatric patients.\nINDICATIONS\nIMFINZI is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who:\nhave disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.\nThis indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nIMFINZI is indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nPlease see complete Prescribing Information , including Medication Guide.\nNOTES TO EDITORS\nAbout Stage III NSCLC\nStage III (locally advanced) lung cancer is commonly divided into three sub-categories (IIIA, IIIB and IIIC), which are defined by how much the cancer has spread locally and the possibility of surgery. This differentiates it from Stage IV disease, when the cancer has spread (metastasized) to distant organs.\nApproximately one in four patients with non-small cell lung cancer present with Stage III disease, which is estimated to affect over 43,000 patients annually in the United States. The majority of these patients are determined to have unresectable tumors. Until now, the standard of care has been chemotherapy and radiation followed by active surveillance to monitor for progression. The prognosis remains poor and long-term survival rates are low.\nAbout IMFINZI ® (durvalumab)\nIMFINZI ® (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80, countering the tumor's immune-evading tactics and releasing the inhibition of immune responses.\nIn May 2017, AstraZeneca received accelerated approval from the FDA for IMFINZI for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy, or whose disease has progressed within 12 months of receiving platinum-containing chemotherapy before (neoadjuvant) or after (adjuvant) surgery. IMFINZI is approved under the FDA's accelerated approval pathway, based on tumor response rate and duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Additional discussions are underway with regulatory authorities around the world.\nAs part of a broad development program, IMFINZI is also being investigated for the adjuvant treatment of patients with NSCLC in the Canadian Cancer Trials Group BR31 trial (ADJUVANT). In the MYSTIC, NEPTUNE, and PEARL Phase III trials, IMFINZI is being studied for 1st-line treatment as monotherapy and/or in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody and potential new medicine, for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. The POSEIDON trial is investigating IMFINZI with and without tremelimumab in combination with chemotherapy in a similar patient population.\nAbout AstraZeneca Support Programs\nAstraZeneca strives to ensure that appropriate patients and their oncologists have access to IMFINZI and relevant support resources. These include educational resources, an Oncology Nurse Educator program and affordability and reimbursement programs, such as Access 360 .\nAdditionally, AstraZeneca has launched Lighthouse , a program that provides support to patients during any immune-mediated adverse events they may encounter during treatment, through medically trained Lighthouse Advocates.
