The company raised full-year EPS guidance to $0.96-$1.06 from $0.91-$1.01.\nAnsell sold its oldest division, its condoms business, for $600 million last May to China’s Humanwell Healthcare Group Co Ltd and CITIC Capital China Partners, and had estimated a $365 million after-tax gain on the sale.\nProceeds from the sale of $359.9 million after tax, slightly lower than the estimate, lifted net profit for the six months to Dec. 31 to $428.2 million from $69.8 million a year earlier.\nThe former condom maker declared an interim dividend of 20.50 cents per share, up from 20.25 cents a year prior. The company reports in U.S. dollars.
