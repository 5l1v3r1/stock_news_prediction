That contradicted a map previously produced by police and entered in the court file, which showed stores and tea shops, but no factories.\nMyo Ko Ko told the court he was part of the arresting team, but did not see the documents police have said the two reporters were holding in their hands.\nAt a previous hearing, police Major Min Thant had agreed during cross-examination that the information in the documents that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were holding had already been published in newspaper reports.\nEarlier in Wednesday’s proceedings the prosecution had opposed a defense request that the police station logbook in which the arrests had been recorded should be shown to the court as evidence, arguing that it was still in daily use and could not leave the police station.\nDetained Reuters journalist Wa Lone talks to reporters as he leaves after a court hearing in Yangon, Myanmar February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer Judge Ye Lwin refused the defense’s request, saying the defense did not have the right to see the record at this stage of the proceedings.\nMASS GRAVE REPORT The two reporters had been working on a Reuters investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men who were buried in a mass grave in northern Rakhine state after being hacked to death or shot by ethnic Rakhine Buddhist neighbors and soldiers.\nSlideshow (2 Images) After Reuters published its report on the killings on Feb. 8, calls have mounted for the release of the two reporters.\nThe United States said at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that Myanmar had “the gall to blame the media” for the situation in Rakhine and demanded that the reporters be freed.\n“For the crime of reporting the truth, the Burmese (Myanmar) government arrested and imprisoned the reporters,” said Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. “Unhindered media access is vitally important. Journalists like the two imprisoned Reuters reporters are an indispensable source of information.”\nBritain, France, the Netherlands and Kazakhstan also called at the meeting for the release of the reporters.\nMyanmar U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan said Myanmar recognizes freedom of the press and the journalists were not arrested for reporting a story, but were accused of “illegally possessing confidential government documents”.\nNearly 690,000 Rohingya have fled Rakhine and taken refuge in neighboring Bangladesh since the Myanmar military launched a crackdown on insurgents at the end of August, according to the United Nations.\nThe United Nations has said the military campaign against the Rohingya may amount to genocide. Myanmar says its security forces mounted legitimate counter-insurgency clearance operations.\nThe next hearing at the Insein District Court in Yangon was set for Feb. 21.\nReporting by Myanmar bureau; Writing by Raju Gopalakrishnan; Editing by Alex Richardson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T18:16:24.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
