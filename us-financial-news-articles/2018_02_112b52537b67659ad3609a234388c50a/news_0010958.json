The gain was the smallest since the company began tracking spending in 1993. Consumer out-of-pocket costs held steady last year. CNBC Tim Wentworth, CEO of Express Scripts. \nPrescription drug prices may still be high, but Express Scripts says the commercial insurance plans it works with saw the lowest increase in drug spending last year, in nearly a quarter of a century. \nFor private employer and individual health plans, total drug spending rose 1.5 percent last year, according to the latest Express Scripts annual Drug Trend report. That was the smallest increase since the pharmacy benefits firm first began tracking spending in 1993. Nearly half of all private insurance plans spent less per person year over year, including plans on the Obamacare exchange market, which saw drug spending fall more 3 percent. Overall drug spending for Medicare rose 2.3 percent, while the Medicaid safety net program saw a 3.7 percent spending increase last year. Among the biggest drivers of the lower trend, a near 31 percent drop in the unit cost of cholesterol drugs, and a 13 percent decrease in pain and inflammation drug costs due to more patients being steered to new lower-cost generics. In aggregate, costs for traditional non-biologic drugs fell 4.9 percent. Spending on specialty drugs rose 11.3 percent, which according to Express Scripts is the lowest increase it has seen. A 40 percent decrease in the utilization of costly Hepatitis C drugs, was among one of the factors.Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefit management firms have been under pressure for their role in negotiating drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and shaping drug benefit plan co-pays for health insurance companies. Critics have charged that the middlemen have contributed to the high prices consumers pay out of pocket for prescriptions. \nWhile health plans saw lower spending on drugs, plan members did not necessarily share in those savings. Consumer out-of-pocket costs held steady in 2017. The average plan member on a high-deductible plan spent $268 out of pocket last year, while those in standard commercial plans paid $200.
