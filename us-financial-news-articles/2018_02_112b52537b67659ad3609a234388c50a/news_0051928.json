REUTERS/Caren Firouz In the latest U.S.-led push to spur Pakistani action, a global money-laundering watchdog decided to put the country back on its terrorist financing watch list, a Pakistani government official and a diplomat told Reuters in Islamabad.\nThe U.S. official dismissed suggestions pressure from Washington may backfire and suggested that Pakistan might start by taking smaller, tactical steps, including forcing such groups into Afghanistan before the spring fighting season begins.\n“I don’t think Pakistan is feeling its oats. I think it’s feeling pressure,” said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We have their attention.”\nThe official said the United States did not have a specific timeline to assess Pakistani cooperation and would be looking to see if Islamabad would take ”tactical steps“ such as ”actions against ... (the) Haqqanis, pushing them across the border.\n“They don’t have to arrest them or kill them ... just get them into Afghanistan, disrupt some of the infrastructure that exists, make it harder for them,” the official added. “We are about two months away from the fighting season, so now is the time to do some of this.”\nSome in the U.S. government doubt Pakistan will comply.\nIn a Feb. 13 statement to Congress, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats said Pakistan would maintain “its ties with militant groups, restricting counter-terrorism cooperation” with the United States.\nWriting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T23:36:58.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
