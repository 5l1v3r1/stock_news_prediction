In the long run, the company would like to expand that business, and is not looking to sell it, Pourbaix said.\nCanadian heavy oil producers have been stung in recent months by a larger than usual price discount for their crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil, due to expanding Alberta production and tight transportation capacity.\nPourbaix said the problem should ease in the short term, when TransCanada Corp’s ( TRP.TO ) Keystone pipeline returns to full pressure following a leak last year, and as crude sent by rail increases.\nCenovus is in “active negotiations” with Canadian National Railway Co ( CNR.TO ) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd ( CP.TO ) about moving more crude, said Cenovus senior vice-president of downstream, Keith Chiasson.\nCenovus shares fell over 6 percent in Toronto on Thursday. Some investors may have been disappointed that the company has not already secured additional railway capacity, said Michael Dunn, analyst at GMP FirstEnergy.\nEarlier on Thursday, Cenovus reported that fourth-quarter profit soared, as production nearly doubled after the Conoco Phillips assets acquisition and the company reined in expenses.\nCenovus said it reduced general and administrative costs by 44 percent per barrel of oil equivalent and oil sands operating costs by 6 percent per barrel in 2017 from 2016.\nThe company’s net income jumped to C$620 million ($497 million), or 50 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter, from C$91 million, or 11 Canadian cents per share, in the year-ago period.\nAdditional reporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T19:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:38:37.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
