Determining net savings, as a result, is difficult and the passage of any legislation will not result in a quick windfall.\nEthernet cables are seen at the Brazilian mobile operator Vivo office that is no longer in operation, in Sao Paulo, Brazil December 21, 2017. Picture taken December 21, 2017. REUTERS/Leonardo Benassatto If a bill is approved, it will free up significant cash to expand modern, profitable segments, according to company sources.\nOi, for instance, maintains 650,000 pay phones, many of which are unused in an era where mobile phones are ubiquitous. It hopes to reduce that number to between 130,000 and 150,000, according to a source with knowledge of the company’s strategy who was not permitted to speak publicly.\nAs the pay phone unit generates annual revenues of about 17 million reais ($5.27 million) and losses of 300 million reais, money re-directed to other purposes should far exceed 200 million reais.\nThe company also has a list of about 85 unneeded buildings it would quickly liquidate, and another 600 it would sell in the medium term, the source said, though those figures may be modified due to Oi’s recent in-court restructuring, which was approved in January.\nSlideshow (2 Images) While the source said it was difficult to put a price on many real estate assets, some are quite valuable. Among them is Oi’s 15,000-square-meter headquarters in Rio de Janeiro’s Leblon neighbourhood, one of Latin America’s most exclusive places to live and work.\nAs prices there average over 20,000 reais per square metre, the building would almost certainly fetch close to $100 million.\nOi declined to comment on possible asset sales.\nThe potential impact on Vivo is also significant though smaller, as the company’s regulatory obligations are limited to Sao Paulo, Brazil’s most populous state.\nVivo has fewer real estate assets to divest - dozens rather than hundreds - but many are valuable or costly to maintain.\nAmong them is a 10-story building in Sao Paulo’s historic but faded downtown, which once housed 2,000 employees but is now abandoned.\nThe company would get rid of most pay phones not in institutional locations such as hospitals and airports, Camilla Tapias, the company’s executive director of regulatory affairs, said in an interview.\nNo calls whatsoever were placed from over 62,000 Vivo pay phones in 2017, she said, while close to a quarter of its 179,000 pay phones suffer some sort of vandalism each month.\n“People don’t use them, but if we don’t fix them, we get fined,” Tapias said. “It’s money thrown away ... that would be better used elsewhere.”\n($1 = 3.23 reais)\nReporting by Gram Slattery and Leonardo Goy; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Christian Plumb and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:18:46.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
