It will raise the chances of the Fed median dots shifting up to 4 rate hikes for 2018,” he added.\nThat would be negative for emerging markets and commodity currencies, said Ruskin. Both the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell sharply in the wake of the job numbers, along with a range of Asian currencies.\nIt was also a major blow to government bonds. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury paper were up at a four-year peak of 2.86 percent, having jumped almost 7 basis points on Friday.\nThe 2-year yield was near a nine-year top at 2.162 percent, tightening financial conditions and offering a more competitive return compared to equities. The dividend return of the Dow, for instance, was 2.13 percent.\nPRICED FOR PERFECTION Wall Street had already been flashing expensive by many historical measures and sold off in reaction. The Dow fell 2.54 percent, the S&P 500 2.12 percent and the Nasdaq 1.96 percent.\nIt was the Dow’s biggest daily percentage loss in 20 months and the largest point fall since December 2008. The three major indexes capped their worst weekly losses in two years, after closing at record highs the previous week.\n“It has to be remembered that U.S. shares were priced for perfection at around 19 times earnings,” said Craig James, chief economist at fund manager CommSec, noting the historic average is around 15 times.\n“Still, U.S. companies have produced stellar earnings over the reporting period. So it is understandable that some ‘irrational exuberance’ would emerge.”\nWith half of the S&P 500 companies having reported, 78 percent have beaten expectations against an average 64 percent.\nThe lift in U.S. yields provided some initial support to the dollar after a rocky start to the year, though it was starting to lose altitude again in Asian trade.\nAgainst a basket of currencies, the dollar was down a fraction at 89.154 having climbed 0.6 percent on Friday for its biggest single day gain in three months.\nThe dollar backed off to 109.90 yen from an early 110.29, while the euro nudged up to $1.2453 from $1.2425.\nAny rally in the U.S. dollar is considered a negative for commodities priced in the currency, with the Thomson Reuters CRB index down 0.5 percent. Gold was off a touch at $1,330.50 an ounce after losing 1 percent on Friday.\nIn oil markets, U.S. crude fell 53 cents to $64.92 a barrel, while Brent lost 57 cents to $68.01.\nReporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Shri Navaratnam and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T09:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:46:01.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
