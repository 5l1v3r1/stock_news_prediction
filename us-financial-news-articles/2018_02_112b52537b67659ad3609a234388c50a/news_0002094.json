Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway , designed to bring down health costs for their employees, their families, and — according to J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon , potentially all Americans.\n\nAnd the comments came the week President Donald Trump named tackling the \"injustice of high drug prices\" a top priority for his administration in 2018, as part of his State of the Union address.\nThe drug industry is under siege. So does its latest defense hold water?\nYes — with caveats.\nThe Congressional Budget Office published a study in 2012 on the issue: It estimates that for every 1 percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled by Medicare beneficiaries, the government insurer's spending on medical services would decline by about 0.2 percent, and vice versa.\nIn many ways, this makes sense. As the CBO report points out, \"most often, pharmaceuticals have the effect of improving or maintaining an individual's health\" — for example, taking antibiotics to prevent a more severe infection or adhering to medication to manage a chronic condition like diabetes or high blood pressure.\n\"In either of those circumstances, taking the medication may also avert hospital admissions and thus reduce the use of medical services,\" the report said.\nThe CBO came to its estimate by reviewing recent studies on the relationship between use of prescription medicines and spending on medical services. Universally, the studies cited found that reductions in use of prescription drugs resulted in increased spending on medical services, and likewise, that more generous coverage of prescription drugs led to fewer hospitalizations and fewer medical services used.\nSo, yes, attempting to control health costs by reducing the use of prescription drugs would result in higher spending on medical services (and, importantly, could be harmful to people who need those drugs to manage their disease).\nBut as a defense for the ever-increasing prices of brand-name drugs? Critics say the support doesn't go that far.\n\"In general, there is research when you're talking about adherence to necessary meds,\" said Walid Gellad, director of the University of Pittsburgh Center for Pharmaceutical Policy & Prescribing. \"However, increased use of expensive drugs when generics are available, or the meds are not needed in the first place, does not lower overall health costs.\"\n\"As usual, there is truth to what is said,\" Gellad concluded. \"But not the whole truth.\"\nshow chapters Eli Lilly CEO: It's a great time for science in pharma sector      11:38 AM ET Mon, 8 Jan 2018 | 05:30", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:30:37.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
