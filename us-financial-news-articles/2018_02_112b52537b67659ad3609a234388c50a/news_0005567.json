Brazil’s round at Sao Paulo’s Interlagos circuit now starts at 1510 instead of 1400.\nAll practice sessions and qualifying at those European rounds will also start an hour later.\n“Other minor adjustments have been made in order to avoid clashes with other major sports events like the FIFA World Cup, to allow for differing sunset times, and to attract a wider attendance to promoters’ events,” Formula One added.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:41:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
