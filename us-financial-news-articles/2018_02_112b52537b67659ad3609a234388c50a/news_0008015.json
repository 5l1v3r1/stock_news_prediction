Analysts have forecast a 2018 result of 19.9 billion.\n“We experienced a positive development across our business units, which in many areas led to good increases in the number of customers and lending,” Chief Executive Thomas Borgen said in a statement regarding the final quarter of 2017.\nDanske’s board proposed a dividend of 10 crowns per share, roughly in line with the 10.1 crowns expected by analysts.\nThe bank said that in future it would raise its dividend payout ratio to 40-60 percent of net profit from 40-50 percent.\nThe bank also announced a share buyback programme of 10 billion crowns this year, roughly in line with the 9.84 billion expected by analysts.\nIt said it aims “to rank in the top three among major Nordic peers in terms of return on shareholders’ equity”.\nFormerly it had said it would aim for a return on shareholders’ equity of 12.5 percent.\nThe bank has had a run of strong quarters, helped by Denmark’s low interest rates, rising house prices and improved profitability in the farming sector.\nIn November, Danske raised its 2017 net result guidance for the second time to the 19-21 billion crowns range.\nThe bank increased lending in Sweden and Norway in 2017, aided partly by an agreement with Sweden’s TCO trade union.\nBut Denmark’s central bank has warned of risks facing the country’s banks from low interest rates, rising property prices and easy credit terms for corporate borrowers.\nThe central bank said in November that several indicators suggested risks were building up in the financial system, and that some of the largest banks did not have sufficient capital to meet buffer requirements.\nDanske Bank’s loan impairment charges showed a net reversal of 241 million crowns in the fourth quarter, marking a fifth consecutive quarter with net reversals.\nAnalysts have warned that a drop in pork prices might begin to squeeze some Danish farmers’ profits and increase Danske Bank’s writedowns slightly from their current very low levels.\nDanske Bank’s exposure to the farming sector represented 2.4 of its total group exposure according to its third-quarter report, but more than 16 percent of its total impairment charges.\nRival Ringkjoebing Landbobank said this week there were “darker clouds” over the farming sector.\n($1 = 5.9593 Danish crowns)\nReporting by Teis Jensen; editing by Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:24:43.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
