(NASDAQ:VDSI), a global leader in digital solutions including identity, security and business productivity, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“VASCO ® reported double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter with positive contributions from software, services, and hardware,” stated VASCO CEO, Scott Clements. “We are executing on our strategy to drive growth in software and services resulting in non-hardware revenue increasing 29% in 2017. For the quarter, strong hardware sales and shifts in our regional sales mix contributed to a lower gross profit margin. As we look to 2018, our focus on developing and growing our software and services offerings paired with continued demand for our hardware products positions VASCO for accelerated growth.”\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 15% to $54.5 million from $47.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and for the full year 2017 increased 1% to $193.3 million from $192.3 million for the full year 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $25.8 million or ($0.65) per fully diluted share, a decrease of $30.8 million from net income of $5.0 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the full year 2017 was $22.4 million or ($0.56) per diluted share, a decrease of $32.9 million from net income of $10.5 million or $0.27 per diluted share, for the comparable period in 2016. The fourth quarter and full year 2017 results include an estimated one-time impact related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $28.1 million or ($0.70) and ($0.71), respectively.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.2 million, a decrease of $1.0 million from $2.2 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the full year 2017 was $6.2 million, a decrease of $3.4 million from $9.6 million reported for the full year 2016. Operating income as a percentage of revenue for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 was 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to 5% and 5% for the comparable periods in 2016.\n1 An explanation of the use of non-GAAP measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has also been provided in tables below.\nNon-GAAP net income 1 , which excludes long-term incentive compensation, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $5.7 million or $0.14 per fully diluted share, a decrease of $0.6 million from $6.3 million or $0.16 per fully diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income for the full year 2017 was $17.0 million or $0.43 per fully diluted share, a decrease of $4.5 million from $21.5 million or $0.54 per fully diluted share, for the full year 2016.\nFor periods reported herein, we have revised amounts reported in previously issued financial statements related to unrecorded pension liabilities net of pension assets and related deferred income taxes. The adjustments are a correction of immaterial errors to the December 31, 2016 balance sheet and there are no adjustments to the statement of operations. The adjustments are summarized below (in thousands, unaudited):\nAs of December 31, 2016 As previously reported Adjustment Corrected Total assets $ 327,270 $ - $ 327,270 Other long-term liabilities $ 1,878 $ 3,831 $ 5,709 Deferred income taxes 853 (414 ) 439 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (9,493 ) (3,417 ) (12,910 ) Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 327,270 $ - $ 327,270 Other Financial Metrics\nGross profit was $35.9 million or 66% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $134.5 million or 70% of revenue for the full year 2017.

We also evaluate our performance using certain non-GAAP operating metrics, namely Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP Net Income and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Our management believes that these measures provide useful supplemental information regarding the performance of our business and facilitates comparisons to our historical operating results. We believe these non-GAAP operating metrics provide additional tools for investors to use to compare our business with other companies in the industry.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not measures of performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation, as alternatives or substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. While we believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful within the context described below, they are in fact incomplete and are not a measure that should be used to evaluate our full performance or our prospects. Such an evaluation needs to consider all of the complexities associated with our business including, but not limited to, how past actions are affecting current results and how they may affect future results, how we have chosen to finance the business, and how taxes affect the final amounts that are or will be available to shareholders as a return on their investment. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are found below.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a simplified measure of performance for use in communicating our performance to investors and analysts and for comparisons to other companies within our industry. As a performance measure, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA presents a view of our operating results that is most closely related to serving our customers. By excluding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation we are able to evaluate performance without considering decisions that, in most cases, are not directly related to meeting our customers’ requirements and were either made in prior periods (e.g., depreciation, amortization and long-term incentive compensation), or deal with the structure or financing of the business (e.g., interest) or reflect the application of regulations that are outside of the control of our management team (e.g., taxes). Similarly, we find the comparison of our results to those of our competitors is facilitated when we do not consider the impact of these items.\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands, unaudited)\nThree months ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (25,837 ) $ 5,012 $ (22,399 ) $ 10,514 Interest income, net (415 ) (281 ) (1,431 ) (785 ) Provision (benefit) for income taxes 27,786 (2,283 ) 30,780 863 Depreciation and amortization 2,708 2,850 10,601 10,777 Long-term incentive compensation 2,173 (586 ) 5,372 4,871 Adjusted EBITDA $ 6,415 $ 4,712 $ 22,923 $ 26,240 Non-GAAP Net Income & Non-GAAP Diluted EPS\nWe define non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS, as net income or EPS before the consideration of long-term incentive compensation expenses, the amortization of purchased intangible assets and the impact of tax reform. We use these measures to assess the impact of our performance excluding items that can significantly impact the comparison of our results between periods and the comparison to competitors.\nLong-term incentive compensation for management and others is directly tied to performance and this measure allows management to see the relationship of the cost of incentives to the performance of the business operations directly if such incentives are based on that period’s performance. To the extent that such incentives are based on performance over a period of several years, there may be periods which have significant adjustments to the accruals in the period but which relate to a longer period of time, and which can make it difficult to assess the results of the business operations in the current period. In addition, the Company’s long-term incentives generally reflect the use of restricted stock grants or cash awards while other companies may use different forms of incentives the cost of which is determined on a different basis, which makes a comparison difficult.\nWe exclude amortization of purchased intangible assets as we believe the amount of such expenses in any given period may not be correlated directly to the performance of the business operations and that such expenses can vary significantly between periods as a result of new acquisitions, the full amortization of previously acquired intangible assets or the write down of such assets due to an impairment event. However, purchased intangible assets contribute to current and future revenue and related amortization expense will recur in future periods until expired or written down. We make a tax adjustment based on the above adjustments resulting in an effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis, which may differ from the GAAP tax rate. We believe the effective tax rates we use in the adjustment are reasonable estimates of the overall tax rates for the Company under its global operating structure.\nWe also exclude the impact of tax reform in the enactment period for items that are not reoccurring. For the fourth quarter and full year results of 2017, our estimate includes tax rate changes in the US and Belgium, deemed repatriation and tax elections related to tax reform. We believe disclosing the estimate improves the comparability of results.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income (in thousands except per share data, unaudited)\nThree months ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (25,837 ) $ 5,012 $ (22,399 ) $ 10,514 Long-term incentive compensation 2,173 (586 ) 5,372 4,871 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 2,206 2,227 8,809 8,849 Tax impact of adjustments* (876 ) (328 ) (2,836 ) (2,744 ) Impact of tax reform 28,075 — 28,075 — Non-GAAP net income $ 5,741 $ 6,325 $ 17,021 $ 21,490 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $ 0.14 $ 0.16 $ 0.43 $ 0.54 Diluted shares outstanding 39,829 39,771 39,802 39,782 * = The tax impact of adjustments is calculated at 20% of the adjustments in all periods\nCopyright © 2018 VASCO Data Security, Inc., VASCO Data Security International GmbH.
