Germany’s Daimler AG has its Car2Go service, while BMW took full control of its DriveNow service last month. \nThe Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said last month it would invest as much as $1 billion in over five years in a bid to adapt to rapid industry change. \nDidi said the new network would also include Chinese electric carmaker BAIC BJEV, Ford partners Changan Automobile Group and Zotye Automobile, Chery Automobile, Geely Auto, KIA Motors and others. \nA person familiar with Didi’s tie-up with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance said the partnership was about looking at the possibility of supplying all-electric battery car models for Didi’s new service. \nThe alliance, however, will also likely explore broader business opportunities with Didi’s new energy vehicle sharing service, the person said without elaborating. \n“This cooperation fits with the alliance’s expansion in vehicle electrification, autonomy, connectivity and new mobility services,” Ogi Redzic, senior vice president of Connected Vehicles and Mobility Services for Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, said in a statement. \nThe global car-sharing market is expected to hit $16.5 billion by 2024, from just $1.2 billion in 2015, according to a report last year from Global Market Insights. China is expected to see particularly fast growth. \nDidi, which dominates China’s ride-hailing market, has previously announced plans to create a domestic charging network for electric cars. The firm has said that it aims to have 1 million electric cars on its network by 2020. \nIn November, Didi had said that more than 260,000 electric vehicles were running on its network.
