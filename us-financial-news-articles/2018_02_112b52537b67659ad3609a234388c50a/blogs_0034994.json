The ministry declined to specify the nationalities of the remaining eight, citing concerns that they might be too easily identified.\n“Twenty people is way too few. Judging from our experience in refugee support, I believe more people should be accepted,” said Eri Ishikawa, of the Japan Association for Refugees.\nJapan accepted 28 people as refugees in 2016.\nReporting by Thomas Wilson, Ami Miyazaki; Writing by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T13:18:46.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
