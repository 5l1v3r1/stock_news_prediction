REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Every time Bolshunov came into view, Niskanen seemed to up the tempo even more to restore his advantage, but with 15km to go Bolshunov started to close in on the Finn and by the time they entered the stadium again the lead had been wiped out.\nBolshunov passed him shortly afterwards and a titanic battle between the two ensued, with Niskanen content for Bolshunov to lead for several kilometers before making a final switch to fresh skis.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Rejuvenated, Niskanen made his break for gold with about one km to go, steaming past Bolshunov and pumping his ski poles for all he was worth.\nHis Russian rival seemed spent and could not respond, leaving the Finn to coast to a gold medal which will delight his countrymen, starved of success at recent Olympics.\nNormally quiet and reserved, the 26-year-old burst into a broad smile, lifting his arms as the crowd rose to their feet to applaud him, led by a raucous band of jubilant, blue-and-white clad Finns.\n“I hope it’s the first but not the last,” a delighted Niskanen said of his gold medal, his second following Finland’s team sprint victory in Sochi four years ago.\n“For me it’s always hard to save energy to the end but today I managed to be first at the finish line, so maybe the coach is not so angry because I didn’t go as planned,” he said with a smile.\n“I could handle the pressure, everything went perfectly today and that’s the result,” he added.\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T15:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T10:05:23.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
