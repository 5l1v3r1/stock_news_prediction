It’s been fun over the first couple of days. \n”I‘m just trying to shoot as low as possible. I know if I carry on playing like I‘m playing and a few putts start to go in, because I didn’t really hole any putts today, I’ll be thereabouts on the leaderboard. \n“To be perfectly honest, match play is anybody‘s. You’re going to need a lot of luck to win it.” (Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly,; editing by Ed Osmond)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T14:58:04.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
