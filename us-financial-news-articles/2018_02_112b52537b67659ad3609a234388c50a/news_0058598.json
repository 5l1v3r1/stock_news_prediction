Completion is expected by the end of 2018 and funding is to come from internal resources, Zurich said.\nEurope’s fifth-biggest insurer last year bought Australia and New Zealand Banking Group’s life insurance arm for $2.1 billion, a deal that propelled it to the top rank in the attractive Australian market.
