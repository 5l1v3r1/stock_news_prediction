That does not mean that they might not be selling dollar again today with renewed enthusiasm,” the analysts said, pointing out that a lack of key data on Monday and a U.S. holiday could keep trading quiet.\nThe U.S. currency’s outlook remains uncertain in the longer-term, strategists said, particularly as other parts of the world where central banks are tightening policy and economies are strong are looking more attractive for investors.\n“Inflation worries and concerns about the U.S. fiscal and trade deficits will keep the dollar on the defensive,” said Masashi Murata, senior strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in Tokyo.\n“In addition to major currencies like the yen and pound, a significant portion of the selling pressure on the dollar is expected to come from emerging currencies, which either enjoy high yields or are supported by current account surpluses.”\nWith the dollar higher, the pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.4011.\n(This version of the story Refiles with correct link to LIVE MARKETS.)\nReporting by Tommy Wilkes; Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in TOKYO; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T03:17:44.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
