Republican aides said the proposal, along with many others, would be considered as the spending legislation is written. \nLeaders of U.S. intelligence agencies warned a Senate committee last week that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections, when control of Congress is up for grabs, much as it did during the 2016 U.S. campaign. \nAnd on Friday, the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russians and 13 Russian companies with conspiracy to tamper with the 2016 race. \nMoscow has denied election meddling and Republican President Donald Trump rejects suggestions that his associates colluded with Russia. \nDemocrats also want a “substantial” increase in funding for the Department of Homeland Security and Election Assistance Commission to help states upgrade their machines and systems. \nDemocratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said on a conference call with reporters that she would back $386 million for states. \nMembers of Congress have repeatedly decried what they see as federal officials’ failure to do more to work with states to protect the election system. \nHomeland Security said last year that 21 states had experienced initial probing of their systems from Russian hackers and a small number of networks were compromised. \nBut three U.S. intelligence officials said protecting sources of information about the use of cyberspace to meddle in elections are a major obstacle to closer cooperation with state officials because much of the intelligence is so classified that it cannot be shared with anyone who does not have a high-level security clearance. \nSchumer also said Democrats want Trump administration officials to issue a public report detailing how Russia might interfere in the 2018 U.S. vote. \nThey also want a classified report for state officials and relevant congressional committees. \nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:09:46.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
