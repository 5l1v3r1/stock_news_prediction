Then the train stopped and an announcement warned of signal problems.\n“Five minutes became 10 minutes, became 20 minutes, became one hour, became one hour and 50 minutes,” said Tang, who was in pain and urgently hoping the subway would quickly reach her destination. “Now, before boarding the subway, even if it’s for one stop, I use the bathroom.”\nThe Riders Alliance invited commuters to share their stories using the hashtag #WorstCommute. Winners of the contest receive a chocolate replica of the MetroCard, which the subway system’s roughly 6 million daily riders swipe to enter stations.\nCuomo, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the public agency that runs the subways, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOverall subway on-time performance has plummeted to 65 percent - a drop of 15 percentage points over the past several years and the worst of any major transit system in the world, the Riders Alliance said.\nTrain delays more than tripled from 2012 to 2017 and subway speeds are now slower than they were in 1950, it said.\nTang said Jan. 20 incident stands out as a personal worst in a lifetime of subway riding: “Even in the ‘70s when I almost got mugged on the subway, I never had such as horrible experience on the train.” (Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Scott Malone)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T22:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:14:37.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
