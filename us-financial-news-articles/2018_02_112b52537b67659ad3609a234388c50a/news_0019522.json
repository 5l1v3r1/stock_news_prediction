Subaru based the estimates on a new forecast for the yen to average around 112 yen to the U.S. dollar.\nThe automaker has enjoyed years of strong growth due to ballooning U.S. demand for its rugged SUVs and crossovers including the Forester and the Outback, which it has marketed as niche lifestyle products.\nBut as competition in the U.S. SUV segment has heated up in the past year, Subaru has been increasing discounts to raise sales. That has been weighing on profits in its biggest market which accounts for nearly two-thirds of global unit sales.\nIn the April-December period, Subaru sold 509,100 vehicles in the United States, up 1.6 percent from a year earlier. Domestic sales rose 12.6 percent to 118,800 units, while they fell 33 percent to 21,500 in China.\nIn the year to March, Subaru expects to sell 671,300 units in the United States, up from a previous forecast of 668,000 and up 0.5 percent from last year. Globally, its sees sales of 1.0671 million units, up slightly on the year even after a revision from a previous forecast for 1.0679 million units.\nReporting by Naomi TajitsuEditing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T16:39:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
