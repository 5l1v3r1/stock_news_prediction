It was the biggest moment of my life when she won that gold and I think today was one of the biggest moments of our lives, but her gold will forever be the biggest thing,” she said.\n”She made me believe that you can grab the stars and that’s what I did today.\n Women's Alpine Combined - Jeongseon Silver medallist Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S., gold medallist Michelle Gisin of Switzerland and bronze medallist Wendy Holdener of Switzerland celebrate during the victory ceremony.

REUTERS/Toby Melville Shiffrin was, for many, the favorite in the combined event, while Swiss team mate Wendy Holdener, whose sizzling slalom run of 40.23 seconds earned her a bronze medal, was also seen as a challenger.\n“It’s amazing to be on the podium with two such amazing skiers and I knew I will have to show the slalom of my life to have a chance to get that medal and to get that gold medal,” the 24-year-old Gisin added.\n”I‘m just so excited that I found my run. I’ve been looking for that run the whole season and it came at just the perfect moment.\n“I didn’t feel I could make that slalom. I have to be honest because I was struggling so bad with the slalom the whole season. Today was the day to finally put all the pieces together in the slalom and that was the key.”\nReporting by Simon Evans; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T11:33:01.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
