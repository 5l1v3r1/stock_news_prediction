REUTERS/David Cerny TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY While body checking is forbidden in women’s hockey, the game was a scrappy affair which would be expected from a rivalry that both sides have routinely described as “a war”.\n“Yeah, we’re not worried about it,” said Stauber after watching his team absorb a fifth straight loss to Canada.\n“Nope we’re focused on the things that we can control, and certainly those games that we played in the past have absolutely nothing to do with our future.”\nSlideshow (8 Images) After a high-tempo scoreless opening period, Canada took control in the second on a power-play goal from Meghan Agosta and another from Sarah Nurse, who found the top corner of goalie Maddie Rooney’s net with a laser-like wrist shot.\nBefore the end of period, the U.S. had chance to pull one back when Canada covered the puck in the crease to give up a penalty shot.\nHowever, Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson could not convert, sending Canada to the intermission with a two-goal cushion.\nThe U.S. came out flying to start the third and immediately halved the deficit, Kendall Coyne splitting the Canadian defense and snapping the puck between Genevieve Lacasse’s pads just 23 seconds into the period.\nThe Americans, however, could not complete the comeback with the game ending in a wild pile-up around the Canadian net.\nWith the victory Canada sails into the knockout round with a perfect 3-0 mark sitting top of Group A followed by the U.S. at 2-1.\n“It’s always a battle playing the U.S.,” said Agosta. “We haven’t seen Team USA since December and they’ve gotten better but so have we.”\nAdditional reporting by Dan Burns; Editing by John O'Brien and Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T08:11:20.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
