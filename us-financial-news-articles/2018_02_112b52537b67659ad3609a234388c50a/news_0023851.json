On its website it describes Guizar as the commander of his own faction of the violent Los Zetas in the south of Mexico. \n“Guizar is responsible for the importation of thousands of kilograms of cocaine and methamphetamine to the United States on a yearly basis,” the website says. \nGuizar, an American citizen, has been charged in drug trafficking indictments in Texas and Viriginia.
