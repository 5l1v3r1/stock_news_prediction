Sabine's cash distribution history, current and prior year financial reports and tax information booklets, a link to filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission and more can be found on its website at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/ .\nThis distribution reflects primarily the oil production for November 2017 and the gas production for October 2017. Preliminary production volumes are approximately 38,744 barrels of oil and 480,482 Mcf of gas. Preliminary prices are approximately $52.31 per barrel of oil and $2.76 per Mcf of gas.\nThe table below compares this month's production and prices to the previous month's:\nNet to Trust Sales\nVolumes\nAverage Price\nOil\n(bbls)\nGas\n(Mcf)\nOil\n(per bbl)\nGas\n(per Mcf)\nCurrent Month\n38,744\n480,482\n$52.31\n$2.76\nPrior Month\n53,181\n500,292\n$48.97\n$2.84\nRevenues are only posted and distributed when they are received. Most energy companies normally issue payment of royalties on or about the 25 th of every month, and depending on mail delivery, a varying amount of royalties are not received until after the revenue posting on the last business day of the month. The revenues received after that date will be posted within 30 days of receipt.\nDue to the timing of the end of the month of January, approximately $1,700,000 of revenue received will be posted in the following month of February in addition to normal receipts during February. Since the close of business in January and prior to this press release, approximately $358,000 in revenue has been received.\nApproximately $32,000 for 2017 Ad Valorem taxes was deducted from this month's distribution as compared to $64,000 this time last year. These payments are normal expenditures at this time of year.\nThe 2017 tax information packets are expected to begin mailing directly to unitholders in early March 2018. A copy of Sabine's 2017 tax information booklet will be posted on Sabine's website by March 1, 2018. In addition to the tax booklet the Sabine website will also offer two simple calculators for computing the income and expense amounts and the cost depletion. The calculators are currently expected to be updated with the 2017 tax information by February 19, 2018.\nThe January 1, 2017 Reserve Summary is available on the Sabine website at http://www.sbr-sabine.com/ .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sabine-royalty-trust-announces-monthly-cash-distribution-for-february-2018-300592853.html\nSOURCE Sabine Royalty Trust", "external_links": ["http://www.sbr-sabine.com/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sabine-royalty-trust-announces-monthly-cash-distribution-for-february-2018-300592853.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T18:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T19:58:56.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
