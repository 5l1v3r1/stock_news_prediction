They are looking at random feeds. They are the ones seeing when Dwayne ”The Rock“ Johnson tweets at us,” said Lyndsay Signor, who oversees the war room as NBC’s director of sports consumer engagement.\nThe team once spotted a video of a stray walkie talkie tumbling down a ski slope, followed by workers trying to catch up with it. The clip has around 1.5 million views on Facebook.\nNBC’s parent, Comcast Corp, paid more than $7.75 billion for the rights to broadcast the Olympic Games to U.S. audiences, up until 2032. Most of its Olympic revenues will come from selling TV advertising or from subscriber fees collected from pay-TV operators that carry its coverage.\nBut social media generates a growing stream of ad revenues and helps drive younger people to watch NBC broadcasts.\nThe social media room is in constant contact with NBC’s “highlight factory” in Stamford, Connecticut where highlights are cut from raw footage and posted across all NBC platforms.\n“It’s probably 50 people at one time who might touch a piece of social content,” Signor said.\nFor action that unfolds when American viewers are asleep, the room prepares “waves” of content timed for release during U.S. prime time.\nOn Wednesday, it readied a wave of social media coverage on U.S. snowboarder Shaun White becoming the most successful snowboarder in history with his third Olympic gold.\nThe hottest social-media properties for NBC at these Games include figure skaters Adam Rippon -- who Signor calls a “soundbite machine” -- and Mirai Nagasu who this week became the first American woman to land a triple axel jump at the Olympics.\nCanadian ice dancing pair Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir are also drawing plenty of interest online.\n“They’re very attractive and they won gold for Canada so we are seeing a lot of traction with them,” Signor said.\nEditing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T13:42:15.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
