Riley analyst Susan Anderson wrote in a note.\nAnalysts also highlighted management’s expectation to achieve 40 percent of the $650 million of cost savings planned over two years, up from one-third previously.\nInvestors also cheered Barbie’s first sales rise in five quarters, with the iconic brand up 9 percent during the holiday sales quarter.\n“Barbie, Hot Wheels and Thomas & Friends growth is expected, but leaves over 70 percent of the business still struggling,” wrote Jefferies analysts, who cut their price target to $12.50 from $14.00.\nThe results come at a time when Mattel’s shares have been buoyed by chatter of a takeover by Hasbro Inc. However, Mattel has snubbed the previous offers.\nMattel is expected to provide more details at its analyst meeting on Feb. 16.
