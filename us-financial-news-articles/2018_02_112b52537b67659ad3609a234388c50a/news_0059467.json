But a judge does not have to act on a prosecutor’s request in terms of sentencing.\nBoth Vella and Scaroni have previously denied any wrongdoing.\nLawyers for Vella, who was head of Eni’s North Africa business at the time, and for Scaroni were not immediately available to comment on Monday.\nThe case covers the period 2007 to 2010.\nAn Eni spokesman reiterated the company’s previous denial of any wrongdoing, adding it would be able to present its position in defence hearings in coming weeks.\nPalma also asked for Eni and oil service group Saipem to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.1 million) each.\nJail sentences were also requested for some former Saipem executives.\nThe long-running case revolves around allegations that Saipem paid intermediaries around 197 million euros to bag contracts worth 8 billion euros with Algeria’s state-owned Sonatrach.\nProsecutors claim the payment also allowed Eni to get a green light from Algeria’s Energy Ministry to buy Canadian oil and gas company First Calgary Petroleums.\nUnder Italian law, companies are responsible for the actions of their managers and can be fined if found guilty.
