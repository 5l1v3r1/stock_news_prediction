Holding the hammer the Canadian world champions had looked poised to secure a victory only to watch skip Rachel Homan’s last rock wreck on a guard in the 11th end as Madeleine Dupont’s Danish foursome looked on stunned by their good fortune picking up a first win. ”We can play a little looser now because we came in as team number 10 (of 10),“ said Denmark second Julie Hogh. ”If we could get one win we would be really happy, and now we have it. “So of course we’re going to move forward and take one day at a time, but we can play a little loose now because we have the win we really, really wanted.” Curling – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Women’s Round Robin - Denmark v Canada - Gangneung Curling Center - Gangneung, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Madeleine Dupont, Denise Dupont, Julie Hogh and Mathilde Halse of Denmark celebrate after beating Canada.

Japan and Sweden sit at the top of the standings with marks of 3-0 while Canada (0-3) are the only nation without a win and find themselves in a big hole with only four of the 10 teams advancing to the semi-finals.
