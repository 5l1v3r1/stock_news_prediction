Its main listing is on the London Stock Exchange where the company has been trading since 2005.\nThe additional listing should boost X5’s stock liquidity and open it to additional investors, Chief Financial Officer Svetlana Demyashkevich told reporters at a ceremony which she attended along with Fridman and other executives.\nGiven the risk of sanctions facing Russia’s wealthiest people, the finance ministry plans to give them priority in a sovereign Eurobond issue due later this year.\nAsked about that, Fridman, whose wealth is estimated by Forbes at $14.4 billion, said he did not have any immediate plans to take part.\n“If the terms are attractive, then maybe I’ll think about (investing) my personal funds,” he said.
