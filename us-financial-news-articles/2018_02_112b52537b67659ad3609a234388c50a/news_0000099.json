But the rebels launched a new offensive when the ceasefire expired last month, killing members of the armed forces, bombing major oil pipelines and kidnapping an oil contractor.\nThe ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1964, has sought peace with the government before but made little progress. It is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union.\nFARC leaders have expressed fear of a systematic campaign to assassinate militants and leaders of their political party, as happened with the Patriotic Union, a leftist organization that lost some 5,000 of its members in attacks attributed to right-wing paramilitaries in 1985.\nAccording to the FARC, 39 ex-combatants have been assassinated since the peace agreement was signed, in addition to 14 family members.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Helen Murphy; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:10:50.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
