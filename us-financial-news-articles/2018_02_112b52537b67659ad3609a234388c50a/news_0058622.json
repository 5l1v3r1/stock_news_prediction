Of this, KenGen, which is 70 percent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW, including 533 MW from geothermal sources.\nKenGen plans to add another 1,745 megawatts (MW) of electricity capacity from geothermal sources by 2025.\nIt said operating expenses rose to 4.65 billion shillings from 4.39 billion shillings a year earlier due to maintenance costs at its power plants.\nBasic earnings per share fell to 1.86 shillings from 2.10 shillings a year earlier, the company said, adding it would not pay an interim dividend.\n$1 = 101.8000 Kenyan shillings Reporting by George Obulutsa; Editing by Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T16:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:00:50.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
