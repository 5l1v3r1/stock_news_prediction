Fast Retailing fell 2.5 percent, SoftBank Group Corp shed 2.4 percent and Fanuc Corp slid 2.0 percent.\nData early in the day showed slowing production of cars and electronics in January tipped Japan’s industrial output into its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory.\nConfidence was further dented after the Bank of Japan trimmed the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation.\nGlobal investors are increasingly worried over how much longer the BOJ can maintain its massive stimulus campaign. Though a complete exit from these policies is believed to be a long way off, economists worry that the central bank won’t be able to start scaling back its asset purchases more actively without disrupting financial markets.\nExporters were also battered, with Honda Motor falling 2.2 percent and TDK Corp dropping 1.9 percent.\nAs oil prices extended declines into a second day, the mining sector was hit. Inpex Corp tumbled 4.9 percent and Japan Petroleum Exploration Co slumped 3.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix dropped 1.2 percent to 1,768.24.
