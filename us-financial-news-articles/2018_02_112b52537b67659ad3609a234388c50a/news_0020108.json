The department reported last month that wholesale inventories rose 0.2 percent in December. \nAuto inventories rose 1.7 percent after increasing 0.9 percent in November. \nThe component of wholesale inventories that goes into the calculation of gross domestic product - wholesale inventories excluding auto stocks - rose 0.2 percent in December. \nU.S. financial markets were little moved by the data. \nInventory investment cut 0.67 percentage point from GDP growth in the fourth quarter, according to the government’s advance estimate released last month. GDP grew 2.6 percent in the October-December quarter. \nSales at wholesalers rose 1.2 percent in December after gaining 1.9 percent in November. \nInventories in December were up 3.4 percent from the year-earlier period, while sales jumped 9.1 percent. \nAt December’s sales pace it would take wholesalers 1.22 months to deplete stocks, compared with 1.23 in November. The inventories-to-sales ratio for motor vehicles rose to 1.72 in December from 1.69 in the prior month.
