The SPD, reluctant to repeat the bruising experience, insisted on taking the top finance job -- prompting rumblings of discontent in Merkel’s camp.\n“We will stick to a budget with no new debt. We won’t raise any taxes,” said Altmaier. “And on a European level we will be responsible with German interests,” Altmaier said in the interview with the Funke media group.\nEven if an SPD finance minister were minded to pursue a less sober fiscal policy, he would be bound by collective government responsibility, he added.\nSchaeuble stepped down as finance minister after the election to become president of the Bundestag, Germany’s parliament, which, with the entry of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, is at its most fragmented in decades.\nThe SPD’s membership is currently voting on whether to endorse the party leadership’s decision to govern with Merkel for another four years. The results of the postal ballot are expected this weekend.\nReporting by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T04:25:06.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
