And the CRA would release temporary liquidity worth almost 2 trillion yuan.\nIn the same statement on Tuesday, the central bank said it had skipped reverse repos for the 15th straight trading day.\nThe outstanding balance of reverse repos in the open market operations has fallen to 70 billion yuan as of Tuesday, according to Reuters calculations based on official data.\nReporting by Winni Zhou and John RuwitchEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:38:47.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
