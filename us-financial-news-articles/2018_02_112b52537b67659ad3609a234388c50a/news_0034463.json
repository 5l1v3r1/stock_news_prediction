I bet that will never happen again,” Southgate said.\n“Gary and I worked together well and it was great out there today. I‘m chuffed for Marcel too, he’s a good friend of mine and it’s always a bit of fun getting a hole-in-one.”\nSouthgate’s ace was his second of the year after his effort with a different caddie in the Dubai Desert Classic last month.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:31:29.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
