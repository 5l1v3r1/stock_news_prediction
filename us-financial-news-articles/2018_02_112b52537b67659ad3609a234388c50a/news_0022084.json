(NYSE: DCI) today provided provisional estimates of the impact from the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) on its fiscal 2018 results.\nDonaldson expects its second quarter 2018 results will include the following non-cash items:\nA provisional charge of approximately $110 million, or $0.83 per share, 1 related to the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings, to be paid over eight years. A provisional charge of approximately $2 million, or $0.02 per share, related to the re-measurement of Donaldson’s net deferred tax assets.\nAdditionally, the Company estimates the net impact from the TCJA will lower the full-year 2018 effective tax rate by approximately 1 percentage point, reflecting a partial-year benefit from the U.S. corporate tax rate reduction that is largely offset by a negative impact from foreign withholding tax and other matters related to the TCJA. Longer term, Donaldson expects an annual effective tax rate between 24 and 28 percent.\nThe provisional estimates of the impact from the TCJA are based on currently available information and interpretation of its provisions. Management believes these charges are a reasonable estimate, as of February 7, 2018, that may change as additional required information is prepared and analyzed, interpretations and assumptions are refined, additional guidance is issued, and due to actions taken because of the legislation. Donaldson expects to finalize the impact from the TCJA during the financial close process for its fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.\nMembers of Donaldson’s management team will discuss the broader impacts from tax reform, including the Company’s capital deployment priorities and other business matters, during a webcast of its second quarter 2018 earnings conference call on March 6, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. CST.\nWEBCAST:\nTo listen to a live webcast of the call, visit the Events & Presentations section of Donaldson’s Investor Relations website at IR.Donaldson.com and click on the “listen to webcast” option.\nREPLAY:\nThe webcast replay will be available within the Events & Presentations section of Donaldson’s Investor Relations website beginning at approximately 12:00 p.m. CST on Tuesday, March 6, 2018 .\n1 All earnings per share figures refer to diluted earnings per share.\nMiscellaneous\nStatements in this release regarding future events and expectations, such as forecasts, plans, trends and projections relating to the Company’s business and financial performance, are within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are identified by words or phrases such as “will likely result,” “are expected to,” “will continue,” “will allow,” “estimate,” “project,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” and similar expressions.
