It comes amid a wave of lawsuits by cities, counties, and states seeking to hold corporations responsible for the drug abuse epidemic.\n\"I'm committed to hauling each of these opioid companies into a Kentucky court to answer for their actions that have devastated our families, communities, and state,\" Beshear said in a statement.\nCardinal Health said in a statement that it cares deeply about opioid abuse and addiction and it believes there is an \"urgent need\" to work toward solutions to address the public health crisis.\n\"We do not believe litigation is the solution to this problem and will defend ourselves vigorously against baseless lawsuits,\" the company said.\nThe lawsuit seeks to recover the costs that it says Kentucky has incurred as a result of Cardinal's actions as well as unspecified penalties and fines.\nOpioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nA growing number of lawsuits by states, counties, and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and wholesale distributors of failing to report suspicious drug orders.\nTwo other state attorneys general have sued Cardinal Health. The company says it faces at least 343 opioid-related lawsuits, which were largely brought by counties and municipalities.\nIn December 2016, Cardinal Health agreed to pay $44 million to resolve claims by the U.S. Justice Department that it failed to alert the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to suspiciously large orders of addictive painkillers.\nThe following month, the company announced that it had reached a $20 million settlement with West Virginia to resolve a lawsuit filed in 2012 over its distribution of opioids in the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:37:12.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
