December’s reading surpassed even the top estimate in a Reuters poll, suggesting manufacturers kicked off the new year on a strong footing.\nIn comparison, retail sales fell 1.5 percent in December from the previous month, a much larger decline than the 0.4 percent contraction median estimate among economists polled by Reuters.\nThe result highlights the two-track economic recovery of corporate Brazil, which for years suffered from bloated debt loads, high costs weak demand.\nNevertheless, economists expect the economy to turn that page in 2018, expanding at the fastest pace in four years.
