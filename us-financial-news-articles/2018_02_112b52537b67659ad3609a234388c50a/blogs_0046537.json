But this falls below us by about 30bps and the Street by about 100bps, potentially disappointing folks,” Leerink Analyst Danielle Antalffy said.\nThe company’s shares were marginally down in early trading.\nSales in the company’s diabetes unit rose 17 percent to $584 million, as its new 670G system, which mimics some of the functions of a healthy pancreas, completed a priority access program.\nThe company earned $1.17 per share excluding items in the quarter ended Jan. 26, in line with analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet sales rose 1.2 percent to $7.37 billion, beating the average estimate of $7.21 billion.\nMedtronic, which redomiciled to Ireland through its Covidien deal, said it recorded a $2.2 billion net charge related to recent changes in the U.S. tax law.\nThe company reported a third-quarter loss of $1.39 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the quarter, compared with a profit of $821 million, or $0.59 per share, a year earlier.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:17:57.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
