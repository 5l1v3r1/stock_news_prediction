The bank in September scrapped a 45 percent payout cap. \nItaú beat analysts’ estimates for recurring return on equity on the fourth quarter with 21.9 percent, compared with a 20.7 pct consensus compiled by Thomson Reuters. \nNet income of 6.280 billion reais was slightly above analysts’ consensus of 6.243 billion reais, as the fall in loan-loss expenses offset the reduction in interest income as Brazilian basic interest rates reached their lowest-ever level. \nAs the country showed the first signs of emerging from its harshest recession in decades on the fourth quarter, Itaú’s loan book grew 3.2 percent over the three previous months, excluding acquisition effects. Adding the loan book of Citigroup Inc’s Brazilian retail unit, acquired by Itaú, growth reached 4 percent on the quarter. \nItaú expects its loan book to grow from 4 percent to 7 percent this year, after a 0.8 percent contraction for full-year 2017. \nLower credit losses and higher volumes are expected to offset further decreases in interest income from loans. Last quarter, Itaú’s recurring interest income was 11.2 percent below the same period a year earlier. \nDefault rates above 90 days fell to 3 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percentage point below the ratio on the previous quarter.
