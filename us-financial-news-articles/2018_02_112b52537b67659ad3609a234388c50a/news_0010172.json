He pushed him really close and I‘m really proud of him.” \nWithout Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka, Switzerland were eliminated by Kazakhstan while Serbia, missing the injured Novak Djokovic, were knocked out by the United States. \nKazakhstan will now face Croatia and the U.S. will take on Belgium, who beat Hungary with David Goffin winning both his singles matches in Liege.
