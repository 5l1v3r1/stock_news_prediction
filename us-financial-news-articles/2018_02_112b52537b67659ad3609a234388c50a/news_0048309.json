This new acquisition strategically adds TIME’s market leading technology platform to Crown’s exclusive global service network, providing significant benefits across the value chain.\n“Technology is at the forefront of our industry,” says Curt Smith, Group Vice President of Crown World Mobility. “This acquisition allows us to expand our service offerings for new and existing customers and meets a growing demand for managed Lump Sum and Flexible move-types in the marketplace.”\nIn recent years, Lump Sum policies have grown in popularity and are expected to increase due to shifting consumer preferences and the recent tax reform in the U.S.. TIME’s proprietary technology platform has been specifically developed to address these types of moves and enhance the relocation process.\nBy embracing new ways of working, our customers can now be put in direct control of their moves; the system links them to their entitlement and guides them through each step of the process. Crown’s global network will support these moves and be on hand to ensure consistency of approach and real-time support when required.\n“We pride ourselves on being where our clients need us to be and meeting their ever-growing needs,” says Smith. “This allows us to improve our value proposition by further leveraging our technological expertise.”\nGrant Chapman, former Director for TIME Relocation, will join Crown World Mobility to lead the global service rollout and oversee future development.\nFor more information, visit www.crownworldmobility.com .\nAbout Crown World Mobility : Crown World Mobility ( www.crownworldmobility.com ) is a division of the Crown Worldwide Group, established in 1965 and headquartered in Hong Kong.
