The cumulative impact of regulation (and) higher taxation than other jurisdictions is making Canada a more difficult place to allocate capital in,” Williams said on a conference call with analysts. \nThe company is taking those concerns to the government, he added. \n“Other jurisdictions are doing much more to attract business, so Canada needs to up its game,” Williams said. \nTrudeau is already under pressure to settle a dispute between two provinces, Alberta and British Columbia, over a proposed oil pipeline expansion. \nAmong other competitive pressures, U.S. corporate income taxes are set to fall sharply, creating benefits for energy companies. \nPipeline companies are struggling to gain approval for new projects in Canada due to staunch opposition from environmental groups. Tight pipeline capacity has made a price discount for Canadian heavy oil more severe.
