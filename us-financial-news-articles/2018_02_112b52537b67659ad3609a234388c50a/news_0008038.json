Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks! [0711 EST]\n- Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps thatâ€™s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition! [0717 EST]\n- Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped! [0739 EST]\n- Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal! [0936 EST]\n- Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure![1008 EST]\n- Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
