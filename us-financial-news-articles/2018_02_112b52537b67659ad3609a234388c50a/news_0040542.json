Everything is so fine for me.”\nIn a sign of changing attitudes in the country, Iranian female weightlifters last year won the right to compete internationally in a sport where its men have won seven Olympic gold medals this century.\nShe said that international competition has helped her forge bonds with fellow ski racers from around the world including American athletes, who hail from a country that has long been an adversary of the Middle Eastern nation.\nAlpine Skiing – Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Women’s Slalom – Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 16, 2018 - Forough Abbasi of Iran competes. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann ”I love the American people so much and really, we don’t have any problem with the people,“ she said. ”Maybe the governments have some problems but the people really don’t have any problem.\n“We love everyone around the world... Iranian people want to be friends and have peace with other countries.”\nSlideshow (3 Images) SAMSUNG CONTROVERSY Abbasi said she and her countrymen back home were offended when South Korean Olympic organizers initially refused to give Iranian athletes the gift of a free Samsung phone, citing international sanctions.\nThe organizers reversed course after Iran summoned South Korea’s ambassador to the Foreign Ministry over the apparent snub and demanded an apology from Samsung.\n“The Iranian people became so angry. They said we will block Samsung in Iran and no one will use Samsung anymore,” she said. “They apologized to Iranian athletes and we accept it because we need the peace.”\nAbbasi, who was a championship mountain bike rider prior to becoming an Alpine skier, said coming from Iran still had its disadvantages, which were on display when she came in 55th during her first run at the Yongpyong Alpine Center.\n“The slope was so icy and we don’t have any ice in Iran,” she said. “It was really hard for us to train for this.”\nReporting by Rory Carroll; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T14:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:11:11.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
