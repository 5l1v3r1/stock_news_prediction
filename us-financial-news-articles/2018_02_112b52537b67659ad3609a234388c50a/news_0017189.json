It was a marked turnaround from the 13.6 billion euro loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 when the bank booked writedowns to its bad loan portfolio to ease disposals.\nThe bank said this week it had completed a landmark 16 billion euro bad loan sale and would reap a capital benefit in coming months.\nMustier said this year’s net profit would be higher than the 3.7 billion euro adjusted 2017 result as the bank works to meet a 2019 goal of 4.7 billion euros.\nUniCredit’s revenues come mostly from lending, unlike at Intesa, Italy’s biggest retail bank, which relies more on fees from asset management and insurance.\nUniCredit’s net interest income rose 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016 while fees grew 12 percent. Operating costs fell 5 percent net of one-offs.\nThe bank expects its interest income, which remained flat last year, to rise in the second half of 2018.\n“UniCredit beat on all lines ... but mainly on cost and lower tax rate,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.\nBAD LOANS Italy’s 300 billion euro pile of loans that turned sour during a harsh recession which ended in 2014 is the focus of European Central Bank supervisors’ concerns over Italian banks.\nUniCredit held 48 billion euros in bad loans at the end of 2017, or 10.2 percent of total lending, but said in December that it aims to cut that ratio to 7.8 percent in 2019.\nYielding to rising ECB pressure, Intesa Sanpaolo pledged to halve its bad debts under a new four-year plan unveiled this week, while Italy’s third-largest bank Banco BPM ( BAMI.MI ) also upped its bad loan reduction target on Wednesday.\nUniCredit said its core capital stood at 13.02 percent after taking into account a boost from the bad loan sale and the hit from fresh writedowns the bank plans to book this year as a new accounting rule comes into force.\n($1 = 0.8143 euros)\nReporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Mark Potter and Kirsten Donovan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:48:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
