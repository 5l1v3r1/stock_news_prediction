Zarda’s estate was backed in the appeal by dozens of large companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft Corp, CBS Corp and Viacom Inc.\nZarda died in a BASE-jumping accident after the lawsuit was filed.\nZarda’s former employer, Altitude Express Inc, and companies that have faced similar lawsuits have argued that when Congress adopted Title VII more than 50 years ago, it did not consider whether the law’s ban on sex bias included discrimination based on sexual orientation.\nBut lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender groups and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have increasingly argued that sexual orientation is a function of a person’s gender.\nThe 2nd Circuit agreed on Monday in its 10-3 decision.\nLast April, the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit became the first court to find that Title VII bans gay bias in the workplace.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in December declined to take up a different case out of Georgia that posed the same question.
