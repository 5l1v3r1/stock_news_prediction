The Company also summarized recent program updates and reiterated full-year 2018 revenue and net cash spend guidance.\nCorporate Highlights for Full-Year 2017 and Year-to-Date 2018\nFull-year 2017 revenue for Fabry oral precision medicine Galafold (migalastat) totaled $36.9 million. On track to achieve full-year 2018 revenue guidance of $75M-$85M with more than 360 patients treated today. Regulatory decisions for migalastat anticipated in 1H18 in Japan (J-NDA) and in 3Q18 in the U.S. (NDA filed under priority review; PDUFA action date August 13, 2018). Novel, highly differentiated Pompe treatment regimen ATB200/AT2221 continues to show persistent and durable improvements on functional outcomes and key disease biomarkers, with favorable safety profile, following up to 12 months of treatment in Pompe patients. Significant Pompe biologics manufacturing milestones achieved. Agreement reached with FDA on biocomparability between 250L GMP and 1000L engineering batches in 4Q17. Initial 1000L GMP drug substance manufacturing campaign now complete in 1Q18. Building robust Pompe clinical data package to include current and additional patients in ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study, as well as a supportive retrospective natural history study and prospective observational study. Regulatory update expected in 2Q18. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $358.6 million at December 31, 2017. Balance sheet further strengthened with $300M in gross proceeds from a follow on public offering in February 2018.\nJohn F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. stated, “Throughout 2017 we continued to build a leading global rare disease biotech company. In the early part of 2018 we have made significant progress to further advance our vision to maximize the impact of our medicines for people living with rare metabolic diseases. There is tremendous momentum for the launch and regulatory review processes for Galafold as we expand global access to this important oral precision medicine for Fabry disease. In addition, the longer term data from our Pompe clinical study further strengthen the potential of our new treatment paradigm for this devastating muscle disease. With these key value drivers in Fabry and Pompe, supported by a strengthened balance sheet and several pipeline opportunities, Amicus is well positioned to create significant near- and long-term value for patients and shareholders.”\n2018 Key Strategic Priorities\nDouble global revenue for Galafold ($75 million - $85 million) Secure approvals for migalastat in Japan and the U.S. Achieve clinical, manufacturing and regulatory milestones to advance ATB200/AT2221 toward global regulatory submissions and approvals as soon as possible Develop and expand preclinical pipeline to ensure at least one new clinical program in 2019 Maintain a strong balance sheet\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the full-year 2017 was $36.9 million, an increase from total revenue of $5.0 million in the full-year 2016. Total revenue represents commercial sales of Galafold (migalastat) which commenced in May 2016, as well as reimbursed Expanded Access Programs (EAPs). Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $358.6 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $330.4 million at December 31, 2016. Total operating expenses increased to $472.7 million for the full-year 2017 compared to $186.0 million in the full-year 2016. Operating expenses in 2017 included $210.8 million of non-cash charges related to the Phase 3 ESSENCE study in epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Operating expenses, as adjusted, excluding the impact of non-cash charges related to the ESSENCE study, were $261.9 million for the full-year 2017, reflecting increased investments in the Pompe and EB programs as well as increased investment in the Galafold commercial launch. Net cash spend was $216.5 million for the full-year 2017, in-line with full-year 2017 net cash spend guidance of $200 million to $225 million. Net loss was $284.0 million, or $1.85 per share, compared to a net loss of $200.0 million, or $1.49 per share, for the full-year 2016. Net loss, as adjusted, excludes the impact of the non-cash charges related to the ESSENCE study and was $237.9 million or $1.55 per share.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nAmicus recorded $36.9 million in full-year 2017 revenue from commercial sales and reimbursed expanded access programs for Galafold. For the full-year 2018 the Company anticipates total Galafold revenue of $75 million to $85 million.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $358.6 million at December 31, 2017. As previously announced, the Company further strengthened the balance sheet with $300 million in gross proceeds from a follow on public offering in February 2018. The Company continues to expect full-year 2018 net cash spend of between $230 million and $260 million. The current cash position, including proceeds from the recent equity offering and expected Galafold revenues, is sufficient to fund ongoing Fabry and Pompe program operations into at least 2021. Potential future business development collaborations, pipeline expansion, and investment in biologics manufacturing capabilities could impact our future capital requirements.\nProgram Highlights\nMigalastat for Fabry Disease\nMigalastat is an oral precision medicine intended to treat Fabry disease in patients who have amenable genetic mutations. Regulatory authorities in the European Union, Switzerland, Israel, Canada, Australia, and South Korea have granted full approval for migalastat under the trade name Galafold. The EU approval may serve as the basis for regulatory approvals in more than two-thirds of the global Fabry market that is outside the U.S. In the U.S., the U.S. FDA accepted the Company’s new drug application (NDA) for migalastat under priority review with a six-month PDUFA goal date of August 13, 2018.\nAmicus is committed to advancing the highest quality therapies for all people living with Fabry disease. For people with non-amenable mutations who are not eligible for migalastat as an oral precision medicine, the strategy is to advance next-generation therapies such as a novel Fabry ERT (ATB101) co-formulated with migalastat or other innovative technologies that continue to be evaluated.\nGlobal Fabry Updates:\n360+ patients (naïve and ERT-switch) on reimbursed Galafold as of February 28, 2017 Total full-year 2017 revenue of $36.9 million from global commercial sales and expanded access programs (EAPs) Pricing and reimbursement secured in 18 countries Approvals secured in EU, Australia, Canada, Israel, South Korea and Switzerland Approvals pending in Japan, U.S. and Taiwan\nAnticipated Milestones:\nRegulatory decisions on Japanese J-NDA (1H18) and U.S. NDA (3Q18) Total full-year 2018 revenue guidance of $75 million to $85 million ATB101 co-formulated with migalastat advancing toward the clinic in 2019\nATB200/AT2221 for Pompe Disease\nATB200/AT2221 is a novel treatment paradigm that consists of ATB200, a unique recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) enzyme with optimized carbohydrate structures, particularly mannose-6 phosphate (M6P), to enhance uptake, co-administered with AT2221, a pharmacological chaperone. During WORLD Symposium™ in February 2018, Amicus presented updated positive data from an ongoing global Phase 1/2 clinical study ( ATB200-02 ) to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and functional outcomes of ATB200/AT2221 across ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 1), non-ambulatory ERT-switch patients (Cohort 2), and ERT-naïve patients (Cohort 3).\nThe Company is in the midst of a series of collaborative discussions with U.S. and EU regulators regarding the best and fastest pathway forward for this novel treatment option. Amicus expects to provide a Pompe regulatory pathway update in the second quarter of 2018. While these discussions are underway, Amicus continues to make progress with clinical and manufacturing activities to support the needs of the Pompe community.\nPompe clinical activities:\nPhase 1/2 clinical study includes 19 current patients treated for up to 12 months, with four to six additional patients to be enrolled Retrospective study (POM-002) on the natural history of Pompe disease in up to 100 ERT-treated Pompe patients to help provide context for the ATB200-02 clinical study results Prospective observational study (POM-003) to assess safety and functional outcomes in patients currently treated with standard of care ERT, and to serve as a potential run-in for a registration study\nPompe manufacturing activities:\nFDA agreed on comparability between 250L scale and 1000L engineering batches, as well as the testing strategy for demonstrating comparability between 250L scale and 1000L GMP batches Initial GMP production runs of ATB200 drug substance completed at the 1,000 liter commercial scale\nAnticipated Upcoming Pompe Program Milestones:\nExpansion of ongoing ATB200-02 clinical study to include four to six additional ambulatory ERT-switch patients Final demonstration of comparability between 1,000L GMP material and 250L material and release for clinic of 1,000L GMP material Pompe regulatory pathway update (2Q18) Initiation of larger registration-directed study (2H18)\nConference Call and Webcast\nAmicus Therapeutics will host a conference call and audio webcast today, February 28, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss full year 2017 financial results and corporate updates.
