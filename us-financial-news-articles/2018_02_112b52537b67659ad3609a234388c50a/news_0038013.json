Australian pair Alex Pullin and Hughes also qualified from the first semi-final.\nEVERYTHING TO LOSE After more drama in the second semi-final, which saw Hernandez and American pair Nick Baumgartner and Mick Dierdorff advance, the stage was set for a mouth-watering finale.\nBaumgartner and Dierdorff were then involved in another collision, this time with Pullin, leaving the path free for Vaultier, who crossed the line ahead of Hughes and Hernandez to retain his title.\nSpeaking to Reuters after the final, Vaultier said it felt different crossing the line compared to how it had at Sochi four years ago.\n”It is not the same flavor,“ Vaultier said. ”I came into Sochi with outsider status and today I was the leader. It is really great to defend my title but it was way harder.\n“I didn’t have anything to lose in Sochi, today I had everything to lose and I won it.”\nVaultier also became emotional speaking about the fall in the semi-final that almost cost him a place in the final.\n“That was terrible, it was really insane. I thought now everything is finished,” he admitted. “It was a stroke of luck I could continue and qualify in third place.”\nThe 30-year-old added that he was unlikely to come back in four years to defend his title in Beijing.\n“I just don’t know if I can put my body through it,” he said. “It is hard to commit for another four years as I have family back home. It takes huge energy to work away from my family. I am happy if it all ends up like this.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:44:11.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
