The single currency was last up 0.10 percent at $1.2413.\n(In paragraph 2 of the story, ECB corrects Coeuré’s Quote: in transcript of RTÉ interview to say “our monetary policy” instead of “foreign monetary policy”)\nReporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:59:42.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
