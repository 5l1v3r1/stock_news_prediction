Earlier this month, the South American country’s telecoms regulator implemented a rule allowing companies to provide a so called “quadruple play” of mobile phone, land line, cable television and Internet services, which had previously been prohibited.\nThe change, previously announced by President Mauricio Macri, paved the way for a merger agreement between Telecom and cable TV provider Cablevision last year.\nTelecom said In a statement it would invest $1.3 billion in 2018. It added it would finance its investments through “various financial instruments available in the market,” without providing any further details.
