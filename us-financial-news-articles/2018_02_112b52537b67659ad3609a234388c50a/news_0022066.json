I think there’s a lot of things that need to change in Formula One,” he said of the sport’s owners Liberty Media. “Going after a younger audience is certainly something they need to do.”\nThe American said there might be an impact on race sponsors, who might have used uniformed models, but they could be easily compensated.\n“Let’s say it was a Heineken-sponsored grand prix, you’re not going to want to have a kid in Heineken (branded clothing),” he explained.\n”But I think the level of exposure that created can be replaced. So if I’m Heineken and I’ve just lost that moment of exposure, if I’m Formula One I’d go ‘fair enough, I’ll give you more signeage’.\n“I think that one’s easy to navigate from a sponsor standpoint.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:28:42.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
