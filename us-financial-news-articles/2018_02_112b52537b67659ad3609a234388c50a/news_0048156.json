More than 70 million guests have visited the park ever since it was launched in 2005, the company said.\nIn 2016, Hong Kong Disneyland said it would invest another $1.4 billion to expand the loss-making park.\nIron Man Experience, Disney Park’s first Marvel-themed ride which was launched in January last year, now serves as the most popular attraction at the resort, it said.\nThe Hong Kong-based resort faces stiff competition from other theme park operators such as Ocean Park, which has been vying for mainland Chinese visitors.\nHong Kong retail sales ended a three-year slump in 2017, rising 2.2 percent, underpinned by a rise in tourist arrivals from mainland China and upbeat property and share prices that boosted sentiment.\n$1 = 7.8225 Hong Kong dollars Reporting By Twinnie Siu and Anne Marie Roantree, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:21:21.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
