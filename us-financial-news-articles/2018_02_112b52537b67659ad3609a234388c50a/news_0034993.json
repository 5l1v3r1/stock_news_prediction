The consumer packaged-foods giant recently completed a multi-year cost-cutting under Brazilian investment group 3G Capital LLC t hat included shuttering some plants and imposing new, far more efficient methods to put together turkey and bologna slices. The WSJ’s Brian Baskin and Annie Gasparro write the plan has given the business the highest operating profit margin in its field, highlighted by a new Iowa plant that at full capacity will be able to churn out about 17% more sliced meat than the old factory, while employing 500 fewer people. Yet Kraft Heinz also now commands a smaller share of a shrinking market, hit by consumers’ desire for more natural foods. The company’s attention so far has been on efficient delivery of supply, but its success over the long term will come in its attention to meeting new market demands.\nOnline furniture pioneer Wayfair Inc. proved it can solve a logistics challenge, but doing it profitably is another matter. The company’s rapid growth has made it an icon in e-commerce logistics, with its in-house logistics network to manage delivery of bulky, heavy furniture to consumers helping the company pile up some $4.3 billion in sales in the past four quarters. The WSJ’s Elizabeth Winkler writes Wayfair’s marketing and logistics success isn’t translating into financial gains, however, and a growing competitive threat casts a cloud over its model of undercutting traditional players with faster and cheaper shipping . One study found Wayfair spends about $69 to acquire each new customer, but only gets $59 back from each acquisition. The weak brand loyalty may be tied to its lack of stores, which it must make up for with a big advertising budget, and that leaves the business vulnerable as online laggards get their web presence up to speed.\nA Trump administration plan to change the way infrastructure is paid for will have to build support from a skeptical audience. The White House released a long-awaited outline for a plan that would replace traditional federal programs with incentives aimed at pushing state and local governments to raise their own funds. The WSJ’s Ted Mann writes that Republicans leery of adding to the deficit may oppose the plan, and lawmakers who blocked his proposals for deep cuts in transportation grant programs last year may join the opposition. Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Haslam said Washington needs to replenish the Highway Trust Fund, which provides most federal transportation funding to the states. Several transportation groups are dubious about the plan. Waterways operators say it would hand them a tab for running inland navigations systems that far exceeds their trust fund. And American Trucking Associations’ chief Chris Spear says it falls short of the president’s campaign promise “to go big and bold.”\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES A warehouse at a Kraft Heinz Oscar Mayer plant in Davenport, Iowa, Photo: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal The federal government is paying more attention to pharmaceutical supply chains and that may raise concerns among some drug distributors. A new report from the White House Council of Economic Advisors says concentration among pharmacy benefit managers is one of the drivers of high drug prices, and the WSJ’s Charley Grant writes that the report argues there should be more concentration in the field just as companies are consolidating even more . The report says that the distributors and benefits managers in between manufacturers and consumers eat up 20% of the money spent on drugs in the U.S. Three behemoths— CVS Health , Express Scripts Holding , and UnitedHealth Group —control 66% of the market, helping them generate “outsize profits,” and CVS is looking to scale up with a $69 billion acquisition of Aetna . The latest White House budget recommends some steps aimed at lowering drug prices, but the CEA report suggests bigger efforts may be in the pipeline.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We look at pretty much any opportunity we have to drive efficiency. ’\n—Troy Shannan, Kraft Heinz’s head of North America supply chain.\nNumber of the Day 9% Year-over-year increase last year in the Prologis Inc. index of U.S. logistics site rents.\nIN OTHER NEWS The OPEC cartel revised upward its crude-supply forecast this year thanks to booming U.S. shale-oil production .
