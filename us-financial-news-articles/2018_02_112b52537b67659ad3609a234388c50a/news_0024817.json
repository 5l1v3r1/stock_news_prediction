Annuals deaths in the coal sector have fallen steadily from a peak of nearly 5,000 in 2003.\nStill, the number of accidents and deaths are too high, the safety agency said.\nThe office of work safety will also carry out inspections to shut so-called “zombie” mines and cut excess capacity at mines.\nChina aims to eliminate all coal mines with a capacity of less than 90,000 tonnes a year to reduce safety risks at coal mines. Some regions have said they plan to raise the threshold to 150,000 tonnes or more.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Tom Daly; Editing by Christian Schmollinger and Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-12T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:52:58.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
