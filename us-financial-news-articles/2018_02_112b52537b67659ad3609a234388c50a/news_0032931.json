This announcement is not an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any Old Bonds. The Offers were not made to holders of Old Bonds in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities, blue sky or other laws of such jurisdiction. In any jurisdiction in which the securities laws or blue sky laws required the Offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Offers were deemed to be made on behalf of PEMEX by the dealer managers for the Offers or one or more registered brokers or dealers that are licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.\nThe 2028 Notes and the 2048 Bonds are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\").

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the \"PRIIPs Regulation\") for offering or selling the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Bonds or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the 2028 Notes and the 2048 Bonds or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.\nThis communication and any other documents or materials relating to the Offers have not been approved by an authorized person for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the \"FSMA\").
