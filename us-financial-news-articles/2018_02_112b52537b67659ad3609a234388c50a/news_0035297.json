He whipped the puck to Hoffman, who one-timed the pass from the left circle by Lehner, getting his 16th goal while falling to his knee.\nMatt Duchene collected three assists and Craig Anderson made 23 saves as the Senators beat the Sabres for the second time in the past seven meetings.\nKarlsson added two assists for Ottawa.\nScott Wilson and Evan Rodrigues scored for the Sabres, who are 3-10 in overtime.\nLehner made 33 saves for Buffalo, which played its second game without Jack Eichel (high ankle sprain).\nBuffalo took a 1-0 lead 6:31 into the first period by capitalizing on a turnover by Mark Borowiecki, who coughed up the puck after being hit by Rasmus Ristolainen. The Sabres’ Johan Larsson gained possession from Thomas Chabot and left a drop pass for Wilson, who put a wrist shot by Anderson.\nOttawa tied the game 5:15 into the third when Duchene won a faceoff from Rodrigues in the offensive zone. Duchene fed Karlsson, whose long point shot was re-directed in by Gaborik’s stick from the right circle.\nRodrigues gave Buffalo a 2-1 lead by converting Kyle Okposo’s cross-ice pass off Anderson’s blocker after Casey Nelson pried the puck from Brassard.\nThe Senators tied the game after pulling Anderson as Gaborik made a backhand pass to Brassard, whose shot from the right circle went over Lehner’s pads.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:39:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
