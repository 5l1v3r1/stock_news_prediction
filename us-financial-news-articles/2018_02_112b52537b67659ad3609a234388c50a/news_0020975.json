Germany - usually a force for EU integration - had been largely absent from the debate for domestic reasons. \nThe news was not all bad, however, the report said. Economic growth and improved public opinion offered “more than a glimmer of hope” for the EU on the economic front. \nIn addition, Military cooperation on NATO’s eastern flank had progressed, and the alliance was now overhauling its military command structure. \nIt also lauded a decision by 25 EU member states to launch the Permanent Structure Cooperation (PESCO) to advance defence cooperation, as well as a decision by Germany and France to jointly develop a new generation of fighter jets. \n“The coming year will show whether attempts to compromise and ambitious reform proposals will translate into concrete actions and decisions to mend the cracks in the EU,” it said.
