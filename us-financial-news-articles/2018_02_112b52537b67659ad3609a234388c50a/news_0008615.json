They really pushed me, encouraged me to keep digging.” \nGreek Olympic gold medallist Katerina Stefanidi won a highly anticipated women’s pole vault that lost much of its lustre after American rival Sandi Morris pulled out due to back spasms. \nStefanidi, who is also the reigning world champion, claimed her 15th consecutive victory by clearing 4.71m on her second attempt. \nAmerican Katie Nageotte matched the Greek woman’s vault but lost out on countback after registering more failures at an earlier height. \nYoung Kenyan Emmanuel Korir sped to the year’s fastest 800m, cruising to victory in 1:44.21, and Scotland’s Chris O‘Hare posted the leading mile time of 2018 with a 3:54.14. \nAmericans Ronnie Baker and Devon Allen, and the Ivory Coast’s Murielle Ahoure also defeated quality fields. \nThe up-and-coming Baker eased to victory in the men’s 60m, running 6.48 seconds, more than a tenth of a second ahead of countryman Noah Lyles. \nJamaican Olympic hurdles champion Omar McLeod was fifth and countryman Asafa Powell, the former world 100m record holder, finished sixth. \nAllen ran down outdoor world record holder Aries Merritt to claim the men’s 60m hurdles in 7.50 seconds, 0.03 seconds faster than Merritt. \nAhoure, already the year’s fastest, put up another quality time to win the women’s 60m in 7.11 seconds, marginally ahead of American world 100m champion Tori Bowie (7.14).
