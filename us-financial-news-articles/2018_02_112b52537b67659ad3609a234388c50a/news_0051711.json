Ankura did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\nThe Gates Foundation and IFC did not immediately respond on Friday to a Reuters’ request to comment on the management changes at Abraaj. They previously declined to comment on the dispute.\nAbraaj, which did not refer to the dispute in its statement on Friday, said Omar Lodhi and Selcuk Yorgancioglu were appointed as co-chief executive officers of the fund management business, Abraaj Investment Management Limited (AIML). It also said they would take over with immediate effect from Naqvi.\n“This is a reorganisation that has been planned for a while and an orderly transition and succession planning,” Selcuk said in a separate statement to Reuters.\nAbraaj said in its statement it had commissioned a comprehensive review of its corporate structure with areas of focus to include governance and control functions. AIML will have an independent board of directors to which internal audit and compliance will directly report.\nA senior banker, who asked not to be named, said the move was a sign of how corporate governance and fiduciary separation was paramount in the eyes of global regulators whether a firm was small or big.\nNaqvi will focus on managing Abraaj Holdings and will retain a non-executive role as a member of the global investment committee of AIML, it said.\nAbraaj also said it had decided to pause investment activities temporarily, other than on transactions for which commitments are already final, until the re-organisation is complete.\nLodhi and Yorgancioglu have each been with the group for over 10 years and were partners for the group’s Asia and Turkey businesses respectively.\n“I have every faith that under their leadership, this dynamic firm will achieve even greater heights. The team has my full support and I look forward to contributing to the success of Abraaj going forward,” Naqvi said. (Additional reporting by Ebru Tuncay.
