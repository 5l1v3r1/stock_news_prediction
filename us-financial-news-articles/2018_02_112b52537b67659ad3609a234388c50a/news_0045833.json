You might be able to find a job but it’s unlikely that it provides a reliable income, benefits, vacation days, or sick leave,” Hughes told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nHughes believes a tax on people earning above $250,000 - along with other adjustments to the tax code - could provide the money necessary to benefit an estimated 90 million people.\nThe best working model of a guaranteed income is Alaska, where since 1976, oil revenues have funded an endowment on behalf of the state’s residents, said Hughes.\nEach resident receives an annual dividend check, which last year amounted to $1,100, paid out to nearly 740,000 people.\n“It’s a small amount of money, but critical in the lives of people who receive it,” Hughes, who grew up in a working-class family before receiving a scholarship that sent him to an elite boarding school and ultimately Harvard, said via Skype from New York.\nDuring a visit to Alaska last September he discovered most Alaskans saved the annual amount for longer-term investments like a child’s future university education.\nA small-scale experiment is already underway in Stockton, California, a city where one in four residents live in poverty.\nThe Economic Security Project, a network Hughes co-chairs, provided $1.2 million to fund the city’s effort to distribute $500 per month for the next 18 months to a few dozen families.\nHughes hopes experiments like these will create support for his idea, based on an amount that is designed to be high enough to help working people, but not so high as to discourage work.\nReporting by Gregory Scruggs.
