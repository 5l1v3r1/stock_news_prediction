The revised rules allow cash settlement, wherein the net cash flows are settled within the counterparties.\nKen Cheung, senior Asian FX strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong said the move suggested market participants would no longer need to buy the full amount of Chinese currency for settlement at maturity but have flexibility to pay the net basis and roll over the forwards.\nAlso in Tuesday’s statement, the SAFE reported that foreign exchange transactions in the domestic market totaled the equivalent of $24 trillion in 2017.
