However, it is likely to face opposition from small countries that fear becoming less attractive to multinational firms.\nThe document says the tax should be applied to companies with revenues above 750 million euros ($922 million) worldwide and with EU digital revenues of at least 10 million euros a year.\nThe proposal is subject to changes before its publication which is expected in the second half of March. Some of the key figures on rates and thresholds are in brackets, showing that work is still ongoing to define the final numbers.\nFirms selling user-targeted online ads, such as Google, or providing advertisement space on the internet, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, would be subject to the tax, the document said, citing these companies.\nDigital marketplaces such as Amazon and gig economy giants such as Airbnb and Uber also fall under the scope of the draft proposal, the Commission said.\nOnline media, streaming services like Netflix , online gaming, cloud computing or IT services would instead be exempt from the tax.\nThe levy would be raised in the EU countries where users are located, rather than where companies are headquartered, reducing the appeal of smaller low-tax states.\n\"This would entail additional reporting requirements so that the tax authorities of member states can calculate how much tax is due in their jurisdiction,\" the document said.\nIn the case of online advertisers, the tax should be levied \"where the advertisement is displayed\" and \"where the users having supplied the data which is being sold are located.\"\nFor online shopping, the tax would be collected in countries \"where the user paying for being able to access the platform (or to conclude a transaction within the platform) is located,\" the document said.\nThe levy would be calculated on the \"aggregated gross revenues\" of a business and should have a single EU rate \"in the region of 1-5 percent.\" It would be possible to deduct this tax as a cost from national corporate taxes.\nThe tax would be a temporary measure that would be applied only until a more comprehensive solution to fair digital taxation is approved, the Commission said.\nThe long-term solution would entail the adoption of new rules on a \"digital permanent establishment\".\nThe proposal, once finalized, would need the approval of all EU states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T21:04:25.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
