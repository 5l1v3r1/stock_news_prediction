Excluding the benefit from a new U.S. tax law, it earned 64 cents a share in the quarter. \nDunkin’ Brands expects its 2018 effective tax rate to be about 28 percent, against 38.5 percent in 2017, Chief Executive Nigel Travis said on a conference call with analysts. \nTotal sales climbed 5.3 percent to $227.1 million in the quarter, on higher franchise fees and the first gain in same-store sales by all four Dunkin’ Brands business segments in nearly three years. \nAnalysts, on average, had expected quarterly earnings of 63 cents a share on revenue of $220.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nSame-store sales at U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants, which account for roughly 70 percent of overall revenue, rose 0.8 percent, matching analysts’ estimate. \nMcDonald’s last week reported a 4.5 percent rise in U.S. sales at established restaurants and has ramped up pressure on rivals with the launch of its $1, $2, $3 value menu, which includes breakfast items, in early January. [L4N1PP4SA] \nDunkin’ Donuts had a 2 for $5 breakfast sandwich promotion in the fourth quarter and a $2 food and drink promotion in January. \nThe chain, like Starbucks, has struggled to lure more customers in the afternoon, which some analysts attribute to McDonald’s more aggressive pricing.
