Most other euro zone bond yields were up 1-2 bps.\nThis after 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to a high of 2.86 percent overnight.\nItalian, Spanish and Portuguese government bonds underperformed, their yields rising 2-3 basis points, but only after having fallen sharply the day before.\nAll three are still trading close to their tightest levels over Germany in months, and in some cases, years. Having a pro-European, pro-spending party at the heart of German government is seen as positive for these southern European countries.\nA string of rate setters are expected to speak later on Thursday, including the ECB’s Francois Villeroy de Galhau and Peter Praet and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Robert S Kaplan and Patrick Harker.\nEarlier, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said on Thursday the euro’s strength and the recent stock market rout do not justify any substantial extension of the European Central Bank’s bond purchase scheme.\n“The key questions are how good is the economy, will wages pick up and what does all of this mean for central bank policy,” said Lenz of DZ Bank.\nIn addition, the Bank of England is set to make a rates decision at 1200 GMT. Analysts expect the bank to keep rates on hold given the economic uncertainty that hangs over the UK, but it could telegraph a hike as early as May.
