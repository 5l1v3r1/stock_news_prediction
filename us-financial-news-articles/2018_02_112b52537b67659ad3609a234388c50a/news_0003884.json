The index fell 3.2 percent in January.\nThe dollar edged up 0.2 percent to 109.36 yen, edging away from a four-month low of 108.280 plumbed on Friday.\nIt had lost 3.1 percent against the yen in January, weighed by a bevy of factors including concerns about U.S. trade protectionism and lingering speculation the Bank of Japan was gearing up to begin an exit from its easy monetary policy.\n“Dollar/yen is still in a consolidation phase,” said Tareck Horchani, head of Asia-Pacific sales trading for Saxo Markets in Singapore, adding that the dollar’s bounce was still looking tepid.\nDemand for cross/yen pairs, such as the Canadian dollar against the yen, is helping to weigh on the yen and supporting the U.S. dollar, Horchani said.\nSome traders are trying to put bullish bets on the Canadian dollar against the yen, after data on Wednesday showed strong growth in Canada’s economy in November, he added.\n“The demand (for Canadian dollar) has been quite strong, even in the options market,” Horchani said.\nThe Canadian dollar held steady at C$1.2312 per U.S. dollar, having set a four-month high of C$1.2250 on Wednesday.\nThe euro last changed hands at $1.2417, having pulled away from a high of $1.2475 touched the previous day.\nThe common currency rose 3.5 percent in January, during which it scaled a three-year peak above $1.25, amid prospects for the European Central Bank to begin normalising monetary policy this year.\nThat prospect got a boost earlier on Wednesday after last month’s underlying euro zone inflation picked up pace.\nThe pound rose 0.1 percent to $1.4200 after surging 5 percent against the dollar in January.
