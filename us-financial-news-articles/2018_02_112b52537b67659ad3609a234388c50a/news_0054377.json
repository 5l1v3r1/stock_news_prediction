He came off the bench for the first time this season, checking in as the game’s first substitute.\nTyus Battle’s 12 points and Frank Howard’s 11 points paced Syracuse (18-11, 7-9), which had three of its six 3-point baskets in the final three minutes.\nThe Orange were in desperate need of a quality victory following a four-point home loss Wednesday night to No. 10 North Carolina.\nThe teams combined for 24 consecutive missed 3-pointers before Oshae Brissett’s long ball to pull the Orange within 29-21.\nDuke didn’t score for almost 4½ minutes to begin the second half, but Syracuse had only two points during that stretch.\nCarter’s dunk on a fast break pushed the lead to 41-30 with 8:37 left.\nSyracuse center Paschal Chukwu fouled out with 6:45 remaining. He scored all six of his points in the first half, though he ended up with 12 rebounds.\nBagley had 14 points by halftime, helping the Blue Devils to a 27-16 advantage. There was little flow for either team.\nDuke, the ACC’s top-scoring team, shot 31 percent in the first half, but that was better than the 27.6 percent for the Orange, who also committed nine turnovers.\nThe teams combined to shoot 0-for-20 on first-half 3-point attempts, both sides going 0-for-10.\nDuke was 9-for-10 on free throws, while Syracuse didn’t have an attempt. The Orange were in the bonus in the second half with 9:49 remaining.\nDuke broke out to an 18-8 lead, with Syracuse not cracking double figures until 13½ minutes had passed.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T09:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:58:28.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
