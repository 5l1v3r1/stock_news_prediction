One of the sources said GM has also asked employees to curb use of corporate cards.\nA GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, while a union spokeswoman said it has not officially received the proposal.\nTEMPORARY RELIEF Meanwhile, GM on Friday dropped a request to use its South Korean factory in Bupyeong as collateral for debt, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\nAt around 5 percent interest, GM headquarters in Detroit has lent its South Korean unit nearly 3 trillion won, out of which 700 billion won comes due at the end of this month.\nAt a board meeting of its South Korean unit, GM also agreed to grant temporary relief in repaying the 700 billion won debt until the government completes its due diligence of the unit, the person with direct knowledge of the matter said.\nSouth Korea said on Thursday it plans to quickly conduct due diligence on GM’s S.Korean operations and would discuss whether the government would provide financial support to the company.\nThis came after GM agreed to play “a responsible role” in normalising its South Korean operations while other stakeholders also “share the pain.”\n“GM told board members that there is progress with its talks with the government, but little progress with talks with its labour union, which is a problem,” said the person with direct knowledge of the matter.\nGM has been seeking concessions from the South Korean union, and government support to engineer a turnaround.\nSouth Korea was once a major export base for GM, but saw slumping sales in recent years as GM scrapped its Chevy brand in Europe.\nThe ruling party on Friday urged GM to come up with a “viable, long-term turnaround plan” for its South Korean operations.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Bill Tarrant\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T05:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:20:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
