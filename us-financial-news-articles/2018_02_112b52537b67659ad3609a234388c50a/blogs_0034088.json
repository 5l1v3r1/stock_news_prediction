Turkey’s state-owned oil company also plans to search for oil and gas off Cyprus, ethnically partitioned between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.\nSTANDOFF Saipem is contracted by Italy’s state-controlled Eni, whose officials have confirmed the ship was stopped by Turkish ships on Friday afternoon because of a military exercise in the area.\nOn Tuesday, Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano told his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, that he wanted a solution to the standoff “that is in line with international law”, a statement from Italy’s Foreign Ministry said.\nThe two men spoke at an anti-Islamic State coalition meeting in Kuwait and agreed “to preserve the necessary climate of trust for possible further projects in the energy sector,” the statement said.\nCyprus has seemed keen to downplay the standoff, which appears to be the worst escalation of simmering tensions since the island struck a small quantity of natural gas in 2011.\n“There is no cause for anyone to be concerned. This is being handled in a manner to avert any possible crisis which could create problems either to the economy or to the state,” President Anastasiades told reporters in Nicosia.\nThe European Union on Monday called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighborly” ties.\nEni and France’s Total, partners in a Cyprus venture, announced last week finding a promising gas field off Cyprus. They said the find looked geologically similar to the Zohr field off Egypt, which holds an estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, the largest field ever found in the Mediterranean.\nCyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Peace talks collapsed last year.\nReporting by Ercan Gurses and Daren Butler, and Michele Kambas in Nicosia, additional reporting by Steve Scherer in Rome,; Writing by Ezgi Erkoyun; Editing by Dominic Evans, Larry King, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:35:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
