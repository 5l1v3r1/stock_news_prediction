It’s hard to explain how that feels but that’s how life goes.\n“It’s a really big bummer but I will learn.”\nShiffrin’s failure to medal in the event in which she is the World Cup leader and was the 2014 Sochi winner, came as a surprise even to her competitors.\n“When I went to the finish I thought, Mikaela must be in front but then I saw Frida cheering,” silver medallist Holdener said.\n“So there have been a lot of surprises today. But Mikaela skis that good and she will do it another time.”\nShiffrin, who won the giant slalom gold on Thursday, will now get a day to recuperate as she had already decided not to compete in Saturday’s super-G.
