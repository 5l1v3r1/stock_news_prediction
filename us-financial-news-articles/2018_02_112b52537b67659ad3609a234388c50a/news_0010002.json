REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson “The point of those meetings is to portray Canada as a good place to invest ... and to explore opportunities related to job growth with those prominent business leaders who may be interested in expanding their operations in Canada,” said spokesman Cameron Ahmad.\nAhmad declined to comment specifically on the meeting with Bezos.\nAmazon’s decision on where to locate its second headquarters is expected this year. The tech giant has promised to invest $5 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the city it chooses. The 19 U.S. cities on the list include Chicago, Boston and New York.\nTrudeau’s trip also comes as Canada and Mexico strive to address U.S. demands for NAFTA reform, with the fate of the trade pact uncertain. Last week, Trudeau reiterated a tough stance, saying Canada could walk away if he was not happy with talks to modernize the agreement.\nTrudeau is due to give a speech in Chicago on Wednesday to sell the merits of bilateral trade.\nReporting by Leah Schnurr and David Ljunggren; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T19:08:16.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
