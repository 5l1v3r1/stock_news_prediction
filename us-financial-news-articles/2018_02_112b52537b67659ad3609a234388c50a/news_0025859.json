At 10 am, we will make the decision whether to race. If it makes sense we can delay, and if not we can cancel.” \nThe race is scheduled to get underway at 11 am local time (0200 GMT) and organizers might take some comfort from the fact that Saturday’s training run proceeded smoothly in clement conditions despite high winds having been forecast. \nWaldner has already said that if the race cannot be run it will be moved to Monday, weather permitting. \nDisruption to the Alpinr skiing at the Winter Olympics is not unusual and it is a rare Games where some re-jigging of the schedule is not necessary. \nHannes Reichelt will go first when the race does get underway with his fellow Austrian Matthias Mayer, the defending champion, set to go out third. \nSwiss world champion Beat Feuz will be the seventh skier to go down the course ahead of Aksel Lund Svindal in ninth and the other main Norwegian contender Kjetil Jansrud (17th).
