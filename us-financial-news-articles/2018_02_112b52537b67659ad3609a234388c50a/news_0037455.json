In 2014 then FBI Director James Comey said Chinese hacking likely cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars every year.\nChina has strongly denied all U.S. accusations of hacking attacks.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T07:50:41.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
