The rise of VCs also raises concerns about the relevance of some non-dollar currencies.\nBitcoin, along with Ripple, Litecoin and Ether among others, are not issued or backed by a central bank and exchanges where consumers can trade them are not regulated under EU law.\nThe EU regulators said that any losses from an exchange going bust or money stolen from a VC account due to cyber attacks would not be covered by national protection schemes.\nReporting by Huw Jones; Editing by David Goodman and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T16:16:04.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
