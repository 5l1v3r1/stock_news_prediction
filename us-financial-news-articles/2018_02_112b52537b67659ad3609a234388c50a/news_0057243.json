One order told regulators that any new rule would require the elimination of two old rules , while another called on the Treasury and Congress to roll back the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.\nHowever, those early announcements have yielded modest impact in the realm of financial regulation. The most ambitious effort to revoke and replace the Dodd-Frank law— Rep. Jeb Hensarling’s (R., Texas) Financial Choice Act —passed the House in June but failed to clear the Senate.\nThe SEC has signaled more gradual action aimed at streamlining regulations for the coming year.\n“Modernizing the rules without in any way taking away investor protection is the best thing that we can do,” Mr. Clayton told CFO Journal on the sidelines of the Practicing Law Institute’s “SEC Speaks” conference in Washington on Friday. The agency is looking at all rules to see what could be pruned back, the SEC chairman said.\nIn making changes, the SEC is limited by its mission to enforce securities law and protect investors, current and former SEC commissioners say.\nMoreover, only Congress can revoke statutes such as Dodd-Frank and the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate governance law, which many business groups say raise the cost of compliance.\nStill, the SEC has some flexibility around its interpretation of statutes and the rules the agency writes and enforces under the law. That has allowed Mr. Clayton and his newly installed team to give companies limited relief and reduce friction in select areas, particularly surrounding access to capital markets.\nSuch efforts include allowing all companies to secretly file initial public offering paperwork . The SEC also allowed companies to exclude financial information from draft registration statements if they reasonably expect it would be stale by the time the securities become public. This eliminated the need to prepare financials that would never be seen by the public.\nThe agency also gave companies relief through guidance, including for how to implement the new executive-pay-ratio rule. The new guidelines allow companies to determine their own method for calculating the ratio, rather than prescribing a standard approach.\n“The fact that there has been any sort of deregulation or burden easing is remarkable, given what we’d suffered the prior eight years,” said Daniel Gallagher, a Republican former SEC commissioner.\nThe SEC is considering a proposal to raise the cap on the definition of a smaller reporting company to those with a float of less than $250 million, up from $75 million currently. Such a move would reduce disclosure requirements and compliance costs for those companies.\nThe regulator also plans to revisit rules that require issuers of guaranteed securities to provide details about the guarantor in their financial statements. It will also review rules around the disclosures an acquirer is expected to provide about a target and update guidance for risk-factor disclosures.\nWhile those efforts began under the previous administration, “they’re not done and they need to get done,” said Hester Peirce, a Republican SEC commissioner , speaking on the sidelines of the conference.\nMr. Clayton’s tenure at the agency is more likely to be marked by a reticence to make new rules, rather than a dramatic rollback of existing ones, said Harvey Pitt, a Republican former SEC chairman.\n“The start of deregulation is not overloading things with new regulation,” Mr. Pitt said. He pointed to the SEC’s approach to regulating cryptocurrencies as one example.\nThe skyrocketing popularity of bitcoin and other tokens among main street investors, alongside concerns about fraud, have prompted calls for the SEC to make new rules to govern the nascent market.\nMr. Clayton has instead suggested that initial coin offerings have many of the hallmarks of securities , and thus would fall under the SEC’s existing rules.\n“They’re just not going to be making new rules,” said Roel Campos, a Democratic former SEC commissioner. “They will be looking very carefully at scrutinizing whether new regulations, new rules are required and whether they can do with less, and whether they can do with more guidance.”\nThe SEC also could sidestep another issue: whether to allow companies to include a mandatory arbitration clause in their registration documents. The move would eliminate investor class-action lawsuits. “It’s not part of our agenda,” Mr. Clayton said when asked about the issue on a panel at the PLI conference.\nHowever, the issue could still come up if, as part of its registration process, a company seeks the agency’s approval to include the clause.\nWrite to Tatyana Shumsky at tatyana.shumsky@wsj.com", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-172"], "published": "2018-02-26T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T13:50:09.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
