Additionally, they are in the final design stages for their new factory campus and are ready to break ground as soon as permits are obtained.\nMr. Sprovieri stated, “We have been prepared to move on this construction as quickly as possible once we were in possession of the land. We re-organized our finances back in December to put us in a much better position going forward. We now have funding to not only complete this plant here in Washington, but to commence advance preparations for another plant in the Southwest to supply that market and assist with supply to California, which will also be supplied by this WA plant.”\nASCK has been regularly approached by considerable interests from all around the country looking for housing that is considered affordable but is highly thermally efficient, won’t burn and being concrete based is very strong in hurricane strength conditions. Management is very pleased that they can now accept orders from contractors and developers, some having tracts of land requiring construction of hundreds of affordable homes.\nAdded Mr. Sprovieri, “We should have our first production building ready in about 4 months and the specialized equipment being manufactured now will be arriving about then. It will take another month or so to install the equipment and we should produce product from then on. We expect to build around 35 homes by the end of the year and would expect revenues of around $5 million for the 2018 year end.”\nAbout Auscrete Corporation\nAuscrete Corporation (OTC:ASCK) is a building products manufacturer and constructer of “GREEN” energy efficient housing and commercial structures built from Auscrete developed lightweight hybrid concrete/insulation wall and roof panels.
