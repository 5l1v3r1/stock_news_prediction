If they are ready to deploy the remote monitor technology by April, it would be the first time they could test their cars on public roads in the state without physical drivers present.\nThe remote control technology, already used by NASA and the military, is seen as a way to more quickly usher in the commercial roll out of self-driving cars. The new regulations are expected to be approved later this month, and take effect in April after a month-long public notice period.\nCompanies like Nissan, Waymo and startups Zoox, Phantom Auto and Starsky Robotics have been working on the technology, which allows for a remote operator to take control of a vehicle if the underlying autonomous system inside the car encounters problems, known in the industry as difficult-to-solve \"edge\" cases.\n\"We think we have the ultimate backup system — which is a human,\" said Elliot Katz, co-founder of Phantom Auto, which last month at the CES technology conference demonstrated how cars driving in Las Vegas could be remotely controlled from Mountain View, California, over 500 miles away.\nThe presence of a remote operator also helps companies reassure lawmakers and the public, said Katz, who said he expected companies to deploy such technology on California roads soon after April.\nGetting rid entirely of drivers capable of taking the wheel in case of problems has concerned some lawmakers. U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut have questioned the safeguards in an autonomous vehicle bill currently stalled in the Senate.\nDuring a January Senate hearing, Zoox Chief Executive Officer Tim Kentley-Klay testified that \"teleoperations\" technology would play a role in the overall system of the Silicon Valley start-up.\n\"When your model is to have autonomous vehicles deployed as a for-hire service in cities, you are still going to need a command center in that city that has a human-in-the-loop oversight of the fleet, both to deal with vehicles if they have an issue but also to deal with customers if they need help,\" Kentley-Klay said.\nThe new regulations are expected to be approved on February 26 by California's legal compliance agency, with the DMV then opening a 30-day public notice period beginning March 1.\nDuring that period, companies planning to test would prepare their applications, with the first permits potentially being issued on April 2, DMV spokeswoman Jessica Gonzalez told Reuters.\n\"It will be interesting to see which manufacturer is the first,\" she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T20:55:18.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
