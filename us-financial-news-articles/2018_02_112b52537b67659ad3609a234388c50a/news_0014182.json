Despite our efforts and if there is a strong wind, the event can be delayed but the decision won’t be made by me, it will be made by IOC and the federation.”\nLee said a special bag with hot packs, seatwarmers, a blanket, a hat and a windbreaker would be distributed to spectators in an effort to keep them warm at the start of what could turn out to be the coldest winter Olympics in decades.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T08:41:50.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
