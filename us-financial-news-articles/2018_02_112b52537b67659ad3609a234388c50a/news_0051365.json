Sullivan told reporters.\nThe European Union, which believes training local forces will allow it to avoid risking the lives of its own combat troops, doubled its contribution to 116 million euros.\nThe pledges should allow the force, which has had difficulty raising funds, to be fully operational this year.\nAs violence has spiked, concerns have grown that the region could be a springboard for attacks on the West.\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini urged donors to provide the funds quickly, while African leaders said the money pledged so far would only cover the first year of operations.\nPresident Emmanuel Macron of France, the region’s former colonial power with 4,000 troops in the region, said it would continue its own offensive alongside the G5 Sahel force.\nGROWING THREAT Islamist militants took over northern Mali in 2012 before French forces pushed them back in 2013, alerting Washington and others to the growing threat in the region.\nThe United States, the largest donor in Mali, has 800 troops in Niger, where four U.S. soldiers died in October, but global awareness of the vast desert region’s importance for security remains low.\n(First row L-R) Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Cyprus' President Nicos Anastasiades take part in a group photo during a High Level Conference on the Sahel in Brussels, Belgium February 23, 2018.

We have to start in Mali, Niger, Chad. All of Europe is involved,” she said, standing with Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni.\nThe G5 Sahel operation, whose command center is in central Mali, is to swell to 5,000 personnel and will also carry out humanitarian and development work.\nSlideshow (13 Images) About 350,000 people traveled through Niger alone in 2017, mostly hoping to reach Europe but some trying to return home, according to the Red Cross.\n“MIGRATE OR DIE”\nNiger’s President Mahamadou Issoufou said many young people in the Sahel felt they had only two options: to die in the Mediterranean trying to reach Europe or to die at the hands of militants.\n“We have to act resolutely to change the face of the Sahel region or risk seeing this region of the world fall irreversibly into chaos and violence,” he told the conference, after asking leaders and ministers to stand for a moment of silence for two French soldiers killed this week in Mali.\nIssoufou said the force would need around 115 million euros a year, and urged the West to take the fight against militants as seriously as it has taken the threat in Iraq and Syria.\nPledges have also come from the United States, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, among others.\nFrance is set to spend 1.2 billion euros on development in the region over the next five years, a 40 percent increase over current levels, while other countries are expected to provide more aid for farmers, schools and water projects.\nThe European Union is investing 8 billion euros in development aid in the region, according to EU data.\n($1 = 0.8132 euros)\n Robert-Jan Bartunek and Jean-Baptiste Vey; ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T08:21:05.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
