Received $19.8 million in repayments and net proceeds from portfolio companies resulting in net originations of $37.1 million. Financing Activity: Sold 471,498 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average price of $9.69 per share through our at-the-market program for gross proceeds of $4.6 million. Recurring Distributions and Dividends: For each of October, November, and December 2017, paid monthly distributions to common stockholders of $0.07 per share. For October 2017, we paid a monthly dividend to holders of the Company’s 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock of $0.141667 per share (which included the pro-rated period from and including the issuance date of September 27, 2017 through the full month of October). For each of November and December 2017, we paid a monthly dividend to holders of the Company’s 6.00% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock of $0.125 per share.\nFirst Fiscal Quarter 2018 Results :\nInterest income increased by $0.4 million, or 4.4%, due to an increase in the average investment portfolio balance and an increase in the weighted average yield quarter over quarter. This increase was offset by a decrease in other income of $0.4 million, or 69.1%, while total investment income was largely unchanged from the prior quarter. Total expenses decreased 1.2% quarter over quarter as the decrease in dividend expenses associated with the recently issued 6.0% Series 2024 Term Preferred Stock more than offset the increase in interest expense on our line of credit.\nNet Investment Income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million, or $0.21 per share, an increase of 1.7% as compared to the prior quarter.\nThe Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was $7.2 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $5.4 million, or $0.21 per share, respectively. The quarter over quarter increase was driven primarily by the $1.3 million realized loss recognized in the prior quarter in connection with the voluntary redemption of our Series 2021 Term Preferred Stock and a small increase in the net portfolio appreciation in the December 31, 2017 quarter.\nSubsequent Events: Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the following significant events occurred:\nPortfolio Activity: In January 2018, we invested $8.1 million in a secured first lien loan to XMedius Solutions Inc.\nDistributions and Dividends Declared: In January 2018, our Board of Directors declared the following monthly distributions to common stockholders and monthly dividends to preferred shareholders:\nRecord Date Payment Date Distribution per\nCommon Share Distribution per\nSeries 2024 Term\nPreferred Share January 22, 2018 January 31, 2018 $ 0.07 $ 0.125 February 16, 2018 February 28, 2018 0.07 0.125 March 20, 2018 March 30, 2018 0.07 0.125 Total for the Quarter $ 0.21 $ 0.375 Comments from Gladstone Capital’s President, Bob Marcotte: “We closed our fiscal 2018 first quarter on a very positive note as our results improved due to a combination of strong asset growth, sustained investment yields, and lower average financing costs. These factors combined to lift our net interest margin by 7.1%, compared to the prior quarter, and 24.2%, compared to the December 31, 2016 quarter, and should position us well to continue to improve on our results as the balance of our FY2018 unfolds.”\nConference Call for Stockholders: The Company will hold its earnings release conference call on Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. EST.
