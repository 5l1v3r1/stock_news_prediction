Net fee and commission income also rose.\nOverall, net profit fell by 42 percent in the fourth quarter to 399 million euros ($489.9 million), but was above the 364 million expected in a Reuters poll of nine analysts.\nFor 2017 as a whole, the net result was 6 percent higher than in 2016.\nKBC said it would pay a dividend of 3 euros per share for the 2017 financial year, including 1 euro already paid out in November. This was in line with market expectations.
