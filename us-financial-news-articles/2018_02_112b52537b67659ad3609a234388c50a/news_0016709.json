He actively supports recognized clients to whom he brings an acute understanding of the increasing challenges of the business in terms of financial environment, regulation and compliance. He mostly invest in Medtech and Energy.\nHe also participated as a seeder and advisor in the creation and success of high-technology start-ups in Israel and France.\nHe is an active member of the Harvard Business Angels committee in the United Kingdom.\nJean-Yves Burel, Chairman of the Theraclion board comments: “I am glad to get Renaud Saleur joining our board. He brings to our company great financial and financing competencies.

Having been a Director of Fidelity France, Fidelity Services UK, Anaconda, Radstock and SAMCO, Renaud has a long experience in board participation. Besides his technical skills, he is also an experienced leader who pays quality attention to people management and development.”\nRenaud Saleur adds: “I feel honored to join the very professional Theraclion’s board of directors. For the last 30 years, I have invested in several Medtech companies, but Theraclion is the first one within my portfolio which has developed such a disruptive solution: non-invasive and ambulatory treatments are growing demands from patients, service providers and payers. Theraclion’s platform meets these requirements. Now that excellent clinical results have been achieved on benign tumors, I am confident the encouraging trials on veins and immuno-stimulation will open new opportunities on the large vascular and oncology markets. Theraclion has a lot to win in opening its capital to the Anglo-Saxon world and I will do my best to leverage my network there.”\nAbout Theraclion\nTheraclion is a French company specializing in high-tech medical equipment using therapeutic ultrasound.
