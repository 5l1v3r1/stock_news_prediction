The report was published ahead of the more comprehensive report from the U.S. Labor Department on Friday.\nAt 2:56 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.38 points, or 0.07 percent, to 26,094.27, the S&P 500 lost 5.09 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,817.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 6.86 points, or 0.09 percent, to 7,395.62.\nStocks had been higher earlier Wednesday, lifted by a surge in Boeing which forecast better-than-expected full-year profits and said it expects to deliver a record number of commercial aircraft in 2018, sending its shares up 4.6 percent.\nThe aerospace giant was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow, helping pull the blue-chip index out of its biggest two-day plunge since September 2016.\nThe selloff earlier in the week had been prompted by an increase in U.S. Treasury yields to multi-year highs on expectations that world central banks will ease away from stimulus.\nAmong the S&P 500’s 11 major sectors, technology gave the biggest boost to the index as investors look to Facebook and Microsoft earnings, due after markets close.\nHealthcare stocks continued to weigh on the three major U.S. indexes following a report on Tuesday that Amazon.com, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase were joining forces to cut healthcare costs for its U.S. employees. The S&P 500 healthcare index was down 1.6 percent.\nAnalysts expect fourth-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 13.7 percent, up from 12 percent expected at the start of the month. So far, 37 percent of companies in the index have reported and 80.5 percent of them have come in above consensus estimates.\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\nThe S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 79 new highs and 45 new lows.
