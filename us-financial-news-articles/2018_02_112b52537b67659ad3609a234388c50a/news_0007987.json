The Philippines acquired those from the United States. \nDefence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana signed the negotiated government contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation, which was licensed to sell the American military aircraft. \nIt was the second time the Philippines has acquired Bell helicopters. In 2014, it bought eight lower variant of the aircraft for 4.8 billion pesos. \nThe Philippines is spending 125 billion pesos for the next five years to modernise its armed forces, but putting priority on equipment and armaments for internal security operations to defeat domestic threats as well protect its maritime borders. \nIt is also acquiring three frigates from South Korea, air defence radars from Israel, armoured vehicles, a long-range patrol aircraft and assault rifles and grenade launchers from Russia. \n($1 = 51.4230 Philippine pesos)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:22:47.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
