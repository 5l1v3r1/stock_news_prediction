Slideshow (13 Images) \nAguero took over in the second half, scoring four times to take his tally to 21 Premier League goals. \nIn the process he joined Harry Kane, Thierry Henry and Alan Shearer as the fourth player to score more than 20 goals in four successive Premier League seasons. \nRiyad Mahrez returned to the Leicester side after his proposed January transfer to City failed to materialise but the Algerian had little chance to make an impact after he was introduced as a second-half substitute. \n“My advice for the players is not to think how many games are left, just to look to the next one,” Guardiola, whose City side have 72 points from 27 games, added. \n“Every time we dropped points this season, the next game we won, which is so important. Keeping that consistency is so important for us. If we are able to win the title it will be something special for us.” Reporting by Tom Hayward, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T23:38:48.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
