The company posted operating income of 8,511 million Yen (or US $75 million) and net income attributable to owners of the parent of 5,175 million Yen (or US $45 million) for the quarter.\nFor 2017, Trend Micro posted consolidated net sales of 148,811 million Yen (or US $1,326 million, 112.22 JPY=1USD). The company also reported operating income of 36,441 million Yen (or US $324 million) and net income attributable to owners of the parent of 25,691 million Yen (or US $228 million).\nBased on information currently available to the company, consolidated net sales for the year ending December 31, 2018 is expected to be 164,800 million Yen (or US $1,484 million, based on an exchange rate of 111 JPY = 1 USD). Operating income and net income are expected to be 40,700 million Yen (or US $366 million) and 28,400 million Yen (or US $255 million), respectively.\nGrowth rate figures are calculated from Japanese Yen results.
