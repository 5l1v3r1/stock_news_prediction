Some of the overseas equity holdings are now worth less in sterling terms,” he added. \nRPC shares fell 4.7 percent after its third-quarter results. \nBuilding products distributor SIG fell 3.9 percent after it said its 2016 profit was overstated. \n“This overstatement of profit follows the recently announced overstatement of cash and trade payables in the same division, further raising concerns on the control environment in SIG Distribution,” said Stifel analysts. \nAmong small-caps, RPS tumbled 12.4 percent after a trading update.
