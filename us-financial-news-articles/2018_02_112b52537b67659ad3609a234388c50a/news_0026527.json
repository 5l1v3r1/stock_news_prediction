The coalition agreement has been criticized by some conservatives who feel the next government will have an SPD-stamped agenda.\nThe SPD’s 464,000 members have to ratify the four-year government program in a postal ballot. The results will be announced on March 4.\nMerkel said that if they rejected the deal, Germany would probably hold a new election.\nShe rejected a suggestion that generous concessions to the SPD had weakened her position in the CDU, saying she had decided to cut a deal for the sake of Germany.\nShe sought to allay fears among conservatives that by ceding the finance ministry, the next government will stray from the strict fiscal discipline enforced by former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble.\n“It was a very conscious decision at one point (during negotiations) to say ‘yes’ this works, even though I know and I myself felt it was painful,” Merkel said.\n“I want to say that the we (the conservatives) have also approved the policies (in the agreement) and the finance minister cannot simply do as he likes.”\nSome conservatives are unhappy with her decision to allow the SPD to spend a record budget surplus and to embrace their demands for European reform.\nThe SPD have criticized Schaeuble’s “forced austerity” on southern European countries like Greece and had vowed in the election campaign to boost investment.\nSocial Democrat Olaf Scholz, who is expected to become finance minister, said on Saturday Germany should not dictate economic policies to its euro zone partners and that mistakes had been made in the past.\nHe said the SPD were also for sound finances and would preserve Schaeuble’s balanced budget policy.\nReporting by Joseph Nasr; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T19:26:48.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
