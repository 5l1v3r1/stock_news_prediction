(the \"Company\" or \"Check-Cap\") (NASDAQ: CHEK, CHEKW), a clinical-stage medical diagnostics company engaged in the development of C-Scan®, an ingestible capsule for preparation-free, colorectal cancer screening, today announced the appointment of Alex Ovadia as Chief Executive Officer effective immediately. Prior to this appointment, Mr. Ovadia served as Check-Cap's Chief Operating Officer, Vice President of Research and Development and Israeli site manager since 2013.

We believe that Alex's leadership capabilities, global strategic perspective, and extensive R&D background will provide focus as we progress towards execution of our C-Scan commercial pathway. With our recent CE Mark approval a key validation of our breakthrough product, we look forward to Alex's leadership in driving the Company to achieve its mission of generating an alternative for colorectal cancer screening.\"\nAlex Ovadia, Chief Executive Officer of Check-Cap stated, \"I am very excited to take on the challenge of driving broad regulatory, clinical and commercial acceptance of our C-Scan product. Following our receipt in January of CE Mark, we continue to build a growing body of clinical evidence as we remain focused on bridging the gap toward the commercialization of C-Scan. We look forward to delivering on our target milestones and I am honored to continue to serve and further build with the talented and dedicated team at Check-Cap.\"\nAbout Check-Cap\nCheck-Cap is a clinical-stage medical diagnostics company developing C-Scan®, the first capsule-based system for preparation-free colorectal cancer screening.\nUtilizing innovative ultra-low dose X-ray and wireless communication technologies, the capsule generates information on the contours of the inside of the colon as it passes naturally. This information is used to create a 3D map of the colon, which allows physicians to look for polyps and other abnormalities. Designed to improve the patient experience and increase the willingness of individuals to participate in recommended colorectal cancer screening, C-Scan removes many frequently-cited barriers, such as laxative bowel preparation, invasiveness and sedation.\nLegal Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements.\" Words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"future,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"look forward\" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, often signify forward-looking statements.
