Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are down around 1 percent.\nBrazilian and South African equities were the worst hit, down 6.4 percent and 5.9 percent respectively - comparable to the S&P 500 which has lost just over 6 percent after suffering its worst one-day drop on Monday since August 2011.\nReporting by Claire Milhench and Marc Jones; Editing by Toby Davis\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:49:28.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
