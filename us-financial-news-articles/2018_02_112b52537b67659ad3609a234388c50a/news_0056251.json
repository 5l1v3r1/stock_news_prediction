REUTERS/Sergio Perez They also face a struggle to keep up with so-called platform companies like Amazon, Google or Facebook that have proven highly adept at using customer data to sell products, services or advertising online.\nAura won’t seek to compete - instead it will operate as a branded app in Argentina, Brazil and Britain, will run on Telefonica’s pay-TV platform in Spain, while being available via Facebook Messenger in Chile and Germany.\nIt will soon be integrated with Google Assistant, as well as Microsoft’s Cortana in 2019, Telefonica said.\nTelefonica, which has invested 56 billion euros ($69 billion) in its digital upgrade since 2012, forecast last week that sales would grow by 1 percent this year - slower than the high double digits achieved by U.S. players.\nIt also said it was working with Deutsche Telekom of Germany, Dutch KPN and Orange of France on a so-called data-portability initiative.\nThis comes before new European Union rules that enter force in May - called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - that give customers greater rights over how their personal data is handled by companies.\nData portability foresees allowing people to receive or transfer data collected about them online, in an accessible form, as part of a wider policy agenda of shielding citizens from corporate surveillance.\n($1 = 0.8135 euros)\nWriting by Douglas Busvine.
