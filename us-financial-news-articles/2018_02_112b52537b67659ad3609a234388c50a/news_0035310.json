It also contained three posters with references to the Third Reich, and two rifles, one a replica.\nPolice raided the home of the individual who picked up the package from a post office, the Ministry said, adding that the person was cooperating with authorities.\n“There is no room in Argentina for these types of expressions, which make reference to a tragic era in human history,” Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said in the statement.\nIn the 1940s, millions of Jews were murdered by the state in Nazi Germany, a genocide known as the Holocaust, along with others denoted as inferior. After the fall of the Third Reich at the end of World War Two, a number of high-ranking Nazi officials fled to South American countries, including Argentina.\nLast June, police seized a cache of Nazi artifacts hidden behind a library in the house of an art collector in Buenos Aires.\nReporting by Luc Cohen; Editing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T00:11:35.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
