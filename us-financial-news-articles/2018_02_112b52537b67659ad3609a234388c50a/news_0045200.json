It was his 10th career game with at least two goals and third this season.\nTyler Ennis capped the three-goal second period after being scratched on Saturday.\nMatt Cullen also scored in the second. Cullen, Ennis, defensemen Ryan Suter and Matt Dumba also recorded multi-point games for Minnesota.\nJoel Eriksson Ek scored the other goal while Devan Dubnyk made 32 saves as Minnesota avoided its second three-game losing streak of the season.\nRoss Johnston, Anders Lee and Tanner Fritz scored for the Islanders, who were coming off consecutive shutouts of the New York Rangers and Carolina Panthers.\nJaroslav Halak, who stopped a career-high 50 shots Thursday, made 27 saves.\nMinnesota struck first 7:02 into the game and ended New York’s shutout streak at 140:18 when Eriksson Ek snapped a 50-game drought by re-directing Charlie Coyle’s centering pass from the right corner over Halak moments after a turnover by Islanders defenseman Thomas Hickey.\nThe Islanders tied the game with 1:45 left when Johnston deflected a left point shot by Johnny Boychuk off Dubnyk’s right arm. Boychuk’s shot occurred after Casey Cizikas forced a turnover by Eric Staal behind the net.\nNew York took a 2-1 lead 1:57 into the second when Lee tipped in Hickey’s point shot under Dubnyk’s legs but the Wild scored three times in a span of 4:12 to get a 4-2 lead.\nCullen tied the game at 9:54 by finishing off a breakaway, Zucker put a wrist shot from outside the left circle over Halak’s glove at 12:17 and Ennis put a backhander from near the crease past Halak at 14:06.\nThe Islanders made it a one-goal game late in the second when Fritz put a wrister by Dubnyk for his first career goal but Zucker finished it off for Minnesota with 3:22 remaining.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:26:13.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
