I believe the potential treatments that Tonix is developing could be valuable for the health and well-being of those who have served our country in the armed forces and also to our Nation’s readiness,” commented Gen. Grange.\n“Working with Tonix has been a truly rewarding experience,” commented Stuart Davidson, Managing Partner of Labrador Ventures and Co-Founder and Chairman of Sonen Capital, an impact investment management firm. “I’m pleased to have been a part of Tonix from inception and continue to have high expectations for the company’s future and its development programs.”\nGen. Grange is currently Chief Executive Officer of Pharm-Olam International, Ltd. Prior to joining Pharm-Olam, he was President of Osprey Global Solutions, LLC “OGS”, a Service Disabled Veterans Organization. Gen. Grange served as the Chief Executive Officer of Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc. “PPDI”, where he oversaw clinical and laboratory operations. Prior to PPDI he served in the McCormick Tribune Foundation for 10 years, most recently as Chief Executive Officer and President, where he also oversaw the support of Veteran Programs. Gen. Grange served 30 years in the U.S. Army as a Ranger, Green Beret, Aviator, Infantryman and a member of special operating units.
