Discovered in 2015 by Italy’s Eni, the field contains an estimated 30 trillion cubic feet of gas.\nReporting by Ehad Farouk; Writing by Sami Aboudi, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:40:54.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
