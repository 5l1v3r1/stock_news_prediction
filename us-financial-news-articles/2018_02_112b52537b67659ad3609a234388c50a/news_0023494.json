To come back from that it’s just unbelievable right now. \n“It still gets sore at the end of the day, but I can swing the golf club and can I get around 18 holes, so I feel good about that.” \nWhile Potter celebrated victory, joint runner-up Mickelson’s winless drought since the 2013 British Open continued, though he drew positives from three birdies in the final five holes for a 67. \n“I gave it a shot on the back nine,” he said. \n“It was nice to feel the nerves and make a couple of birdies coming down the stretch. Right now I‘m hitting it as well as I have in a long time.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Adelaide, South Australia; Editing by Toby Davis/Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T02:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T02:52:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
