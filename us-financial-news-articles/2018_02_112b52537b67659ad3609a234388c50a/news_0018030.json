Additional layoffs are not planned.\nThe Swiss bank has struggled to develop a significant presence in the US.\nLast year it fell to 12th in the combined US equity and equity-linked league tables, with US$3.4bn of business for 49 companies, trailing European counterparts such as Barclays (US$15.7bn), Credit Suisse (US$11bn) and Deutsche Bank (US$5.8bn).\nIt ranked fifth and eighth on the tables in the EMEA and APAC regions, respectively.\nIn October, UBS reappointed Sam Kendall as global head of ECM, based in New York, to help revitalise the bankâ€™s US ECM business.\nHe was in the position from 2013 to 2016 before becoming head of corporate client solutions for Asia-Pacific.\nUBS has made recent hires in areas of growth.\nChris Cormier, a long time Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch ECM banker, will join the bank in March to oversee TMT origination in the Americas. Elias Ehrlich, a veteran of Santander, is also joining next month as head of LatAm ECM.\nAdditional junior and senior hires are likely to fill staffing, with an emphasis on significant ECM industry verticals TMT, healthcare and FIG, the people said.
