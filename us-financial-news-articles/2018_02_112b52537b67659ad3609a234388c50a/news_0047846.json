He retains deep insight into the workings of BOJ policy.\nWhile the BOJ will continue to slow its bond buying, abandoning negative rates may take some time as it would require watering down its price target, said Kiuchi, currently executive economist at Nomura Research Institute.\n“Policy normalization doesn’t mean the BOJ will abandon its ultra-easy policy. It’s just about gradually moderating the degree of monetary support,” he said.\nAfter three years of heavy money printing failed to fire up inflation, the BOJ revamped its policy framework in 2016 to one targeting interest rates from the pace of money printing.\nSince then, its bond buying has slowed to roughly half the pace it loosely commits to buy each year.\nReporting by Leika KiharaEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T10:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T04:27:02.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
