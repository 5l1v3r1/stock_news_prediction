Membership has skyrocketed since Mitch Lowe took over as CEO this past June and slashed fees from $30 a month to $9.95. In just two days after the fee reduction, sign-ups shot up by 150,000.\nNow the company is cutting prices even more. This week MoviePass reduced subscription fees by 20% to $7.95 per month. Coupled with the growing number of cinemas that accept the card – currently 91% of U.S. theaters – subscriptions are set to keep growing.\nBut even with subscriber growth on the rise, MoviePass reimburses most cinemas in full for each ticket (except for a few that offer them a 20 percent discount). In many high-priced markets such as New York and San Francisco, tickets cost much more than their $7.95 monthly fee.\nSo, how does the company break even?\nshow chapters ", "external_links": ["https://www.moviepass.com/"], "published": "2018-02-16T21:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T22:17:16.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
