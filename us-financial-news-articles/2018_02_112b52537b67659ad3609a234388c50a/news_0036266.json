Labor Department figures on Tuesday showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month.\nConcerns that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve to accelerate its path of interest rate hikes have erased the S&P 500’s gains for the year even after January’s 5.6 percent rise, its strongest performance for that month since 1997.\nOverall, hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by Credit Suisse.\nHedge funds posted an estimated 4.1 percent gain in January, the report said, with the largest gains coming in long positions in consumer discretionary stocks and short positions in healthcare stocks.\nHedge funds often use leverage to increase the size of their wages, supercharging potential rewards but also boosting risk.\n“January’s record performance provided a buffer to February’s vol-inspired risk-off move,” said Mark Connors, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in the note. “Managers appear to be weathering the storm well.”\nQuarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of tracking what the managers are selling and buying.\nBut relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.
