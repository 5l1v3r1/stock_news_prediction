This has the potential to cannibalize Google’s revenue from retail advertisers,” wrote Scott Devitt, an analyst at Stifel who cut his rating to “hold” from “buy”.\nAt least 11 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet, while two cut their price on the stock. Susquehanna was the most bullish, raising its price target to $1,475.Jefferies analysts said Alphabet is placing the right bets on some very big opportunities such as YouTube/TV, hardware, GCP, Waymo, which will help fuel sustained growth and meaningful share appreciation over time.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:46:16.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
