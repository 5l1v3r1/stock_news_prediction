We are going to expect a good deal, a fair deal,” said Trudeau.\n“We will not be pushed into accepting any old deal and no deal might very well be better for Canada than a bad deal.”\nTrudeau made similar comments last Friday when he also said he was confident about prospects for the treaty.\nReporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T08:21:32.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
