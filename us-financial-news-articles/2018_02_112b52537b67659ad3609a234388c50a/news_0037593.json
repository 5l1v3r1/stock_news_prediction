So it is the first time and so we are really happy,” he enthused.\n“After the super-G (in which Goggia finished 11th) we knew that a lot of things could happen,” he told reporters at the foot of the mountain. “And we were afraid the same things might happen here in the downhill... but she was very strong and we are very happy.”\nAs the garrulous Goggia talked through her triumph, Malago smiled. ”She’s unbelievable,“ he said. ”How strong is her enthusiasm?\n“You have seen... she is contagious.”\nEditing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T13:07:35.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
