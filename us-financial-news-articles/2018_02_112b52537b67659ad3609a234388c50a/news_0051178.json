REUTERS/Grigory Dukor The Canadians received their silver medals with a blank stare, Jocelyne Larocque removing hers as soon as it was placed around her neck.\n“It was just hard,” Larocque said. “I mean we were going for gold, we were chasing that gold medal.”\nSince Nagano, Canada and the United States have held a duopoly on Olympic women’s ice hockey, contesting every final except one when Sweden crashed the party at the 2006 Turin Olympics to take silver.\nSlideshow (3 Images) The most gut-wrenching of those U.S. defeats came in Sochi when, leading 2-0 with under four minutes to play, Canada scored twice to force overtime.\nMarie-Philip Poulin then did what she has become notorious for, putting a knife through the heart of Team USA by notching the overtime winner.\nThere were 10 returning players from that team in Pyeongchang, the pain as fresh as the day it occurred.\nThe loss remained an open wound and the Americans took every opportunity to remind the 13 new players that this was something they never want to experience.\n”Ten players were with us in 2014,“ Team USA coach Robb Stauber said. ”They know what it feels like to be on the other side.\n”I‘m thrilled not only for those 10 players but the entire team that they have had a different experience.\n“That was our goal coming in to the Olympics - to fight really hard for a different result and I‘m very, very happy for our players.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:39:03.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
