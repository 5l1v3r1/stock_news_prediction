The move comes as more fashion brands have noted the growing appeal of 90s styles. Ralph Lauren, Perry Ellis, Guess and Abercrombie & Fitch all noted the logo trend on recent earnings calls. Source: Coach Coach Signature handbag \nWhen it comes to fashion, flashy logos have been out of vogue for a while. But a number of premium retailers say logos are back. \nCoach Brand President & CEO Josh Schulman told investors on the company's second-quarter conference call that the company is seeing \"a global movement in luxury brands toward a higher penetration of logo product.\" \nThe recognizable Coach \"C\" print has not been a part of the handbag maker's main assortment for several years as it has been undergoing a brand transformation, but that will change soon. \nTapestry , the parent company of Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, is reintroducing logo into its retail store and website assortment as part of the new inventory designed by Coach creative director Stuart Vevers. The collection will hit stores and the website on March 1. \nSchulman says the early response from the editorial and wholesale community, including Harper's Bazaar the Neiman Marcus catalog team, has been \"terrific.\" \nCoach has already begun to increase the logo product available in its outlet business. Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy estimates in the most recent holiday quarter, Coach outlet stores dedicated about 20 percent of the floor space to logo product. \nThe handbag maker isn't the only company bringing back logos. \nMurphy says she's started to see \"a renaissance of logo,\" largely led by luxury players like LVMH , Gucci and Balenciaga, but also including what she calls premium players like Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger (both owned by PVH ) and Donna Karan (part of G-III Apparel Group ).
