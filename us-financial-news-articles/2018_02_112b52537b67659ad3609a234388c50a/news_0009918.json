A beautiful service. Powerful, emotional,” club captain Michael Carrick told MUTV. “For me, it was emotional sitting next to Sir Bobby and coming to terms with what he’s been through. It was tough but a pleasure to be part of.” \nIn Munich, club ambassador Denis Irwin joined an estimated 3,000 United fans for a ceremony and a two-minute silence at the scene of the crash. Two commemorative plaques were also unveiled, British media reported. People take part in a memorial service marking 60 years since Manchester United plane crash in Munich, Germany February 6, 2018.

I know the fans make an annual pilgrimage, but they’ve made a special effort this year and it’s great to see them pay their respects,” Irwin said. \nWreaths were also laid at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade, where United had played Red Star Belgrade the day before the crash.
