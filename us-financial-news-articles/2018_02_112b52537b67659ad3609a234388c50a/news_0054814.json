(\"Zoës Kitchen\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:ZOES) today reported financial results for the twelve and fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017.\nHighlights for the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017, as compared to the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016:\nTotal revenue increased 15.2% to $71.4 million. Comparable restaurant sales increased 0.3%. Five new Company-owned restaurants opened. Loss from operations increased 123.6% to $2.8 million Restaurant contribution* increased 10.5% to $11.4 million. Net loss was $2.9 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share. Net loss for the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017 included a $1.1 million benefit for income taxes inclusive of a $2.2 million benefit related to tax reform. Net loss for the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016 included a $1.7 million benefit for income taxes. Adjusted net loss* was $2.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $1.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA* decreased 3.8% to $2.9 million.\nHighlights for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017, as compared to the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016:\nTotal revenue increased 13.8% to $314.1 million. Comparable restaurant sales decreased 2.0%. 39 new Company-owned restaurants opened. Income from operations decreased 80.9% to $1.2 million Restaurant contribution* increased 5.3% to $58.1 million. Net loss was $2.0 million, or $0.10 per basic diluted share, compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share. Net loss for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017 included a $1.3 million benefit for income taxes inclusive of a $2.2 million benefit related to tax reform. Adjusted net loss* was $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $1.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA* decreased 0.4% to $25.0 million.\n(*) Restaurant contribution, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income (loss) are non-GAAP measures. For reconciliations of restaurant contribution to income (loss) from operations; EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income to GAAP net income (loss); and why the Company considers these non-GAAP measures useful, see the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures accompanying this release.\nKevin Miles, President and Chief Executive Officer of Zoës Kitchen, commented, “I continue to be very pleased with our team’s focus and discipline toward executing our initiatives, which resulted in improved operations and guest experience throughout the year, including our fourth quarter. Seeing the positive impact of these initiatives on our business, I am confident that our strategy is on firm footing and that we are continuing to build a strong brand for long-term success.”\nMiles continued, “Looking ahead to 2018, we are focused on several growth drivers that include new menu items and beverage innovation that will extend our leadership position in the Mediterranean category as well as drive growth in our dinner day part; investing in our digital platform and marketing to build deeper guest relationships and offer more convenience; and expanding our reach through off-premise catering and delivery channels. We believe these initiatives, along with reducing our development to 25 new locations and leveraging our expense management efficiencies, are the right steps to drive long-term shareholder value.”\nImpact of Tax Reform\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act also provides for the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017 as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018, including additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\nThe company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. Accordingly, the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were remeasured to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, resulting in a $2.2 million decrease in income tax expense for the year ended December 25, 2017 and a corresponding $2.2 million decrease in net deferred tax liabilities as of December 25, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue, which includes restaurant sales from Company-owned restaurants and royalty fees, increased 15.2% to $71.4 million in the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017, from $62.0 million in the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016. Restaurant sales for the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017 were $71.3 million, an increase of 15.2% from the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016.\nComparable restaurant sales increased 0.3% during the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017, consisting of a 1.6% decrease in transactions and product mix combined with a 1.9% increase in price. The comparable restaurant base includes those restaurants open for 18 full periods or longer and included 186 restaurants as of December 25, 2017.\nRestaurant contribution increased 10.5% to $11.4 million from $10.3 million in the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017. As a percentage of restaurant sales, restaurant contribution margin decreased 60 basis points to 16.0% as increases in labor and store operating expense rates were partially offset by lower cost of goods rates.\nThe increase in labor and store operating expense rates was driven by the dilutive effect on margins from our newest restaurants, which, on average, initially operate at less than system-wide average sales volumes and incur some inefficiencies for a short period of time. In addition, labor rates increased from hourly wage rate inflation while store operating expense rates increased due to marketing costs.\nNet loss for the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017 was $2.9 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.5 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, for the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016. Adjusted net loss was $2.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017, compared to adjusted net loss of $1.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share, for the twelve weeks ended December 26, 2016.\n2017 Fiscal Year to Date Financial Results\nTotal revenue increased 13.8% to $314.1 million in the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017, from $276.0 million in the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016. Restaurant sales for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017 were $313.9 million, an increase of 13.8% from $275.8 million in the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016.\nComparable restaurant sales decreased 2.0% during the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017, consisting of a 3.5% decrease in transactions and product mix combined with a 1.5% increase in price.\nRestaurant contribution increased 5.3% to $58.1 million in the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017, from $55.2 million in the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016. As a percentage of restaurant sales, restaurant contribution margin decreased 150 basis points to 18.5% as increases in labor and store operating expense rates were partially offset by lower cost of goods rates.\nThe increase in labor and store operating expense rates was driven by the dilutive effect on margins from our newest restaurants, which, on average, initially operate at less than system-wide average sales volumes and incur some inefficiencies for a short period of time. In addition, labor rates increased from hourly wage rate inflation while store operating expense rates increased due to investments in store technology and marketing costs.\nNet loss for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017 was $2.0 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net income of $1.8 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted share, for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016. Adjusted net loss was $1.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the fifty-two weeks ended December 25, 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $1.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the fifty-two weeks ended December 26, 2016.\nDevelopment\nThe Company opened five new Company-owned restaurants during the twelve weeks ended December 25, 2017. As of December 25, 2017, there were 240 Company-owned restaurants and three franchised restaurants. As of February 22, 2018, the Company has opened six additional restaurants, bringing the total restaurant count to 249.\nFY 2018 Outlook\nThe fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 includes a fifty-third week for the time frame of December 25, 2018 through December 31, 2018. The extra week will be included in our fourth quarter results. For the fifty-three weeks ending December 31, 2018, the Company currently expects the following:\nTotal revenue between $358 million and $368 million (includes $4.5 million for the fifty-third week) Comparable restaurant sales growth of flat to 2.0% on a comparable fifty-two week basis 25 Company-owned restaurant openings Restaurant contribution margin between 17.3% and 18.4% (includes a negative 20 bps impact due to the fifty-third week) General and administrative expenses between 10.6% and 10.8% of total revenue, inclusive of $3.7 million of non-cash equity based compensation expense.\nEarnings Conference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 financial results today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

An archive of the webcast will also be available through the corporate website shortly after the conference call has concluded.\nDefinitions\nThe following definitions apply to these terms as used throughout this release:\nComparable restaurant sales represent the change in period-over-period sales comparisons for the comparable Company-owned restaurant base. A restaurant becomes comparable in its 18th full fiscal period of operation. The Company presents comparable restaurant sales on a fiscal calendar basis. As a result, our comparable restaurant sales calculation may not correspond exactly to the related calendar periods.\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs, which are cost of sales, labor, and store operating expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is restaurant contribution as a percentage of restaurant sales.\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as EBITDA plus loss from disposal of equipment, pre-opening costs, and casualty loss.\nAdjusted net income (loss), a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) plus the provision (benefit) for income taxes and casualty loss; less an estimated tax rate of 38%. Beginning in fiscal year 2018 we will use an estimated tax rate of 24% due to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nOur first fiscal quarter consists of sixteen weeks and each of our second, third and fourth fiscal quarters consists of twelve weeks, except for a fifty-three week year when the fourth quarter has thirteen weeks. Fiscal year 2018 is a fifty-three week year.\nAbout Zoës Kitchen\nFounded in 1995, Zoës Kitchen is a fast-casual restaurant group serving a distinct menu of fresh, wholesome, made-from-scratch, Mediterranean-inspired dishes delivered with warm hospitality.
