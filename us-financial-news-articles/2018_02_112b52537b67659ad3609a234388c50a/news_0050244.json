If things are going to be okay, it’s going to be driven by companies that are able to grow and take advantage of the growth in the economy,” said Jason Browne, chief investment officer at FundX Investment Group in San Francisco.\nSeven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.04 percent gain in the industrial index .SPLRCI.\nThe real estate .SPLRCR sector fell the most with a 0.72 percent decline after data showed U.S. home sales unexpectedly fell in January.\nQualcomm ( QCOM.O ) fell 1.05 percent after Broadcom ( AVGO.O ) lowered its takeover offer for the chipmaker. The revised offer comes in the wake of Qualcomm’s sweetened bid for NXP Semiconductors ( NXPI.O ).\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields US10YT=RR, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, were slightly below the four-year peak at 2.8987 percent.\nThe CBOE Volatility index .VIX, a gauge of near-term stock market volatility, eased to a session low of 17.97 and below Friday’s close of 19.46.\nA jump in these two gauges to multi-year highs were at the center of the selloff in equities earlier in the month.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,993 to 888.
