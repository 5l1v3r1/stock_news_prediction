Nearly 20 percent of reviews on\nAmazon's Brazilian marketplace are negative, compared with 10\npercent in Mexico and just 4 percent in the United States,\naccording to e-commerce analytics firm Marketplace Pulse.\nComplaints in Brazil often focus on delayed or canceled\norders - a problem dramatically reduced in other countries when\nAmazon itself packs and posts orders of third-party goods stored\nat its warehouse facilities.\nIn an early sign of Amazon's Brazilian logistics push, the\ncompany posted more than a dozen listings for distribution jobs\nin the country to LinkedIn last year, including \"Site leader,\nFulfillment Center.\"\nThe new warehouse site outside of Sao Paulo, in the\nmunicipality of Cajamar, looks to be a step in that direction.\nThere San Francisco-based logistics company Prologis Inc\nhas offered a 50,000-square-meter space to Amazon in a\nnew industrial park that hosts DHL and Samsung, according to\nsources, who said adaptation of the warehouse had not begun.\nPrologis, which also partnered with Amazon on a\nmega-warehouse north of Mexico city last year, declined to\ncomment.\nThe preparations in Brazil come as Luft, the local logistics\noperator for Amazon's book business, readies a move into another\nPrologis site nearby in Cajamar, sources said, leaving its\ncurrent 12,000-square-meter facility in the city of Barueri.\nAmazon registered in October to conduct operations in\nCajamar, according to municipal records seen by Reuters.\nThe new logistics investment could spell trouble for rivals.\nMercado Libre has been a success story among Latin America\ntech start ups: its shares have nearly tripled since 2014,\nbringing its market capitalization to more than $15 billion.\nMagazine Luiza's stock has risen sixfold in each of the past\ntwo years as it shifted its rolled out an ambitious e-commerce\nstrategy built on its brick and mortar stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:55:32.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
