Washington went 76-30 from 2009-11 in Thomas’ three seasons, winning one regular-season championship and two conference tournament titles.\nWith Thomas cheering the team on, Washington (18-9, 8-6) snapped a season-worst three-game losing streak by completing a season-series sweep of Colorado (15-12, 7-8). The Huskies won 72-62 in Boulder, Colo., last month.\nMatisse Thybulle exploded for a career-best 26 points to lead the Huskies, who were coming off a 70-58 home loss to Utah on Thursday.\nThe junior forward’s previous high was 20 points last season against Yale. He had 19 against Kansas earlier this season.\nNoah Dickerson had 14 points, while Dominic Green and Jaylen Nowell added 11 apiece for Washington, which is attempting to return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since Thomas’ final season at the school in 2011.\nDickerson led all rebounders in the game with nine. David Crisp had a game-high seven assists to complement seven points and six rebounds.\nDickerson scored 12 of his 14 and Green all of his 11 in the first half, during which the Huskies grabbed a 39-34 lead.\nThen the Washington defense took over, limiting the Buffaloes to six points in the first nine minutes of the second half, allowing the Huskies to pull away into a 58-40 advantage.\nThe 59 points allowed were the second-fewest by Washington in a Pac-12 game this season. They limited California to 56 in a 10-point win last month.\nTyler Bey finished with 11 points for Colorado, which went winless on its two-game trip to the state of Washington. The Buffaloes were beaten 73-69 at Washington State on Thursday.\nBey also found time for a team-leading eight rebounds.\nMcKinley Wright IV added 10 points for the Buffaloes, who suffered their most lopsided loss of the Pac-12 season.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:08:52.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
