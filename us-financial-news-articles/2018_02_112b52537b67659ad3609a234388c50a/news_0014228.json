Her body was discovered outside Tel Aviv in August, and Israeli police arrested Mohammed Harouf, a Palestinian. \nHarouf, 30, said in a televised statement to the court in August that he had targeted Halimi “to free prisoners”. His lawyer, Elad Rath, said that Harouf’s plan had been to abduct Halimi and swap her for Palestinians held in Israeli jails, but that when she resisted he strangled and bludgeoned her to death. \nHalimi was married and lived in the settlement of Adam in the occupied West Bank. Harouf, from Nablus, was working as a gardener in Holon, south of Tel Aviv, on the day of the murder. \nIsraeli prosecutors initially treated the case as non-political. Israeli media reprinted a photograph that had circulated on Facebook of Halimi and Harouf embracing and smiling.

REUTERS/Nir Elias \nThis means that Halimi’s next-of-kin will be entitled to state stipends given to relatives left bereaved by political violence. \nHarouf’s family, in turn, can expect payouts from the Palestinian Authority, which offers such support to relatives of those killed or jailed for attacks on Israelis. Those Palestinian stipends have come under increased scrutiny by Israel and have drawn U.S. threats of funding cuts. \n“This arrangement is important not least because it spares the (victim‘s) family further grief,” lead prosecutor Raed Anuz told the three-judge panel. \nNo date was set for the sentencing.
