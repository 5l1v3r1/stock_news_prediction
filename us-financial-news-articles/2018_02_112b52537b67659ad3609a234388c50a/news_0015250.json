(NYSE:BKI), a leading provider of software, data and analytics solutions to the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals, today announced unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 2% to $267.5 million from $261.5 million in the prior year quarter. Net earnings attributable to Black Knight for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $147.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared to $11.8 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter. The results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include an income tax benefit of $110.9 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred income tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Reform Act\").\nAdjusted Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 2% to $268.4 million from $263.0 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment, Adjusted Revenues growth for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 5%. Adjusted Net Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 25% to $56.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $45.2 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, in the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 13% to $131.9 million from $116.7 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 49.1% compared to 44.4% in the prior year quarter.\nBlack Knight Executive Chairman Bill Foley said, “2017 was another successful year for Black Knight as we continued to execute against our long-term strategic initiatives to drive organic growth. In particular, we expanded and extended our relationships with several key existing clients through cross-sell and contract renewals, won new clients in existing markets and delivered innovative new solutions. In addition, we completed several key implementations, made investments that will pave the way for future growth and returned capital to our shareholders. As we look towards 2018, we are excited and optimistic about our opportunities to continue to drive Black Knight forward and deliver value for our shareholders.”\nBlack Knight Chief Executive Officer Tom Sanzone added, “We are pleased with our results in the fourth quarter and for the full year, both of which included Adjusted Revenues growth of 2%, or 5% excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment. For the fourth quarter, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 13%, which drove margin expansion of 470 basis points to 49.1%. For the year, Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9%, which drove margin expansion of 310 basis points to 47.9%. As we begin 2018, we are very excited about Black Knight’s strong business momentum across the enterprise, and we remain focused on converting our significant and growing implementation pipeline.”\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2% to $1,051.6 million from $1,026.0 million in 2016. Net earnings attributable to Black Knight for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $182.3 million, or $1.47 per diluted share, compared to $45.8 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, in 2016. The results for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred income tax liability, partially offset by expenses associated with the debt refinancing, Term Loan B repricing and the spin-off of Black Knight from Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (\"FNF\") (the \"Distribution\").\nAdjusted Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 2% to $1,056.1 million from $1,033.3 million in 2016. Excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment, Adjusted Revenues growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 5%. Adjusted Net Earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 19% to $209.6 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted Net Earnings of $175.4 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 9% to $505.8 million from $463.1 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 47.9% compared to 44.8% in 2016.\nDefinitions of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to related GAAP measures are provided in subsequent sections of the press release narrative and supplemental schedules. Black Knight has not provided a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted Net Earnings Per Share and Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, due primarily to variability and difficulty in making accurate forecasts and projections of non-operating matters that may arise, as not all of the information necessary for a quantitative reconciliation is available to Black Knight without unreasonable effort.\nSegment Information\nSoftware Solutions (formerly Technology)\nAdjusted Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 4% to $228.2 million from $219.2 million in the prior year quarter. Our servicing software business had Adjusted Revenues growth of 9%, primarily driven by higher loan volumes on our core servicing software solution and price increases. In our origination software business, Adjusted Revenues declined 17%, primarily driven by lower volumes as a result of the 42% decline in refinancing originations as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association on January 20, 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased 9% to $135.1 million from $124.4 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 59.2%, an increase of 240 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 4% to $893.8 million from $855.8 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $523.0 million from $487.8 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 58.5%, an increase of 150 basis points compared to 2016.\nData and Analytics\nAdjusted Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $40.2 million compared to $43.8 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment, Adjusted Revenues increased $3.2 million, or 9%, compared to the prior year quarter driven by growth in our property data and multiple listing service businesses. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.0 million compared to $4.5 million in the prior year quarter, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 22.4%, an increase of 1,210 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.\nAdjusted Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $162.3 million compared to $177.5 million in 2016. Excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment, Adjusted Revenues increased $14.9 million, or 10%, compared to 2016. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $31.9 million from $26.5 million in 2016, with an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 19.7%, an increase of 480 basis points compared to 2016.\nRealignment of Property Insight\nEffective January 1, 2017, Property Insight, LLC (\"Property Insight\"), an indirect Black Knight subsidiary that provides information used by title insurance underwriters, title agents and closing attorneys to source and underwrite title insurance for real property sales and transfer, realigned its commercial relationship with FNF. In connection with the realignment, Property Insight employees responsible for title plant posting and maintenance were transferred to FNF. Under the new commercial arrangement, Black Knight continues to own the title plant technology and retains sales responsibility for third parties, other than FNF. As a result of the realignment, Black Knight no longer recognizes revenues or expenses related to title plant posting and maintenance, but charges FNF a license fee for use of the technology to access and maintain the title plant data. Had the realignment taken place on January 1, 2016, Black Knight revenues and expenses for 2016 would have been lower by approximately $30 million with essentially no effect to Adjusted EBITDA.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Black Knight repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock for $90.1 million, or at a price of $45.065 per share. As of December 31, 2017, Black Knight had approximately 6.8 million shares remaining under its share repurchase authorization.\nSegment Realignment\nOn January 1, 2018, we realigned the composition of our two reportable segments. Certain enterprise business intelligence offerings in our Data and Analytics segment were moved to our Software Solutions segment. This change aligns with our go-to-market strategy and with the internal management of our business operations, including the allocation of resources and assessment of performance.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, Black Knight had cash and cash equivalents of $16.2 million and debt of $1,434.1 million. As of December 31, 2017, Black Knight had available capacity of $445.0 million on its revolving credit facility.\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following reflect Black Knight’s expectations as of today's date.

Black Knight also presents these non-GAAP financial performance measures because it believes investors, analysts and rating agencies consider them useful in measuring Black Knight’s ability to meet its debt service obligations.

These adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other. This adjustment for the full year 2018 is expected to be approximately $2.5 million.\nAdjusted Revenues Excluding the Effect of the Property Insight Realignment - We define Adjusted Revenues excluding the effect of the Property Insight realignment as Adjusted Revenues for the respective 2016 period determined on the basis as if the Property Insight realignment had taken place on January 1, 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA - We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net earnings, with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain income statement items including, but not limited to:\nDepreciation and amortization; Interest expense; Income tax (benefit) expense; Other expense, net; Loss (gain) from discontinued operations, net of tax; deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment recorded in accordance with GAAP; equity-based compensation, including related payroll taxes; costs associated with debt and/or equity offerings, including the Distribution; spin-off related transition costs; and acquisition-related costs.\nThese adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other.\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin - Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Revenues.\nAdjusted Net Earnings - We define Adjusted Net Earnings as Net earnings with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain income statement items including, but not limited to:\nthe net incremental depreciation and amortization adjustments associated with the application of purchase accounting; deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment; equity-based compensation, including related payroll taxes; costs associated with debt and/or equity offerings, including the Distribution; spin-off related transition costs; acquisition-related costs; significant legal and regulatory matters; adjustment for income tax expense assuming the conversion of all the shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the Distribution, the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments and the deferred tax revaluation adjustment as a result of the Tax Reform Act. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 37.9% and 36.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 37.2% and 36.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Earnings Per Share - For the periods prior to the Distribution, we calculate per share amounts assuming the exchange of all shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the respective period. We also include the dilutive effect of any unvested restricted shares of common stock.\nTax Reform Act\nOur estimate of the effect of the Tax Reform Act is based on certain assumptions and our current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act, and may change as we refine our analysis and as further information becomes available.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

The shares of Class B common stock did not share in the earnings or losses of Black Knight and were, therefore, not participating securities. Accordingly, basic and diluted net earnings per share of Class B common stock have not been presented. The numerator in the diluted net earnings per share calculation is adjusted to reflect our income tax expense at an expected effective tax rate assuming the conversion of the shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, prior to the Distribution, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was (16.7)%, including the effect of the benefit related to the revaluation of our net deferred income tax liability and certain other discrete items recorded during the year. The denominator includes approximately 63.1 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, the approximately 84.8 million shares of Class B common stock for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 have been excluded in computing diluted net earnings per share because including them on an \"if-converted\" basis would have an anti-dilutive effect. The denominator also includes the dilutive effect of approximately 0.7 million and 0.6 million shares of unvested restricted shares of common stock for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, and approximately 2.0 million shares for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 Earnings before income taxes $ 192.4 Income tax benefit excluding the effect of noncontrolling interests (32.2 ) Net earnings $ 224.6 Diluted shares 152.4 Diluted net earnings per share $ 1.47\nSCHEDULE III BLACK KNIGHT, INC.
