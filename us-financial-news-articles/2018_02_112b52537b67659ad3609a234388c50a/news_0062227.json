We stand by the integrity of our reporting teams.”\nReuters was not able to independently verify the woman’s account.\nAfter the woman’s talk show appearance, Egypt’s State Information Service (SIS), which runs its foreign press center, called on “all Egyptian officials and sectors of the Egyptian elite wishing to do so, to boycott conducting media interviews and meetings with BBC correspondents and editors until the BBC issues a formal apology.”\nSIS also asked that the BBC publish a statement it had prepared “refuting the professional errors and violations as well as the allegations on the situation in Egypt.”\nRights groups say there is a growing crackdown against political opponents ahead of the election, while Egypt has banned scores of local news websites since May.\nEarlier this month, a high-profile politician and former presidential candidate was arrested after he gave an interview critical of Sisi to Al Jazeera, a Qatar-based channel banned in Egypt.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:58:26.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
