Even as this effect fades, the BoE expects inflation to fall only slowly as domestic pressures build.\nA Reuters poll on Wednesday showed most economists expect the BoE to raise rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.75 percent in May, and financial markets see a roughly 50 percent chance of a further rise before the end of 2018.\nLast week the BoE forecast annual pay growth would reach 3 percent by the end of 2018, up from 2.5 percent in the year to November 2017.\nThe BoE has been overly optimistic about pay before. But it said on Wednesday that pay deals last year were bigger than firms had predicted in its survey a year ago. The survey was based on replies from 368 businesses employing 845,000 staff.\n($1 = 0.7213 pounds)\nReporting by David Milliken, editing by Andy Bruce and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:10:24.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
