Foreign exchange stability is extremely important.”\nThe yen rose versus the dollar to the strongest level in more than a year, taking its gains so far this year to nearly 6 percent.\nEarlier on Friday, the government reappointed BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda for a second term and chose an advocate of bolder monetary easing as one of his deputies.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T15:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:17:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
