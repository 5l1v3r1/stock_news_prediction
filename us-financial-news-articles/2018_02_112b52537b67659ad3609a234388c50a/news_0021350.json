There was a spirited recovery by the players that is forgotten about when you see 5-1 but we need to react properly.” \nAllardyce defended his on-loan centre half Eliaquim Mangala after his difficult debut at the heart of the defence against Arsenal. \n“You can only make an impact if other players are playing to their capabilities and they weren‘t,” he said of the Manchester City defender. \n“There wasn’t anything wrong with his performance in the second half. Only I would know that because it’s my job to study the game.” \nAllardyce next faces his former club managed by another former England manager in Roy Hodgson and he believes the absence of forward Wilfried Zaha, ruled out for a month with a knee injury, could give Everton the edge. \n“We have to be concerned about Palace’s strengths but Zaha not playing could be an advantage. That being said, we will have to be at our best game to beat Crystal Palace. They’re very resilient, so hats off to Roy and his players,” Allardyce said. \nAlthough Everton are 10th in the table, they sit just four points above Palace and seven clear of the relegation zone. \n“We need to avoid the threat of relegation and it needs to start with Crystal Palace,” Allardyce said. “We need to focus on our own form. We’ve only lost one since I got here (at home). Our home form is very good.” Reporting by Neil Robinson, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T18:48:42.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
