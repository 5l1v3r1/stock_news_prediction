I wanted to get a last glimpse of her, but the police won’t let us in,” Indrayani, a woman from Sridevi’s home state of Tamil Nadu in southern India, said.\n‘SENSUALITY AND OOMPH’\nFans of Bollywood actress Sridevi wait to offer their condolences outside a makeshift memorial in Mumbai, India February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui Fans later ran behind a flower-bedecked truck carrying the body as it drove toward the crematorium.\nPolice in Dubai where Sridevi had gone to attend a family wedding said that a post mortem showed her death on Saturday was due to drowning in her hotel room’s bathtub following loss of consciousness.\nSlideshow (5 Images) Media reports had earlier said the cause of death was cardiac arrest.\nSridevi is survived by her husband, Boney Kapoor, and daughters Janhvi and Khushi. The Kapoors are a prominent film family, and her brothers-in-law, Anil and Sanjay, are actors, as is Arjun Kapoor, her husband’s son from a previous marriage.\n“She was an all-round actress, a hard worker who was always willing to correct her mistakes and improve,” Bharathi Pradhan, a film critic who knew Sridevi from her initial days in Bollywood, said.\n“She had sensuality and oomph like no other actress of the time.”\nEditing by Sanjeev Miglani and Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T16:04:29.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
