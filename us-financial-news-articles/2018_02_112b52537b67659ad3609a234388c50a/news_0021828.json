Who is Cristina Garcia? \nGarcia was elected to the state assembly in 2012. Throughout her time in office, she has been known as a champion of women’s issues and environmental health for impoverished communities. \nSince the beginning of the #MeToo movement this fall, Garcia has been a vocal supporter, tweeting in October that she refused to work with another assemblyman who had been disciplined years prior for groping a colleague. She has also supported legislation that would give legislative staff members whistleblower protections for reporting sexual misconduct. Signed, sealed and delivered to @JerryBrownGov . Proud to have worked with @asmMelendez as she persisted on this essential legislation that was long overdue. Persistence has prevailed! #WeSaidEnough #TimesUp #Ab403 pic.twitter.com/ot9AMeNtzg \nFor this work, Garcia was featured as part of the “Silence Breakers,” who were Time Magazine ’s Person of the Year. A groping incident \nBut now, she’s come under fire for being a perpetrator of sexual misconduct herself for an alleged incident involving an assembly aide in 2014. \nA man named Daniel Fierro says he was groped by Garcia while working as a staffer to Assemblyman Ian Calderon. According to Fierro’s account , Fierro was cleaning up the dugout following a softball game when Garcia approached him. \nGarcia reportedly appeared inebriated and began stroking his back and then squeezed his butt. Fierro says she then attempted to grab his crotch as well, but he quickly walked away. Fierro never reported the incident as he didn’t feel it was a “ life-damaging experience .” \nIn January, Fierro mentioned the incident to Calderon. It was then referred to the Assembly Rules Committee, which has since launched an investigation.

A Sacramento lobbyist also told Politico that he had been accosted by Garcia last year, at which time she “made a graphic sexual proposal, and tried to grab his crotch.” \nFor her part, Garcia has said that she was unaware of the claims until this week. “Every complaint about sexual harassment should be taken seriously and I will participate fully in any investigation that takes place,” she said. “I have zero recollection of engaging in inappropriate behavior and such behavior is inconsistent with my values.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T13:00:32.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
