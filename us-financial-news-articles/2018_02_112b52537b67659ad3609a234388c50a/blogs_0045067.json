The organization said that Musk will continue to advise and donate to the nonprofit.\nResearchers affiliated with the organization regularly publish AI research papers and release source code for other people to use. Unlike Tesla -- and companies like Facebook and Google that conduct extensive AI research -- OpenAI doesn't sell any products.\nElon Musk is known for taking on one world-changing tech challenge after another. Besides serving as the CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla, he also co-founded Hyperloop, which develops super fast tube-transportation systems, the Boring Company which digs tunnels, and the brain science venture, Neuralink.\nIt may come as a relief to investors that he is taking back the two percent of his time that he previously said he spent on OpenAI, to focus on things like launching re-usable rockets, and getting all the electric — and autonomous — vehicles he's promised into customers' hands.\nIn the fall of 2016, Elon Musk promised prospective customers and investors that vehicles with Tesla's \"Hardware 2\" (HW 2.0) sensors would be capable of fully autonomous driving with software upgrades in 2019. So far, the company has not come close to delivering a level 5 self-driving system. Nobody has.\nTesla has also made tweaks to the hardware that enables its advanced driver-assistive features.\nThe EV maker is also seen as lagging the competition — especially Alphabet-owned Waymo and GM-owned Cruise — when it comes to real-world test drives of its self-driving cars in its home state of California. However, Tesla has stated that it is conducting test drives out of state, at closed tracks and via simulation, instead.\nIn June Tesla hired a prominent AI researcher , Andrej Karpathy, away from OpenAI and made him its head of AI and Autopilot vision. In December Karpathy was present when Musk talked publicly for the first time about Tesla's plans for special chips that are designed to handle AI workloads. Google and Intel have also developed AI chips.\nMusk has also invested in other AI companies, DeepMind and Vicarious.\nshow chapters Elon Musk: A 'potentially dangerous outcome' with AI 2:36 PM ET Fri, 20 June 2014 | 02:09", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T20:38:21.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
