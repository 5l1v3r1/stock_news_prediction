Yun showed to us that we can be the best in the world if we try and dare to challenge a new field,” Moon wrote. “Thank you skeleton emperor Yun Sung-bin.”\nSouth Korea has long been a powerhouse in short-track speed skating and “Queen” Kim won the country’s first figure skating gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, sparking more local interest in winter sports.\nSkeleton racing, though, is one of the most extreme sports.\nCompetitors hurtle head-first and face-down at speeds of more than 100km per hour (60 miles per hour) down a twisting ice track, their chins hovering a few inches from the surface.\nYun, 23, knows every bump and curve of the Pyeongchang track, having spent thousands of hours training on it. But that wasn’t enough - he also had to put on weight to gain more speed.\nAfter winning gold, he described how he had eaten eight meals a day to gain up to 16kg to ensure he was a contender.\nBy coinciding with the Lunar New Year holiday, Yun ensured a big television audience. Many people tuned in after traveling back to their home towns and paying respect to their ancestors by preparing a feast and making a deep bow.\nYun bowed before the crowd after his victory.\n“I feel good to hear from people cheering me that way, I haven’t come this far just to get that title,” said Yun, known more commonly at home as the “Iron Man” for his love of the Marvel super hero character.\n“And my biggest wish is that this interest and support not fade out after the Olympics but could lead to finding new talents.”\nEditing by Mark Bendeich and Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T16:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T16:32:20.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
