The U.S.-listed shares also fell. \nCanada Goose said its net income rose to C$62.9 million or 56 Canadian cents per share in the three months ended Dec. 31, from C$39.1 million or 38 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. \nOn an adjusted basis, it earned 58 Canadian cents, beating estimates of 48 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe company, known for its pricey winter coats, made a successful market debut in 2017, when most other retailers were fighting off falling sales and shrinking margins. \n“More and more people today see outerwear as a prominent part of their wardrobe. In introducing over 30 new styles in our fall/winter line, we’re successfully meeting that demand,” Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss said on a call with analysts. \nMargins from stores and online sales were at 76.4 percent during the quarter, compared with gross margins of 51 percent from its wholesale channel. \nRevenue rose 21 percent to C$265.8 million. Revenue from selling directly to customers rose almost 83 percent to C$131.6 million, driven by new company-owned stores and ecommerce sites. \nFounded in 1957, Canada Goose has historically sold its products through wholesalers, but it started opening its own stores in 2016, banking on its luxury tag and focusing on ecommerce and international markets. \nThe company, which sells parkas for $900, has said it expects to open up to 20 brick-and-mortar stores around the world by 2020. It has already opened stores in Toronto, New York, Chicago and London since 2016. Canada Goose also operates 11 online stores across North America and Europe.
