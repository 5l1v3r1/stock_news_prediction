Pengilly could not be immediately reached on his mobile phone. It was not clear exactly what Pengilly, a former skeleton racer, whose term at the IOC ends at the completion of the Games, was alleged to have done. The IOC said Pengilly had apologised for the incident. “Mr Pengilly has expressed his apologies to the security man involved,” the IOC’s statement said.
