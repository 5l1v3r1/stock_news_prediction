This unique and compelling business model has enabled RumbleOn to carve out a niche in the highly fragmented recreational vehicle marketplace. As we look ahead, we will continue enhancing our technology, expanding our product to different market segments, and offering an unmatched customer experience, which we believe will position us well to drive further expansion in the business.\nFinancial Summary\nThere were no sales of vehicles during the three-months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. As a result, comparative financial results for the three-months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 have been omitted.\nThree-month period ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue totaled $3.44 million, driven by the sale of 355 units; Total average gross profit per unit was $764; Total operating loss was $3.2 million; Net loss was $3.4 million; and Net loss per share was $0.28, based on 12.3 million weighted average shares of common stock outstanding.\nFiscal year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue totaled $7.3 million, driven by the sale of 678 units; Total average gross profit per unit was $750; Total operating loss was $8.0 million; Net loss was $8.6 million; and Net loss per share was $0.86, based on 9.9 million weighted average shares of common stock outstanding.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 16, 2018, the Company entered into a floor plan line of credit with Ally Bank Dealer Services for up to $25 million through its wholly-owned subsidiary, RMBL Missouri, LLC.\nOutlook\nAs our platform and business model begins to achieve scale, for the first quarter of 2018 we estimate:\nRevenue in the range of $7.2 million to $7.5 million; Net loss ranging from $3.0 to $3.6 million; and We anticipate non-Harley Davidson units to approach 45% of vehicle sales, which will result in an average selling price ranging from $9,200 to $9,400 and gross margins range of 8% to 10%.\nFor the full year 2018, we estimate:\nRevenue in excess of $100 million; We expect that our sales mix between Harley Davidson and non-Harley Davidson vehicles will be about 50% each which is more in line with the overall market sales mix, and we anticipate that this will result in an average selling price range of $9,000 to $9,200 and a gross margin range of 12.5% to 14.5%; and Positive cash-flow from operations in the second half of the year.\nConference Call Details\nRumbleOn will host a conference call today, February 27, 2018, at 8:30 am Eastern Time to discuss financial results.
