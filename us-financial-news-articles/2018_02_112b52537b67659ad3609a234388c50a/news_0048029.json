The company said it had shifted its advertising clients to a new pricing scheme based on TV show ratings, going into effect this year.\nLike broadcasters internationally, Televisa, which owns Mexico’s popular ‘Las Estrellas’ network and a sizeable stake in U.S. Spanish-language peer Univision, is facing increasing competition from internet-based streaming services.\nOver the past year, the company has shuffled its management team.\nLate last year, longtime Chief Executive Emilio Azcarraga announced he would step down, remaining as chairman of the board. Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia and Executive Vice President Bernardo Gomez succeeded him as co-chief executives in January.\nThe company also named a new Chief Content Officer last year.\nTelevisa has said that it will sell off assets as it focuses on content and distribution. Last week, the company announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its 19 percent stake in Imagina, a Spanish media group, for 284 million euros ($350 million).\n($1 = 19.6595 Mexican pesos)\n$1 = 0.8105 euros Reporting by Julia Love, Noe Torres and Sheky Espejo, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T02:57:11.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
