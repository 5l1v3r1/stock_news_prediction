That followed a 0.1 percent annual increase in November and marked the biggest decline since a 1.1 percent annual decrease in July 2017.\nFor all of 2017, real wages fell 0.2 percent, following a 0.7 percent increase in the previous year.\nNominal cash earnings rose 0.7 percent in December from the same period a year earlier, slower than a 0.9 percent annual increase in the previous month, the data showed.\nSpecial payments, which include bonuses, rose 0.7 percent on-year in December, following a revised 7.8 percent annual increase the month before. The data suggest that many companies paid year-end bonuses in November instead of December.\nOvertime pay, a barometer of strength in corporate activity, rose an annual 0.9 percent in December, slower than a revised 1.9 percent annual increase in November.\nIn April-June last year Japan’s output gap showed demand exceeded supply by the most in more than nine years, according to BOJ data.\nCentral bank officials and economists outside the BOJ took that as a positive sign that inflation would start to accelerate and put an end to years of falling prices.\nYet, data on consumer prices and wages have failed to put inflation growth on a sustainable footing.\nBOJ officials hope strong economic growth will help spark this shift, though firms remain wary of scaring away cost-sensitive consumers with price hikes.\nJapan’s economy is forecast to have grown for an eighth straight quarter in October-December, the longest period of expansion in about 30 years, a Reuters poll showed before release of the data next week.\nReporting by Stanley White; Editing by Kim Coghill & Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T09:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:45:44.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
