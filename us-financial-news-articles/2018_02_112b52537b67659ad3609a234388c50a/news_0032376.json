Copper on the LME climbed 2.3 percent while zinc ended up 2.6 percent on Tuesday, while stocks on Wall Street ended the day up for a third straight session, buoyed by technology majors Amazon and Apple . The local share price index futures rose 0.2 percent or 14 points to 5,807, a 48.9-point discount to the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index close. The benchmark rose 0.6 percent on Tuesday. New Zealand's benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell as much as 0.9 percent in early trade, dragged by Fletcher Building Ltd , which lost as much as 13.8 percent after flagging a bigger loss for its buildings business in the 2018 fiscal year.
