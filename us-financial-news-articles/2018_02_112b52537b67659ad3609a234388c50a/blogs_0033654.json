FINRA would not comment on the report.\nIt isn't a stretch to imagine that regulators are examining the violent swings in the stock market last week that accompanied a spike in volatility. The VIX, as the index is better known, is calculated based on the price of S&P 500 options and was designed to be a barometer of traders' concerns about the near-term direction of the market.\nFor most of last year, the VIX traded in record low territory, but it spiked last week as the S&P 500 had a sharp sell-off. That sent shock waves through the markets and wiped out a Credit Suisse exchange-traded product linked to the VIX. On Monday, a person who would not identify himself, sent a letter to the SEC saying the VIX is subject to manipulation.\nThe Cboe , which derives an estimated 25 percent of its revenue from VIX-related products and trading activity, has tried to put a positive spin on events, saying its markets were orderly and functioning. But its shares sold off 18 percent last week. They are up 4 percent in Tuesday afternoon trading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T21:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T21:58:15.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
