REUTERS/Max Rossi “Surely, we can pray but not only: each one of us can say ‘no’ to violence in their own way, because victories obtained through violence are false victories, while working for peace benefits all,” he said.\nHe specifically invited non-Catholics and non-Christians to join the initiative in any way they saw fit, “but all together”.\nFrancis said the prayers and fasting should be offered in a particular way for the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.\nSouth Sudan has been hit by a prolonged civil war and humanitarian crisis. The Democratic Republic of Congo has been hit by unrest this month following the shooting of protesting pro-democracy churchgoers opposed to President Joseph Kabila.\nReporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Crispian Balmer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T14:08:09.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
