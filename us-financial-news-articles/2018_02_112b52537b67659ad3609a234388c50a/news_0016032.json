Morris won his in Vancouver in 2010, and Lawes got hers in Sochi in 2014. \nThe two were each 11-0 in Olympic curling play before Thursday’s loss.

I make any of them and we’re in a good position.” \nMixed doubles curling is one of four new events in the 2018 Winter Olympics and was the first event overall to kick off official competition. The Pyeongchang Olympics formally opens on Friday and runs through Feb. 25. Slideshow (4 Images) \nThe Norwegian’s victory featured a highlight-reel shot by Skaslien. A so-called “angle-raised takeout,” she knocked out the Canadians’ stones and ended up scoring three points in the second end of the match. \nIn most curling venues, it was a play that would have generated huge cheers from the stands, but the hometown crowd here at the Gangneung Curling Center only roared when the South Koreans, playing on the adjacent sheet, made a good play in their game against Finland. \n“It was quiet,” Skaslien said, “but I heard our commentator, our Norwegian commentator up in the stands say: ‘Oh what a shot!'” Reporting By Dan Burns; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T07:27:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
