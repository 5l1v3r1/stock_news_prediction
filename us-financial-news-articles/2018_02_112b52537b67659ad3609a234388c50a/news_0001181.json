The superpower is expected to pump $60 billion into its smaller regional neighbor as part of its Belt and Road Initiative , a massive infrastructure building plan to resurrect ancient trading routes across Asia and beyond.\n\"Investors may be getting in early in anticipation of big future gains,\" Henderson said.\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange, the company that operates financial markets in the country, is itself 40 percent owned by a Chinese consortium, Reuters reported a year ago.\nPakistan's rallying stocks come ahead of a politically turbulent background. Earlier in January, news broke that the U.S. was cutting $2 billion of aid to the country, accusing it of refusing to combat terrorism.\nIn addition, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was booted from office in July last year following allegations of corruption. No Pakistani prime minister has completed a full term in office since the country's formation in 1947.\n\"Pakistan's external position remains extremely vulnerable,\" Duncan Innes-Ker, regional director for Asia and Australia at advisory firm the Economist Intelligence Unit, told CNBC via email. \"Rising oil prices have pushed up its import bill.\"\nBut, Emad Mostaque, co-chief investment officer at emerging market specialists Capricorn Fund Managers, told CNBC via email: \"A rupee devaluation and rate hikes should stabilize inflation.\n\"We could see this rally continuing into elections given accelerating investment, improving politics and relatively low ownership. Pakistan is, however, a long-term play given the various forces at play and should be allocated to as such.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:03:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
