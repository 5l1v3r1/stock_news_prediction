(OTC Pink: IVST). Innovest Global, Inc. is a diversified holding company that focuses on acquiring niche, high-growth businesses that are capable of generating significant annual revenue. The company’s planned subsidiaries operate across biotech, telehealth, commercial energy, business-to-business distribution, national call center and auto sales.\nThe report provides an overview of Innovest Global, Inc., its subsidiaries, financials, industry analysis and more. The content also covers the global outlook for the LED lighting and energy efficiency industries.\nGlobal LED Lighting Market Forecast To Be Worth $92.40 Billion By 2022\nEnergy efficiency continues to be a growing trend within the global business community, as companies search for ways to cut costs and boost revenues. It is surprising to hear that there is still a massive amount of companies out there that continue to rely on decades-old, outdated, and inefficient energy solutions. Ultimately, running these inefficient systems leads to higher energy costs, as well as lower productivity.\nAccording to MarketsAndMarkets , the global LED lighting market is estimated to be worth $92.40 billion by 2022, which represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.66%. The market research firm sees the growth being driven by increasing demand for energy efficiency products, LED costs are falling, and overall greater adoption of the technology as a general lighting source.\nIn PwC’s “ 2017 Power and Utilities Trend ” report, analysts concluded that a vast majority of the growth will come from a “blueprint for a service-based model.” This would include: emerging technologies, monitoring equipment, sensors, energy management technology, and more.\nEven the recent U.S. tax overhaul could help the LED lighting industry, as the new code incentivizes companies to expand their “business investments.” Under the old tax code , companies would have to utilize a depreciation model to know when tax credits could be realized. Now, companies can receive all of the tax credits from major purchases and upgrades in year one. This provides companies with a massive incentive to take on much-needed efficiency upgrades.\nInnovest Launching Two Regional Development Offices, Massive Call Center Operation Planned\nInnovest Global, Inc. recently announced plans to begin expanding its energy division on a national scale. Management detailed plans to open two regional businesses development offices. One office will be located in Grand Rapids, Michigan and the other will be located in Demopolis, Alabama.\nManagement plans on establishing strategic partnerships with highly-qualified customer service & sales agents and electricians local to Grand Rapids and Demopolis. The customer service and sales agents will be solely focused on developing leads, client acquisition, customer service, and more.\nAs new clients are brought on board, the quality local electrician will be contracted to complete the installation work. Management has noted the importance of implementing extensive training procedures to ensure that the Innovest Global’s trademark quality customer service is thoroughly represented at its new offices.\nCoinciding with the regional office expansion will be a massive call center operation. The operation will be focused on expanding the customer base into small commercial energy businesses. This will complement the existing midsize-ranged client base held by the energy division.\nInnovest also recently announced that it has appointed current president of Shepherd Energy Solutions, Damon Mintz, to lead the entire Innovest Energy Group subsidiary. Mr. Mintz has an expansive history in the energy sector, which involved founding and managing companies generating revenues between $10-30 million annually.\n“Damon is a natural leader, and a proven rainmaker in the energy business,” details Innovest Global, Inc. (OTC Pink: IVST) CEO, Dan Martin. “Shepherd came under the Innovest umbrella recently, and since that time he has initiated so much expansion and growth, and industry referrals, with so much enthusiasm, that the best way we could capitalize on that was to give him authority over the entire energy effort. I couldn’t ask for anything more from a new team, and that work ethic and attention to detail is why I believe Innovest is poised to surpass our goals.”\nInnovest announced that it has generated revenues of $388,000, through half of the first quarter 2018. This beat management’s estimates by 55% and puts the company well on its way to beating its goal of reporting $500,000 in revenue per quarter.\nManagement has been very pleased with its customer feedback and testimonials, which shows the company continues to earn high marks for its customer service and job completion.\n“As happy as I am about how well our team has gelled, and our sales results, I’m even happier with the positive response from our clients. That’s a great testament to the professionalism and excellence of our team,” detailed Dan Martin, CEO of Innovest Global, Inc. (OTC Pink: IVST).\nAside from the biotech division, sales growth, and customer feedback, management has also noted in recent press releases that the company continues to search for quality acquisitions, as it processes its growing pipeline. Furthermore, Innovest is currently vetting PCAOB auditors to be engaged with the company and assist with auditing the financials.\nFor more information on Innovest Global, Inc., please visit http://innovestglobal.com and http://spotlightgrowth.com/index.php/2018/02/22/innovest-global-inc-otc-pink-ivst-announces-major-expansion-plans-energy-division-reports-mid-quarter-revenue-388k/\nSpotlightGrowth.com is a digital hub for micro-caps, small-caps, crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and other emerging growth investors.
