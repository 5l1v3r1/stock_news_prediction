Losses on loans were down to $1.36 billion, from over $4 billion when Winters arrived.\nChair of the bank’s remuneration committee Christine Hodgson said group-wide pay increase reflected the bank’s improved financial performance and progress against its strategic objectives.\nAcross the bank, 139 people earned more than 1 million euros ($1.23 million), the bank disclosed in complying with European rules, with the highest earners raking in between 5 million and 9 million euros.\nShareholders in recent years have criticized the bank for keeping staff pay levels flat or even increasing them, while slashing dividend payouts as the bank’s losses on bad loans mounted and profits fell.\nWinters defended an increase to the bonus pool of 5 percent last year even as the bank canceled its dividend and the rest of the banking industry cut bonuses back due to underwhelming results.\nThe bank reported a gender pay gap of 30 percent in Britain, meaning it on average paid women 30 percent less per hour than men due to lower levels of women in senior roles at the bank.\nReporting by Emma Rumney and Lawrence White; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:06:32.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
