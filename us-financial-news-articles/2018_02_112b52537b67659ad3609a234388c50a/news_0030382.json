The facility is unsecured and there are no financial covenants, Anglo Asian said in a statement.\nIt will use $13.5 million of the loan to repay existing loans to Amsterdam Trade Bank N.V., Gazprombank (Switzerland) Ltd., Anglo Asian’s CEO Reza Vaziri and Azeri Yapi Credit Bank, the company said.\nAnglo Asian said last week that its gold output would rise to 64,000-70,000 ounces in 2018, from 59,617 ounces last year, and it expects its total metal production to increase to 78,000-84,000 gold equivalent ounces (GEO) in 2018, from 71,461 ounces last year.\nAnglo Asian began production at Gedabek, the bigger of two mines it operates, in July 2009 with plans to extract 22 tonnes of gold. It eventually plans to develop seven mines in western Azerbaijan, including Gedabek, with estimated gold reserves of 430 tonnes in total.
