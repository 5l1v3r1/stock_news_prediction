Crude production is at its lowest levels in many years.\nThe OPEC nation is also behind on more than $1.6 billion in payments across sovereign debt and that of state oil company PDVSA, Japanese bank Nomura said in a recent note to investors.\n“The negotiation and restructuring processes of our international debt is impeccable, going better than I could have hoped which demonstrates it was the correct decision,” Maduro told reporters.\nOil accounts for some 95 percent of Venezuela’s export revenue.\nVenezuela said oil output rose in January to 1.8 million bpd, according to OPEC. However, the oil cartel’s secondary sources reported the true figure was just 1.6 million bpd, its lowest monthly figure in more than a decade and a half.\nCrude production fell 13 percent in 2018 from the previous year, according to OPEC.\nIt was the biggest decline among OPEC members, who have pledged to restrain output through 2018.\nBut unlike voluntary cuts by other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries intended to stoke higher crude prices, Venezuela has been unable to stop a six-year-long production decline.\nWhile the government has vowed to stay current on its debt, it has also deferred payments into grace periods and beyond. It blames U.S. sanctions for delays.\nCritics blame the crisis on strict currency and price controls and deep corruption at high levels in government.\n(This story corrects to 250,000 bpd from 200,000 bpd)\nEditing by David Gregorio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:13:02.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
