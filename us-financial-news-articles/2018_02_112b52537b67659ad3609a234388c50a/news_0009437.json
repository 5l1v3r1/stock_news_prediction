About 2,000 owners opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation. The first trials could potentially set a template for the remaining suits. \nThe monkey tests were also sponsored by Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and both said this week they had suspended or moved staff linked to the testing. VW said the monkey tests were approved by an independent review board to protect animals.
