This enables the creation of appropriate pricing and increases the exposure of investors from Israel and abroad. The goal of the analysis project is to encourage investments in these companies by removing the barrier of a lack of understanding in the market.\nIn order to maintain professional, independent and unbiased analysis, the companies signed an agreement with the TASE to receive the analysis services for an obligatory period of two years. The companies cannot withdraw from the project during this period. The analysis is funded by the companies surveyed with funding from the Chief Scientist and the TASE.\nSummary of Highlights\nEntera's unsuccessful NASDAQ IPO is not expected to have a significant impact on its clinical plans. On 28 th January, the company reported that Entera announced on 26 th January 2018 that it had not completed its IPO and listing process as planned. Entera announced it is examining various available alternatives for raising capital. To our understanding, the effect of the incomplete offering on Entera's clinical plans is immaterial. The company is currently preparing for Phase 2b/3 clinical trials, which are scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2018. Beforehand, the company will conduct a preliminary trial to examine Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics in the drug. Financially, it should be noted that Entera recently completed a $12.4 million financing round, and therefore, in our opinion, the company presently has sufficient funding to complete the necessary preparations prior to initiating the aforementioned experiment. At the same time, Entera expects to try and raise public or private capital in the coming months. If Entera manages to raise enough capital, there will be no delay in the clinical development programme. In light of all these considerations, we have maintained the company's value at approximately $30.9 million; a target price of $0.23 per share. The estimated valuation for the company in NIS is 106.7 million; a target price of NIS 0.79 per share (according to the exchange rate at US market close on February 2, 2018).\nAbout the Company\nIsraeli holdings firm DNA Biomedical Solutions Ltd.
