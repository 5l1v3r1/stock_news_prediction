For 2016, it reported an 8.4 percent increase in rupiah terms.\nIndonesia has sought to scale back a so-called “negative investment list” that restricts or caps sectors open to foreign investors. In February 2016, President Joko Widodo’s administration opened up sectors ranging from e-commerce and telecommunication equipment in a move dubbed “Big Bang”.\nBut Widodo’s pledge to revise the list further is yet to materialise.\nThe revision “is in process. The president has instructed us to evaluate this but let’s abide by the existing one for now,” Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita said on Friday.\nOn Wednesday, Widodo warned that Indonesia was losing out to neighbours in export markets.\n“This big country of Indonesia is inferior to Thailand in terms of exports. With enormous resources and human resources, we are losing. There is something wrong and something has to be changed,” the state news agency Antara Quote: d him as saying in a speech at the Trade Ministry.\nLukita said overcomplicated regulations and red tape were also obstructing foreign trade agreements. Indonesia had only reached one free trade deal in the past eight years, with Chile, he said.\n$1 = 13,448 rupiah Editing by Ed Davies and Richard Borsuk\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:29:51.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
