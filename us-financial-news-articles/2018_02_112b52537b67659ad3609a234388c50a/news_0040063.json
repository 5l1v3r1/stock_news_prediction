The houses were built illegally and authorities had previously asked the residents to leave, officials said.\n“Up to now 17 dead bodies were recovered. We fear more might be unaccounted for. So we will keep searching for bodies buried underneath the garbage pile,” a councillor for Ka Mavota Municipal District, Despedida Rita, told reporters.\nLand pressure in many African cities leads some people to squat on land they do not own as they seek higher wages available in urban centres. The dwellings are sometimes built on land that is marginal or unsafe.\nReporting by Manuel Mucari; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:08:35.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
