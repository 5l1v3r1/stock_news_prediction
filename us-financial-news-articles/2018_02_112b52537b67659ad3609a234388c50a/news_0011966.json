Boeing is attacking the A330neo wherever it pops up,” said the fleet manager of a large Western airline. \nSeveral U.S. airlines and low-cost, long-haul carriers such as Level, part of the IAG group, are comparing the Boeing 787 and the recently upgraded A330neo as competition intensifies, market sources said. \nEven AirAsia, Airbus’s top Asian customer, has said it is considering the Boeing 787 for long-haul operations, in what would be a significant upset for the European company. \nAirbus officials were not available for comment. INTERNAL GOAL \nBoeing’s potential new mid-market jet would seat 225 to 275 people and enter service in the middle of next decade, senior vice president Dinesh Keskar told reporters, adding interest was coming from markets like Australia, India and the Middle East. \nAsked about expectations that Boeing would launch the plane this year, he said, “Certainly the interest is there and we continue to have our dialogue with customers”. \nAirbus argues it already controls much of that space with its 185-240-seat A321neo, which boasts 80 percent of comparable sales, and the albeit less-in-demand A330neo wide-body. \nBut despite winning the 2017 order battle thanks to a record deal for small jets, Airbus took a severe hit in the high-margin wide-body market, where Boeing won three times as many orders. \nAirbus has shrugged off the loss, claiming a 50 percent share of average sales over 10 years. But privately, it has made closing the gap its top internal goal this year, sources say. \nThese concerns have intensified as Airbus faces a wave of new departures following the retirement of sales chief John Leahy, who is in Singapore this week to facilitate the handover to his successor, ex-Rolls-Royce executive Eric Schulz. \n“The A330neo is a big priority for Airbus this year in sales,” BOC Aviation Chief Executive Robert Martin told Reuters. \n“There are new markets opening up this year for mid-sized wide bodies. India is probably going to have more growth ... Maybe some of the U.S. majors will add to their growth. I think we are going to see a big battleground in this area.” Additional reporting by Brenda Goh.
