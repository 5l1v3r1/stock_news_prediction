It demanded that the government never impose unreasonable regulation on virtual currency trading.\nThe government has to produce an official response within a month for a petition that gathers more than 200,000 signatures.\nSouth Korea, which has become a cryptocurrency trading hub after a market frenzy that attracted even housewives and students, has already imposed some regulations on cryptocurrency trading.\nIt banned the use of anonymous bank accounts for virtual coin trading as of January 30, but said it does not intend to go as far as shutting down domestic exchanges.\n“But, the government is still divided with many opinions ranging from an outright ban on cryptocurrency trading to bringing the institutions that handle the currency into the system,” Hong said, adding that the government will thoroughly review the industry within global norms.\nSouth Korea will also develop ways to tax virtual currencies, led by the finance ministry, and should announce measures within the first half of the year to develop the blockchain industry, Hong added.\nReporting by Dahee Kim; Additional reporting by Christine Kim; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T05:51:15.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
