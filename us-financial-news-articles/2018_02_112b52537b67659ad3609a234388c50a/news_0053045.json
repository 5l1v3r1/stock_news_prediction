Analysts on average were expecting same-store sales to rise 1.8 percent, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.\nNet income rose to $159.3 million, or 64 cents per share, from $28.9 million, or 11 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, benefiting from a $121.6 million gain due to changes in the U.S. tax law.\nExcluding items, the company earned 11 cents per share, in line with the analysts’ estimates.\nTotal revenue fell 0.2 percent to $309.2 million, below the average analyst estimate of $313.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nShares of the company fell 1.4 percent to $16 after the bell.\nReporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:01:15.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
