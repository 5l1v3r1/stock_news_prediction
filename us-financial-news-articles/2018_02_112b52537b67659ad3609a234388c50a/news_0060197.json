(Nasdaq:TICC) (“TICC,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) announced today its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and announced a distribution of $0.20 per share for the quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, net asset value per share was $7.55 compared with the net asset value per share as of September 30, 2017 of $7.43.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017 we recorded net investment income of approximately $7.6 million, or approximately $0.15 per share. In the fourth quarter, we recorded net realized losses of approximately $1.0 million, and net unrealized appreciation of approximately $9.8 million. In total we had a net increase in net assets from operations of approximately $16.4 million, or approximately $0.32 per share.\nOur core net investment income (“Core NII”) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $9.0 million, or approximately $0.17 per share.\nCore NII represents net investment income adjusted for additional cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) equity investments and also excludes any capital gains incentive fees we recognize but have no obligation to pay in any period. ( See additional information under “Supplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income” below ).\nWhile our experience has been that cash flow distributions have historically represented useful indicators of our CLO equity investments’ annual taxable income during certain periods, we believe that current and future cash flow distributions may represent less accurate indicators of taxable income with respect to our CLO equity investments than they have in the past. Accordingly, our taxable income may be materially different than either GAAP NII or Core NII.\nTotal investment income for the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to approximately $13.4 million, which represents a decrease of approximately $1.1 million from the third quarter of 2017.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we recorded investment income from our portfolio as follows:\napproximately $5.6 million from our debt investments,\napproximately $7.2 million from our CLO equity investments, and\napproximately $0.6 million from all other sources.\nOur total expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $5.8 million, down by approximately $1.9 million compared to the third quarter of 2017. The primary driver of that decrease was lower interest expense for the quarter on our outstanding debt.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017:\nWe made investments of approximately $40.7 million in corporate loan investments. We received proceeds of approximately $15.2 million and $2.0 million from sales of our CLO equity investments and corporate loan investments, respectively.\nWe received or were entitled to receive proceeds of approximately $30.2 million from repayments, sales and amortization payments on our corporate loan investments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average yield of our debt investments at current cost was approximately 9.7%, compared with 9.5% as of September 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was approximately 15.6%, compared with 15.9% as of September 30, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was approximately 20.2%, compared with 17.5% as of September 30, 2017.\nOur weighted average credit rating on a fair value basis was 2.2 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 (compared to 2.2 at the end of the third quarter of 2017).\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no investments on non-accrual status.\nOur board of directors has declared the following distribution on our common stock:\nQuarter Ending Record Date Payment Date Amount Per Share March 31, 2018 March 16, 2018 March 30, 2018 $0.20 On February 5, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new program for the purpose of repurchasing up to $25.0 million worth of the Company’s common stock.\nSupplemental Information Regarding Core Net Investment Income\nOn a supplemental basis, we provide information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted for additional cash distributions received, or entitled to be received (if any, in either case), on our CLO equity investments (excluding those cash distributions believed to represent a return of capital) and also excludes any capital gains incentive fees we recognize but have no obligation to pay in any period. The Company did not recognize any capital gains incentive fees for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nIncome from investments in the “equity” class securities of CLO vehicles, for GAAP purposes, is recorded using the effective interest method based upon an effective yield to the expected redemption utilizing estimated cash flows compared to the cost, resulting in an effective yield for the investment; the difference between the actual cash received or distributions entitled to be received and the effective yield calculation is an adjustment to cost. Accordingly, investment income recognized on CLO equity securities in the GAAP statement of operations differs from the cash distributions actually received by us during the period (referred to below as “CLO equity additional distributions”).\nFurther, in order to continue to qualify to be taxed as a regulated investment company (“RIC”), we are required, among other things, to distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income annually. Therefore, core net investment income may provide a better indication of estimated taxable income for a reporting period than does GAAP net investment income, although we can offer no assurance that will be the case as the ultimate tax character of our earnings cannot be determined until tax returns are prepared after the end of a fiscal year. We note that these non-GAAP measures may not be useful indicators of taxable earnings, particularly during periods of market disruption and volatility and our taxable income may differ materially from our core net investment income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to Core NII for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Amount Per Share\nAmounts Amount Per Share\nAmounts Net investment income $ 7,628,828 $ 0.148 $ 30,726,730 $ 0.597 CLO equity additional distributions 1,347,464 0.026 5,680,872 0.110 Core net investment income $ 8,976,292 $ 0.174 $ 36,407,602 $ 0.707\nWe will host a conference call to discuss our fourth quarter results today, Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 10:00 AM ET.
