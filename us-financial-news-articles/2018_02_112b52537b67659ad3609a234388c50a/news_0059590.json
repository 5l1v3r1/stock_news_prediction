One would allow teachers to carry firearms in the classroom and another would raise the minimum purchase age for military-style assault rifles from 18 to 21.\nState and local governments should be allowed to decide whether to arm teachers, Ryan said.\nThe 14 students and three adult educators killed in Florida were shot with a semi-automatic AR-15-style assault weapon. Authorities say it was purchased legally last year by the accused gunman, Nikolas Cruz, when he was 18 years old.
