It was the second such conference held since world leaders agreed in Paris in 2015 on a goal of slowing the rise in average global temperatures.\nExecutive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa gives a speech during the Women4Climate conference in Mexico City, Mexico February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Romero “It is clear the battle will be fought especially in urban areas,” said Patricia Espinosa, the current UNFCCC head.\n“It’s clear if we want to face climate change, women and girls from all the world should be central actors,” she said. “We have little time left.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Extreme weather related to climate change is hitting urban areas, said Salt Lake City, Utah Mayor Jackie Biskupski.\nShe said the western U.S. city is warming at double the global rate, affecting the snowfall it depends upon for water.\nRome’s Mayor Virginia Raggi said her city planned to ban diesel-fueled cars from its centre, plant thousands of trees and invest in zero-emissions busses.\n“Cities can do a lot to make a difference on climate, but just like women, cities can’t be expected to change the world all by themselves,” said Andrea Reimer, a Vancouver, Canada city official.\nReporting by Sophie Hares, Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst.
