It offered them an option to sell any stakes in coming years. \nThe infrastructure fund indicated it would keep Italo Chairman Luca Cordero di Montezemolo and CEO Flavio Cattaneo in their roles. \nItalo said a deal needed to be cleared by the European sector authority. $1 = 0.8057 euros Writing by Francesca Landini; Editing by Edmund Blair", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T23:23:29.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
