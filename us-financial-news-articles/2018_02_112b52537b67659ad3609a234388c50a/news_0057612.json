During the last weeks of the campaign, the gap grew, with Trump's rate climbing to between $35 and $40, while Clinton's was around $20 to $25. \nA recent report in Wired , based on a statement from Brad Parscale, director of Trump's digital operations in 2016, suggested that Trump got a better deal on Facebook ads than did Clinton. This story argued that Facebook's advertising software had in effect rewarded some of the more-sensationalist and divisive Trump ads, which drew more interactions from those who saw them, by showing them to even more users. \nIf true, that would have lowered the CPM for Trump's ads. But that wasn't the case, according to Bosworth's tweets. \n\"Prices depend on factors like size of audience and campaign objective. These campaigns had different strategies. Given the recent discussion about pricing we're putting this out to clear up any confusion,\" Bosworth said on Twitter. \nTrump today named Parscale as manager of his 2020 re-election campaign. After some discussion we've decided to share the CPM comparison on Trump campaign ads vs. Clinton campaign ads.
