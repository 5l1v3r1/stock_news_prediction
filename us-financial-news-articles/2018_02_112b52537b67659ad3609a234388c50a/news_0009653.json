REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \nThe potential budget deal in the Senate could head off another round of last-minute posturing that preceded last month’s shutdown. \nThe Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on Tuesday evening on a stop-gap spending bill that would fund much of the government through March 23 and fund the military through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year. \nThat measure is not likely to survive unscathed in the Senate, where Republicans cannot pass spending bills without some Democratic support. McConnell and Schumer could incorporate their agreement on domestic and military spending into the stop-gap measure, which then would have to win passage in the House. \nCongress also faces another looming deadline, as the United States could have trouble paying its bills within weeks if lawmakers do not take the politically painful step of raising the debt ceiling.

IMMIGRATION ISSUE \nLawmakers have been struggling to reach a deal on an immigration bill, despite broad public support for helping Dreamers - hundreds of thousands of young Latinos who were allowed to study and work without fear of deportation under a program set up by Democratic former President Barack Obama. \nTrump last year ordered those protection removed by March 5, saying Congress should come up with a legislative solution. Related Coverage White House says Trump not advocating for government shutdown \nA federal court blocked the Trump administration last month from ending the program, and the administration’s appeal is pending before the Supreme Court. \nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress are trying to agree on bipartisan legislation that would protect Dreamers and boost border security. \nTrump has said any immigration deal must also include funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, along with changes to programs for legal immigration that would assess applicants on their skills, rather than their country of origin or ties to U.S. residents. Democrats oppose that idea. \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that any bill that comes up for a vote in the House must have Trump’s backing.
