All the others are legally obliged to adopt the single currency once they meet all the criteria.\nSeparately, the Commission proposed that there should be money available as a “stabilization function” for the euro zone to help protect its members from crises.\n“The stabilization function is to be built progressively over time, relying on back-to-back loans guaranteed by the EU budget, loans from the European Monetary Fund, a voluntary insurance mechanism based on national contributions as well as a grant component from the European budget,” the Commission said.\n“The amounts required from the EU budget would not necessarily need to be very high but would need to be significant enough to, for example, reduce the interest burden of the loans and provide incentives to properly implement the support scheme,” it said.\nThe Commission proposal is a compromise between the positions of France and Germany and builds on proposals of Klaus Regling, the head of the euro zone bailout fund ESM, which is to be transformed into the European Monetary Fund.\nRegling has suggested that a stabilization function for the euro zone could total between 1 and 2 percent of euro zone GDP and work on the basis of cheap loans for countries hit by crises not of their own making.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called last year a euro zone budget of several hundred billion euros financed from taxes while Germany did not want any separate budget at all.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:22:04.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
