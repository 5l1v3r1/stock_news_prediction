Confirming a press report in Italian daily Il Messaggero, the source said the percentage of writedowns required every year once a loan is classed as non-performing would rise gradually over time. The source added the draft envisaged gradual writedowns over two years for unsecured loans, of which 35 percent in the first year. The EU Commission was not immediately available for a comment.
