I got lucky.”\nSet up by a perfect feed from Park Yoon jung midway through the second period, Griffin moved up the right wing and managed to get a shot on Akane Konishi that dribbled through the Japan netminder’s pads.\n”After all the pressure and everything that is happening to our team to get a goal felt really good,“ said Korea’s Canadian coach Sarah Murray. ”It was so loud after Randi scored we couldn’t hear each other talk on the bench.\n“We just kind of gave each other a hug and refocused.”\nAdditional reporting by Dan Burns, Editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:28:47.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
