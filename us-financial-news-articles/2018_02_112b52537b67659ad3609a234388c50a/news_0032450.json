Although Airbus officials insist that should not be an issue until later this year, multiple industry sources call it a potential distraction.\nINTERNAL CANDIDATES The main internal candidate is Guillaume Faury, the former helicopter unit chief who steps into Bregier’s shoes next week.\nInsiders say he is not the only internal contender, however, with defense boss Dirk Hoke, 48, also in the ascendant, subject to the stability of the delayed A400M military project, which took another 1.3 billion euros of charges in 2017.\nAlso emerging as a potential candidate, according to two industry sources, is Harald Wilhelm, who has overseen a rise in Airbus shares to record levels since becoming finance chief in 2012.\nWilhelm, 51, is among the few who bridged the rift between Enders and Bregier and worked smoothly with both.\nThe board is expected to examine fresh blood such as Thales ( TCFP.PA ) CEO Patrice Caine, two other industry sources said.\nLe Figaro newspaper reported on Thursday former Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) chief Alexandre de Juniac, currently head of the International Air Transport Association, could be a candidate.\nNone of the individuals cited could be reached for comment.\nAn Airbus spokesman said: “We don’t engage in any such speculation and have no comment.”\nEnders has acknowledged his time is limited but told staff in January he would remain fully focused on strategic initiatives such as digitalization.\nSome analysts warn the year-long transition may however put pressure on Enders to demonstrate he is more than a caretaker, as the group faces industrial and commercial challenges.\n“It is a concern; not that he would abandon his duties, but you need someone with the authority to be able to negotiate with politicians, suppliers and customers,” said analyst Richard Aboulafia, a veteran Airbus watcher at U.S.-based Teal Group.\n“In this career-sunset phase there are concerns about being a lame duck and that can weaken your position,” he added.\nAdditional reporting by Sabine Siebold and Andrea Shalal; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:34:56.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
