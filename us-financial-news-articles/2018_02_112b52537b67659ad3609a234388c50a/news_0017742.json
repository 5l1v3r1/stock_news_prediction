The daughter of one of the security guards was held hostage in France but then released. There were no injuries,” it said in a statement that gave no estimated value of the amount stolen. \nA French police source, confirming a report on French radio Europe 1, told Reuters in Lyon, France that the armoured van was believed to be carrying 15 to 30 million Swiss francs (£11.5 million - £23 million euros) in cash. \nEurope 1 reported that the woman had been held hostage by men pretending to be plumbers at her home in Lyon, France. \nTwelve Swiss police patrol cars and investigators were deployed in the operation and a criminal case has been opened, the Vaud police statement said, appealing for witnesses.
