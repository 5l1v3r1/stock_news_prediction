Kim Il Sung founded North Korea in 1948 and his family has ruled it ever since.\n”We’re following the example of our neighbour,’ wrote another user.\nThe comments were removed late on Sunday after Weibo, China’s answer to Twitter, began blocking the search term “two term limit”.\nIn an unusual step amid intense international media attention, China’s foreign ministry, which normally only comments on diplomatic matters, said amending the constitution was a matter for the Chinese people.\nSince 1954, when the constitution was first adopted, everybody can see that it has been “continuously improved”, spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing.\n“I hope everyone can acknowledge the voice of all the Chinese people.”\nThe U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed constitutional changes, but speaking at a White House event on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump heaped praise on Xi for his help on North Korea.\n“I think that President Xi is unique,” Trump said, highlighting his personal relationship with the Chinese leader, but making no mention of the proposed changes.\n“China has really done more probably than they’ve ever done because of my relationship - we have a very good relationship,” Trump said. “We have a very good relationship. But President Xi is for China and I‘m for the United States.”\nTrump has had a complex relationship with China since taking office last year, repeatedly threatening tough action against Beijing over trade and putting the countering of China, as well as Russia, at the center of a new defense strategy announced last month.\nAt the same time, Trump has gone out of his way to personally praise Xi and stress the importance of their close personal relationship built up in one-on-one summit meetings.\nA woman picks a souvenir necklace with a portrait of Chinese President Xi Jinping from a selection that also includes necklaces featuring late Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong at a stall in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas Peter STATE MEDIA China’s widely read state-run newspaper, the Global Times, said in an editorial the change did not mean the country’s president will stay in office for ever, though it did not offer much explanation.\n“Since reform and opening up, China, led by the Communist Party, has successfully resolved and will continue to effectively resolve the issue of party and national leadership replacement in a law-abiding and orderly manner,” it said, referring to landmark economic reforms that began four decades ago.\nThe party’s official People’s Daily reprinted a long article by Xinhua news agency saying most people supported the constitutional amendments, quoting a variety of people proffering support.\n“The broad part of officials and the masses say that they hoped this constitutional reform is passed,” it wrote.\nSlideshow (7 Images) The WeChat account of the People’s Daily, after initially posting a flurry of positive comments under its article, then disabled the comments section completely late on Sunday. It was back again by Monday, complete with remarks lauding the party.\nThe overseas edition of the same paper’s WeChat account removed entirely an article focusing on the term limits, replacing it with the lengthy Xinhua report summing up all the amendment proposals.\nIn one confusing moment for many Chinese, Xinhua initially only reported the news in English.\nJokes have also circulated on social media. One shows a picture of a condom in its wrapper under the words “doing it twice is not enough”.\nOthers shared pictures of Winnie the Pooh, an internet meme that plays on Xi’s supposed likeness to the rotund cartoon bear, an image censors have repeatedly tried to remove.\nParts of the stock market took heart from the news. Chinese speculators pounced on stocks with “emperor” in their name on Monday.\nRelated Coverage 'Emperor' stocks soar in China as Xi cleared for indefinite reign The decision has also unsettled some in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, where authorities have been trying to rein in a pro-democracy movement.\n“This move, which would allow for a single individual to amass and accumulate political power, means that China would again have a dictator as her head of state - Xi Jinping,” said Joshua Wong, one of the movement’s leaders.\n“The law may exist in China in form, but this just proves that the Chinese law exists to serve the individual and the party’s purposes.”\nChina is likely to see any such criticism as a plot against the party.\n“Every time China deliberates on reforms and key decisions, effect on public opinion is worth pondering,” the Global Times wrote. “Misinformation and external forces’ meddling will affect public opinion in China.”\nStill, on China’s streets, there was some support for Xi staying on.\n“I think in our country, nowadays, many policies, such as deepening reforms, need more continuity,” said Beijing resident Zhao Yisu, 42. “Particularly in politics, I believe stable leadership is good.”\nReporting by Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina; Additional reporting by Reuters Television, and Venus Wu in Hong Kong and David Brunnstrom, Doina Chiacu and Roberta Rampton in Washington; Editing by Michael Perry, Clarence Fernandez and Paul Simao\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T07:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T08:11:47.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
