The Company now expects fourth quarter 2017 net sales of $138.5 million and a comparable sales decline of 15%, both at the high end of guidance. The guidance ranges, noted in the Company’s January 4, 2018 press release, were net sales of $137 million to $139 million with a comparable sales decline of 15% to 17%.\nAs noted in the January 4, 2018 press release, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act prompted a non-cash write-down of the Company’s deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter 2017. This is anticipated to increase tax expense by approximately $3 million to $4 million, or approximately $0.08 to $0.11 per diluted share. As a result, fourth quarter 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.07 to $0.11. Excluding the write-down of the deferred tax asset and related tax expense increase, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now estimated to be $0.18 to $0.19. This is at the low end of the prior guidance of $0.18 to $0.23 as the Company continued to take actions to address slow-selling merchandise.\nFiscal year 2017 GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.43. Excluding the write-down of the deferred tax asset and related tax expense increase, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now estimated to be $0.50 to $0.51. This compares with prior adjusted earnings per share guidance of $0.50 to $0.55.\nFor fiscal 2018, the Company expects the effective tax rate to decrease to approximately 26% based on the new tax legislation.\nThe Company’s priorities in fiscal 2018 are to drive improved comparable sales performance through improved merchandising, while continuing to make strategic investments for the future that will drive long term sustainable growth and shareholder value. While new boutiques produce favorable financial returns, the Company believes it is prudent to moderate boutique openings in 2018 as it focuses on improving merchandising and investing in existing boutiques and infrastructure. The Company expects to open approximately 35 new boutiques in high traffic locations while also refreshing approximately 80 to 90 high volume existing boutiques. Additionally, the Company has increased performance expectations of existing boutiques and, as a result, will close approximately 20 boutiques.\nThe Company will remain vigilant on expenses and capital management to ensure it continues to invest in future growth. The Company plans to continue to allocate cash within its stated capital allocation framework. The priorities for excess cash are boutique and ecommerce investments, infrastructure investments and share repurchases.\nSteve Lawrence, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our primary focus in fiscal 2018 will be to continue aligning our merchandise assortments with our core guest and execute the strategic initiatives we have previously communicated. We believe this will stabilize our business, drive improved financial performance and enable us to enhance shareholder value.” Mr. Lawrence added, “In fiscal 2017, we made significant investments in our infrastructure to develop a stronger foundation for our future. We will continue to enhance those investments and we expect to see the benefit of these investments take hold in fiscal 2018 and beyond. We look forward to sharing more details around our plans for 2018 on our next earnings call.”\nEarnings Conference Call\nfrancesca’s ® plans to release fiscal fourth quarter 2017 financial results on March 27, 2018. The company will host a conference call on that day at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss fourth quarter 2017 results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this release are \"forward-looking statements\" made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
