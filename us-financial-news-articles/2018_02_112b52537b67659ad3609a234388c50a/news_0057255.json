The comprehensive rebrand follows Fisher’s 2017 acquisition of PPC and aims to reaffirm the company’s strong market presence while unifying the corporate identity of the two subsidiaries.\nAs part of the official rebranding launch, Fisher unveiled a new logo for PPC Flexible Packaging and outlined the proposed scope of work for the campaign. Fisher plans to incorporate the new logo across print and digital collateral, including a re-designed website. Fisher CEO Kevin Keneally indicates the rebranding efforts signal the next step in the company’s growth within the packaging industry.\n“Fisher Container and PPC are both successful leaders in the packaging industry,” said Mr. Keneally. “After the merger, we knew we had an opportunity to create a new brand identity that would showcase our innovation and speed to market. PPC Flexible Packaging now has a visual identity that captures our quality, service, and technology in a bold way and we’re very proud of that.”\nIn addition to creating a new visual identity for the company, the rebrand will highlight PPC Flexible Packaging’s focus on two primary market segments—consumer packaging and precision clean packaging. The consumer division focuses on food, “better for you,” organic, snack, produce, bakery, and pet food retail packaging, while the precision clean division focuses on healthcare, clean room, critical environment, and microelectronic packaging. Fisher will visually display the names of the two segments in conjunction with the new logo in internal and external communications. Mr. Keneally believes this will further strengthen brand presence within the packaging industry.\n“We are committed to providing speed to market, value, and quality in a highly-diverse industry, and our well-defined focus helps us achieve this goal,” said Mr. Keneally. “We look forward to seeing our company grow and thrive through acquisitions and organic growth as our rebranding vision materializes in the coming months.”\nFisher plans to launch PPC Flexible Packaging’s re-designed company website later this year.\nAbout Fisher Container Holdings, LLC:\nBased in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, Fisher is a leading provider of cleanroom and consumer packaging for the healthcare, snack, organic, “better-for-you,” and produce markets.
