The company also announced that Scott Stabler, executive vice president, internal audit, is moving into a new role as HII’s executive vice president and chief transformation officer, reporting to Mike Petters, HII’s president and CEO.\n“Mike has excelled in a variety of leadership positions since joining HII,” Petters said. “I am confident his experience—including his time leading corporate development of HII’s nuclear and environmental services before the creation of Technical Solutions—will build on SN3’s legacy and leverage the full complement of HII’s expertise for additional nuclear and environmental work, which we see as our largest growth opportunity.”\nSmith joined HII in 2014 as corporate vice president, business growth. In January 2015, he was named vice president, corporate development, nuclear and environmental services, where he was responsible for executing the growth strategy in commercial and government nuclear markets. In 2016, he became HII’s executive vice president, strategy and development. Before joining HII, Smith worked for BAE Systems, where he served as sector vice president, business development, strategy and planning, for the Support Solutions sector. He is a graduate of Stanford University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in industrial engineering and a master’s in engineering management.\nWith this management change, HII’s strategy and development team will move back to business management, reporting to Chris Kastner, executive vice president, business management, and chief financial officer.\nIn his new role, Stabler will work directly with HII’s divisions to assess and facilitate implementation of the transformative business model and process changes necessary to meet rapidly evolving customer demands. The scope is open-ended but will initially focus on HII’s digital, technological and supply chain strategies.\n“Scott has been an integral part of HII’s success since we formed in 2011 and of Newport News Shipbuilding for more than 25 years,” Petters said. “The breadth and depth of his experience in engineering, program management, supply chain management and business development—as well as his perspective from leading corporate’s operations—make him the ideal candidate to lead the transformation effort.”\nStabler joined Newport News Shipbuilding in 1984 and has held progressively responsible positions in engineering, purchasing, business development and program management. He was appointed vice president of assembly in 1999 and vice president of aircraft carrier construction in 2000. He was directly responsible for program management and construction of the last Nimitz -class aircraft carrier, USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77), from the contract award in 2001 until successful builder’s sea trials in 2009. He went on to serve as vice president of supply chain management and was vice president of corporate operations during HII’s stand-up as an independent business in 2011. He was named HII’s chief audit executive in 2013. He earned a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from North Carolina State University and a master’s degree in business administration from the College of William and Mary.\nStabler will continue to lead Internal Audit until a replacement can be identified.\nPhotos of Smith and Stabler are available at: https://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/leadership-smith-stabler .\nHII Technical Solutions is a professional services business providing solutions to a variety of government and commercial customers worldwide.
