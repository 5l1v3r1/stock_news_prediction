Appointments will be partly based on how much business the banks do with Thomson Reuters, the sources said.\nOnce the bank group is complete, the highly anticipated US$14bn financing is expected to launch for wider syndication to institutional investors in March, the sources said.\nBlackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment.\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS Recent market volatility has had a destabilising effect on the debt markets, which could be exacerbated by Wednesday’s US inflation figures.\nThe financing was underwritten before stock markets slumped on February 2, and the three lead banks may wait until market conditions are more stable to launch the deal.\n“US inflation figures will be a catalyst ... I would expect they (the lead banks) will want to see how the next few days play out, then they’ll either rush it out or hold out and hope things improve,” a senior investor said.\nProlonged volatility could encourage banks joining the deal to negotiate for better fees and titles to compensate for increased market risk, the investor said.\nThe jumbo deal is being run from New York and will require participation from nearly all Transatlantic loan and bond investors in order to play markets off against each other and achieve best execution for the borrower.\nSecondary prices are a key indicator of volatility and sentiment and could also dictate timing as falling bids often encourage investors to seek more compensation.\nBanks and investors are confident that the financing will be well received as cash-rich funds are eager to put fresh capital to work in size, the sources said.\nDEAL STRUCTURE The debt will be mainly denominated in dollars and bankers are currently assessing how much will be denominated in euros. Even a small euro tranche could mean €1bn-€2bn of debt being syndicated in Europe, the sources said.\nA US$14bn financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on last 12 months Ebitda of approximately US$1.7bn for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of US$8bn-$9bn, and junior debt of US$4bn-$5bn, sources said.\nAnother source familiar with the matter said previously that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.\nBlackstone will acquire a 55% stake in the F&R business and Thomson Reuters will retain a 45% holding.\nLoan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.
