Taiwan’s Foxconn is formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co ( 2317.TW ).\nThe mobile handsets maker had already warned in November that it expects to post a net loss for 2017.\nFIH Mobile said on Tuesday it estimated its 2017 turnover to exceed $12 billion, compared to $6.2 billion a year ago. It gave no further details.\nFull-year impairment loss of its investment portfolio is estimated at $215 million, the company added. It has not said when it will release detailed financial results for 2017.\nBefore the loss announcement, FIH Mobile shares ended up 2.3 percent on Tuesday, compared to a 0.8 percent fall for the benchmark Hang Seng Index .HSI\nReporting by Twinnie Siu; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:13:59.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
