The militants have responded with attacks in Kabul in the past few weeks, killing nearly 150 people.\nThe overall civilian toll last year of 3,438 killed and 7,015 wounded was 9 percent lower than the previous year. But the figures highlighted the high number of casualties caused by militant bombs, the United Nations said.\n“Attacks where anti-government elements deliberately targeted civilians accounted for 27 per cent of the total civilian casualties ... mainly from suicide and complex attacks,” the United Nations said in a statement.\nThe deadliest attack since the U.N. mission began recording civilian casualties in 2009 was in Kabul on May 31 when a suicide attacker detonated a truck bomb, killing 92 civilians and injuring 491.\nTwo-thirds of all casualties last year were inflicted by anti-government forces, with the Taliban responsible for 42 percent, Islamic State 10 percent and 13 percent caused by undetermined anti-government elements.\nPro-government forces caused a fifth of civilian casualties with 16 percent attributed to Afghan forces, 2 per cent to international forces and 1 percent each to pro-government armed groups and undetermined pro-government forces, the United Nations said.\nThe air campaign by international and government forces accounted for 6 percent of civilian casualties in 2017, with 295 people killed and 336 wounded, a 7 percent increase over the previous year.\nWhile ground clashes were the second leading cause of civilian casualties, that toll was 19 percent lower than a record level seen in 2016.\nWomen and children were heavily affected by the violence with 359 women killed last year, an increase of 5 percent over the previous year - and 865 injured.\nThe number of child casualties - 861 killed and 2,318 wounded - was 10 percent lower than 2016.\n“Afghan civilians have been killed going about their daily lives - traveling on a bus, praying in a mosque, simply walking past a building that was targeted,” U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al Hussein said in a statement.\n“Such attacks are prohibited under international humanitarian law and are likely, in most cases, to constitute war crimes. The perpetrators must be identified and held accountable.”\nReporting by Robert Birsel; Editing by Nick Macfie\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T09:17:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
