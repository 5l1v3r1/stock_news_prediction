I think we can be competitive for the championship this year, with both riders,” Tardozzi told the official motogp.com website on Friday.\n“Both our (factory) riders and (Danilo) Petrucci (on a non-works Ducati) have had very positive comments. They really appreciate the power delivery and the new engine,” added the Italian.\n“We tried to make the engine smoother and less aggressive, this is something the riders requested. During the winter we worked on that and it looks like we got the results.”\nLorenzo, who won all his MotoGP titles with Yamaha, said after the test ended on Tuesday that there was still plenty of room for improvement.\n”I think we still have quite a big margin to arrive to our maximum potential,“ said the Mallorcan. ”This is a good sign because we finished first today and we still have some margin.\n“This bike gives more confidence and it is more to my riding(style),” he added.\nDovizioso, who won in Malaysia last year, was fourth fastest over the three days with Honda’s four times world champion Marc Marquez only eighth.\nThe next test starts in Thailand on Feb. 16.
