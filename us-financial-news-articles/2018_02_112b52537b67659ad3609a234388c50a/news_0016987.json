(“Canada Goose” or the “Company”) (NYSE: GOOS, TSX: GOOS) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended December 31, 2017. The Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2017 will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com , the EDGAR section of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov and posted on the Company’s website at investor.canadagoose.com .\n“In our peak selling season, we delivered strong performance across geographies, channels and categories this quarter, reflecting the continued demand for the Canada Goose brand around the world. Year to date, we added e-commerce sites in seven new markets, opened five new stores across three continents, including our partner operated store in Tokyo, and we successfully added more than 700 employees. As we look ahead, we continue to build deeper relationships with our fans and bring new people into the world of Canada Goose,” stated Dani Reiss, President & Chief Executive Officer.\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Results (in Canadian dollars, compared to the same period in Fiscal 2017):\nTotal revenue increased by $56.8 million from $209.1 million to $265.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, representing year-over-year growth of 27.2%. Wholesale revenue was $134.2 million as compared to $137.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In the first half of fiscal 2018, we shipped approximately $18 million of customer orders that were originally planned for the third quarter based on the order book, which was enabled by efficiency in manufacturing and sales planning to allow us to accelerate our shipment timing in response to requests from retail partners approaching their peak selling season. This was partially offset by strong demand in the wholesale channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue was $131.6 million as compared to $72.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue from four new company operated retail stores and additional seven new e-commerce sites which opened in fiscal 2018. We experienced continued strong performances of our existing e-commerce sites and retail stores. Gross profit increased to $169.0 million from $120.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit was 63.6% compared to 57.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Wholesale gross profit was $68.5 million, a gross margin of 51.0%, as compared to $65.5 million, a gross margin of 47.8%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in wholesale gross profit and higher gross margin were due to a greater proportion of wholesale revenue from higher margin parkas within our fall and winter line and lower material costs. Direct-to-consumer gross profit increased to $100.6 million, a gross margin of 76.4% from $54.8 million, a gross margin of 76.1%, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Lower material costs have a less significant impact on gross margin in our direct-to-consumer channel as a result of higher selling prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $76.8 million as compared to $62.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, driven by employee headcount increases and operational and selling expenditures to support the growth of our direct-to-consumer channel. Net income for the third quarter was $62.9 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to net income of $39.1 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $94.7 million compared to $66.1 million in the prior year, representing year-over-year growth of 43.2%. Adjusted net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.58, based on 111.6 million diluted shares outstanding, compared to an adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.44, based on 101.8 million diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted pro forma net income per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, which includes the effect of the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) in the calculation of the weighted average number of shares outstanding as if the IPO had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2017, was $0.42 per share based on 106.3 million shares.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss third quarter fiscal 2018 results is scheduled for today, February 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

net income 64,577 44,918 84,224 59,167 (a) In connection with Bain’s purchase of a 70% equity interest in our business on December 9, 2013 (the “Acquisition”), we entered into a management agreement with certain affiliates of Bain Capital for a term of five years (“Management Agreement”). This amount represents payments made pursuant to the Management Agreement for ongoing consulting and other services. In connection with the IPO on March 21, 2017, the Management Agreement was terminated in consideration for a termination fee of $9.6 million and Bain Capital no longer receives management fees from the Company. (b) In connection with the IPO in March 2017 and Secondary Offering in July 2017, we incurred expenses related to professional fees, consulting, legal, and accounting that would otherwise not have been incurred. These fees are reflected in the table above, and do not reflect expected future operating expenses after completion of these activities. (c) Represents non-cash unrealized gains on foreign exchange forward contracts recorded in fiscal 2016 that relate to fiscal 2017. We manage our exposure to foreign currency risk by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts. Management forecasts its net cash flows in foreign currency using expected revenue from orders it receives for future periods. The unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in net income from the date of inception of the contract, while the cash flows to which the derivatives related are not realized until the contract settles. Management believes that reflecting these adjustments in the period in which the net cash flows occur is more appropriate. (d) Represents non-cash unrealized gains and losses on the translation of the Term Loan Facility from USD to CAD, net of the effect of derivative transactions entered into to hedge a portion of the exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. (e) Represents expenses incurred to establish our international headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, including closing several smaller offices across Europe, relocating personnel, and incurring temporary office costs. (f) Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense on stock options issued prior to the IPO under our pre-IPO plan. (g) Represents accrued expenses related to termination payments to be made to our third-party sales agents. As part of a strategy to transition certain sales functions in-house, we terminated the majority of our third party sales agents and certain distributors, primarily during fiscal 2015 and 2016, which resulted in indemnities and other termination payments. As sales agents have now largely been eliminated from the sales structure, management does not expect these charges to recur in future fiscal periods. (h) Represents non-cash lease amortization charges during pre-opening periods for new store leases. (i) As a result of the Acquisition, we recognized an intangible asset for customer lists in the amount of $8.7 million, which had a useful life of four years and has been fully amortized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
