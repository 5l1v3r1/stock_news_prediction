All three are members of the rate-setting committee this year.\n“Right now, people may be paying more attention (to Fed speakers) than they have in the past and that’s because Janet Yellen has left and Jerome Powell is in charge,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin.\n“The question is will the other members have a greater influence on the new leader versus what they had in the past.”\nMarket participants are largely expecting the Fed to raise rates three times this year, beginning with its next meeting in March.\nBy 8:30 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis had gained 106 points. S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.75 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 38.5 points.\nShares of Blue Buffalo Pet Products jumped 17 percent in premarket trading after General Mills said it would buy the natural pet food maker for $8 billion in cash. General Mills shares fell about 4 percent.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise shares rose about 12.8 percent and were set to open at a record high after the company reported upbeat quarterly results and announcing a plan to return $7 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal 2019.
