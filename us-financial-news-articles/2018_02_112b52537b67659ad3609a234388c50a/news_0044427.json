What the president chooses to tackle first and when he’s able to do that will become big questions,” Lubin said.\n“Conditions to go into the international (bond) market are absolutely better than they were a year ago. SA (South Africa) is a member of an asset class that’s in very good shape, because growth in the Chinese economy is robust and the dollar is weakening.”\nWith commodities globally priced in dollars, South Africa’s chief exports such as gold, platinum and coal earn the country higher revenues when the greenback depreciates, helping to close the country’s capital deficit.\nIn September the Treasury issued a pair of dollar bonds in overseas capital markets worth $2.5 billion, attracting more than double that in bids.\nIn October it said it would raise international borrowing, pushing total debt to 3.4 trillion rand ($290 billion) in 2020 as it looks to plug a gaping budget deficit triggered by years of weak growth and bailouts to state firms, including state airline SAA which received 10 billion rand in 2017.\nLubin said portfolio flows into South Africa would remain solid despite U.S. bond yields rising by their most in years.\nHe said to attract more direct investment flows, South Africa needed policy changes compared with changes in cabinet.\nRamaphosa is expected to change his cabinet soon and appoint a new finance minister to replace Malsui Gigaba, hired in March by Zuma in a midnight reshuffle that triggered credit downgrades by all three major rating agencies.\n“A lot depends on Wednesday. If South Africa delivers a budget that maintains confidence in its ability to stabilize debt, that would go a long way,” Lubin said.\n“Building up some credibility and buying some time in what remains a transition going into election requires a high degree of credibility,” he said, referring to national elections due next year.\nEditing by James Macharia and Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:39:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
