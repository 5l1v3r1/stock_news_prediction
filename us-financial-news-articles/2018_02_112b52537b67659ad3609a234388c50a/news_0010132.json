It’s the same as lighting fire and burning your base because the snow crystals get such sharp edges,” said the slalom specialist who is favored to win gold in Pyeongchang.\nSki Jumping– Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Normal Hill Training – Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 7, 2018 - An athlete trains. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Although discarding expensive skis over relatively minor flaws may seem extreme, Randell said it was a necessary evil for Olympians in pursuit of medals.\n“When you are an athlete training to be the best in the world, every little millisecond, every little idiosyncrasy counts.”\nSki Jumping– Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics – Men’s Normal Hill Training – Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 7, 2018 - An athlete trains. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Due to the hard snow and cold weather, the slalom race course has been injected with water. That, along with a warming trend in the region, should help maintain the integrity of the skis.\nTemperatures in Pyeongchang were still in the single digits Fahrenheit early Wednesday morning at the center but that has not prevented top skiers from taking practice runs.\nDefending slalom gold medalist American Mikaela Shiffrin was the first athlete Randell said he spotted training on the course earlier in the week.\nThe North Korean and South Korean teams were also among the first to barrel down the training course when it opened for training sessions, he said.\nThe Games open on Friday and run through Feb. 25.\nReporting by Rory Carroll; Additional reporting by Mark Trevelyan; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T07:24:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
