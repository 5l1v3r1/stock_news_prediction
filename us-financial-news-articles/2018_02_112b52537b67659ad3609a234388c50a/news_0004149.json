(NYSE: RDN) today reported net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, of $6.8 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, which includes an incremental tax provision of $102.6 million, representing the estimated impact of recently enacted tax reform, as discussed below. Net income for the full year 2017 was $121.1 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, which, in addition to the incremental tax provision, includes impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the Mortgage and Real Estate Services segment of $130.9 million, net of tax. This compares to net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, of $61.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, and net income for the full year 2016 of $308.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share.\nThe non-cash tax expense of $102.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 represents the estimated impact of recently enacted tax reform, as a result of the remeasurement of the company's net deferred tax assets to reflect lower enacted corporate tax rates. The impact of this remeasurement was a reduction of $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2017.\nKey Financial Highlights (dollars in millions, except per-share data)\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nYear ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nPercent\nChange\nNet income (1) $121.1 $308.3 (61 )% Diluted net income per share $0.55 $1.37 (60 )% Consolidated pretax income $346.7 $483.7 (28 )% Adjusted pretax operating income (2) $617.2 $541.8 14 % Adjusted diluted net operating income per share (2) (3)\n$1.82 $1.56 17 % Net premiums earned - insurance $932.8 $921.8 1 % MI New Insurance Written (NIW) $53,905 $50,530 7 % MI insurance in force $200,724 $183,450 9 % Book value per share $13.90 $13.39 4 % Tangible book value per share (2) $13.60 $12.10 12 %\nQuarter ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nQuarter ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nPercent\nChange\nNet income (1) $6.8 $61.1 (89 )% Diluted net income per share $0.03 $0.27 (89 )% Consolidated pretax income $164.7 $97.8 68 % Adjusted pretax operating income (2) $172.5 $140.2 23 % Adjusted diluted net operating income per share (2) (3)\n$0.51 $0.41 24 % Net premiums earned - insurance $245.2 $233.6 5 % MI New Insurance Written (NIW) $14,383 $13,882 4 % (1)\nNet income for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 includes an incremental tax provision of $102.6 million as a result of the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets to reflect lower enacted corporate tax rates and includes $5.2 million for the fourth quarter and $17.3 million for the full year of pretax restructuring and other exit costs related to the Mortgage and Real Estate Services segment.

Adjusted diluted net operating income per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $0.51, an increase of 24 percent compared to $0.41 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted pretax operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $617.2 million, compared to $541.8 million for the same period of 2016. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.82, an increase of 17 percent compared to $1.56 for the same period of 2016.\nBook value per share at December 31, 2017, was $13.90, compared to $13.88 at September 30, 2017, and an increase of 4 percent compared to $13.39 at December 31, 2016. Tangible book value per share at December 31, 2017, was $13.60, compared to $13.57 at September 30, 2017, and an increase of 12 percent compared to $12.10 at December 31, 2016.\n“I am pleased to report on another quarter and year of excellent operating results for Radian,” said Radian’s Chief Executive Officer Rick Thornberry. “During my first year with the company, we have made progress in positioning Radian to become an even stronger, more diversified company and a more valued business partner, while also improving our capital position, debt maturity profile and financial flexibility.”\nFOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS AND RECENT EVENTS\nMortgage Insurance\nMI new insurance written (NIW) grew to $53.9 billion for the full year 2017, an increase of 7 percent compared to $50.5 billion for the prior year. NIW was $14.4 billion for the fourth quarter, compared to $15.1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 4 percent compared to $13.9 billion in the prior-year quarter. NIW for the full year 2017 represented record volume written on a flow basis for the company. Of the $14.4 billion in NIW in the fourth quarter of 2017, 23 percent was written with single premiums. After consideration of the 35 percent ceded under the Single Premium Quota Share Reinsurance Transaction (Single Premium QSR), net single premiums were 15 percent of new business written in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, as previously announced effective December 31, 2017, the company amended its 2016 Single Premium QSR to increase the amount of ceded risk for 2015 through 2017 vintages under the agreement from 35 percent to 65 percent. After consideration of the increased cession percentage, net single premiums represented 8 percent of new business written in the fourth quarter of 2017. Purchase originations accounted for 88 percent of total NIW in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 91 percent in the third quarter of 2017, and 73 percent a year ago. Total primary mortgage insurance in force as of December 31, 2017, grew to $200.7 billion, an increase of 2 percent compared to $196.5 billion as of September 30, 2017, and an increase of 9 percent compared to $183.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. The composition of Radian’s mortgage insurance portfolio continues to improve, with 92 percent consisting of new business written after 2008, including those loans that successfully completed the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). Persistency, which is the percentage of mortgage insurance that remains in force after a twelve-month period, was 81.1 percent as of December 31, 2017, compared to 80.0 percent as of September 30, 2017 and 76.7 percent as of December 31, 2016. Annualized persistency for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was 79.4 percent, compared to 80.4 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and 76.8 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Total net premiums earned were $245.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $236.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and $233.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Accelerated revenue recognition due to single premium policy cancellations was $21.2 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $15.4 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $26.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net of reinsurance, accelerated revenue recognition due to single premium policy cancellations was $11.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $8.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Ceded premiums of $15.0 million, $13.8 million and $18.2 million for the quarters ended December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively, are net of accrued profit commission on reinsurance transactions of $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Direct mortgage insurance premium yield was 52 basis points in the fourth quarter, compared to 52 basis points in the third quarter of 2017, and 55 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total net mortgage insurance premium yield, which includes the impact of ceded premiums and accrued profit commission, was 49 basis points in both the fourth and third quarters of 2017, compared to 51 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016. The mortgage insurance provision for losses was $35.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $36.0 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $54.7 million in the prior-year period. The total number of primary delinquent loans was 27,922 in the fourth quarter, an increase of 17 percent compared to 23,826 in the third quarter of 2017, primarily driven by new notices of default from areas affected by major 2017 hurricanes. The total number of primary delinquent loans included 7,051 from hurricane-affected areas in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 2,934 in the third quarter of 2017. The company believes that these hurricane-related delinquencies have reached their peak and, based on past experience, continues to expect that these delinquencies will not result in a material number of new paid claims. The total number of primary delinquent loans decreased by 4 percent from 29,105 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact from hurricane-affected areas, the total number of primary delinquent loans decreased by 19 percent from 25,784 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The total number of primary new notices of default increased by 49 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of 2017, and increased by 38 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the new notices of default from hurricane-affected areas, the total number of primary new notices of default increased by 3 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter of 2017, and decreased by 7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. The primary mortgage insurance delinquency rate was 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 2.5 percent in the third quarter of 2017, and 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The loss ratio in the fourth quarter was 14.4 percent, compared to 15.2 percent in the third quarter of 2017 and 23.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. Mortgage insurance loss reserves were $507.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $556.5 million as of September 30, 2017, and $760.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Primary reserve per primary default (excluding IBNR and other reserves) was $17,103 as of December 31, 2017. Excluding the impact of reserves and defaults related to hurricane-affected areas, the primary reserve per primary default would have been approximately $20,500. This compares to primary reserve per primary default of $21,367 as of September 30, 2017, and $22,503 as of December 31, 2016. Total mortgage insurance claims paid were $85.5 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $131.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $116.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of commutations and captive terminations, claims paid were $58.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $76.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. In addition, the company’s pending claim inventory declined 38 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, total net claims paid were $390.4 million, compared to $417.6 million for the full year 2016.\nMortgage and Real Estate Services\nAs previously announced, the company committed to a restructuring plan in October 2017, and incurred related charges in the fourth quarter of $5.2 million and $17.3 million for the full-year 2017. Additional pretax charges of approximately $4 million, primarily in cash, are expected to be recognized within the next twelve months. The estimated total restructuring charges of $21 million are expected to consist of $11 million in asset impairments and loss on sale, $7 million in employee severance and benefit costs, $2 million in facility and lease termination costs, and $1 million in contract termination and other costs. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $40.7 million, compared to $41.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, and $52.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenues for the full year 2017 were $161.8 million, compared to $177.2 million for the same period of 2016. The adjusted pretax operating income before corporate allocations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which includes $1.4 million in restructuring and other exit costs, was $2.9 million, compared to a loss of $4.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and income of $3.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The adjusted pretax operating loss before corporate allocations for the full year 2017, which includes $6.8 million in restructuring and other exit costs, was $1.8 million, compared to income of $6.1 million for the prior year. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (Services adjusted EBITDA) for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, which includes $1.4 million in restructuring and other exit costs, was income of $3.8 million, compared to a loss of $3.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and income of $4.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Services adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017, which includes $6.8 million in restructuring and other exit costs, was $2.0 million, compared to $9.2 million for the prior year period. Additional details regarding the non-GAAP measure Services adjusted EBITDA may be found in Exhibits F and G.\nConsolidated Expenses\nOther operating expenses were $66.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $64.2 million in the third quarter of 2017, and $62.4 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Details regarding notable variable items impacting other operating expenses may be found in Exhibit D.\nCAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY UPDATE\nRadian took several actions in 2017 in order to improve its capital position, increase liquidity, enhance its return on capital, increase its financial flexibility and cost-effectively strengthen the financial position of Radian Guaranty under the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs). As of December 31, 2017, Radian Group maintained $229 million of available liquidity. Total liquidity, which includes the company’s $225 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in October 2017, was $454 million as of December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 and consistent with its capital plan, Radian settled all of its remaining convertible senior notes outstanding. In addition, as previously announced: Radian Guaranty, the principal MI subsidiary of Radian Group, agreed with its reinsurance providers to increase the cession of business for its first single-premium MI quota share reinsurance arrangement, which was entered into in 2016. The cession of business increased from 35 to 65 percent for single-premium policies with effective dates in 2015-2017. This increased cession, which was effective December 31, 2017, improved Radian Guaranty’s PMIERs position at December 31, 2017, and has been approved by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs). On December 28, 2017, Radian Group transferred $100 million of cash and marketable securities to Radian Guaranty in exchange for a surplus note. The intercompany surplus note has a 0 percent interest rate and a stated maturity date of December 31, 2027. The surplus note may be redeemed at any time upon 30 days prior notice, subject to the approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. Any redemption of the surplus note increases holding company liquidity by the corresponding amount of the redemption. As discussed above, Radian Guaranty experienced a recent increase in reported delinquencies in hurricane-affected areas. Given that the PMIERs require Radian to maintain significantly more Minimum Required Assets for delinquent loans than for performing loans, the company’s Minimum Required Assets from hurricane-affected areas increased by approximately $100 million as of December 31, 2017, as compared to September 30, 2017. The company expects these Minimum Required Assets to decrease given the expectation that substantially all of the hurricane-related defaults will cure within the next six to twelve months. As a result of capital actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2017 and as described above, at December 31, 2017, Radian Guaranty’s Available Assets under the PMIERs were approximately $3.7 billion and its Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs were approximately $3.2 billion, resulting in an excess of approximately $450 million, or 14 percent. This compares to an excess of approximately $237 million, or 7 percent, at September 30, 2017. Radian Guaranty received a summary of proposed changes to the PMIERs on December 18, 2017, that are being recommended to the Federal Housing Finance Agency by the GSEs. Based on this initial summary, which remains subject to comment by the private mortgage insurance industry, Radian expects to be able to fully comply with the proposed PMIERs and to maintain an excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs as of the expected effective date in late 2018, without a need to take further actions to do so. The company’s expectation is not dependent upon the existing surplus note and is based on its projections for positive operating results in 2018, its strong capital position, and the benefits of its reinsurance programs.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nRadian will discuss fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results in a conference call today, Thursday, February 1, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet at http://www.radian.biz/page?name=Webcasts or at www.radian.biz . The call may also be accessed by dialing 800.230.1093 inside the U.S., or 612.332.0226 for international callers, using passcode 443361 or by referencing Radian.\nA replay of the webcast will be available on the Radian website approximately two hours after the live broadcast ends for a period of one year. A replay of the conference call will be available approximately two and a half hours after the call ends for a period of two weeks, using the following dial-in numbers and passcode: 800.475.6701 inside the U.S., or 320.365.3844 for international callers, passcode 443361.\nIn addition to the information provided in the company's earnings news release, other statistical and financial information, which is expected to be referred to during the conference call, will be available on Radian's website under Investors > Quarterly Results, or by clicking on http://www.radian.biz/page?name=QuarterlyResults .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nRadian believes that adjusted pretax operating income and adjusted diluted net operating income per share (non-GAAP measures) facilitate evaluation of the company’s fundamental financial performance and provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about the ongoing operating results of the company. On a consolidated basis, these measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures of performance. The measures described below have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the company’s operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with Radian’s competitors.\nAdjusted pretax operating income is defined as earnings excluding the impact of certain items that are not viewed as part of the operating performance of the company’s primary activities, or not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss). Adjusted pretax operating income adjusts GAAP pretax income (loss) to remove the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments; (ii) loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment; (iii) acquisition-related expenses; (iv) amortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and (v) net impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of lines of business. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share represents a diluted net income per share calculation using as its basis adjusted pretax operating income, net of taxes at the company’s statutory tax rate for the period.\nThe company has also presented a non-GAAP measure for tangible book value per share, which represents book value per share less the per-share impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, net. The company uses this measure to assess the quality and growth of its capital. Because tangible book value per share is a widely used financial measure which focuses on the underlying fundamentals of the company’s financial position and operating trends without the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, the company believes that current and prospective investors may find it useful in their analysis.\nIn addition to the above non-GAAP measures for the consolidated company, the company also presents as supplemental information a non-GAAP measure for the Services segment, representing earnings before interest, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Services adjusted EBITDA is calculated by using the Services segment’s adjusted pretax operating income as described above, further adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation and corporate allocations for interest and operating expenses. Services adjusted EBITDA is presented to facilitate comparisons with other services companies, since it is a widely accepted measure of performance in the services industry.\nSee Exhibit F or Radian’s website for a description of these items, as well as Exhibit G for reconciliations to the most comparable consolidated GAAP measures.\nABOUT RADIAN\nRadian Group Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the Company’s business performance is evaluated by both management and the board of directors. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although on a consolidated basis “adjusted pretax operating income” and “adjusted diluted net operating income per share” are non-GAAP financial measures, we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations. Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian's chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments. Adjusted pretax operating income is defined as GAAP consolidated pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments; (ii) loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment; (iii) acquisition-related expenses; (iv) amortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and (v) net impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of lines of business. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share is calculated by dividing (i) adjusted pretax operating income attributable to common shareholders, net of taxes computed using the company’s statutory tax rate, by (ii) the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Interest expense on convertible debt, share dilution from convertible debt and the impact of share-based compensation arrangements have been reflected in the per share calculations consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share, whenever the impact is dilutive. Although adjusted pretax operating income excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent those that are: (i) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (ii) not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income. These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. (1)\nNet gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile and overall market cycles. Unrealized investment gains and losses arise primarily from changes in the market value of our investments that are classified as trading securities. These valuation adjustments may not necessarily result in realized economic gains or losses.\nTrends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized and unrealized gains or losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss). (2)\nLoss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses incurred to purchase our convertible debt prior to maturity are discretionary activities that are undertaken in order to take advantage of market opportunities to strengthen our financial and capital positions; therefore, we do not view these activities as part of our operating performance. Such transactions do not reflect expected future operations and do not provide meaningful insight regarding our current or past operating trends. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\n(3)\nAcquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses represent the costs incurred to effect an acquisition of a business (i.e., a business combination). Because we pursue acquisitions on a strategic and selective basis and not in the ordinary course of our business, we do not view acquisition-related expenses as a consequence of a primary business activity. Therefore, we do not consider these expenses to be part of our operating performance and they are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\n(4)\nAmortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets represents the periodic expense required to amortize the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are also periodically reviewed for potential impairment, and impairment adjustments are made whenever appropriate. These charges are not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities and therefore are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\nRadian Group Inc. and Subsidiaries\nDefinition of Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nExhibit F (page 2 of 2)\n(5)\nNet impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of lines of business. The recognition of net impairment losses on investments and the impairment of other long-lived assets does not result in a cash payment and can vary significantly in both amount and frequency, depending on market credit cycles and other factors. Losses from the sale of lines of business are highly discretionary as a result of strategic restructuring decisions, and generally do not occur in the normal course of our business. We do not view these losses to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, whenever these losses occur, we exclude them from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\nWe have also presented a non-GAAP measure for tangible book value per share, which represents book value per share less the per-share impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, net. We use this measure to assess the quality and growth of our capital. Because tangible book value per share is a widely-used financial measure which focuses on the underlying fundamentals of our financial position and operating trends without the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, we believe that current and prospective investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company. In addition to the above non-GAAP measures for the consolidated company, we also have presented as supplemental information a non-GAAP measure for our Services segment, representing a measure of earnings before interest, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). We calculate Services adjusted EBITDA by using adjusted pretax operating income as described above, further adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation and corporate allocations for interest and operating expenses. We have presented Services adjusted EBITDA to facilitate comparisons with other services companies, since it is a widely accepted measure of performance in the services industry. See Exhibit G for the reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measures, consolidated pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share and book value per share, to our non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated company, adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share and tangible book value per share, respectively. Exhibit G also contains the reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), to Services adjusted EBITDA. Total adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share, tangible book value per share and Services adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share, book value per share or net income (loss). Our definitions of adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share, tangible book value per share or Services adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.\nRadian Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations Exhibit G (page 1 of 5) Reconciliation of Consolidated Pretax Income (Loss) to Adjusted Pretax Operating Income 2017 2016 (In thousands)\nQtr 4 Qtr 3 Qtr 2 Qtr 1 Qtr 4 Consolidated pretax income (loss) $ 164,727 $ 102,814 $ (35,474 ) $ 114,670 $ 97,796 Less income (expense) items: Net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments (1,339 ) 2,480 5,331 (2,851 ) (38,773 ) Loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment — (45,766 ) (1,247 ) (4,456 ) — Acquisition-related expenses (1) 21 (54 ) (64 ) (8 ) (358 ) Impairment of goodwill — — (184,374 ) — — Amortization and impairment of other intangible assets (2,629 ) (2,890 ) (18,856 ) (3,296 ) (3,290 ) Impairment of other long-lived assets and loss from the sale of a business line (2) (3,865 ) (6,575 ) — — — Total adjusted pretax operating income (3) $ 172,539 $ 155,619 $ 163,736 $ 125,281 $ 140,217 (1)\nPlease see Exhibit F for the definition of this line item.

These statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. We operate in a changing environment where new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all risks that may affect us. The forward-looking statements, as well as our prospects as a whole, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation:\nchanges in economic and political conditions that impact the size of the insurable market, the credit performance of our insured portfolio, and the business prospects of our Services segment; changes in the way customers, investors, ratings agencies, regulators or legislators perceive our performance, financial strength and future prospects; Radian Guaranty Inc.’s ability to remain eligible under the PMIERs and other applicable requirements imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency and by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the “GSEs”) to insure loans purchased by the GSEs; our ability to successfully execute and implement our capital plans and to maintain sufficient holding company liquidity to meet our short- and long-term liquidity needs; our ability to successfully execute and implement our business plans and strategies, including plans and strategies to reposition our Services segment as well as plans and strategies that require GSE and/or regulatory approvals and licenses; our ability to maintain an adequate level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries to satisfy existing and future state regulatory requirements; changes in the charters or business practices of, or rules or regulations imposed by or applicable to, the GSEs, including the GSEs’ interpretation and application of the PMIERs and the proposed changes to the PMIERs; changes in the current housing finance system in the U.S., including the role of the Federal Housing Administration (the “FHA”), the GSEs and private mortgage insurers in this system; any disruption in the servicing of mortgages covered by our insurance policies, as well as poor servicer performance; a significant decrease in the persistency rates of our mortgage insurance on monthly premium products; competition in our mortgage insurance business, including price competition and competition from the FHA, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and other forms of credit enhancement; the effect of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on the financial services industry in general, and on our businesses in particular; legislative and regulatory activity (or inactivity), including the adoption of (or failure to adopt) new laws and regulations, or changes in existing laws and regulations, or the way they are interpreted or applied, including interpretations and guidance pertaining to recently enacted tax reform legislation; legal and regulatory claims, assertions, actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations that could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief that could require significant expenditures or have other effects on our business; the amount and timing of potential payments or adjustments associated with federal or other tax examinations, including deficiencies assessed by the Internal Revenue Service resulting from its examination of our 2000 through 2007 tax years, which we are currently contesting; the possibility that we may fail to estimate accurately the likelihood, magnitude and timing of losses in connection with establishing loss reserves for our mortgage insurance business or in establishing the assumptions that have formed the basis for our expectations regarding our ability to comply with the proposed PMIERs when implemented; volatility in our results of operations caused by changes in the fair value of our assets and liabilities, including a significant portion of our investment portfolio, and potential volatility in our Available Assets under the PMIERs as a result of a new requirement in the proposed changes to the PMIERs to mark certain of our Available Assets to fair value; potential future impairment charges related to our goodwill and other intangible assets, and uncertainties regarding our ability to execute our restructuring plans within expected costs; changes in “GAAP” (accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.) or “SAP” (statutory accounting practices including those required or permitted, if applicable, by the insurance departments of the respective states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries) rules and guidance, or their interpretation; and our ability to attract and retain key employees; and legal and other limitations on dividends and other amounts we may receive from our subsidiaries.\nFor more information regarding these risks and uncertainties as well as certain additional risks that we face, you should refer to the Risk Factors detailed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequent reports filed from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
