Shale producers’ access to capital markets is curtailed until financial metrics improve.” \nGoldman expects metal supplies to remain tight, given the financial, economic and environmental success of Chinese supply-side policy reforms. \nThe bank forecast returns from S&P GSCI enhanced commodity index at 7.4, 14.7 and 10 percent for 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively.
