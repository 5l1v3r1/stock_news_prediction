But he added that, “Whether that will be the case here or not, I do not know.”\n“Maduro should get back to his constitution and follow it,” Tillerson said, adding if the heat gets too hot for him, “I am sure that he’s got some friends over in Cuba that could give him a nice hacienda on the beach.” (Reporting By Matt Spetalnick, David Brunnstrom and Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T22:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T00:18:48.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
