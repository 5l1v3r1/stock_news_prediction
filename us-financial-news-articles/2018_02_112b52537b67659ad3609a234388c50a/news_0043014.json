It provides grants for evidence-based teen pregnancy prevention programs.\nHHS currently funds 84 grants. Since the program’s inception, the teen birth rate in the United States has fallen 41 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to one of the lawsuits.\nBut in July, the department under the Republican Trump’s administration told recipients of 81 of the five-year grants that it would be terminating their agreements two years early. The remaining three were terminated in September, the groups say.\nAffiliates of Planned Parenthood, a non-profit that provides contraception, health screenings and abortions, in their lawsuit called the decision part of the Trump’s administration’s “broader political agenda against sexual and reproductive health and evidence-based and science-based programs.”\nThe lawsuit said the early termination equals a loss of more than $200 million in funding and will mean depriving thousands of teenagers of information and education that could help them make decisions about their health.\nThe lawsuits seek injunctions barring the grants from being terminated based on claims the department failed to follow proper administrative procedures and that it violated the U.S. Constitution by endorsing religion.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:14:12.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
