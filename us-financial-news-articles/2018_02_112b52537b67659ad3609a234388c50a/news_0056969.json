JPM, -0.37% says it is optimistic about 2018 and the impact the new U.S. tax law will have on its financial outlook. \nThe largest U.S. bank by assets shared new targets and expectations in its annual investor day presentation Tuesday, which for the first time included benefits from changes to the tax law. \nMost notably, JPMorgan moved its medium-term target—over the next two to three years—for return on tangible common equity, a key profitability metric, to roughly 17% compared with its prior target of 15%. That is in line with Credit Suisse analyst Susan Katzke’s 15% to 18% expectation, she wrote in a Tuesday research note. Excluding tax reform, the bank said its return on tangible common equity target for 2018 would be around 15%. \nAlready, the bank’s traders are off to a strong start. Daniel Pinto, the bank’s co-president and head of its corporate and investment bank, said trading is expected to rise “mid to high single digits” in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period last year. He added that activity in the beginning of 2018 has been “strong” and that “markets are correcting quite fast after the selloff” earlier this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T20:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T20:42:23.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
