After all, he's considered one of the best coaches in NFL history. He holds five Super Bowl wins as the Patriots head coach and is aiming for his sixth win against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.\n\"This is not a game Tom Brady is going to win [by himself]. Every single player matters. Every single player can change the course of the game,\" Belichick told CNBC contributor Suzy Welch recently, which she recalled in a segment of CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Thursday. \"That's why everybody, even the ones who are going to be on the sideline, have to go into the stadium completely prepared to be the person who wins the game for us.\"\nIn a rare, wide-ranging interview in 2017, Belichick told Welch about his leadership approach and \"secret sauce\" to winning.\nHere are four qualities that have helped his Patriots over the years:\n1. Do your job.\n2. Be attentive.\n3. Pay attention to details.\n4. Put the team first.\nThis is what \"we look at every day when we walk into the building,\" says Belichick.\n\"Ultimately, the team has to come first even though we all have individual goals and preferences,\" he explains. \"If you pay attention, and you're coachable and you work hard, you've gotta improve. That's really what it's about for us.\"\nPlus, he says it's important to stay in the present. \"It's one day at a time,\" he explains. \"We don't talk about last year. We don't talk about next week. We don't talk about next year.\"\n\"We talk about today, and we talk about the next game,\" Belichick says. \"And that's all we can really control. The rest of it will take care of itself.\"\nSee also:\nThe top 10 countries if you want to retire comfortably in 2018 4 TED Talks you should watch immediately if you want to understand bitcoin show chapters Belichick: You have to count on the most dependable people 3:24 PM ET Thu, 13 April 2017 | 09:51 This is an updated version of a previously published story.\nDisclosure: NBC Sports is televising Sunday's Super Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T23:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T23:50:09.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
