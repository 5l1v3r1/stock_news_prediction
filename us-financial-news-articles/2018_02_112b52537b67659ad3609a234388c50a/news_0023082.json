The Justice Department had no immediate comment.\nFitzgerald’s decision to dismiss part of the case was based on a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision regarding what must be alleged under the False Claims Act to prove a company’s false statement was material to the government paying it.\nThat law allows the government and whistleblowers suing on its behalf to recover taxpayer money paid to companies based on fraudulent claims.\nIf successful, whistleblowers receive a percentage of the recovery. The government may intervene in whistleblower lawsuits, typically a major boost to those cases.\nLast year, the Justice Department intervened in a lawsuit brought by former UnitedHealth executive Benjamin Poehling, whose whistleblower case was filed under seal in 2011.\nThe Justice Department said UnitedHealth obtained inflated risk adjustment payments based on untruthful and inaccurate information about the health of patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\nMore than one-third of Medicare recipients are in Advantage plans run by private insurers like UnitedHealth.\nThe lawsuit said UnitedHealth failed to repay the Medicare program by over $1.14 billion from 2011 to 2014.\nThe case was one of two that the Justice Department announced last year against UnitedHealth related to payments it received for patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\nBut a federal judge in October dismissed the other case, saying the government failed to allege CMS would have refused to make payments to UnitedHealth if it had known all the facts.\nThe case is U.S. ex rel.
