It is not complicated to do it legally in that the legal instrument exists, but it doesn’t require a huge internal debate,” Chaibi told a Euromoney conference in Paris.\nThe regulations were agreed in 1996 as a countermeasure to the U.S. extraterritorial economic sanctions against Cuba, which EU governments argued benefited U.S. foreign policy interests at the expense of European sovereignty.\n“It could be revived or put back, but only if it is clear that the U.S. is putting back sanctions with extraterritorial sanctions and that they are being applied. It can’t be done protectively,” he said.\nThe so-called extra-territoriality of U.S. sanctions law, which apply to foreign firms carrying out transactions in U.S. dollars even if the operations involve non-U.S. branches, allowed U.S. authorities to fine French lender BNP Paribas nearly $9 billion (5.34 billion pounds) in 2014.\nFears of such fines have been one reason preventing major international lenders and firms from returning.\nRelated Coverage 'Make nuclear deal a success, then we'll talk other issues,' Iran to West Iranian officials have repeatedly said reluctance of major European banks to return to Iran has slowed its economic improvement, calling on European leaders to encourage businesses to return to Iran.\nIran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has praised European signatories of the deal for trying to keep it alive, but has demanded tangible reaction if the United States pulls out of the accord.\nThe European External Action Service (EEAS), set up in 2009, runs a network of diplomats around the globe, drafts policy papers for EU foreign ministers and is led by the EU’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini.\nReporting by John Irish and Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T17:40:21.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
