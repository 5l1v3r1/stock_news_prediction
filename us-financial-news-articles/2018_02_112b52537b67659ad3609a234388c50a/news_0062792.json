Wendy's leadership and significant contributions to the Board have been instrumental in helping guide Mylan's strategic development, growth, and global transformation.\"\nMr. Coury continued, \"The Mylan Board has continued to refresh itself over the past decade as the Company has evolved into a leading global healthcare company, adding seven of its current eleven directors during that time frame, including four in the past five years. As the Company continues to evolve and continues the natural refreshment of its Board, we believe that Pauline represents yet another outstanding addition to the Board, given her extensive experience as a director of several multi-national companies operating in a broad range of industries, as well as her expertise in, among other areas, executive compensation, risk oversight, governance, regulatory and audit-related matters, sustainability, and talent development. I am confident that the Board and Mylan's stakeholders will greatly benefit from her expertise, practical judgment, and fresh perspectives.\"\nMs. van der Meer Mohr is a highly respected and influential corporate leader and has significant global and Dutch company board experience.
