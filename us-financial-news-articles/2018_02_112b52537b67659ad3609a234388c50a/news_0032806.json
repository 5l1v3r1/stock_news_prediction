Sturm, Ruger & Company (rgr) was up 2.8%, ammunition and rifle-scope firm Vista Outdoor (vsto) was up 2.8%, and ammunition maker Olin (oln) was up 1.4%. \nThis has become a familiar sight in the aftermath of mass shootings, with likely reasons including the anticipation of more people buying guns to defend themselves, and the possibility that buyers might fear an impending crackdown on gun ownership, leading them to buy new firearms sooner rather than later. \nThe same thing happened after last year’s deadly Las Vegas shooting spree. \nRead: Trump Says Texas Church Shooting Is Due to ‘Mental Health Problem’—Not ‘a Guns Situation’ \nThat said, gun manufacturers have not been having the best of times under Donald Trump’s presidency. The so-called “Trump Slump”—where some people no longer feel the need to make a political statement against a relatively anti-gun White House by buying guns—was one factor cited in the recent Remington bankruptcy . \nAmerican Outdoor Brands saw its profits reduced by 90% last year, while Sturm Ruger said in October that its quarterly profits were down 35%. \nThe gun used in the Florida shooting is reported to have been an AR-15 assault rifle.
