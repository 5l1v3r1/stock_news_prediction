Buddhists make up about 70 percent and Hindus about 13 percent.\nThe government ended a full-blown 26-year civil war by defeating mostly Hindu Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009, with claims of atrocities on both sides.\nThe United Nations criticised Sri Lanka last year for slow progress in addressing war crimes and human rights abuses. The United Nations and rights activists have accused the Sri Lankan military of killing thousands of civilians, mostly Tamils, in the last weeks of the war.\nReporting by Ranga Sirilal and Shihar Aneez; Editing by Nick Macfie, William Maclean\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T13:15:46.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
