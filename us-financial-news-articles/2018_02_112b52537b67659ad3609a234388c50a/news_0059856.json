Microsoft challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. \nA ruling is due by the end of June, giving Congress little time to act. \n“Wouldn’t it be wiser to say let’s leave things as they are. If Congress wants to regulate in this ‘Brave New World,’ it should do it,” Ginsburg said. \nAlito agreed that Congress should act but added that “in the interim, something has to be done.” \nIf the court were to rule in favor of Microsoft and Congress does not amend the 1986 law at issue in the case, Alito wondered how the government could quickly obtain information in a major criminal investigation in which data is held overseas, potentially in several different countries. \n“What happens in that situation?” Alito asked. \nRoberts appeared concerned that companies like Microsoft could enable customers to evade the reach of U.S. prosecutors by deliberately storing data overseas. \nMicrosoft “might gain customers if you can assure them, no matter what happens, the government won’t be able to get access to their e-mails,” Roberts said. \n\nMicrosoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith (R) and his lawyer Josh Rosenkranz make their way to the news media to make a statement outside of the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis The company’s lawyer, Joshua Rosenkranz, responded that customers already know that other services existed that provided stronger privacy guarantees. \n“If customers do not want their e-mails to be seized by the government, they don’t use Microsoft’s services,” Rosenkranz said. \nThe case highlights the friction between tech companies and privacy advocates desiring to protect customer data and law enforcement wanting information vital to criminal and counterterrorism investigations. \nLOWER COURT BACKED MICROSOFT \nFILE PHOTO: A Microsoft logo is seen a day after Microsoft Corp's $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn Corp, in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on June 14, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 sided with Microsoft, handing a victory to tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump’s administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. \nThe appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a federal law called the 1986 Stored Communications Act. \nBipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the 1986 statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The bill would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. Passage of the bill likely would render the case moot. \nSenator Orrin Hatch, a Republican who has led the efforts to rework the law, was in the courtroom to hear Tuesday’s argument. He said in a statement afterward that his bill would resolve the legal question while balancing law enforcement and privacy interests. \n“This commonsense legislation has the full-throated support of both law enforcement and the tech community and deserves swift enactment,” Hatch added. \nGlobally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government’s reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law. \nMicrosoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States. The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account. \nOther companies including IBM Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government’s position. \nThe administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont. \nReporting by Lawrence Hurley and Dustin Volz; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T08:12:46.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
