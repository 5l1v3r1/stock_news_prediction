On Monday morning, Syrian state media had said the pro-government militia would enter Afrin “within hours” - although the forces never materialized.\n“The (Syrian deployment) was seriously stopped yesterday... It was stopped,” Erdogan told reporters following a speech in parliament.\nWhen asked if the deployment was stopped after talks with Putin, Erdogan said: “Yes, it was stopped after those talks”.\nOn Monday Erdogan spoke to both Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani about Syria, Ankara’s government spokesman said. The three countries also agreed that their foreign ministers would meet in Moscow on March 14.\nIn the speech to members of his ruling AK Party, Erdogan also promised that a siege of Afrin would begin soon.\n“The sieging of the Afrin city center will start rapidly in the coming days. This way, both outside help to the region and city will be cut off, and the terrorist organization will not have the means to negotiate with anyone,” he said.\nErdogan has repeatedly said Turkey has no intention of backing down from its operation in Syria’s Afrin region, launched to sweep the YPG from its southern border.\nAnkara’s onslaught has further scrambled the matrix of rivalries and alliances in northern Syria among Kurdish forces, the Syrian government, insurgent factions, Turkey, Iran, the United States and Russia.\nReporting by Gulsen Solaker, Tuvan Gumrukcu and Ece Toksabay; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Daren Butler, William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:48:05.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
