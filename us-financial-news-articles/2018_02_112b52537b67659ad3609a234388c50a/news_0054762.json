This was followed by a doubling of the prices of subsidised bread.\nJafar Hassan, chief of staff of the office of Jordan’s King Abdullah, takes up the post of deputy Prime Minister for economic affairs, a role that had been left vacant in Mulki’s previous cabinet.\nHassan, a former Harvard educated planning minister, will be leading the ministerial team overseeing a tough three-year program agreed with the International Monetary Fund of long delayed structural reforms to cut public debt to 77 percent of national output GDP by 2021 from 94 percent now.\nEarlier this year, Mulki imposed steep IMF-mandated tax hikes to cut rising public debt that have hit incomes of ordinary Jordanians, causing his popularity to plummet.\nFinance Minister Omar Malhas kept his job in the reshuffle.\nAyman Safadi, a long-time adviser to the royal family, who took up the post for the first time early last year and has been leading the kingdom’s talks with Washington over its Middle East policy remains as foreign minister.\nPoliticians and economists say the tough fiscal consolidation plan and the price hikes, the widest in range in recent years, worsen the plight of poorer Jordanians.\nRemoving subsidies has triggered civil unrest in the past. Unlike previous hikes, only a few scattered protests have taken place, but slogans carried by demonstrators in the rally in Salt were the most critical so far.\n“We will wage an intifada (Uprising) until prices go down. There are limits to our patience,” protesters chanted. Some indirectly blamed the monarch. On Friday the authorities sent gendarmerie reinforcements to Salt.\nThe government has said cash transfers to low income citizens had mitigated the impact of price rises.\nIn recent years Jordan’s economic growth has been hit by regional conflicts weighing on investor sentiment and as consumer demand generated by Syrian refugees staying in Jordan has receded, according to the IMF.\nReal GDP was revised downwards to 2 percent in 2017 about one percent lower than anticipated at the start of the IMF program and was expected to hover around 3 percent, almost half the levels it attained a decade ago (Reporting by Suleiman al-Khalidi; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T17:30:54.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
