The insurer has said it does not merit the “too big to fail” designation it was pinned with in the wake of the financial crisis.\n“We have and continue to maintain that we do not meet the standard for designation and that flaws in the designation process led to this outcome,” said company spokesman Andrew Simonelli in a statement. “We look forward to making our case to FSOC as part of our annual designation review, which is now underway.”\nPrudential is the only non-bank financial company currently designated as a “systemically important financial institution” by FSOC. The panel last year released rival insurer AIG from the label, and agreed this month to drop its earlier appeal against a court decision releasing MetLife from the label.\nThe FSOC meeting is the first step towards Prudential also potentially being released from the label which demands more stringent oversight and higher capital requirements.
