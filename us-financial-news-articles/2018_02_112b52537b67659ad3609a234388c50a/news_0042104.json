It will issue a final determination on June 27.\nThe highest “dumping rate” came from Sibo International Limited, according to the Commerce Department, which has put a duty on the company’s fittings of 109.79 percent.\nPresident Donald Trump’s administration has made protecting U.S. manufacturers a priority and since Trump took office has initiated 94 investigations into unfair subsidies and dumping, where a company exports products at artificially low prices.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T01:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:42:34.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
