REUTERS/Jim Urquhart Republicans hold 51 of the Senate’s 100 seats but many legislative issues require getting the support of 60 senators.\nTrump has repeatedly said that he needs more Republicans elected during the 2018 congressional elections to win approval of more of his agenda.\nRomney said last week he generally approved of Trump’s agenda, but would not hesitate to call out the president if needed.\n“I‘m with the president’s domestic policy agenda of low taxes, low regulation, smaller government, pushing back against the bureaucrats,” Romney said. “I‘m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens I’ll call‘em like I see‘em, the way I have in the past.”\nTrump had lobbied Hatch to run for re-election in 2018, in what was viewed as an effort to prevent Romney from getting into the Senate. Trump and Romney spoke in January after Hatch announced his retirement, a White House official said.\nRomney, the son of former Michigan Governor George Romney, helped found the buyout firm Bain Capital and gained prominence after stepping in to lead the organizing committee for the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics after a bribery scandal. He served as governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.\nRomney first sought the presidency in 2008 but lost the Republican nomination to Arizona Senator John McCain. Four years later, Romney won the party’s nomination but was defeated by incumbent Democratic President Barack Obama.\nReporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Grant McCool and Clarence Fernandez\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T05:27:44.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
