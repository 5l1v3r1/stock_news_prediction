Gabriel said it was “not realistic” to insist on full implementation of the Minsk peace accords before offering some sanctions relief to Moscow. Gabriel said there were still fundamental differences over Russia’s proposal to bring U.N. peacekeeping forces into eastern Ukraine, but he viewed the idea as “one of the few realistic options” to make some progress on ending the violence that has killed some 10,000 people in the region since 2014.
