It is likely to prove unpopular, with a national election due next year.\nFinance Minister Malusi Gigaba announced on Wednesday the Treasury was taking the politically risky step of raising VAT to 15 percent from 14 percent starting in April, as part of its efforts to cut the deficit and stabilize debt.\nThe move is expected to generate an additional 23 billion rand ($2 billion) of revenue in 2018/19.\nMagashule also said that party officials on Monday could discuss the issue of cabinet appointments under new President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n“We don’t have an agenda tomorrow - it’s a normal officials’ meeting. If it comes it will be part of our discussions,” Magashule said in response to questions.\nRamaphosa, who was sworn in 10 days ago after his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma stepped down, said on Tuesday he planned to take the lifestyles of future government officials into consideration as he put together a new cabinet.\nReporting by Dinky Mkhize; Writing by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Ed Stoddard and Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-25T18:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T18:15:43.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
