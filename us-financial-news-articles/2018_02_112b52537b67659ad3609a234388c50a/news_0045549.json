If not through medical problems, it is through war, it is through hunger. In the end death is the destiny for many people.”\nUNICEF was able to deliver nutrition and health supplies last week to children in Eastern Ghouta after two months without access, but Juliette Touma, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it was not enough.\n“We don’t have the words anymore to describe our outrage at what is happening to children inside Syria,” she said by phone from Amman, the capital of neighboring Jordan.\nNeither the Syrian military nor Russia commented on the renewed bombardment in eastern Ghouta, but they have often said they do not target civilians.\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Robert Carmichael and Katy Migiro.
