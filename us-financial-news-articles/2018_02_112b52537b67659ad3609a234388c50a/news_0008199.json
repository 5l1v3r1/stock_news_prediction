Baker declined to comment on what had been stolen from the home.

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo \nA Patriots spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nLike many of his teammates, Gronkowski has a home in Foxborough, Massachusetts, the suburb about 25 miles (40 km) south of Boston that is home to Gillette Stadium, where the team pratices and plays. \nThe 28-year-old athlete now in his eighth NFL season is one of the better known faces on the Patriots, cheered on by fans both for his catches as well as off-season antics that have included serving as the celebrity host of a Caribbean cruise following the team’s 2016 Super Bowl victory. \n“It’s kind of a tough combination to have suffered this unfortunate loss and then to get home and be a victim of this kind of crime, which as I say has a really profound effect on everybody when your personal space is breached like that,” Baker said.
