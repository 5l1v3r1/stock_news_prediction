Thirteen new offshore wind farms were completed in 2017, with the U.K. and Germany accounting for the majority of these. The U.K. installed 1.7 GW of offshore wind, while Germany was responsible for 1.3 GW.\nLast year also saw the world's first floating offshore wind farm, Hywind Scotland, begin to send electricity to the Scottish grid. The 30-megawatt farm, which can be used at water depths of up to 800 meters, is operated by Statoil in partnership with Masdar.\nLooking ahead, 11 offshore wind farms are currently being built; these will add an extra 2.9 GW once completed. This \"project pipeline\" should give Europe 25 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2020, WindEurope said.\n\"We'll see further growth in 2018 and 2019,\" Dickson said. \"But the longer term outlook for offshore wind is unclear. Very few countries have defined yet what new volumes they want to install up to 2030.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T13:52:55.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
