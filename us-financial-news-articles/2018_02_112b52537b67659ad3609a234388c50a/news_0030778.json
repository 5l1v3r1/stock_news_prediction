The painting of my father means a lot to me,” Shin told reporters after the game against Japan.\nThe IOC also stopped South Korean male hockey goalie Matt Dalton from wearing a mask with the image of Korean admiral Yi Sun-shin who inflicted defeats on Japan in a 16th century war.\nThe Olympic ruling body did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
