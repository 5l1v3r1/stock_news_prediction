Of course,” Assistant Governor John McDermott told Reuters in an interview. \n“If it kept going in that (upwards) direction and it was following a trend, I’d think you’d find the bank would start using different language.” NUDGE NEEDED FOR INFLATION \nThe RBNZ reinforced its determination to hold rates into 2019 as it grappled with weaker-than-expected inflation. \n“Core inflation...still needs a little shove to get it towards the midpoint. That strategy hasn’t changed,” McDermott said. \nConsumer price inflation for the December quarter undershot all expectations at an annual rate of 1.6 percent. The RBNZ had hoped it would be nearer 2 percent, the middle of its 1-3 percent target band. \nBut with inflation expectations holding around 2 percent and non-tradeable inflation running at 2.5 percent at the end of 2017, McDermott said there was no need to alter interest rate projections. MARKET VOLATILITY A WARNING \nThe central bank was also keeping a close eye on the global move towards lifting interest rates, which Spencer said was a risk to the RBNZ’s current plans to hold policy steady until the second half of 2019. \nSpencer said wild stock market swings around the globe on worries about rising inflation and higher rates had not changed the RBNZ’s forecasts as it had largely been confined to equity markets for now. \n“But you’d have to say it’s been a warning sign because that volatility shows how nervous the market is about...the normalisation of interest rates,” Spencer said. \n“If that volatility translates through into interest rate markets and has a more pervasive effect on our forecasts for example, then it would be an upside risk on our interest rate track.” Reporting by Charlotte Greenfield and John MairEditing by Eric Meijer & Shri Navaratnam", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T08:11:12.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
