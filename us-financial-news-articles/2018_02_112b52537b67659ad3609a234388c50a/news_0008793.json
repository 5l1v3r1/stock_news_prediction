He was alluding to what many believe was the rushed accession of Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and the poorly managed migration of eastern European workers to Britain, which turned many Britons against the European project. \nHahn cited “enlargement fatigue” in some EU countries that still needed to be overcome, but also noted European companies were investing heavily in the Balkans. \nCommission President Jean-Claude Juncker had played down enlargement at the start of his five-year term in 2014, and that left Balkan citizens wondering if they would ever be admitted. \nMacedonia has been an EU candidate country since 2005. Montenegro, where Russia is accused of backing a failed coup, has been one since 2010. Serbia, where Russian media are a growing source of news, has been since 2012. Albania won candidate country status in 2014. \nMeanwhile, Chinese investment in the region, though welcomed by governments, is seen as undermining EU standards because it does not come with the same stringent requirements as EU aid. BALKAN SUPPORT STILL STRONG \nBut in a change of tone, top EU officials now insist there is no alternative but for them to join the European Union. \nTheir inclusion is being held up as an EU ideal that is long overdue since the 1989 end of the Cold War and the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Hahn told Reuters last month it was “time to finish the work of 1989”. \nSupport for EU membership still ranges from roughly 75 percent in Kosovo to 52 percent in Serbia. \nThe Balkan strategy drawn up in Brussels aims to show the region that membership is certain if countries meet EU demands including establishing independent courts, a free press and breaking up crime rings that have badly weakened governments. \nIntegration means increasing access to EU funds and is designed to foster reforms to lure investors, boost growth and encourage stability in a region still grappling with the legacy of Yugoslavia’s socialist planned economy. \nAlbania and Montenegro are already members of the U.S-led NATO alliance while Macedonia is likely to be offered NATO membership, often seen as a springboard to EU membership, if it can overcome a dispute over its name with Greece. \nEU leaders will embrace the 2025 timeline at a special Western Balkans summit in May in Sofia, the Commission said. \nSerbia and Montenegro are the most advanced in the so-called accession process but Hahn said that could easily change. \n“We will only accept a new member state if it has resolved its conflicts with its neighbors,” Hahn said. \nSerbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo, its former province. Belgrade’s ally Russia and five EU states have also refused to recognize Kosovo, including Spain, which is trying to contain its own separatists in Catalonia. \nMogherini said she hoped the Kosovo issue could be resolved by the end of her mandate in 2019.
