It is roughly the size of Greece and believed to be rich in biodiversity and tuna.\nIt is not in the South China Sea and Beijing has made no claim to it. However, Filipino nationalists are suspicious of China’s interest in the area.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte earlier this month banned all foreign scientific research at Benham Rise and told the navy to chase away unauthorized vessels, including Chinese oceanographers, whose research trip he had personally approved only a few weeks earlier.\nAccording to Roque, Beijing had proposed in 2015 to assign Chinese names to five undersea features at Benham Rise before the International Hydrographic Organisation during a conference in Brazil.\nPhilippine diplomats had raised their concern with the Chinese authorities, he said.\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he was not aware of the specific details but said the naming of such features was permitted.\n“China respects the Philippines’ relevant rights to Benham Rise. At the same time, we hope the relevant party can take a professional and responsible view of relevant continuing work,” Geng said.\nDefence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the Philippines would assign its own names to the undersea features of Benham Rise.\nReporting By Manuel Mogato in MANILA and Michael Martina in BEIJING; Editing by Martin Petty\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:08:23.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
