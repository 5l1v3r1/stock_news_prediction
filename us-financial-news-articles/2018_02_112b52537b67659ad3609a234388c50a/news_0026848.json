Written by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, is was intended to rebut a Republican document made public last week with Trump’s consent. \nThe memo by committee Republicans claimed bias against Trump by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department in the federal investigation of Russia and the 2016 U.S. election. \nThe Intelligence Committee had voted unanimously on Monday to release the document drafted by the panel’s Democrats, contingent on the Republican president agreeing to reclassify it. \n“The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency,” Trump tweeted. “Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!” \nTrump’s decision to block the release of the memo infuriated Democrats, who said it showed a double standard on transparency on the part of the Republican president. \nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Saturday that he will review redactions recommended by the FBI and Justice Department.

The FBI expressed “grave concerns about material omissions of fact” in the Republic memo. \nDemocrats said it mischaracterized highly sensitive classified information and was intended to discredit special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of potential collusion between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. \nTrump repeatedly has denied any such collusion. \nLate on Friday, Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, accused Trump of “hypocrisy at its worst” in blocking, at least for now, release of the House Democrats’ memo. \n”Any minor redactions should be made as quickly as possible and the memo should be released,” she said.
