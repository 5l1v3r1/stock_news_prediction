Ascometal, which makes specialty steel and employs around 1,300 workers, filed for court protection last November.\nBut the rescue by Schmolz + Bickenback left out Ascoval, a joint-venture between Ascometal and Vallourec, which employs 300 people. An agreement was reached to guarantee activity at the plant for another year while a buyer is sought.
