I went back home and I had two weeks of very hard practices. I practiced a lot, especially my serve,” the 27-year-old Copil said after his fourth consecutive straight-sets win in Sofia. \n“Not losing a set here gives me a lot of confidence.” Reporting by Angel Krasimirov, editing by Ed Osmond", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T20:40:16.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
