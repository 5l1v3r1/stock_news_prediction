The biggest players in this market are Russia’s two largest lenders - Sberbank and VTB.\nOtkritie had a significantly smaller share in the gold market, Polyus chief executive Pavel Grachev told Reuters in September.\nPolyus’s management report for 2017, published on Thursday, showed that 34 percent of Polyus’s 2017 revenue was received from sales to Otkritie, or $909 million. This compared with 23 percent in 2016. In 2017, Polyus sold a total of 2.16 million troy ounces of gold for $2.7 billion.\nThe increase in gold sales puts Otkritie in second place among Polyus’s customers, overtaking Sberbank, whose share of Polyus’s sales fell to 19 percent from 27 percent in 2017, according to the financial reports. VTB’s share of Polyus’s sales remained flat at 37 percent in 2017.\nPolyus did not immediately respond to a Reuters’ request for comment.\nFormerly Russia’s largest private bank, Otkritie was put under the central bank’s administration in August last year, after rapid expansion and making risky investments.\nPolyus’s 2017 management report followed publication of its 2017 financial results on Thursday.
