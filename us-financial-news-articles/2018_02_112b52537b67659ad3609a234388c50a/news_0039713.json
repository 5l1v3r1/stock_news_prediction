President Michel Temer last week ordered Brazil’s army to take command of all security forces in violent Rio de Janeiro state. Temer argued that he could “lift” that decree for a few hours to allow congress to vote on pension reform. Oliveira disagreed, saying no vote would go forward. Temer is counting on pension reform to bring the deficit under control.
