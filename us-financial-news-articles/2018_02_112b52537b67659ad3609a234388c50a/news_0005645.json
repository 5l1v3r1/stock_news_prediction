The group acquired AvComm through its ill-fated Aeroflex acquisition in 2014, which increased its debt burden.\nChief Executive David Lockwood, who took over in 2016 to lead a turnaround, had said there was little overlap between the Wireless and AvComm units and the rest of the business and the sale followed a competitive process.\n“We can now focus on delivering value-add technology and capabilities to our defense, aerospace and space customers, supported by a more resilient balance sheet,” he said.\nAvComm is based in the U.S., while the Wireless unit, is based in Britain, said Cobham, adding that the deal is expected to complete in the first half of this year.\nShares in Cobham closed at 124.8 pence on Thursday, valuing the company at 3 billion pounds.\nReporting by Sarah Young, editing by James Davey\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:32:22.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
