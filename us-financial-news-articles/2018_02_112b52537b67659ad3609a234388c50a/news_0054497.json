Sometimes the payoffs to us will be modest; occasionally the cash register will ring loudly. And sometimes I will make expensive mistakes. Overall – and over time – we should get decent results. In America, equity investors have the wind at their back.\"\nBerkshire's largest positions included Wells Fargo , Apple and Bank of America shares. The letter said the company had stock holdings totaling $170.5 billion in value at the end of 2017.\nBuffett said the company's interest in Kraft Heinz is not included on the list because Berkshire is part of a \"control group\" and must use a different method to account for its holding. He said the company's position in Kraft Heinz had a year-end value of $25.3 billion with a cost basis of $9.8 billion.\nThe investor also noted some of Berkshire's large stock holdings were managed by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. He said each investment manger controlled more than $12 billion of capital each for the company.\nTweet Link", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T19:05:28.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
