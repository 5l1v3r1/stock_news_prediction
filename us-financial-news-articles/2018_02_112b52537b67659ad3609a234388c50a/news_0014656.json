The unit sells electric motors, heating systems and control units for military and civil vehicles as well as rail and aircraft equipment.\nJenoptik said on Tuesday it had given the Defense & Civil Systems business a new brand to set it apart from the rest of the company. It is also carving out the part of the division that deals with photonics and merging it into its Optics & Life Science segment.
