For sterling to move much higher we would have to see very strong earnings data,” next week, said Jane Foley, London-based FX strategist at Rabobank.\nSterling in January touched $1.4346, its highest level since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.\nMarkets are pricing in around a 70 percent chance of a rate hike as soon as May.\nCommerzbank said the market was failing to price adequately the risk of Brexit-related problems into the pound, such as the failure to secure a transition deal by the end of March.\n“The currency market currently sees only minor risks for significant sterling weakness,” analysts at Commerzbank said, explaining that they believed both Britain and the EU could let the March deadline slip. “We believe it is possible that, in this case, the Pound may experience a temporary episode of weakness.”\nGraphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\nGraphic: Trade-weighted sterling since Brexit vote tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv\nReporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Alison Williams and Jon Boyle\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2hwV9Hv"], "published": "2018-02-15T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:37:34.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
