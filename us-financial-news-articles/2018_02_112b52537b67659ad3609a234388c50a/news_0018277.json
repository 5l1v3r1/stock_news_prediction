He apologised to investors, partners and 20 million registered users of the company’s 600,000 bikes. Slideshow (2 Images) \nNo. 1 Bicycle said on its website that it was shutting due to changes in its operating direction and did not say how it will deal with the left over bikes. \nIt said it would be refunding deposits up until Feb. 12. \nThe firm has registered capital of 5 million yuan (£574,645), according to official filings. \nIn January, Chinese ride-hailing application Didi Chuxing said it would launch a bike-sharing platform within its app that will host partner firms such as Ofo as well as its own bike-sharing brand.
