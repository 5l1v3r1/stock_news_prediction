In that filing, Bank of America noted the potential risk of customers leaving for competitors offering products and services “in areas we deem speculative or risky, such as cryptocurrencies.” \nA spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on why the company chose to add cryptocurrency to its risk factors now. But the bank has shown an increasing appreciation for the transformative potential of both blockchain technology —becoming one of the first to spearhead the development of its own Ethereum-based blockchain —and the cryptocurrencies based on it. Earlier this month, for example, Umar Farooq, JPMorgan Chase’s head of blockchain initiatives, offered a peek into the rapid and enthusiastic uptake of the technology inside the bank. \n“It’s more than thriving. People have been surprised how quickly it basically spread as a way to address and think about customers differently,” Farooq said at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in New York on Feb. 7. “It’s quite insane.” \nThe following week, JPMorgan Chase released a 71-page research report that became known as the “Bitcoin bible” because of its thorough analysis and exploration of a broad spectrum of issues surrounding the dominant cryptocurrency, as well as others such as Ripple. Assessing banks’ current blockchain and cryptocurrency ventures, the bank’s analysts concluded, “Opportunities for banks to utilize blockchain technologies for conducting business could have far-reaching implications for the sector in our view.” SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:59:49.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
