On Tuesday the refugees said soldiers had shot at them and wounded at least two people when around 2,000 people from among the 17,000 living at Kiziba camp in western Rwanda marched out of the camp to protest against a 25 percent cut that began last month in rations provided by the U.N. refugee agency. UNHCR said last month it was cutting rations due to funding shortages. Police asked refugees to leave the UNHCR office in Karongi town, 15 km from the camp, but they refused.

Most of the rest fled the Democratic Republic of Congo during various bouts of instability there over the past 20 years.

UNHCR representatives in Kigali and the agency’s Geneva headquarters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
