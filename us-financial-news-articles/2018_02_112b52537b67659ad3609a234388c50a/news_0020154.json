The rules would not apply to permanent residents applying for citizenship, but would apply to a wide range of people living or working in the United States, including close family members of U.S. citizens and workers employed by U.S. companies. \nIn addition, nearly 620,000 other immigrants living abroad obtained U.S. permanent residence through the State Department in 2016. The State Department typically adopts immigration policies that mirror those of DHS, but Reuters could not establish if it is considering similar policies. The Department did not respond to a request for comment. \nU.S. immigration law has long required officials to exclude a person likely to become a “public charge” from permanent residence. But current U.S. guidelines, in place since 1999, narrowly define “public charge” to be a person “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence,” either through direct cash assistance or government-funded long-term care. \nCurrent guidance instructs immigration officers to look at a narrow range of public benefits in trying to determine whether someone is likely to become a burden, specifically directing officers not to consider most non-cash benefits, such as government food assistance programs or preschool programs. \nThe new rules, if adopted in their current form, would significantly change these guidelines. Under the draft rules, a person would be considered a “public charge” if they depend on “any government assistance in the form of cash, checks or other forms of money transfers, or instrument and non-cash government assistance in the form of aid, services, or other relief,” according to the document seen by Reuters. \nAN ARRAY OF BENEFITS Among the benefits singled out in the draft rule for consideration are: health insurance subsidies such as those provided by the Affordable Care Act; the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); WIC, a federal program that feeds poor pregnant or nursing women and their children; transportation and housing vouchers; programs that help the poor pay their heating bills; and programs such as Head Start, which provides early education to low-income children. \nSome benefits would not be considered in making the “public charge” determination under the draft regulations, including emergency or disaster relief, public health assistance for immunizations, attending public school, receiving free or reduced-price school lunches, and earned benefits such as disability insurance, Medicare and unemployment payments. \nAccording to the draft rule, the government will also have the authority to obtain information from a broad range of state and federal government entities to determine if someone has requested or received public benefits, and to obtain an applicant’s credit report to determine their financial status. \nAnd though DHS allows applicants to request fee waivers for many immigration benefits, receiving such a waiver could be used as evidence that the applicant could become a public charge, according to the draft rule. \nReporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Sue Horton and Ross Colvin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T21:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T21:33:46.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
