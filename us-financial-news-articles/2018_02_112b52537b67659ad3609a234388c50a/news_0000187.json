(OTCQB:WLKR) (“Walker Innovation” or the “Company”), which seeks to develop and commercialize its unique portfolio of intellectual property assets through licensing and enforcement operations and is pursuing an effort to acquire one or more operating businesses, today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, Walker Innovation had in excess of $24 million in cash and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet. Operating expenses were $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a 46% reduction compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $0.7 million, or ($0.04) per share, compared to net income of $15.4 million, or $0.43 per share on a fully diluted basis, in the prior-year period. Results for the fourth quarter of 2016 included $14.7 million in unrealized and realized gains on investment in connection with the exercise of the Upside Warrant and sale of the related shares, as well as the recording of the Upside Warrant at fair value.\n“I am pleased that we continue to keep operating expenses at a relatively stable and reduced level while we continue our concerted pursuit of acquisitions and other opportunities to create shareholder value,” said Jonathan Siegel, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFor the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Walker Innovation reported no revenue versus total revenue of $1.9 million in the prior-year period.\nManagement expects that the timing and results of patent prosecution and the Company’s enforcement proceedings relating to its intellectual property rights will fluctuate from period to period.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter 2017 were approximately $0.7 million versus $1.3 million in the prior-year period, primarily due to reduced overhead by eliminating positions and streamlining processes to conserve cash across its business.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.7 million compared to net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $15.4 million. Net loss per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.04, compared to diluted net income per common share of $0.43 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 results included a non-cash, unrealized gain of approximately $7.6 million in connection with the ownership of the Company’s warrant to acquire shares of Upside and a realized gain of approximately $7.1 million in connection with the exercise and sale of 3.75 million shares associated with the warrant. The Company sold its remaining 12.65 million shares of Upside during the second quarter of 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, Walker Innovation had $24.0 million in cash and no outstanding long-term debt on its consolidated balance sheet.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain certain “forward-looking statements” that reflect the Company’s current expectations and projections about its future results, performance, prospects and opportunities.
