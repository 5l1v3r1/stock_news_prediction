On BRGAAP, the expected loss model is used 8 .\n(b) On IFRS (IAS 39 and 32), stocks and quotas classified as permanent investments were measured at fair value and its gains and losses were recorded directly on Equity, with no impact on the income statement of the period.\n(c) On IFRS, the effect of accounting at fair value the acquisition of the participation in Porto Seguro Itaú Unibanco Participações S.A. was recognized.\n(d) On the IFRS (IAS 39), the assets and financial liabilities measured at amortized cost are recognized according to the methodology of effective interest rate, which appropriates the revenues and costs directly attributed to the acquisition, issue or disposal for the period of operation. On BRGAAP, the recognition of expenses and revenues from fees occurs at the time of contracting these operations.\n(e) Under IFRS (IAS 17) the financial leasing operations are recorded as Fixed Assets on the other hand of Other Financial Liabilities. On BRGAAP, as of September 30, 2015, the consideration of these transactions are now recorded in income in accordance with CMN Resolution No. 3,617/08.\n(f) Other Adjustments mainly comprise the difference in the eligibility of operations of the Cash Flow Hedge for purposes of IFRS and the reversal of the Goodwill\nAmortizations pursuant the BRGAAP.\n8 For more details see our Complete Financial Statements for January to December, 2017\nFor comparison purposes, we present on the table below the Result and the Recurring Result according to the IFRS and the BRGAAP.\nR$ million\nRecurring Result\n4 th Q/17\n3 rd Q/17\njan-dec/17\njan-dec/16\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nBRGAAP\nIFRS\nVariation\nResult - Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n5,821\n5,485\n(336)\n6,077\n6,048\n(29)\n23,965\n23,903\n(62)\n21,639\n23,263\n1,624\nExclusion of the Non-Recurring Events\n459\n424\n(35)\n177\n52\n(125)\n914\n496\n(418)\n583\n251\n(332)\nProvision Expenses for Citibank Integration\n277\n277\n-\n-\n-\n-\n277\n277\n-\n-\n-\n-\nGoodwill Amortization\n135\n-\n(135)\n125\n-\n(125)\n508\n-\n(508)\n441\n-\n(441)\nDisposal of IRB shares\n-\n-\n-\n(155)\n(155)\n-\n(155)\n(155)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nLiability Adequacy Test\n(145)\n(45)\n100\n-\n-\n-\n(165)\n(74)\n91\n(109)\n-\n109\nCivil Lawsuits - Economic Plans\n-\n-\n-\n61\n61\n-\n101\n101\n-\n224\n224\n-\nTax Contingencies and Legal Liabilities\n184\n184\n-\n9\n9\n-\n226\n226\n-\n6\n6\n-\nImpairment\n7\n7\n-\n137\n137\n-\n152\n152\n-\n181\n181\n-\nProgram for the Settlement or Installment Payment of Taxes\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(14)\n(14)\n-\nPension Fund\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(130)\n(130)\n-\nOthers\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(31)\n(31)\n-\n(18)\n(18)\n-\nRecurring Result - Attributable to Controlling Stockholders\n6,280\n5,909\n(371)\n6,254\n6,100\n(154)\n24,879\n24,399\n(481)\n22,222\n23,514\n1,291\nThe tables in this report show the figures in millions.
