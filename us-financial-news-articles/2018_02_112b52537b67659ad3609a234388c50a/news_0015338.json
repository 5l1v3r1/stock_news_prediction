Now, we have a lot more games to play and we need to keep fighting,“ Valencia told the club’s website. ”We need to keep going. \n“The important thing is to get the three points, playing at home, playing well, and we will carry on with this mentality until the end of the season.” \nUnited bounced back from a 2-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur last Wednesday to beat Huddersfield Town 2-0 on Saturday. \n“We have showed that we have the quality and conditions to fight until the end of the season,” Valencia added. \nUnited travel to 16th-placed Newcastle United on Sunday.
