By reversing the Obama administration policies, the report argues, the economy will be able to grow 3% per year over the next decade. \n“In recent years, the pursuit of alternative policy aspirations at the expense of growth has imposed real economic costs on the American people, in the form of diminished opportunity, security, equity, and even health,” the report said.
