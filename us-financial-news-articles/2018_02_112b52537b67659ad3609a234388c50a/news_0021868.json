When further information is available you will be informed,” Reeb told reporters.\nCAS is also handling appeals of Russians, including Olympic champion skater Viktor Ahn, who had not been named in the doping investigations or had any prior doping offences but were still not invited due to doping suspicions by the IOC.\nThe Games run from Feb. 9-25.
