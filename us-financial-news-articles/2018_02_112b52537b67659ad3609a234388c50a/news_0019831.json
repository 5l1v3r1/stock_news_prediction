Over the study period, 25 in every 1,000 people with migraines had a heart attack, compared with 17 out of every 1,000 individuals without a history of these headaches. \nSimilarly, 45 in 1,000 people with migraines experienced the most common type of stroke, compared with 25 out of every 1,000 people without a migraine history. \nClots in the legs developed in 27 of every 1,000 people with migraines and 18 in 1,000 people without these headaches. And, with migraines, 47 in 1,000 people developed an irregular heartbeat, compared with 34 in 1,000 other individuals. \nIn general, the risk of cardiovascular problems associated with migraines was higher for people who had a history of migraines with aura (visual symptoms such as flashing or shimmering lights, zigzagging lines or stars). \nOne limitation of the study is that some people with migraines might not have been properly diagnosed, the authors note. Another drawback is that researchers lacked data on other factors like exercise habits that can independently influence the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. \nStill, the findings add to a growing body of evidence that even young, healthy people may develop cardiovascular disease if they experience migraines, said Tobias Kurth, author of an accompanying editorial and director of the Institute of Public Health at the Charite - Universitatsmedizin in Berlin. \n“Migraine, specifically migraine with aura, has previously been associated with an increased risk of stroke and there was increasing evidence that migraine is also related to other non-stroke cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular causes,” Kurth said by email. \n“These findings matter for patients because having migraine puts them at an added risk for cardiovascular disease above and beyond the risk from other known factors such as hypertension, smoking, obesity, etc.,” Kurth added. \nSOURCE: bit.ly/2BkgXPS The BMJ, online January 31, 2018.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T19:43:51.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
