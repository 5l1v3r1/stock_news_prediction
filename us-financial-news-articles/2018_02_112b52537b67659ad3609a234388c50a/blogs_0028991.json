The people in this country are not going to accept it,” Corre said at the event.\nThe company was granted an injunction in 2017 by Britain’s High Court, preventing anti-fracking protesters from interfering with its operations. Corre told crowd that activists were “not frightened of,” the injunction.\nAn Ineos spokesman said that activists’ assertions that their legal action had made all protest unlawful in the UK was not the case.\n“Our injunctions prohibit unlawful acts by protesters and in no way impinge on the right to peaceful protest. These injunctions simply protect Ineos and our people from hard core activists who game the system and treat the law with contempt.”\nReporting by Helena Williams; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:27:45.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
