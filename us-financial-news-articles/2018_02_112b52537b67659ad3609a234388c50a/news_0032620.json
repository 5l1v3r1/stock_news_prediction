The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!” Trump said in a tweet.\nReporting by Susan Heavey; Writing by Mohammad Zargham; editing by Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T00:28:32.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
