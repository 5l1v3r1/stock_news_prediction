I think the market over-reacted a little bit,\" she added.\nU.S. 10-year yields, which move inversely to prices, have risen about 43 basis points so far this year. U.S. 30-year yields are on a similar path, climbing 39 basis points in 2018.\nPart of the run-up, however, was not all due to events in the United States, analysts said.\nTD Securities interest rates strategist Gennadiy Goldberg said global central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of England have started to normalize their monetary policies, pushing yields higher. That has spilled over to the U.S. Treasury market.\n\"There is a global re-pricing of the quantitative easing trade,\" Goldberg said.\nAnalysts have lifted their yield forecast for both U.S. 10-year Treasuries and 10-year German Bunds.\nDanske Bank said in a research note that it believes the rapid rise in yields is slowing down, but they remain on an upward track as the global cyclical recovery continues.\nIt expects the 10-year Treasury yield to rise to 3.3 percent on a 12-month horizon, while 10-year Bunds could climb to 1.2 percent, from the current 0.73 percent.\nIn late trading, U.S. 10-year yields fell to 2.840 percent from 2.855 percent late on Monday. U.S. 10-year yields hit 2.902 percent on Monday, the highest since January 2014.\nU.S. 30-year bond yields fell to 3.128 percent, from Monday's 3.136 percent. The yield on the maturity touched an 11-month peak of 3.139 percent on Monday.
