The company, whose brands include Churchill, Green Flag and Privilege, said operating profit from continuing operations was 610.9 million pounds ($853.49 million) for the year ended Dec. 31, compared with 403.5 million pounds a year earlier. Gross written premiums for ongoing operations rose 3.6 percent to 3.39 billion pounds in the period, it said. Direct Line added it would pay a special dividend of 15 pence, higher than 10 pence it paid last year.
