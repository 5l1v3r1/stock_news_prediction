The most popular figureheads are both unable to run; Henrique Capriles is barred from office while Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest. Several countries, including major Latin American countries, have already said the vote will lack legitimacy. \nBut other opposition activists say they have to keep up pressure by voting, and an upset could occur given public disgust at growing national penury. \nOpposition leader Julio Borges said the coalition would meet Thursday afternoon. “We’re talking... of hours until we respond to the nation,” he told local radio. \nThere is a risk the perennially squabbling opposition will split over strategy, with some boycotting the vote and others backing several different candidates. \nMaduro, meanwhile, has been reveling in near-daily campaign speeches. During hours-long events broadcast on state television, cheering red-shirted supporters sing his campaign jingle “Everyone with Maduro” while he dances salsa with first lady Cilia Flores, whom he calls the “First Combatant.” Related Coverage U.S. denounces lack of guarantees for fairness in Venezuela election \nMaduro has also been distancing himself from his charismatic predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. \nHe and his allies have exited the Chavez-era party known as Venezuela’s United Socialist Party (PSUV) to create a new movement called We Are Venezuela. Chavez, who died of cancer five years ago, is also barely featured in Maduro’s campaign, unlike in the 2013 election where Maduro pitched himself as the “son” of the former president. \nOpposition activists say Maduro’s focus on campaign aesthetics show he is an uncaring tyrant vying to amass power even if it risks pushing Venezuela into a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Maduro, meanwhile, says opposition leaders are feckless right-wing elites who get their orders from Washington.
