This as rival Expedia has fallen nearly 19 percent and is the second worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 .\nAri Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, explained that from a technical standpoint, there is reason to be skeptical of TripAdvisor's recent rally. \"This stock is still making lower highs for the past few years, I am very skeptical of this move, and if it's truly marking a change in the long-term trend,\" Wald said Tuesday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\"\nWhile Wald doesn't believe either the TripAdvisor or Expedia charts show strong long-term trends, between the two, \"TripAdvisor is overbought in a poor trend, so I think TripAdvisor is the tactical play here to sell. Forty-six dollars is the key resistance level.\"\nFurthermore, Boris Schlossberg, managing director at BK Asset Management, said Tuesday on \"Trading Nation\" that while neither stock is a buy right now, \"the bullish case for both is if you're truly a big believer in a massive bull move this year in the market, and that the tax cut is going to increase spending on travel.\"\nTripAdvisor and Expedia shares were roughly unchanged midday Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:23:07.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
