These results have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and are stated in nominal Peruvian Soles (S/).\nFinancial and Operational Highlights:\n4Q17 Highlights\n(All comparisons are to 4Q16 unless otherwise stated)\nSales volume of cement, concrete and blocks increased 7.3%, primarily due to increased sales volume to the self-construction segment and to a pick up in public sector spending. Gross margin was 41.3%; a 1.2 percentage point increase, primarily due to a higher average price of cement. Cement EBITDA increased 13.9%, to S/105.5 million. Cement EBITDA margin increased to 32.2% for the fourth quarter 2017. Consolidated EBITDA decreased 35.7% due to a write-off in the Company’s investment in the Salmueras Sudamericanas S.A. brine project. It is important to note that this is a non-cash capital impairment. Net income from Continuing Operations excluding the non-cash impairment provision would have been S/36.5 million, similar to that of 3Q17, with a 247.7% increase as compared to 4Q16.\n2017 Highlights\n(All comparisons are to 2016 unless otherwise stated)\nSales volume of cement, concrete and blocks decreased by only 0.8%, despite the significant decline in sales volume during the first four months of the year due to Coastal El Niño. It is important to note that year-on-year sales volume has increased steadily every month, from May through the end of the year. Gross margin was 40.1%, in line with that of full year 2016. Cement EBITDA reached S/375.3 million; a decrease of only 2.2%, despite the negative effects of Coastal El Niño on both sales and costs. Cement EBITDA margin was 30.6%, in line with that of the full year 2016. Consolidated EBITDA decreased 12.9%, primarily due to the non-cash impairment provision related to the Salmueras Sudamericanas S.A. brine project. Net income from Continuing Operations excluding the impairment provision would have been S/118.8 million for the full year 2017, in line with that of 2016.\nFor a full version of Cementos Pacasmayo’s Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release, please visit http://www.cementospacasmayo.com.pe/investors/ .\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION:\nCementos Pacasmayo will host a conference call on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, to discuss these results at 10:00 a.m. Lima Time/Eastern Time .\nTo access the call, please dial:\n+1 (877) 407-0782 (From within the U.S.)\n+1 (201) 689-8567 (From outside the U.S.)\nThere will also be a live Audio Webcast of the event at:\nhttp://www.investorcalendar.com/event/24616\nAbout Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A.\nCementos Pacasmayo S.A.A. is a cement company, located in the Northern region of Peru.
