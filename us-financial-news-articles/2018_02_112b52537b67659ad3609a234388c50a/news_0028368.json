Dr. Moniz is the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics and Engineering Systems Emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and serves as Special Advisor to the President of MIT. Dr. Moniz served as Secretary of Energy from 2013 - 2017.\n“We require breakthrough energy technologies to achieve our goals for a clean, prosperous and secure energy future,” said Dr. Moniz. “Innovative nuclear technologies such as Terrestrial Energy’s Integral Molten Salt Reactor have the potential to meet that challenge. I am pleased to be supporting Terrestrial Energy as they move forward with their project.”\n“We are delighted to have Dr. Moniz join Terrestrial Energy’s team,” said Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy. “Dr. Moniz’s deep policy and technical experience will be a great asset to Terrestrial Energy as it continues to expand its government and industry engagements, and to meet its goal of commissioning the first commercial IMSR ® power plants in the 2020s.”\nDr. Ernest Moniz has a distinguished career in academia and public service. Before serving as Secretary of Energy, he was a member of the MIT faculty from 1973 to 2013, where he was the Founding Director of the MIT Energy Initiative and Director of the Laboratory for Energy and the Environment, the Head of the MIT Department of Physics, and Director of the Bates Linear Accelerator Center.\nDr. Moniz is a Fellow of the American Physics Society, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Humboldt Foundation, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and inaugural Distinguished Fellow of the Emerson Collective. He is the Co-Chairman and CEO of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, and also CEO of Energy Futures Initiative, Inc., a non-profit energy innovation policy institute. Dr. Moniz received a Bachelor of Science degree summa cum laude in physics from Boston College, a doctorate in theoretical physics from Stanford University, and nine honorary doctorates.\nAbout Terrestrial Energy\nTerrestrial Energy is a developer of advanced reactor power plants that use its proprietary Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR ® ) technology. This technology represents true innovation in cost reduction, versatility and functionality. IMSR ® power plants will provide clean, convenient, dispatchable and cost-competitive heat for many industrial applications, including electric power provision and heat for industrial processes, such as chemical synthesis and desalination. They extend the application of nuclear energy far beyond electric power markets. IMSR ® power plants promise to transform industrial competitiveness, energy security, and drive economic growth. Their deployment can realize rapid global decarbonization of the primary energy system by displacing fossil fuel combustion across a broad spectrum. Using an innovative design, and proven and demonstrated Molten Salt Reactor technology, Terrestrial Energy plans to bring IMSR ® power plants to markets in the 2020s.\nContact:\nJarret Adams\nTerrestrial Energy\nPhone: (202) 815-9234\nEmail: jadams@fulloncom.com\nContact:\nBrian Smith\nTerrestrial Energy\nPhone: (416) 822-3130\nEmail: bsmith@the-lanes.ca\nWebsite: www.terrestrialenergy.com\nE-mail: info@terrestrialenergy.com\nSocial Media\nFacebook: TerrestrialMSR\nTwitter: TerrestrialMSR\nYouTube: Terrestrial Energy\nLinkedIn: TerrestrialEnergy\nGoogle+: TerrestrialEnergy\nKeywords\nEnvironment\nClimate\nNuclear Energy\nScience\nTechnology\nMolten Salt Reactor\nSource:Terrestrial Energy Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CXSDGJpHD3SI3Gp_T6ZolTuz2UeyYk3HgkiqpP0Gq5kgeLIwesh0lHMlN25r7Gv6_S6HECBpl-M5zU0DswbUID_bS6mFIe1jgGXJBMrfOfOsffI7eUviMqwKP6THLLio", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SUCxISvwu2TfTk4L_O--TqfZcnrZmxhlZskq6UHNR4I3NDcs2BMfKPToCU2eDHWNEapRkZvFv0IE9OMEqFfuvDtlM55GQQPooieLyOpfbaA=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CXSDGJpHD3SI3Gp_T6ZolV6KuTgGuqyNnEcAf2YEkRGN-S5flACh5FAvdKNNqDqXZkFmispBly8VYWiVWdPAQf_STF91z7250ccHzcMYWsGDUmsufPhTGT7tBDKsop9DUuaMBZc5p4tRDDlkZh0fWA==", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=htXJT3TzjSWWu79FXfo78T3CquZetIiXg_5jIiPjOZyKX5GnI_P5b_naSbmD2KCwYaMGzyfbYBQkg6w1Bw4yamSIFJS_XzBl5DyqiQhoxfv_xo8M6CgXsTPuSTIUU605", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CXSDGJpHD3SI3Gp_T6ZolW9AhmLu9v_1qot0Fzbwm2KS1OSl4RrrKQ2uRiKYxa93AYvH2kDemcMBGPKT554rIT9KtUMxL5HvBMrxCf04pyw=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CXSDGJpHD3SI3Gp_T6ZolezljWFEtKeVeBxLNkQV0t6vbPdlMKWAG54AmTY5PgBI6kEezFYCd_5btgeEu0u_JMx536ZeZnC_lXDagFzJUvw=", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=CXSDGJpHD3SI3Gp_T6ZolVAe7Us_3mq49BDYud6RBRYlFaH5wvELR_vWiScyW0bY326cISMtgZ876QTZNofsGsaHcvQxCf-Zy05jUDg-qeVhqEtToSmPZKnHsVwmZrsRr0OMloZVTjis54tup1ZqAQ=="], "published": "2018-02-14T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T18:36:07.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
