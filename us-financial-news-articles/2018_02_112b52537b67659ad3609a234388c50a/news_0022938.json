There has to be. In the meantime, the long-term investor should keep invested and look at the bigger picture,” he added Reporting by Sudip Kar-GuptaEditing by Dominique Vidalon", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T10:15:07.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
