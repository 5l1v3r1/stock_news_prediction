For instance, when I'm going through a hectic week, I reflect on why I started my company . When I rekindle my passion for helping others financially, even the most difficult tasks seem like a breeze. Whatever your mission is, you should also step back, reflect and use it to fuel your progress.\nManipulate your environment \"The path to success is to take massive, determined action,\" said Tony Robbins.\nAn easy solution to build your mental power is to tweak your everyday environment.

Quite simply, you want to make it easier to do positive habits and harder to do bad ones.\nFor example, to hit your financial goals, instead of filling your wallet with tempting credit cards , opt to leave them behind and just bring budgeted cash.

Start using this habit by accepting that you cannot always give in to things that make you feel better in that moment, especially if they aren't aligned with your long-term plans.\nFor example, in the world of finance, many investors fail because of their inability to delay gratification . For your investments to compound, you must stand by your long-term strategies and not be stirred by emotional tendencies.\nSurround yourself with positive energy \"Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher,\" said Oprah Winfrey.\nAccording to research , networking is an important predictor of career success. And striving to expand your network with inspirational people is a great stepping stone for improving your mental strength.\nEmotions are contagious .
