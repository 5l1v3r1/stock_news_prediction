Net earnings were $1.1 million or $0.14 diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to net earnings of $551,000 or $0.07 diluted earnings per share for the six months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $598,000 or 108.5%.\nThe increase in net earnings on a quarter-to-quarter basis was primarily attributable to increased non-interest income and lower income tax expense.\nNon-interest income increased $360,000 to $436,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily because of an increase in earnings on bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”). During the quarter just ended the Bank received BOLI insurance proceeds on policies maintained under its long-standing overall employee benefits program pursuant to the passing of a covered individual.\nThe Company recorded a net income tax benefit of $160,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to federal income tax expense of $139,000 in the prior year quarter. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily related to a change in income tax law. Recently-enacted tax reform has reduced the top income tax rate for corporations beginning January 1, 2018. Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles the effect of changes in tax laws or rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period in which the legislation is enacted. The Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $268,000 related to lower tax rates expected to be applied to its net deferred tax liabilities in the future.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses increased $12,000 or 0.5% to $2.5 million for the three-month period just ended. Interest income increased by $173,000, or 6.2%, to $3.0 million, while interest expense increased $161,000 or 47.2% to $502,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Costs associated with the Company’s funding sources are increasing as short-term interest rates continue to rise. The Company recorded a $3,000 provision for losses on loans during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a provision of $52,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense increased $105,000 or 5.0% and totaled $2.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in net earnings on a six-month basis was also primarily attributable to increased non-interest income and lower income tax expense.\nNon-interest income increased $332,000 to $576,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the prior year quarter, primarily because of an increase in BOLI earnings. Federal income taxes decreased $324,000 or 108.4% as the Company’s income tax benefit totaled $25,000 for the recently-ended six-month period compared to income tax expense of $299,000 in the prior year period, primarily because of the change in income tax law.\nNet interest income before provision for loan losses decreased $16,000 or 0.3% to $4.9 million for the six-month period just ended. Interest income increased by $285,000, or 5.1%, to $5.9 million, while interest expense increased $301,000 or 45.0% to $970,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2017. The Company recorded a $3,000 provision for losses on loans during the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a provision of $56,000 for the six months ended December 31, 2016. Non-interest expense increased $95,000 or 2.2% and totaled $4.4 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017 assets increased $955,000 or 0.3% to $309.4 million compared to $308.5 million at June 30, 2017. This increase is attributable primarily to increases in loans and time deposits, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. Total liabilities increased $436,000 or 0.2% to $241.8 million at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in deposits, which increased $8.5 million or 4.6% to $191.3 million at December 31, 2017. The Company has been successful in competing for and attracting deposits in its local markets as short-term interest rates have risen. FHLB advances decreased $7.2 million or 12.8% and totaled $48.6 million at quarter end.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company reported its book value per share as $8.01.\nThis press release may contain statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995 or the Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations and releases.
