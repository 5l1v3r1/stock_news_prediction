REUTERS/Brian Snyder \nTrump raised the issue of standing for the anthem again during his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday while NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who has been supportive of players rights to protest, discussed it on Wednesday. \nThe impact of Kaepernick’s activism was also on display at the NFLPA’s media conference as a video featuring the quarterback and his lone protest that grew into a social movement was broadcast. \nA poster with players’ hands raised and the caption, “I am an Activist” was also displayed on one side of the room. \nKaepernick’s activism, however, has come at a cost. \nHe has been unemployed this season despite injuries at other teams that have created job openings and pundits have suggested his protest was the key reason teams are wary of signing him. \nLast October, he filed a grievance against the NFL accusing the 32 owners of collusion. \nSmith, like Goodell, refused to comment on the case but noted the season had been the most rewarding in charge of the NFLPA, as members locked arms and rallied around a cause. \n“What you’ve seen this year, for me personally, is one of most exciting and thrilling and in many ways one of the most rewarding years I’ve had in this job,” said Smith. \n“You see a group of men who responded as a team, at times responded with more respect than the respect they were given.” Editing by Greg Stutchbury", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T03:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T03:24:30.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
