Analysts have therefore seen the drives division as a prime candidate for disposal. \nThe business has seen a recovery in 2017 following restructuring. Through the first nine months, sales rose nearly 15 percent to 532 million francs. $1 = 0.9319 Swiss francs Additional reporting by John Miller; Editing by Mark Potter", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T15:55:34.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
