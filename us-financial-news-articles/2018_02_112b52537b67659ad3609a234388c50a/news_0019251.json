Ineos had to declare force majeure on exports and the outage pushed up global oil prices. \nIn a note to customers, Ineos said that “when these valves close, then this requires FPS (Forties Pipeline System) to shut down the pipeline system”. \nIt said the operator had mobilised a team to investigate the cause of the valve closure and was therefore not yet able to give a timeline for a restart. \nForties is the biggest of the five North Sea crude grades underpinning dated Brent, a benchmark used for oil trading in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. \nThe pipeline was originally built to bring oil ashore from the vast Forties field. Over time, more oil and gas fields, now in excess of 50, were linked to it. \nRoyal Dutch Shell said production at its Shearwater platform in the North Sea had been shut down as a result of the outage. The Nelson field, which also connects to the pipeline, had already been closed for maintenance, a spokesman said. \nTotal said it had to stop gas exports from its Elgin Franklin terminal due to the Forties pipeline outage.
