He listens to AC/DC and rock and roll while training. REUTERS/Mike Blake Olsen moved up to the front of the sled after helping the American four-man team to 12th place in Sochi four years ago and was one of three pilots selected in the United States team.\n“We know he’s going to do what he can within his power to be at the starting line on race day,” Steele added.\n“There’s no question he’s mentally ready, but we are looking at our options in case he physically can’t compete.”\nDoctors usually recommend rest for one to three weeks after a laparoscopic appendectomy before a patient resumes normal activity.\nReporting by Nick Mulvenney, editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T07:14:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
