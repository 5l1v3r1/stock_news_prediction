The benchmark 10-year bond yield fell 2 basis points to 7.48 percent.\n“We maintain that PSBs (public sector banks) are vulnerable to the NPA- (non-performing asset) related situation,” said Deven Choksey, founder, KR Choksey Investment Managers.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.04 percent at 10,543.75, as of 0649 GMT, pulled down by State Bank of India and ICICI Bank.\nThe benchmark BSE index slipped 0.06 percent to 34,282.76.\nThe Nifty PSU bank index shed as much as 2.8 percent, with SBI leading the decline with a 2 percent fall. Bank of India and Punjab National Bank dropped over 5 percent.\nAmong gainers, Nifty IT index rose nearly a percent after falling 4.3 percent this month, as of Monday’s close.\nHCL Technologies and Wipro Ltd gained around 1.5 percent each.\nReporting by Tanvi Mehta in Bengaluru,; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:01:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
