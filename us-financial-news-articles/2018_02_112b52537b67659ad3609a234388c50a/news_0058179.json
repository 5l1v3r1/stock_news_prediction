Gavrilova lost her temper during a match against American Madison Brengle at the Acapulco Open on Monday, the Australian throwing her racket after misfiring on a serve and nearly hitting a ballkid. Tennis - Australian Open - Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne, Australia, January 18, 2018. Australia's Daria Gavrilova in action during her match against Belgium's Elise Mertens. REUTERS/Issei Kato The racket then bounced up and slammed into the umpire’s chair, yet Gavrilova escaped punishment and went on to win the match 4-6 6-3 6-3. Kyrgios, known for tantrums and controversial moments of his own, tweeted a video of the incident and wrote: “I would be banned for 6 years and been on every paper and news channel for the next month.” American Coco Vandeweghe, who has also found herself in trouble with tennis authorities, appeared to support Kyrgios with a reply to his tweet that included an emoji of a woman shrugging. “Double standards everywhere,” she commented.
