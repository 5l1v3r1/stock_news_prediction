Dowden said the steps that Capita took on Wednesday to strengthen its balance sheet, such as stopping dividend payments, showed that it was acting responsibly. \n“Arguably these are exactly the measures that could have prevented Carillion from getting into the difficulties that they did,” he said. \n“This is further evidence of shareholders and not the taxpayer taking the burden on this.” \nThe government has been criticized, however, for its approach to these contracting companies. \nOpposition Labour party member of parliament Rachel Reeves said that government thinking was “muddled and complacent”. \nShe urged the government to reconsider decision to outsource other services, saying there were more similarities than differences between Capita and Carillion. \n“Jobs, pensions and small businesses and vital public services now depend on these outsourcing companies. But it’s time we rethought the whole strategy for public service provision,” Reeves said. \n“How many more warning signs does this government need?” Reporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison and Jane Merriman", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:06:35.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
