The exchange, which froze all withdrawals of yen and digital currencies following the theft, said it had confirmed the integrity of its system security.\nCoincheck has received withdrawal requests from customers totalling about 30 billion yen ($280 million), a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week.\nStill, the exchange said it would keep restrictions on cryptocurrency withdrawals until it could guarantee the secure resumption of its operations. It did not give further details.\nThe Coincheck heist exposed flaws in Japan’s system of regulating cryptocurrency trading, and raised questions over the country’s dash to oversee the industry - a move that was in sharp contrast to clampdowns by policymakers in countries such as South Korea, China and India.
