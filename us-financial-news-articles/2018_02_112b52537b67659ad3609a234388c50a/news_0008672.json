(NASDAQ:AMAG) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its application to broaden the existing label for Feraheme ® (ferumoxytol injection) beyond the current chronic kidney disease (CKD) indication to include all eligible adult Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron. This sNDA approval immediately doubles the number of patients who could benefit from Feraheme to include both CKD and non-CKD patients.\n\"Iron deficiency anemia is a serious and under-treated health condition which negatively impacts quality of life for millions of people, many of whom do not benefit from or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy,” said Michael Auerbach, M.D., Clinical Professor at Georgetown University School of Medicine. \"Physicians now have a new option for patients who meet the broader ferumoxytol injection indication that can be administered in 15 minutes providing a gram of iron in two doses as few as three days apart.\"\nThe Feraheme label expansion approval was supported by two positive pivotal Phase 3 trials evaluating Feraheme versus iron sucrose or placebo in a broad population of patients with IDA. It was also supported by positive results from a third Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, clinical safety trial comparing Feraheme to Injectafer ® (ferric carboxymaltose injection) in approximately 2,000 adults with IDA. The study demonstrated comparability to Injectafer ® based on the primary composite endpoint of the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension.\nThe study also met important secondary safety and efficacy endpoints, including the demonstration of mean improvement in hemoglobin per gram of iron administered from baseline to week 5 (1.35 g/dL Feraheme versus 1.10 g/dL Injectafer ® ). Adverse event rates were similar across both treatment groups, however, the incidence of severe hypophosphatemia (defined by blood phosphorous of <0.6 mmol/L at week 2) was less in the patients receiving Feraheme (0.4% of patients) compared to those receiving Injectafer ® (38.7% of patients).\n“An expanded Feraheme label that includes all eligible adult IDA patients will double the addressable market opportunity estimated to be nearly a million patients per year for Feraheme and provide for future growth within this broader IDA market segment,” said Nik Grund, chief commercial officer at AMAG. “In addition, roughly 4.5 million Americans suffer from the debilitating effects of IDA. AMAG is proud that Feraheme may now be a treatment option for all eligible IDA patients.”\nAMAG is committed to researching and developing therapies to address unmet medical needs and often-overlooked conditions, such as IDA. As part of the company’s efforts to help ensure all patients who can benefit from AMAG’s products are able to access them, AMAG offers a comprehensive patient access support program and patient assistance for qualifying Feraheme patients through AMAG Assist™. Uninsured or underinsured patients who need help paying for their Feraheme prescription should call 844-635-2624 to see if they qualify for help.\nAbout Feraheme ® (ferumoxytol injection)\nFeraheme received marketing approval from the FDA in June 2009 for the treatment of IDA in adult CKD patients and was commercially launched by AMAG in the U.S. shortly thereafter. Ferumoxytol is protected in the U.S. by seven issued patents covering the composition and dosage form of the product. Six of the issued patents are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book, the last of which expires in June 2023.\nFatal and serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have occurred in patients receiving Feraheme. Initial symptoms may include hypotension, syncope, unresponsiveness, cardiac/cardiorespiratory arrest. Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in patients in whom a previous Feraheme dose was tolerated. Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies may have a greater risk of anaphylaxis with parenteral iron products. Feraheme is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to Feraheme or any of its components, or a history of allergic reaction to any intravenous iron product. Feraheme may cause clinically significant hypotension. Excessive therapy with parenteral iron can lead to excess storage of iron and possible hemosiderosis. Administration of Feraheme may transiently affect the diagnostic ability of magnetic resonance imaging. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 2%) are diarrhea, headache, nausea, dizziness, hypotension, constipation, and peripheral edema.\nFor additional product information, please see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warning, available at www.feraheme.com .\nAbout AMAG\nAMAG is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering important therapeutics, conducting clinical research in areas of unmet need and creating education and support programs for the patients and families we serve.
