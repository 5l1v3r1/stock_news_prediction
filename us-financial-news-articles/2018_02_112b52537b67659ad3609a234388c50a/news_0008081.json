Coming on the heels of a quarter of record growth for the company, this expansion of the executive leadership team ensures Dtex is well equipped to continue to meet the increasing demand for scalable, intelligent security solutions.\nIn this newly created role, Holton will be responsible for all of Dtex’s go-to-market operations - including sales, marketing, and sales support functions. He most recently served as the President and Chief Revenue Officer (CRO) of Blancco Technology Group and has held CRO positions at leading companies such as Entrust, Webroot, Genesys, and Good Technology. Notably, as a founding employee and VP of Sales at RightNow Technologies (later acquired by Oracle), Holton built the sales organization from the ground up and grew the company’s revenue from $0 to $100 million in just five years.\n“We’re seeing a notable shift in the maturity of the security market over the past year as more enterprises recognize the need for an innovative, but sustainable, security approach,” said Christy Wyatt, CEO and President of Dtex. “Steve has a successful track record of building and scaling high-growth SaaS companies, and brings with him a laser focus on flawless execution and exceeding customer expectations. His expertise, along with his ability to lead and empower teams, is exactly what we need during this period of rapid growth.”\nIn the second quarter of its fiscal year, Dtex has seen record growth, including 140 percent growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and over 1000 percent growth in bookings year over year. The company has also reported a 140 percent increase in revenue and 60 percent growth in number of customers over the same period.\n“There are few industries that are experiencing the explosive growth we’re seeing in enterprise security, and Dtex is right at the forefront,” said Holton. “This position combines my passion for building high-performance cultures with my experience in driving the repeatable, sustainable revenue growth that creates category leaders - and I’m incredibly excited to be here.”\nFor more information on Dtex and the company’s Advanced User Behavior Intelligence Platform, visit www.dtexsystems.com .\nLike Dtex on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Dtex-Systems-297181017056254\nFollow Dtex on Twitter: https://twitter.com/DtexSystems\nConnect with Dtex on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/dtex-systems\nAbout Dtex Systems\nDtex Systems arms enterprises across the globe with revolutionary technology to protect against user threats, data breaches, and outsider infiltration.
