And therefore, it really impacts the fact that I think our lineup for the year is among the strongest we’ve ever seen,” Goldner said.

Still, Hasbro ended the year with higher sales than rival Mattel ( MAT.O ), the first time since 1993. \nNet revenue from the company’s partner brands unit, which includes toys based on movie franchises, fell 21 percent to $342.9 million. \nNet loss attributable to the company of $5.3 million, or 4 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, due to a $296.5 million charge related to the U.S. tax overhaul.
