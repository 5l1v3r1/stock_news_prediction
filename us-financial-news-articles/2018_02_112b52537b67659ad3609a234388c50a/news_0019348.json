The ONS said Friday’s industrial and construction data did not alter this estimate. \nThe buoyant world economy has been a boon for British exporters, who are in the midst of a sweet spot before Britain’s exit from the European Union, BoE Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday. \nDeputy Governor Ben Broadbent said on Friday that he would not be shocked if British interest rates needed to go up twice this year. \nHowever, ONS data showed Britain’s goods trade deficit with the rest of the world widened to 13.6 billion pounds in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a smaller shortfall of 11.6 billion pounds. \nThe ONS linked the large deficit to rising crude oil prices and higher imports. \nSeparately, the ONS said construction output jumped 1.6 percent on the month. The Reuters poll suggested construction output would be flat.
