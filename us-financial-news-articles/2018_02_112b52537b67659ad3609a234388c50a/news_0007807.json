On the day, the greenback scored its best daily performance since Oct. 26.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar reached its highest since Jan. 23, and was last up 0.79 percent at 110.25.\nThe yen has correlated inversely with U.S. Treasuries. The 10-year yield hit a four-year high on the day and last edged to 2.8506 percent, while the 30-year rose to 3.0961 percent.\nAfter the jobs data, the euro fell against the dollar. While it pared losses during the day, it did not make up its decline and last fell 0.46 percent to $1.2451.\nInvestors, however, were optimistic about the single currency’s overall performance.\n“The euro has a lot more room to the upside,” said Richard Scalone, co-head of FX at TJM Brokerage in Boca Raton, Florida.\nThe euro zone’s economic revival and expectations of monetary tightening have made the euro more attractive for investors, while strong global growth around the world has encouraged investors to move cash out of the U.S. dollar.\nA survey showed on Thursday that euro zone manufacturing continued to boom last month, bolstering a view that the European Central Bank is on track to normalize monetary policy.\nSterling was at $1.4128, down 0.95 percent on the day.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T08:50:58.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
