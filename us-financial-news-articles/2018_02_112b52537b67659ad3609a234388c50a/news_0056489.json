REUTERS/Bobby Yip/Files London-headquartered StanChart is looking to drive returns by boosting lending to key industrial sectors and top clients, sources told Reuters earlier this month.\nCEO Winters said on Tuesday StanChart needed to establish income growth momentum across all its businesses, which will help it generate income at a new target compound annual growth rate of 5-7 percent in the medium term.\nThe results showed that some of its business lines are still struggling to deliver.\nUnderlying income in the corporate and institutional banking division fell 3 percent year-on-year, as its financial markets unit suffered from the low global market volatility in 2017 that dampened trading activity and dragged income down by $490 million.\nStanChart’s private banking division reported a small $1 million loss for the year, as costs rose from investments. It, however, did see $2.2 billion of new money flow into the private bank, compared to the previous year when it saw $2 billion flow out.\nThe bank’s core capital ratio, another closely watched measure of lenders’ financial strength, remained unchanged at 13.6 percent last year compared to 2016, but above the lender’s targeted range of 12 percent to 13 percent.\n“We’re encouraged by the progress that we’re making,” Winters told journalists.\n“It’s a little bit of a bumpy road but we never expected anything else.”\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee, Emma Rumney and Lawrence White; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman and Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T07:56:39.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
