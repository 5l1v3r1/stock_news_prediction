He will also meet informally on Feb. 12 with small groups of lawyers from both sides to discuss how the trial will proceed. \nThe two sides are expected to exchange witness lists, with a maximum of 30 witnesses, and expert reports on Friday. \nBoth sides said they intended to call former Justice Department economists to support their case. AT&T will call Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, while the Justice Department will call Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley. \nU.S. President Donald Trump attacked the deal while on the campaign trail in 2016. Trump has also criticized Time Warner’s CNN news network and, in November, reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction. \nAT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told analysts on a conference call this week that he expected the case to be resolved through litigation. “We remain very confident that we’ll complete this merger,” he said.
