REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday told lawmakers the agency completed its background check on Porter in July, contradicting the White House’s earlier assertion that investigations into Porter had not yet been completed.\nPorter, who had worked at the White House with a temporary security clearance, resigned after news media reports said he had physically abused two ex-wives. Porter has denied the accusations.\n“The chronology is not favorable for the White House,” Gowdy said of reports the FBI repeatedly told Republican President Donald Trump’s administration about the allegations and warned that Porter should not be given access to sensitive information.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the committee had requested information about how Porter’s employment and clearance were handled.\nReporting by Lisa Lambert and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:54:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
