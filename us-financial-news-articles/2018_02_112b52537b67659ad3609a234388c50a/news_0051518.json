If people like it, that’s great,” he said with a laugh. “Call it enlightenment if you want - I am what I am. That’s the frame of mind I‘m in.”\nReporting by Elaine Lies, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:35:06.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
