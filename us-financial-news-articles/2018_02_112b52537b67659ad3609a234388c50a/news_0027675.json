This year, we will act again,” Royce said in a statement.\nTrump also proposed billions of dollars in cuts last year, prompting strong objections from congressional Democrats and many Republicans, who argued that so-called soft power spending on foreign relations and development was an important component of national security.\nCongress largely rejected the proposed cuts when it passed an omnibus spending bill for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2017. A spending agreement for the next two years hammered out by lawmakers last week includes money to increase, not cut, diplomacy and development funds.\nThe White House argues that the funding cuts are needed to help rein in the budget deficit while beefing up military spending.\nUnder U.S. law, Congress controls the government’s purse strings, and lawmakers rarely enact presidential budgets. While members from both parties generally back high military spending, supporters of foreign aid spending argue that international crises cannot be solved only with force.\nTrump’s spending plan on Monday included $716 billion in military spending, the largest military budget since 2011, and a $74 billion increase over last year.\n“As I’ve said, diplomacy helps keep America strong and our troops out of combat,” Royce said. “Our country faces urgent threats from North Korea, Iran and terrorists around the world.”\nSenator Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees spending, called Trump’s proposed cuts in foreign aid and the State Department “simplistic” and “arbitrary.”\n“In the name of ‘efficiency’ this budget slashes funding for the very operations and programs that support U.S. global leadership and influence on which the security of the American people depends,” Leahy said in a statement.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T07:37:59.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
