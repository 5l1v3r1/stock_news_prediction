( reut.rs/2C036PZ )\nHilton said it also expects higher occupancy rate in China as demand from individual travelers as well as corporate groups continues to improve in 2018.\nBaird analyst Michael Bellisario said China is getting to that “golden age of travel,” where its growing middle class is boosting increased demand for inbound and outbound travel.\nSunTrust analyst Patrick Scholes said Beijing’s “Belt and Road” initiative, a project aiming to build a modern-day ‘Silk Road’ was helping hotel demand.\nScholes said, like Hilton, larger rival Marriot, which reports fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday, could also benefit from its higher exposure to international markets.\nHilton said it also benefited from rise in both group and individual bookings in the country, with holiday shifts and hurricane displacement boosting its overall RevPAR.\nHilton said its overall revenue per available room rose 3.8 percent in the quarter as more people booked rooms at higher prices, helping the hotel operator reaffirm its 2018 RevPAR growth forecast to be between 1 percent and 3 percent.\nThe company said overall occupancy rose 1.8 percent in the reporting quarter, while the average daily room rate rose 1.2 percent.\nThat helped total revenue surge 24 percent to $2.28 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $2.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nExcluding one-time items, Hilton earned 54 cents in the quarter, beating analysts estimates of 45 cents.\nThe company forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.49 and $2.60 for 2018, while analysts were expecting $2.56 per share.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas and Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:02:49.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
