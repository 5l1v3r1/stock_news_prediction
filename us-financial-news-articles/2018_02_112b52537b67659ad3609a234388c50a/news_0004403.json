The fund would also be the third global growth fund for the company. The previous two were $700 million in 2012, and $2 billion in 2015. The third fund would likely be higher than this.\nA Sequoia spokesperson declined to comment.\nSequoia is a well-respected venture firm that has been around since the 1970s. It had previously invested in companies including Google and Apple , and more recently in Airbnb and Stripe.\nThe news comes as private tech companies are staying private for longer and valuations are rising. Instead of choosing the public markets, firms like Uber are opting to take later stage funding.\nMeanwhile SoftBank, which recently took a stake in Uber , has come to the market with a $100 billion fund, and getting into many later-stage businesses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T13:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T14:21:51.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
