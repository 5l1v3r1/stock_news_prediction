We are a democratic country, so there is no pressure. They are always supporting us and that’s why we are here.” (Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:33:02.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
