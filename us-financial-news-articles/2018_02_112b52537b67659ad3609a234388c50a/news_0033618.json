While strike threats in December were averted by a pledge to recognise labour unions for the first time, the airline has so far managed to reach a recognition agreement with only one of the seven unions with which it is in talks.\nO‘Leary said Spain’s SEPLA pilots’ union had not yet responded to offers of a pay rise and terms for union recognition and Ryanair was considering bypassing the union and offering the increase directly to pilots - something it has done in Ireland.\nSEPLA said in a statement it had told Ryanair it would not negotiate with it until it allowed it to represent both pilots employed directly and those employed indirectly as contractors.\nIt also said it would recommend pilots reject a proposed salary increase as long as it was dependent on recognising Ryanair’s system of employee councils at airports, which it said are appointed unilaterally by management.\nThe union said it had offered to poll pilots on the proposed pay increase, but that Ryanair had refused to give it a list of serving pilots. Ryanair did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
