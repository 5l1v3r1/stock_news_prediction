Some did say that the latest structure would seem to meet the main government demands, especially regarding the protection of Brazilian defense programs. \nRepresentatives at Brazil’s Defense Ministry, which set up a committee to make recommendations to the government on a partnership, declined to comment immediately. The Boeing Company logo is projected on a wall at the \"What's Next?\" conference in Chicago, Illinois, U.S., October 4, 2016. REUTERS/Jim Young \nBrazil’s Air Force repeated on Friday that they “consider Embraer to be fundamental for the country’s security and any decision has to take into account national sovereignty.” \nEmbraer shares, which surged as much as 9 percent after a report by Globo media suggested that Embraer had accepted a proposal from Boeing, pared gains to around 4.5 percent in afternoon trading. Boeing shares were down about 1.5 percent. \nBoeing’s proposed tie-up with Embraer, the world’s third-largest planemaker, would give it a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada’s Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) and backed by European rival Airbus SE ( AIR.PA ) last year. \nAn unexpected U.S. trade ruling last month scrapping tariffs on CSeries jets added to pressure on Boeing and Embraer to pull off a tie-up of their own. \nBrazil’s government has openly pushed for a partnership between the two companies focused more narrowly on commercial aviation, rather than an outright acquisition, due to concerns about the independence of Brazilian defense programs. \nThe government, which holds about 10 percent of Embraer shares through public-sector funds, still has veto power over its military programs and any takeover attempts due to a golden share in the former state enterprise. \nBoeing has sought ways to preserve the government’s golden share in Embraer and previously proposed safeguards for defense programs in Brazil along the lines of its subsidiaries in Britain and Australia, sources have told Reuters.
