(NASDAQ: DMPI) (\"DelMar\" or the \"Company\"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of new cancer therapies, announced its financial results for the second quarter ended December 31, 2017. DelMar executive management will host a business update conference call for investors, analysts and other interested parties on Tuesday, February 20, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\n\"This quarter has been an exciting period for DelMar. Our priority is to leverage VAL-083's unique mechanism of action to efficiently advance it into the most promising indications, including MGMT-unmethylated glioblastoma and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. We now have a revised VAL-083 development strategy that is focused on MGMT methylation status in glioblastoma, which has become routine in clinical practice as a biomarker which correlates with resistance to the standard-of-care chemotherapy with temozolomide (Temodar® \"TMZ\"), and patient outcomes. We believe using this biomarker will allow us to optimize patient selection for treatment with our lead drug candidate, VAL-083, thereby streamlining development and enhancing opportunities for success in our clinical development programs,\" commented Saiid Zarrabian, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.\nKEY DEVELOPMENTS AND UPDATED STRATEGIC PLAN\nEvaluation of MGMT promoter methylation status has increasingly become common practice in the diagnostic assessment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). DelMar believes that this provides it with an enhanced ability to leverage MGMT methylation as a biomarker to optimize patient selection for DelMar's novel DNA-targeting agent in the treatment of GBM. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), provided updated guidelines for the standard treatment of GBM based on MGMT methylation status. DelMar believes these recently published guidelines may allow the Company to capitalize on VAL-083's unique mechanism of action and activity in the estimated 60 percent of GBM patients whose tumors are MGMT-unmethylated. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed a second Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to enable DelMar to study its lead drug candidate, VAL-083, as a potential treatment for ovarian cancer. In November 2017, at the annual meeting of the Society for NeuroOncology (SNO), DelMar presented a positive interim update from its ongoing open label Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with MGMT-unmethylated recurrent GBM (rGBM) whose tumors have recurred following treatment with temozolomide (Avastin naïve). This study, which was initiated in February 2017, is being conducted at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. In December 2017, the FDA fully approved Avastin (bevacizumab) which may impact our ability to recruit suitable patients for our STAR-3 Phase 3 clinical trial. In December 2017, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for VAL-083, in recurrent glioblastoma. Based on the above developments, and other factors as stated in DelMar's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (10-Q) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 14, 2018, DelMar has decided to put the STAR-3 program on hold for up to 12 months and will suspend further site or patient enrollment. This will allow DelMar to fully evaluate the possible impact of Avastin's recent approval by the FDA on patient enrollment for this study, and possible protocol amendments, non-dilutive financing sources, as well as to increase focus on the MGMT-unmethylated clinical studies currently underway as further described in the SEC filings. During this interim evaluation period, DelMar will continue to provide treatment to patients already enrolled in the STAR-3 trial, and consider, on a case-by-case basis, and subject to required institutional and regulatory approvals, providing VAL-083 to patients in accordance with our expanded access policy Based on this updated strategy, DelMar believes it has cash available into the second quarter of calendar 2019.\nFor further details on the Company's operating and financial results, as well as more detail about its updated strategy, refer to DelMar's 10-Q filed with the SEC on February 14, 2018, http://ir.delmarpharma.com/all-sec-filings .\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nDelMar plans to host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and provide a corporate update on Tuesday, February 20, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

By focusing on understanding tumor biology and mechanisms of treatment resistance, the Company identifies biomarkers to personalize new therapies in indications where patients are failing, or have become intolerable to, modern targeted or biologic treatments.\nThe Company's current pipeline is based around VAL-083, a \"first-in-class,\" small-molecule chemotherapeutic with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated clinical activity against a range of cancers including central nervous system, ovarian and other solid tumors (e.g. NSCLC, bladder cancer, head & neck) in U.S. clinical trials sponsored by the NCI. Based on DelMar's internal research programs and these prior NCI-sponsored clinical studies, the Company is conducting clinical trials to support the development and commercialization of VAL-083 across multiple oncology indications to solve significant unmet medical needs.\nVAL-083 is also being studied in two collaborator-supported, biomarker driven, Phase 2 clinical trials for MGMT-unmethylated GBM. Overcoming MGMT-mediated resistance represents a significant unmet medical need in the treatment of GBM. DelMar also recently announced the allowance of a separate IND for VAL-083 as a potential treatment for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.\nFurther information on DelMar's clinical trials can be found on clinicaltrials.gov : https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=&term=val-083&cntry1=&state1=&recrs\nFor further information, please visit http://delmarpharma.com/ ; or contact DelMar Pharmaceuticals Investor Relations: ir@delmarpharma.com / (604) 629-5989.\nConnect with the Company on Twitter , LinkedIn , Facebook , and Google+ .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nAny statements contained in this press release that do not describe historical facts may constitute forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
