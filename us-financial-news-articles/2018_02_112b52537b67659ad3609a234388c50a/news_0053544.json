Sanctions were imposed on them in June related to Russia’s incursion into Ukraine.\nThe officials said a review is well under way at what more can be done in response to the meddling. They said they are also looking ahead to the potential for tampering in the 2018 midterm congressional elections next November.\n“The process on sanctions is long; it’s arduous; it’s not pretty, but when the evidence is there and we’re ready, we go ahead with the sanctions,” one official said.\nThe officials said there is an active review under way on how to respond to last week’s designation of Russia as responsible for the devastating “NotPetya” cyber attack last year.\nThe White House last week said the “NotPetya”attack, launched in June 2017 by the Russian military, “spread worldwide, causing billions of dollars in damage across Europe, Asia and the Americas.\n“There is always a review of targets,” one official said.\nAnother official, who spoke to Reuters separately from the briefing, said it is a “certainty” that the United States will act in response to the NotPetya attack.\nReporting By Steve Holland and Lesley Wroughton; Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T03:52:34.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
