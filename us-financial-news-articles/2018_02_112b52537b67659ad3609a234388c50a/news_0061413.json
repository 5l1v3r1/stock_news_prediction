Markets also continued to be spooked following a relatively hawkish speech by the newly appointed head of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell that raised speculation about increased monetary tightening in the United States in 2018. In a note to clients, Mexican brokerage Monex said global markets were continuing to show mixed movements, but with a downward bias, after Powell's speech. The benchmark IPC index was trading of 0.64 percent in the afternoon. Elsewhere, equities in every major Latin American market were trading in the red. Brazil's Bovespa was among the biggest losers, falling 0.82 percent, in part due to some major isolated price movements following results and other corporate events. Shares in major Brazilian miner Vale SA fell 2.4 percent in afternoon trade following fourth quarter results that missed analysts estimates. Shares in major planemaker Embraer SA posted the biggest loss, falling as much as 4.9 percent after a report in Brazilian newspaper O Globo said that newly appointed defense minister Joaquim Silva e Luna has been one of the most avid opponents of a proposed joint venture between Embraer and U.S. planemaker Boeing SA. However, Embraer pared losses to 3.9 percent after a comment from the company's chief executive saying he expected the talks to be concluded in the first half of 2018.
