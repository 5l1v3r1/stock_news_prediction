No time-frame or capacity were given for the Cabinda project.\nThe state firm said it had received proposals from international and domestic companies and that submissions were open until Feb. 10.\nThe two refinery projects come on top of an agreement signed towards the end of last year with Italy’s Eni to optimise the refinery in Luanda over 24 months and get it running beyond its nominal capacity of 65,000 bpd.\n“These developments aim to make Angola self-sufficient in refined products, stopping the outflow of hard currency to import these products,” Sonangol said.\nReporting by Stephen Eisenhammer; Editing by Joe Brock and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T13:13:48.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
