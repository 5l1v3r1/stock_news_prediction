The tax would be a temporary measure until a more comprehensive solution to fair digital taxation is approved, the Commission said.\n$1 = 0.8129 euros Reporting by Francesco Guarascio\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:28:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
