The three links each have a price tag of up to 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion).\nPlugging in NorthConnect at the same time could make it challenging for the Nordic grid to handle the flows and could lead to a capping of capacity in order to keep the system reliable, said Statnett.\nThe biggest risk of adding NorthConnect to the Nordic grid is in balancing electricity supply and demand in the region, it added, as Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland are negotiating a new deal to handle their system’s imbalances.\nNorthConnect has its critics in Norway, with the country’s opposition and several unions campaigning against it in the last years, fearing it would raise domestic power prices.\n“With increased leased lines... the Nordic region is more exposed to power prices in Europe. Statnett believes that this exposure will increase the variation in Nordic power prices, thus increasing prices for reserves,” the grid operator wrote.\nNorway’s average spot power price for Oslo, the capital, was at 29.04 euros per megawatt hour in 2017, one of the lowest in Europe.\nNorthConnect project chairman Odd Oeygarden said the cable’s partners disagreed with Statnett’s report and would discuss the case with Norway’s state regulator prior to an expected decision on issuing a license.\n“We haven’t changed our plans,” Oeygarden told Reuters, while adding he couldn’t rule out the possibility that the project could face delays.
