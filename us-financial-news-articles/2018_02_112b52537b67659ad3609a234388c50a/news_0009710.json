It also increased its annual dividend outlook to 29 yen per share from 25 yen.\n“Stronger contributions from Chile’s copper mines and Australian coal assets, as well as higher income from transportation, paper and pulp and livestock-raising were behind the upward revision,” Marubeni Chief Financial Officer Nobuhiro Yabe told a news conference.\nA U.S. corporate tax cut also led to a 6 billion yen gain, he added.\nStill, Marubeni plans to remain cautious in making fresh investment in energy and metal assets, Yabe said, adding that the company would prioritise an improvement in its financial health.
