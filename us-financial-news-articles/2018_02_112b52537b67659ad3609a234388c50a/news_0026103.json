(Photo: RESTAURANT BRANDS INTERNATIONAL) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Shares of Restaurant Brands International rocketed Monday after the company posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on the back of new menu items and affordable burgers. Shares were recently trading up more than 6%. The company, which owns Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeye's, said net income in the fourth quarter rose to $395 million, or $1.59 a share, up from $118.4 million, or 50 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding items, the company earned 66 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 57 cents, according to Thomson Reuters consensus. Total revenue climbed 11% to $1.23 billion, just shy of expectations of $1.25 billion. Same-store sales at its burger restaurants jumped 4.6% in the quarter, nearly double the 2.5% that analysts had predicted. The company said that a balance of value promotions and new menu items helped boost same-store sales at Burger King during the quarter. Same-store sales growth at Tim Horton's and Popeye's were more tepid, rising 0.1% the coffee chain and falling 1.3% at the chicken chain. The company blamed softer sales in the U.S. and increased competition in the quick-service space for weak sales at Tim Horton's during the quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:28:50.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
