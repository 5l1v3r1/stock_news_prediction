May is hoping to clinch a deal next month for a transition period that would smooth Britain’s exit from the European Union in 2019. She and several of her ministers are hoping to spell out Britain’s case for a good Brexit deal in a series of speeches in the coming weeks, starting with one by foreign minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday. The European Commission’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last week a post-Brexit transition deal was “not a given” and London had objections to the EU’s offer. A German official said on Tuesday the country’s new government would not change its Brexit stance after Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats reached a coalition deal last week.
