It plans to draft new PPEs for 2019-2023 and 2024-2028.\nThe most controversial issue is how many of French state-controlled utility EDF’s 58 nuclear reactors will have to close to reach the 50 percent target and by when.\nAfter initial consultations with energy companies, NGOs and sector specialists last month, a public debate is planned between mid-March and June. A first draft of the new PPE is due this summer.\nBut Jacques Archimbaud, head of the commission tasked with organising the debate, told reporters on Tuesday he was still waiting for a document from the environment ministry’s energy and climate directorate (DGEC) that outlines options.\n“We would like this document to lay out what the choices are,” Archimbaud said.\nHe also called on the the government to make clear why it had discarded two scenarios that would lead to the highest number of nuclear plant closures.\nAhead of the debate, French grid operator RTE has prepared four scenarios with different mixes of nuclear and renewables, but the French government has dismissed the two scenarios that reduce the share of nuclear the most, saying these could lead to an increase in carbon emissions.\nEDF has already said it wants to close no nuclear plants before 2029 except the one in Fessenheim.\nReporting by Benjamin MalletWriting by Geert De ClercqEditing by Richard Lough\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:09:24.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
