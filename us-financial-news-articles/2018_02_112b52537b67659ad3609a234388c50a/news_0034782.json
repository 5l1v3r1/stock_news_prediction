Skating to “Hallelujah” by Leonard Cohen, Sui and Han snapped out a clean series of triples that earned them 82.39 points and put them at the top of a tightly-packed leaderboard. ”I think today we did quite well,“ Sui said. ”We enjoyed ourselves. I think tomorrow we can show our best. Slideshow (5 Images) “When we prepare, before I make up, I cried because I felt both excited and nervous. When we finished, we knew we did well, and I just wanted to cry.” Tarasova pumped her fist after she and Morozov finished their fiery routine to Sergei Rachmaninov’s “Piano Concerto No. 2” that earned them 81.68. Canada’s Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford amassed 76.82 points for third place, their routine slightly marred when Duhamel put her foot down on the thrown triple Lutz. The competition continues on Thursday with the free skate, after which medals will be awarded.
