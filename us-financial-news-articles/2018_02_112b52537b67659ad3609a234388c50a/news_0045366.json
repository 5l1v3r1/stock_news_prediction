The FTSE .FTSE closed 0.48 percent higher at 7281.57 points after spending part of the day in the red in a session that was in sharp contrast to the previous one. “The London market did a U-turn from yesterday which was held back by BHP Billiton and HSBC. Whereas today impressive results from a bank and miner drove the index higher”, CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. Mining giant Glencore ( GLEN.L ) jumped 5.2 percent after full year results that its CEO Ivan Glasenberg hailed as the strongest on record thanks to a rally in commodity markets and cost cuts. Paul Gait of Bernstein, which rates Glencore outperform, said the results were solid, and the reduction of net debt to $10.6 billion, representing a deleveraging of $5 billion over the year, was remarkable. Referring to Glencore’s ability to capitalise on an upturn in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, he said: “We see Glencore as almost uniquely positioned in this regard.” The UK mining index .FTNMX1700 rose 2.1 percent, with Anglo American ( AAL.L ) up 3.2 percent. Financials added the most points to the index as they benefited from the earnings update from Lloyds ( LLOY.L ), which reported   and   pounds.   said Laith   Lansdown. The reaction to Lloyds results was a contrast to Tuesday’s 3 percent decline in peer HSBC ( HSBA.L ), which offered less clarity on share buybacks and said it needed more capital. Britain's mid-cap index .FTMC was hit by a number of large individual falls, retreating 0.1 percent. AA ( AAAA.L ) plummeted more than 28 percent to an all-time low after the roadside recovery group and insurer forecast lower core profit and said it planned to pay lower dividends. Firstgroup ( FGP.L ) dropped more than 12 percent after the transport company downgraded its forecast for annual core earnings, saying its U.S. coach and bus services were affected by severe snowstorms in January.
