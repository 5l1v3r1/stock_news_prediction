It was up 0.29 percent at 109.49 yen, compared with 109.74 yen at around 6:30 a.m. EST.\nThe dollar hit a four-month low of 108.27 against the yen on Friday.\nDavid Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Connecticut, said a broad selloff in world stocks on Thursday had made investors cautious. U.S. stocks opened lower after a string of lacklustre earnings and the Fed’s comments on Wednesday.\n“Markets are on pins and needles about stocks, given the correction this week,” he said. “Very often we see the yen strengthen when stock prices go down.”\nTraders are looking ahead to the U.S. government’s jobs report on Friday.\nThe dollar has struggled this year as expected monetary policy-tightening in other parts of the world, along with stronger global economic growth, encouraged investors to put more of their money elsewhere, particularly the euro zone. The dollar index touched a three-year low of 88.438 on Friday.\nMeanwhile, the euro rose against the dollar by 0.14 percent to $1.2437, supported by a survey on Thursday that showed euro zone manufacturing was booming.\nThe single currency reached a three-year high above $1.25 in January and ended the month up 3.54 percent amid expectations that the European Central Bank would begin normalizing monetary policy this year.\nThat prospect got a boost earlier on Wednesday after last month’s underlying euro zone inflation picked up pace.\nSterling rose 0.07 percent to $1.42.\nThe Australian dollar fell 0.62 percent to $0.8004, after its recent run-up came to an end.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:16:06.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
