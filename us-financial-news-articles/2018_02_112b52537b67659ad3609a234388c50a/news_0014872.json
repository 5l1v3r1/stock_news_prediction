Then Stephen Johns doubled the lead just 39 seconds later by stealing the puck from Nino Niederreiter on his own side of the red line and, after racing down the ice, ripping home a short-side slapper.\nBenn added another man-advantage tally a couple of minutes later with a johnny-on-the spot tap-in on a loose puck during a scramble, and Seguin completed a pretty three-way passing play after Radulov led an odd-man rush and included Benn to make it a 4-0 affair. The four goals came within a six-minute span.\nRadulov and Dan Hamhuis rounded out the scoring for the Stars, who are on an 8-3-1 run and keeping the third spot in the Central Division within reach. Goalie Kari Lehtonen stopped 29 shots in the Dallas net.\nJason Zucker scored for the Wild, who lost in regulation time for just the second time in 10 outings.\nStalock was pulled after two periods, the victim of four goals on 29 shots, and replaced by Devan Dubnyk, who stopped seven of nine pucks fired his way.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-04T12:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T17:42:17.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
