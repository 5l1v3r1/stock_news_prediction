A potted orchid runs $24.99 on the site while a 4-inch Aloe Vera plant comes in at just a little over $10. Most of the plants appear to be Prime eligible as well, so you can get free two-day delivery of them if you’re a member. \nIf you don’t exactly have a green thumb, the store also offers a bit of information on each type of plant to help customers buy the type of plant they want and are able keep it alive, at least for a little while.
