We see the worldwide market for turboprops to be in excess of 3,000 airplanes, so the math is simple — it's over 1,000 airplanes over the next 20 years,\" Scherer said. \nThe chief executive also brushed off those who claimed that turboprop engines were past their expiration date in the era of jet engines. \n\"Let me correct that misconception, the turboprop engine first of all, is driven by turbo machinery just like jet engines,\" Scherer explained. \"And the fact that it's driving a propeller, allows it to offer fuel efficiency that is 50 percent greater than that of a conventional jet engine. So you can imagine that fuel efficiency represents a major economic bonus for the turboprop aircraft.\" Andrew Wong Special to CNBC Related Securities", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T08:30:11.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
