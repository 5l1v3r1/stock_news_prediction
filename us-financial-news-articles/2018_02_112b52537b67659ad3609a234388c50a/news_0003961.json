According to its latest disclosures, 57 percent of its workers are women, including 37 percent of its top executives.\nSince mid-January Citigroup ( C.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) each have said that women and minorities earned 99 percent of what their male and white peers earned in the United States and in other countries.\nAll three banks and others have been under pressure to give the figures from activist investor Arjuna Capital. Arjuna Managing Partner Natasha Lamb said she plans to withdraw a shareholder resolution at Wells Fargo for this spring’s annual meeting. But she hopes the bank and others will disclose more details such pay ratios within job levels and the median pay of women and men across the entire company.\nAsked about the further details, Branca said the bank will “continue to look at that and see how that contributes to the conversation.”\nReporting by Ross Kerber; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:13:24.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
