The assets marked for divestitures represented about $488 million in revenue for the year ended June 30.\nMeredith had bought Time, the publisher of People, Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines, for $1.84 billion in November, in an all-cash deal backed by conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.\nThe sale of Time UK is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Meredith said. Barou Advisers and Herbert Smith Freehills LLP advised Meredith on the deal.\nTime Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) spun off Time, which also publishes the eponymous current affairs magazine, as a standalone company in June 2014.\nSince then, New York-based Time had struggled in an industry-wide decline in print media, as circulation shrinks and advertisers shift to digital platforms.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T14:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T14:46:36.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
