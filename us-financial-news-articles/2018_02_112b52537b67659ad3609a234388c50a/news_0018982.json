REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nThe British government, which is overseeing the talks alongside the Irish government, has already had to take steps towards ruling the region directly from London for the first time in a decade, setting its budget late last year. \nMany in the province fear direct rule would further destabilise the delicate political balance between the two sides who up until last year had run the province since 2007 under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday peace accord.
