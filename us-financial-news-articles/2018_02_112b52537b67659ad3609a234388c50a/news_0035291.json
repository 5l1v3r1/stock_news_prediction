By offering a network of 50,000 independent experts and solutions for managing other pools of talent, Catalant is allowing companies to create a talent ecosystem based on skills rather than geography. This work along with the book, Reimagining Work: Strategies to Disrupt Talent, Lead Change, and Win with a Flexible Workforce , he recently co-authored secured a spot for him on this list.\n\"My inclusion on the list is a testament to the team we've built at Catalant and their efforts to help companies reimagine work,\" said Rob Biederman. \"We're hearing from executives in the Fortune 500 that they are looking to manage talent differently. Increasingly, they realize that the nature of work is changing dramatically. So we partner with their companies to design solutions that engage the right people inside or outside their company, at the right time, without the constraints of job descriptions, office walls or geographic boundaries.\"\nThe list is not a ranking but a way to recognize those championing the Workforce Solutions Ecosystem and driving its growth. Biederman is joined on the list by, CEOs, entrepreneurs, technologists, workforce specialists, legal advisors, data scientists and more, from a range of different kinds of companies and nichesâ€“from traditional staffing to human cloud platforms to MSP/VMS to RPO.\n\"The 2018 Staffing 100 honorees touch all sectors of the workforce solutions ecosystem, elevating it through their commitment, innovation and expertise,\" said Subadhra Sriram, Publisher and Editor, Media Products, SIA. \"I am once again excited to acknowledge an important group whose work is leading our industry into the future.\"\nThe Staffing 100 website for the North American, Latin American and Hall of Fame 2018 lists debuts this today.
