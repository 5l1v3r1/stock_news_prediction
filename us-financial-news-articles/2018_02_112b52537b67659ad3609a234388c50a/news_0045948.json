The U.S. came out flying to start the third and immediately halved the deficit, Kendall Coyne splitting the Canadian defense and snapping the puck between Genevieve Lacasse’s pads just 23 seconds into the period. The Americans, however, could not complete the comeback with the game ending in a wild pile-up around the Canadian net.
