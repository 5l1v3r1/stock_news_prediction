Chinese Gao Tingyu took the bronze medal.\n“I was tying my skates when Cha did his race and the atmosphere was amazing. Then he sets the Olympic record,” Lorentzen told reporters.\n“I wasn’t sure I could beat that but I knew I could at least do a medal. And when I did the last 50 meters I said to myself this has to be a medal.... And then to cross the finish line and the entire stadium just goes to silence - it’s quite cool.”\nRelated Coverage Speed skating: Norway's coach hopes Olympic gold ends funding woes Lorentzen was the first Norwegian to win the Olympic 500m title since Finn Helgesen 70 years ago and he became his country’s first medalist in the event since Magne Thomassen won silver in 1968.\nNorway, once a powerhouse in the sport alongside the Netherlands, has struggled in recent decades and until Monday had not won a gold medal in speed skating at the Olympics since Adne Sondral’s victory in the 1,500m in Nagano in 1998.\nWILD CROWD Racing in the 14th pair, Cha stormed out of the gates to send the crowd wild and the Korean brought the house down when he crossed in record time with eight racers to come.\nSpeed Skating - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's 500m Competition Finals - Gangneung Oval - Gangneung, South Korea - February 19, 2018.

It was time for Norway to step up on the top of the podium again. It feels so good to do that.”\nThe Dutch, who swept the podium in Sochi, finished outside the medal places for the second race in succession after their failure to medal in the women’s 500m on Sunday.\nMulder, whose twin brother Michel won gold at the last Olympics but failed to qualify for the Pyeongchang Games, was the highest-placed of the three Dutch skaters in seventh.\nAt the Sochi Games, the Netherlands dominated the speed skating events, winning 23 of 36 medals, including eight golds. The have won six speed skating golds in Korea so far, and 11 of the 27 medals on offer.\n“It’s not good when one nation dominates (speed skating) too much. Today and yesterday there were no Dutch on the podium,” Lorentzen said. “It’s good for the sport.”\nReporting by Simon Jennings, editing ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T15:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T15:30:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
