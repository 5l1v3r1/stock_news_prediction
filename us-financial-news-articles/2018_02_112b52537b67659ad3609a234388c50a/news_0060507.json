The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) added that it did not know where Modi was. The agency earlier said he left India in January before the $2 billion fraud, which also involves a firm controlled by his uncle, came to light. Modi, to whom CBI sent an email on Wednesday, has denied any wrongdoing.
