The firm says it is a novel device, different from other e-cigarettes that are often already subject to regulations.\nKazlauskas said Philip Morris had been notified of its possible violation of Lithuanian advertising law, and that the regulator was expected to issue its final ruling in a month.\nPhilip Morris representatives were not immediately available for comment.\nThe iQOS has been promoted extensively in Lithuania, and has stores on the main streets of its largest towns.\nThe tobacco product used in the iQOS heating device, also sold by Philip Morris but branded as Heets, is already a subject to advertising restrictions similar to regular cigarettes.\nEarlier this month, ten U.S. senators called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reject Philip Morris’s application to market the iQOS as less risky than cigarettes.\nThey cited a Reuters report in December that detailed shortcomings in the training and professionalism of some of the lead investigators in the clinical trials submitted to the FDA by Philip Morris, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes.\n$1 = 0.8123 euros Reporting by Andrius Sytas; Editing by Johan Ahlander and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-21T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:07:12.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
