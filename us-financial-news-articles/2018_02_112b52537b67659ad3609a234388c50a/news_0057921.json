Stocks edged lower, the dollar rose and U.S. bond yields rose. Futures contracts linked to the central bank’s rate policies showed a roughly 35% probability it would move at least four times by year’s end, according to data from CME Group . \nMr. Powell said recent signs of firming wage growth and inflation have made him more confident the economy is on the right path and that “further gradual increases in the federal-funds rate will best promote attainment” of the Fed’s objectives.\nMr. Powell indicated in his prepared remarks he wasn’t overly concerned by recent market volatility, saying it wouldn’t disrupt the economy’s growth trajectory.\nRelated \nRecap: Analysis of Powell’s Hearing Powell Backs Senate Plan to Raise Threshold for ‘Systemically Important’ Banks Heard on the Street: Powell’s First Problem Is Taming the Job Market Fed Report Signals No Worries About Recent Market Volatility (Feb. 24) Fed Gives Bullish Signals on Economy (Feb. 21) He also said a strong job market will help consumer spending and businesses will feel more confident about investing, which should boost productivity. Stronger growth overseas, meanwhile, has benefited American exports and “provided considerable support to our manufacturing industry.”\nThe Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the price index for personal-consumption expenditures, should move up to central bank’s 2% target “over the medium term,” Mr. Powell said. “Wages should increase at a faster pace as well.”\nThe task now for officials will be to continue nudging up inflation without letting the economy grow so strongly that asset bubbles appear.\nThe Fed “will continue to strike a balance between avoiding an overheated economy and bringing PCE price inflation to 2% on a sustained basis,” Mr. Powell said.\nFactors that had once held back growth, such as fiscal policy or the global economic outlook, are now supporting it, he said. Recently enacted tax cuts and government spending bills should support economic growth, he said.\n“Some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,” he said. “In particular, fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for U.S. exports is on a firmer trajectory.”\nIn response to a lawmaker’s question, Mr. Powell said lower corporate taxes should lead companies to investment, which should spur productivity growth and send wages higher, although “the effect is not easy to estimate.”\nWage growth has been muted during much of the expansion, but there are indications it could be picking up, Mr. Powell said. Average hourly earnings were up 2.9% in January over the previous year, the largest increase since 2009. The weak pace of productivity growth over the past few years could have held back wages, he said.\nFed officials in December raised their benchmark short-term interest rate to a range between 1.25% and 1.5% and penciled in three quarter-percentage-point rate increases this year. The first of those moves is likely to come at the March 20-21 meeting.\nStock prices gyrated and bond yields rose earlier this month after some investors worried signs of stronger wage gains might presage faster inflation that would force the Fed to raise interest rates more aggressively than anticipated.\nMr. Powell sounded sanguine about the market turmoil.\n“At this point, we do not see these developments as weighing heavily on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation,” he said.\nMr. Powell told lawmakers he saw “at most modest risks” to financial stability.\nFed officials have worried in the past that steadily rising equity prices could inflate a new stock-market bubble. The return of market volatility could ease those concerns somewhat, as could rising yields on government debt.\nMr. Powell also seemed to defend the Fed’s 2% inflation target, which has come under question recently.\n“That framework is working. The market understands it,” he said, in response to a question from House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas).\nIn recent weeks, some Fed officials have suggested reviewing the central bank’s 2% target with an eye to making it easier for officials to react should a recession strike in an era of low interest rates and low inflation.\nMr. Powell, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, is likely to get a warm reception from the Republican-controlled Congress this week, a change from his predecessor, Janet Yellen, who frequently sparred with GOP lawmakers. The Senate confirmed Mr. Powell’s nomination for chairman on Jan. 23 by an 84-13 vote.\nMr. Powell’s testimony comes at a relatively benign economic moment. The U.S. economy grew 2.5% in 2017 , higher than the roughly 2% average that has prevailed since the early 2000s, and the Fed expects it to expand by 2.5% again this year.\nRobust hiring has started to draw discouraged workers back into the labor force and has pushed the unemployment rate, at 4.1% in January, down to its lowest point in 17 years.\nOfficials are increasingly confident inflation will rise this year due to the waning effects of some one-time price drops last spring.\nFed staffers at the central bank’s January meeting forecast that inflation would rise “notably faster in 2018,” according to minutes of the gathering released Feb. 21.\nCentral bankers like to maintain inflation around 2% because it is a sign of healthy demand in the economy. Modest inflation also pushes up borrowing costs, giving central bankers room to cut their benchmark interest rates if they need to support the economy in a downturn.\nThe picture is brightening overseas as well. An upswing in global growth has allowed major central banks in the developed world to consider removing the extraordinary stimulus policies they enacted during the last few years of weak growth.\nA coordinated economic upswing will reduce the risk that Fed rate increases will trigger global market volatility and a sharp appreciation in the dollar, which would hurt U.S. exporters.\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:01:19.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
