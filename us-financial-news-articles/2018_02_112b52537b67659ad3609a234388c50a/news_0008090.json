They are a big team and we will do our best to try and beat them.” \nTottenham, who have posted five victories in their last six games, swatted aside second-placed Manchester United 2-0 at Wembley on Wednesday and come into the clash brimming with confidence. \n“I follow the games of Tottenham and they have a good team. I watched the last game against Manchester United and we know everything about their potential, but at home we are strong. It’ll be two very strong teams,” Firmino added. \n“To us, this game is a classic. In Brazil we call this type of game a six-point game. We will try to be focused during the 90 minutes to try and achieve the win. That’s our aim.” \nLiverpool have 50 points from 25 games with 14 wins, eight draws and three defeats and a victory on Sunday will open up a five point lead over Tottenham. A win for the visitors, however, will take them above Liverpool.
