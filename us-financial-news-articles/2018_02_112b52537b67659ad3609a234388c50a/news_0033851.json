(“IS&S” or the “Company”) ( ISSC ) today announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reported net sales of $3.1 million, down 10% from the first quarter a year ago. The Company reported a net loss of $0.9 million, or ($0.05) per share, for the quarter, an improvement from the net loss of $1.2 million, or ($0.07) per share, recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGeoffrey Hedrick, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IS&S, said, “Results in the first quarter reflect the low beginning backlog at the beginning of the fiscal year. While revenues were down in the first quarter, our focus on more profitable production sales and tight cost control has enabled us to generate gross margins approaching 50%, and, we remain committed to internal research and development, with over $900,000, or 30% of revenue, invested in new product work this quarter. We have further broadened our product portfolio with the recent introduction of our patent-pending Autothrottle. The recent Business & Commercial Aviation February 2018 cover story, has created interest in the Autothrottle’s application into several other aircraft. We anticipate rapidly growing demand with the receipt of an STC for the standalone version of our PC-12 Autothrottle with a market of over 1,400 aircraft, which we believe is imminent. Once the King Air Autothrottle is certified, we expect to have Autothrottle certifications that will open up a market in excess of 10,000 aircraft for which we will be the sole source of the industry’s leading Autothrottle retrofit, which we believe will be an engine of future growth.”\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had $24.7 million of cash on hand, virtually unchanged from fiscal year end September 30, 2017.\nNew orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $3.4 million and backlog as of December 31, 2017 was $3.3 million, up 10% from September 30, 2017. Backlog does not include follow on production orders from products developed under the Company’s engineering development contracts, including the Pilatus PC-24, and the KC-46A, all of which the Company expects to remain in production for a decade. The Company expects that these contracts will add to production sales already in backlog.\nShahram Askarpour, President of IS&S, added, “I am pleased with the progress we have achieved in establishing a strong market presence solely on the foundation of products we have internally developed. We believe the strength of this strategy can be seen in our gross profits, which reflect the attractive margins of production orders, even at volumes below our historic norms. With the introduction of the only FAA-certified Turboprop Autothrottle, we are essentially creating an entirely new market. Now, we are adding a retrofit standalone version, which significantly reduces the price point, making this a more economical, accessible choice and expanding the products applications. Over the past few years, we have transitioned IS&S away from large burdensome engineering programs and towards opportunities that we believe better leverage our proprietary technology with significantly lower risk. As we add more internally developed products to our growing portfolio, we can better capitalize on the growth opportunities emerging from impending FAA mandates and the industry’s increasing emphasis on price-for-performance procurement.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will be hosting a conference call on Wednesday, February 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. ET to discuss these results and its business outlook.
