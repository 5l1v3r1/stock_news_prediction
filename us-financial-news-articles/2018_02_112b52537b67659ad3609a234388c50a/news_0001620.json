City now have 69 points from 26 games. \nCity manager Pep Guardiola, without the injured David Silva, Leroy Sane and Gabriel Jesus, named only six substitutes including club record signing Aymeric Laporte, signed for a club record 57 million pounds last week. \nIn an attacking line-up, Burnley boss Sean Dyche gave winger Aaron Lennon his first start since joining from Everton. \nCity went ahead when a short corner was worked to Danilo and, enjoying plenty of space, the Brazilian unleashed an unstoppable drive from outside the area. Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Manchester City - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - February 3, 2018 Burnley's Johann Berg Gudmundsson celebrates scoring their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff CITY QUALITY \nThe Clarets were struggling to create openings but when Jack Cork looped the ball into the area, it fell to defender Ben Mee whose volley forced a good save from Ederson. \nFormer City youth team player Mee had another half-chance minutes later but his header from a corner flashed just wide. \nCity showcased their quality in the 39th minute with a flowing move from the back, ending with a powerful drive from Kevin De Bruyne which keeper Nick Pope did well to keep out. \nAfter the break, there was almost a repeat of the opening goal when City again found Danilo from a corner but this time the full back’s shot was tipped over by Pope. \nSomehow Burnley were still in the game and they came close to levelling when a fine Lennon strike was pushed against the woodwork by Ederson. \nThat brought the game to life and City pushed forward with increased urgency and should have doubled their lead when Kyle Walker played the ball across the face of goal and somehow Sterling put it wide from point-blank range. \nCity were made to pay when Burnley substitute Matt Lowton floated in a cross from the right and Gudmundsson met it on the half-volley to fire home and give the hosts one of the more memorable results of a season that has defied expectations.
