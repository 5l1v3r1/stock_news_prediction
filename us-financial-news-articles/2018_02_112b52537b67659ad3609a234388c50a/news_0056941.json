It’s the full U.N. resolution that needs to be implemented.”\nThe Russian military on Tuesday accused rebels in Ghouta of raining mortar fire down on the evacuation route opened to allow civilians to leave the conflict zone, something the rebels denied.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia regretted the situation unfolding in Ghouta and said Moscow would continue to work to try to help civilians leave the area despite what he called “provocations” from rebels.\nReporting by John Irish; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:09:32.062+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
