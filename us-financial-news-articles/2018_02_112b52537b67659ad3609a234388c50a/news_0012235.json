Its shares rose 3 percent in extended trading.\nSkyworks earned $2 per share excluding items, beating the estimate of $1.92. Revenue rose 15 percent to $1.05 billion, in line with analysts’ expectation.\nHowever, net income fell to $70.4 million, or 38 cents per share, for the first quarter ended Dec. 29, due to a $315.2 million income tax provision.\nThe supplier of radio frequency chips for Apple also announced a new $1 billion stock repurchase program that runs into January 2020.
