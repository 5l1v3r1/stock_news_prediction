They said Russia is currently in talks with Turkish energy companies and state electricity producer EUAS to join the consortium.\nThe three Turkish companies declined to comment on the issue when contacted by Reuters and Rosatom did not respond to a request for comment.\nRussia had halted the project after Turkey downed a Russian warplane over Syria in late 2015, bringing relations between the two countries to their worst since the Cold War. The project resumed in June 2016, after relations were normalized.\nDuring a news conference with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the countries planned to launch the first reactor at Akkuyu in 2023 and that construction would begin in the near future.\nHurriyet newspaper reported on Tuesday that a board member from Kolin Insaat said it was unlikely that the plant would become operational by 2023.\nThe nuclear power plant is slated to have a production capacity of 4,800 megawatts and will cost $20 billion to construct.\nReporting by Orhan Coskun; Writing by Ali Kucukgocmen; Editing by Daren Butler and Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:44:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
