A good response would be, \"I don't have managerial experience, but I was allowed to take the lead on various projects where I delegated tasks to other co-workers and received specified results. If I could obtain these specified results then I'm sure I can effectively manage a team here and am willing to learn from those above me.\"\nRegardless of the area where you're not completely qualified, says Drexler, \"always turn it from what you don't know to what you do know.\"\n\"You need to be like a spin doctor,\" he adds, \"like a politician.\"\nLike this story?
