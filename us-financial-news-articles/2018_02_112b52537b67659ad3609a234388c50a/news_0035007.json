The benchmark fell 0.3 percent on Wednesday.\n“Naturally, after a disappointing day on the ASX yesterday...traders are betting on a very solid day here in Australia,” Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD, said in a note.\nWhile all sectors rose, the main index was primarily led higher by gains in financials and materials stocks. The mining and metals sector contributed the most as Dalian iron ore in key market China hit a three week peak overnight.\nLME nickel added to the optimism, ending Wednesday up 4.8 percent while aluminium finished 1.8 percent higher.\nMining heavyweight BHP gained as much as 4 percent to touch its highest in 10 months and was the main index’s primary driver.\nRival Rio Tinto touched its highest in nearly a month.\nThe Australian financial index added as much as 0.7 percent, with Australian Securities Exchange Ltd gaining the most. The exchange operator reported a five percent jump in first-half net profit on Thursday, with the stock gaining the most on the sector benchmark.\nIn the energy sector, Origin Energy Ltd rose as much as 7.8 percent, the most in more than a year, after half-year underlying profit jumped on higher energy prices. The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast.\nA rally in oil prices, with Brent crude futures settling up by 2.6 percent on Wednesday, took the energy sector to its biggest percentage gain in a little more than a week.\nNew Zealand shares were on track to end Thursday marginally higher largely thanks to industrial and telecom stocks.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index rose 0.1 percent, or 7.4 points, to 8,066.2.\nTelecom services provider Spark New Zealand Ltd was trading as much as 1.5 percent higher, the most in a fortnight, and was the biggest contributor to index gains.\nReporting by Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T04:12:28.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
