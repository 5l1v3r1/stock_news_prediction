He resorted to sometimes crude terms in criticising Macron’s lawmakers, the powerful employers’ groups, and other veterans in his party.\n“When I heard Wauquiez’s comments I first thought he had tried to act as the ‘trash and cash’ cool big brother in front of the students and would later say he regretted his comments,” Dominique Bussereau, a former transport minister, told Reuters on Wednesday.\nAfter Wauquiez told an evening TV show on Tuesday that he was standing by his comments in the name of free speech, Bussereau decided to quit Les Republicains.\n“He (Wauquiez) has given a very rightwing style to the party, flattering the grassroots. But if the party wants to win elections again one day, it needs to be able to attract a wide range of people and not focus on such a narrow line,” Bussereau said.\nAn EU lawmaker and a mayor in eastern France have also said they are quitting the party in protest at Wauquiez’s comments.\nWauquiez could be heard in one of the recordings telling the Lyon business school students that they would get in trouble if one of them leaked his comments.
