Altice, which owns Portugal’s largest telecom operator MEO, agreed to buy Media Capital in July last year from Spain’s Prisa in a 440 million euro deal.\nReporting By Axel Bugge, editing by Andrei Khalip\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:09:27.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
