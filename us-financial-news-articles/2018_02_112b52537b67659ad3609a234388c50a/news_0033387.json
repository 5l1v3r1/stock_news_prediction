Krist was elected to the seat as a Republican in 2010 and 2014 but announced in July he would run for governor as an independent.\nHowever, a state law requiring the signatures of 10 percent of Nebraska’s 1.2 million registered voters and the lack of high-profile candidates among the Democrats led Krist to make the switch.\nWhile Nebraska traditionally votes Republican, Ricketts could be at risk, said Randall Adkins, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.\n“If anyone is going to unseat an incumbent, this is probably the year to do it,” Adkins said. “Krist is considered a credible candidate. He’s a veteran and a two-term incumbent with a conservative voting record in a red state. However, he is running against a well-financed incumbent governor.”\nNearly 49 percent of Nebraska registered voters are Republican, compared with about 31 percent Democrat and about 21 percent independent.\nNebraska has not elected a Democrat as governor since 1994, and a Democrat has not won a presidential nomination in the state since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The highest-ranking Democratic office holder in the state is Lincoln Mayor Chris Beutler.\nRickett’s campaign spokesman Matthew Trail pointed to polling done by research firm Morning Consult from Oct. 1 through Dec. 31 that showed Ricketts with a 54 percent approval rating among voters.\n”Throughout the odyssey of Senator Krist’s candidacy, Governor Ricketts’ campaign has remained focused on sharing the governor’s vision for a growing, stronger, more prosperous Nebraska,” Trail said.\nReporting by Kevin O'Hanlon; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T01:03:55.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
