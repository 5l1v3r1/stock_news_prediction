Revenue from advertising, which accounts for 75.3 percent of its total revenue, fell 5 percent to $297.7 million.\nHowever, that number beat the average analyst estimate of $280.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPandora has been cutting jobs and investing more to make the platform advertiser friendly. Last month, the company said it would save $45 million by cutting 5 percent of its workforce.\nChief Executive Lynch said the money would be used to deploy a more efficient ad technology that would allow advertisers to place ads without paying an intermediary.\nPandora’s net loss narrowed to $52.1 million, or 21 cents per share, benefiting from $483 million in one-time tax gains.\nExcluding items, it posted a loss of 21 cents per share. Total revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $395.3 million.\nAnalysts on average had expected a loss of 7 cents per share and revenue of $376.4 million.\nReporting by Laharee Chatterjee and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T01:48:16.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
