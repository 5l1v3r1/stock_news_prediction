Williams bombed in a 3-pointer and Montrezl Harrell slammed home a pair of dunks in a 9-0 run sliced the Golden State lead to 104-102 with 9:07 remaining in the game.\nHowever, Curry saved three of his eight 3-pointers for the final 6:00, helping the Warriors keep the Clippers at bay.\nCurry also finished with a team-high 10 assists.\nKevin Durant had 24 points for the Warriors, who had lost 123-117 at Portland in their last game before the All-Star break. They improved to 13-1 following a defeat this season.\nThompson added 19 points, the fifth of which was the 10,000th of his career. He became the 10th Warrior ever to reach the milestone.\nGreen (14 points) and David West (10) also scored in double figures for Golden State, which shot 62.7 percent from the field.\nTobias Harris had 22 points while DeAndre Jordan compiled a 16-point, 14-rebound double-double for the Clippers, who went into the All-Star break having won seven of nine, including five of six on the road.\nDanilo Gallinari (15 points), Harrell (15), Milos Teodosic (14) and Austin Rivers (14) made it seven players in double figures for Los Angeles, which fell to 5-3 since dealing Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons on Jan. 29.\nThe Clippers, who were without starting guard Avery Bradley (sports hernia), lost despite making 50 percent of their field-goal attempts.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T14:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:21:49.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
