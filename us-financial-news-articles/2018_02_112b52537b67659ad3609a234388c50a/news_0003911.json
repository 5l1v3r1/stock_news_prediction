He knows exactly how to defend,” said Lotterer, a three-times Le Mans 24 Hours sportscar winner and, like Vergne, a former Formula One driver.\nThe one-two was the Chinese-owned Techeetah team’s first in Formula E.\nRosenqvist, bidding for a third race win in a row, was fourth for Mahindra.\nBrazil’s defending champion Lucas di Grassi again hit problems and retired, failing to score for the fourth race in a row with Audi.
