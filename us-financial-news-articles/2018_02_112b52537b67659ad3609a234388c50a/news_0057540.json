Highlights include:\nFourth quarter 2017 production of nearly 82,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (“Boe/d”), or 7.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”), at the midpoint of the Company’s 80,000 Boe/d to 84,000 Boe/d guidance for the quarter;\nFull year 2017 production was approximately 25.7 MMBoe, or 70,320 Boe/d, for a year-over-year growth rate of 31 percent;\nProved reserves increased 88 percent, to a record 363 MMBoe, with a reserve replacement ratio in excess of 760 percent and an organic reserve replacement of approximately 172 percent;\nThe Company’s year-end Comanche drilling inventory increased by approximately 800 gross locations, a result of successful staggered Lower Eagle Ford development tests;\nA 17 well four-zone stack development test was completed at Briscoe Catarina South in Comanche Area 3, with wells averaging 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,252 Boe/d from the two Lower Eagle Ford zones and 675 Boe/d from the two Upper Eagle Ford zones;\nThe successful stacked development test at Briscoe Catarina South confirms up to four economic targets in certain parts of the Comanche acreage;\nThe Company reported a net loss of $61.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, net income of $35.8 million for the third quarter 2017, and net income of $12.3 million for the fourth quarter 2016;\nThe Company reported net income of $43.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016;\nFourth quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $246 million were 33 percent higher compared to third quarter 2017 and 96 percent higher compared to fourth quarter 2016;\nAdjusted revenues (a non-GAAP financial measure that includes hedge settlements) were approximately $244.3 million during fourth quarter 2017, 25 percent higher compared to third quarter 2017 and 68 percent higher compared to fourth quarter 2016;\nFull year 2017 revenues were approximately $740.3 million and full year 2017 Adjusted revenues (a non-GAAP financial measure that includes hedge settlements) were approximately $753.5 million;\nAdjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) was approximately $137.4 million during fourth quarter 2017, 39 percent higher compared to third quarter 2017 and 89 percent higher compared to fourth quarter 2016 ;\nFull year 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) was approximately $372 million, a 27 percent increase compared to full year 2016 ;\nIn February 2018, the Company announced and closed a comprehensive financing strategy which is expected to fully fund capital plans for the next several years; and\nThe Company has converted its accounting convention from the full-cost method to the successful efforts method, providing increased transparency and comparability to peers.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\n“2017 was a transformational year for Sanchez as we successfully integrated the Comanche asset, providing a tremendous growth platform and pathway to deleveraging the balance sheet,” said Tony Sanchez, III, Chief Executive Officer of Sanchez Energy. “The Comanche Transaction resulted in a significant increase in the scope and scale of our operations, creating a dominant acreage position for Sanchez Energy in the Western Eagle Ford. With approximately 487,000 gross (285,000 net) leasehold acres and roughly 3,700 identified net drilling locations in the Eagle Ford, we now project more than 15 years of capital efficient development opportunities, with over one billion barrels of net oil equivalent (“Boe”) resource potential.\n“As previously reported, we had strong operating results in the fourth quarter, with production increasing to nearly 82,000 Boe/d, or 7.5 MMBoe, and we finished 2017 with full year production of approximately 25.7 MMBoe. The year-over-year production growth rate of 31 percent was accentuated by an 88 percent increase in proved reserves at year-end 2017, leading to record proved reserves of 363 MMBoe. As a key measure of our success, we achieved an organic reserve replacement ratio of approximately 172 percent in 2017, in large part due to the expansion of proved locations in Central Catarina and the identification of a second Lower Eagle Ford target at Comanche. We continue to add drilling locations through our multi-zone development of the Lower Eagle Ford, our recently announced four-zone stack development tests at Briscoe Catarina South, and our step-out well tests at Chupadera Ranch in Comanche Area 7.\n“This quarter’s strong operating performance, together with increases in oil and NGL prices during the latter part of the year, resulted in Adjusted EBITDAX of $137.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 39 percent compared to third quarter 2017, and full year 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX of $372 million, an increase of 27 percent compared to the full year 2016. Importantly, the Company’s operating margins continue to expand as our Eagle Ford assets realize the benefit of premium Gulf Coast pricing and increases in production are driving our per-unit operating costs lower.\n“The new three-year plan we announced last month reinforces our commitment to financial discipline and capital efficiency. While the plan calls for the Company to reduce annual capital spending for the years 2018 through 2020 to levels approximately $100 million lower when compared to 2017, we continue to project significant production growth in 2018 and over the three-year planning horizon. The Company’s inventory of low-cost, high rate of return drilled-but-uncompleted wells, or “DUCs,” and active drilling program are expected to organically increase production and cash flow over this period. These higher production levels, together with better operating margins and improving oil price fundamentals, give us line of sight to full-cycle free cash flow generation at the corporate level.\n“We announced a comprehensive financing strategy in February 2018 to fully fund our growth plans for the next several years. After successfully executing this plan, we currently have liquidity totaling $834 million, which includes $650 million in cash and $184 million of borrowing availability under two credit facilities. Given this significant liquidity position and potential for additional strategic divestitures, we see an opportunity to fully develop the Company’s world-class asset base and provide the cash flow needed to reduce our financial leverage over the next two to three years. With a continuous focus on financial discipline, measured growth and deleveraging, we believe we are well positioned to deliver significant shareholder value.”\nOPERATIONS UPDATE\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company spud 38 gross (14.3 net) wells and completed 80 gross (35.6 net) wells and brought on-line 64 wells at Comanche, 8 wells at Catarina, and 13 wells at Maverick.\nAs previously reported, the Company’s year-end 2017 Comanche drilling inventory increased by approximately 800 gross locations as a result of successful staggered Lower Eagle Ford development tests. A four-zone stack development test of 17 wells was completed at Briscoe Catarina South, in Comanche Area 3, with wells averaging 30-day peak production rates of approximately 1,252 Boe/d from the two Lower Eagle Ford zones and 675 Boe/d from the two Upper Eagle Ford zones. The successful stacked development test at Briscoe Catarina South confirms up to four economic targets in certain parts of the Comanche acreage.\nAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had maximized the allowable 30 well drilling bank at Catarina that can be applied towards its current annual drilling commitment period, which extends from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018. As of Dec. 31, 2017, the Company had drilled an additional 10 wells towards its annual 50 well drilling commitment at Catarina for the one-year drilling period ending June 30, 2018, resulting in a total of 40 wells towards the annual 50 well drilling commitment.\nAs of Dec. 31, 2017, the Company had 2,165 gross (861.6 net) producing wells with 78 gross wells in various stages of completion, as detailed in the following table:\nProject Area Gross\nProducing\nWells Gross Wells\nWaiting/Undergoing\nCompletion Catarina 389 4 Comanche 1,582 71 Maverick 63 — Palmetto 84 3 TMS / Other 47 — Total 2,165 78\nPRODUCTION VOLUMES, AVERAGE SALES PRICES, AND OPERATING COSTS PER BOE\nThe Company’s production mix during the fourth quarter 2017 consisted of approximately 34 percent oil, 34 percent natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), and 32 percent natural gas. By asset area, Catarina, Comanche, Maverick, and Palmetto/TMS/Other comprised approximately 53 percent, 38 percent, eight percent, and one percent, respectively, of the Company’s total fourth quarter 2017 production volumes.\nRevenues of approximately $246 million during the fourth quarter 2017 were 96 percent higher compared to the fourth quarter 2016 and 33 percent higher compared to third quarter 2017 revenues of approximately $184.8 million. Adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter 2017, a non-GAAP financial measure that includes a $1.7 million loss in hedge settlements, were $244.3 million, 68 percent higher compared to the fourth quarter 2016 and 25 percent higher compared to third quarter 2017 Adjusted revenues of $195.3 million.\nCommodity price realizations during the fourth quarter 2017, which include the impact of hedge settlements, were $54.51 per barrel (“Bbl”) of oil, $22.81 per Bbl of NGLs, and $3.20 per thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas.\nProduction, average sales prices, and operating costs and expenses per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter 2017 are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Production: Oil (MBbl) 2,559 1,534 8,217 6,370 Natural gas liquids (MBbl) 2,552 1,340 8,342 5,960 Natural gas (MMcf) 14,585 10,098 54,651 43,189 Total oil equivalent (MBoe) (1) 7,542 4,557 25,667 19,529 Average Sales Price Excluding Derivatives (2) : Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 56.32 $ 45.14 $ 48.69 $ 37.95 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) 22.81 18.81 20.52 13.72 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) 2.99 3.10 3.10 2.50 Oil equivalent ($ per Boe) $ 32.62 $ 27.59 $ 28.84 $ 22.09 Average Sales Price Including Derivatives (3) : Oil ($ per Bbl) $ 54.51 $ 56.88 $ 50.12 $ 55.37 Natural gas liquids ($ per Bbl) 22.81 18.81 20.52 13.73 Natural gas ($ per Mcf) 3.20 3.25 3.12 3.07 Oil equivalent ($ per Boe) $ 32.40 $ 31.89 $ 29.39 $ 29.03 Average unit costs per Boe: Oil and natural gas production expenses (4) $ 9.81 $ 7.40 $ 9.52 $ 7.97 Production and ad valorem taxes $ 1.32 $ 1.22 $ 1.43 $ 1.01 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion $ 8.27 $ 8.57 $ 6.90 $ 7.55 Impairment of oil and natural gas properties $ 4.91 $ 2.99 $ 1.54 $ 2.43 (1) Includes approximately 2,417 Boe of production associated with UnSub for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Accordingly, financial information for prior periods contained in this release has been recast to reflect retrospective application of the successful efforts method. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, Sanchez Energy recognized a $37 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter 2017, largely as a result of the reduced value of undeveloped Tuscaloosa Marine Shale acreage in Mississippi and Louisiana. Additionally, the Company recognized a $73 million gain on the sale of its Javelina asset, which closed in the third quarter 2017.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $79.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, which includes $61.2 million in non-cash mark-to-market losses related to hedging activities, a $37 million non-cash impairment charge, and $1.8 million in one-time acquisition and divestiture costs and other non-recurring items. This compares to the Company’s reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $7.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016.\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $35.1 million for the full year 2017. This compares to the Company’s reported net loss attributable to common stockholders of $157.4 million for the full year 2016.\nThe Company’s fourth quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP financial measure) of approximately $137.4 million was 39 percent higher when compared to third quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDAX of $98.9 million and 89 percent higher when compared to the fourth quarter 2016. The Company’s Adjusted Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure) for the fourth quarter 2017 of $21.8 million excludes $61.2 million in non-cash mark-to-market losses related to hedging activities, a $37 million non-cash impairment charge, and $1.8 million in one-time acquisition and divestiture costs and other non-recurring items.\nFor the full year 2017, the Company reported Adjusted EBITDAX of $372 million, which is 27 percent higher when compared to full year 2016 Adjusted EBITDAX of $293 million.

Adjusted EBITDAX and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) are non-GAAP financial measures defined in the tables included with today’s news release.\nGENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE\nThe Company reported general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses of $32.6 million in the fourth quarter 2017. Included in G&A expenses is $1.8 million in acquisition and divestiture costs, $5.6 million of non-cash equity compensation, and $3.6 million associated with the change in value of the phantom units that vest periodically in accordance with the terms of the Company’s equity-based incentive awards.

It is also used to assess our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. Our Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDAX in the same manner.
