The stake will shrink to below 10 percent after in the merged company.\n“In the long run, we might consider a possible exit but I won’t dare give guidance on the timing,” Axiata Chief Executive Officer Jamaludin Ibrahim told a briefing on its results.\nAxiata’s shares had slipped 0.2 percent to 5.67 ringgit at the day’s close.\n$1 = 3.9150 ringgit Reporting by Liz Lee; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T15:43:51.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
