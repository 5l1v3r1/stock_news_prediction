It gave me a lot of pressure for me to close it out and a lot of pressure for her to stay in and I just handled it a little better.” \nIn Prague, Petra Kvitova sent the Czech Republic into their 10th consecutive semi-final when she clinched the first round tie against Switzerland with a 6-2 6-4 win over Belinda Bencic in the third rubber.

We were pretty tight in the first few games of each set and then when I got the break I felt a little bit better.” \nElsewhere, Kristina Mladenovic and Amandine Hesse beat Kirsten Flipkens and Elise Mertens in the deciding doubles rubber to put hosts France through to the semi-finals for the third time in four years. \nIn Minsk, Anna-Lena Groenefeld and Tatjana Maria beat Lidziya Marozava and Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus in the deciding doubles rubber to put twice champions Germany into the semis for the first time since 2015. \nGermany will next face the Czech Republic.
