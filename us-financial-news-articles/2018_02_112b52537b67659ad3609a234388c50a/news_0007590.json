The Ukrainian court upheld an earlier ruling to deny him the status of a person in need of additional protection. \n“This is yet another decision by (President Petro Poroshenko) and not by the court,” Saakashvili said in a post on Facebook after the verdict. \nHis lawyer, Ruslan Chernolutsky, said the ruling would likely pave the way for Saakashvili’s departure from Ukraine. \n“We all need to be prepared for the fact that the authorities in an illegal manner will take the decision on his compulsory deportation or possible extradition,” he said in a video posted by Saakashvili. \nIn December, Ukrainian General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Saakashvili was likely to be extradited. \nSaakashvili also faces criminal charges in Ukraine. The authorities accuse him of assisting a criminal organization, which he calls a fabricated allegation to undermine his campaign to unseat Poroshenko.
