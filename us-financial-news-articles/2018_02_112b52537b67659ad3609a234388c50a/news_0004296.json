It would need 308 votes to pass the reform. The president expects the proposal, considered key to reduce Brazilâ€™s growing budget deficit, to go up for a vote this month.\nReporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T00:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T00:43:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
