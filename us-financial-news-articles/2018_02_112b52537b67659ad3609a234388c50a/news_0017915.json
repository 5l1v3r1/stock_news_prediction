PTC is designed to prevent derailments and crashes caused by excessive speed. \nAnderson said on Sunday that Amtrak is a leader in adding PTC and is pushing government leaders “to fully support the PTC deadline.” FILE PHOTO: Richard Anderson attends an interview in New York May 22, 2013. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo \nAmtrak has faced a number of challenges, including safety concerns and proposed funding cuts. The railroad has been involved in three high-profile fatal crashes since December, though Anderson said Amtrak is not to blame for two. \nOn Sunday, Amtrak blamed a crash in South Carolina on CSX Corp, which owns and operates the tracks where a switch was padlocked in a position that steered an Amtrak train onto a siding where it crashed into an unoccupied CSX train, killing two people and injuring more than 100. \nIn November, the National Transportation Safety Board criticized what it called Amtrak’s “weak safety culture” after finding that unsafe conditions led to an Amtrak train’s striking a backhoe working on tracks in Pennsylvania, killing two maintenance workers. \nOn Tuesday, two cars separated on a high-speed Acela train in Maryland without injury. Amtrak said inspection of all Acela trains found no defects. \nLast week, an Amtrak train carrying Republican lawmakers struck a garbage truck in Virginia that had driven around safety gates. \nIn December, an Amtrak train derailed near Seattle, killing three. The engineer told investigators he misread a signal shortly before the incident. \nIn December, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao urged railroads and transit agencies to take action to meet PTC deadlines. Since then, Federal Railroad Administration officials have held meetings with top officials at about 30 railroads and transit agencies.
