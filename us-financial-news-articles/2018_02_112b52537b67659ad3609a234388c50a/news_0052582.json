The hearing will deal with Gates’ attorneys request to withdraw from the case over what they have described as “irreconcilable differences.” Gates is charged with conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy to defraud the United States and failing to register as a foreign agent for political work representing a pro-Russia Ukrainian political party.
