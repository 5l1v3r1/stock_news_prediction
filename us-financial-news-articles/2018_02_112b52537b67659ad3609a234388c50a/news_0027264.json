He was to attend a conference on Iraqi reconstruction in Kuwait.\nMILITARY OPERATION Sisi is running against a single competitor in the March 26-28 poll after more challenging opponents pulled out, some citing intimidation of supporters and other tactics designed to give the incumbent an easy win.\nSisi, a former military chief, gave the armed forces three months to clear Sinai of militants after more than 300 people were killed by gunmen at a mosque in Sinai in November. The Egyptian army said at least 28 suspected militants have died in clashes since the operation began on Friday.\nEgypt receives $1.3 billion annually from the United States.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Last year, Washington withdrew some financial aid to Egypt saying it had failed to make progress on respecting human rights and democracy.\nAsked about concerns over the election, Tillerson said the United States supported a credible, transparent vote in Egypt, Libya and elsewhere.\n“We have always advocated for free and fair elections, transparent elections not just in Egypt but in any country,” Tillerson said.\nEgypt says it will conduct free and fair elections, but opponents of Sisi have criticized what they say is a government-led crackdown on challengers.\nHe said the United States was also keen to continue supporting Egypt in its economic recovery, after the country implemented tough economic reforms tied to a $12 billion International Monetary Fund loan.\nShoukry said Egypt stressed the need for a peaceful settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n“We discussed how to reach a solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on the basis of a two state solution and the importance of maintaining U.S. efforts to reach this final settlement,” Shoukry said.\nTillerson said Washington remained committed to working for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, adding that Trump’s decision on Jerusalem in December did not set final boundaries for the city and that Washington believes it has an “important role to play to bring a resolution” to the crisis.\nThe decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital led to clashes in the West Bank, and was opposed by Arab and EU countries.\nReporting by Yara Bayoumy; Additional reporting by Mostafa Hashem,; Writing by Sami Aboudi, John Davison; Editing by Toby Chopra, Alison Williams and William Maclean\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:01:30.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
