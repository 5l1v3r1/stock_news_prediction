So I will if she is.” Slideshow (2 Images) \n“She” is Shiffrin, the reigning overall and slalom World Cup champion who has expanded her repertoire from the technical to the speed events and is also fifth in the downhill rankings this season. \nA U.S. team spokeswoman said a decision on whether Shiffrin would go in the team event would depend on her ‘energy levels’ after her other events. \nU.S. head men’s coach Sasha Rearick said the Americans had been practising the team event and were taking it seriously. \n“I hate to lose at anything, so if there’s a competition out there, we want to win,” he told reporters. “We’re going to put forward the best team we can put forward.” Reporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T08:05:07.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
