Ramsden was one of two policymakers who opposed the BoE’s decision in November to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade, but appears to have shifted his stance somewhat in remarks published by the Sunday Times. “We all will keep a close eye on what happens through the early part of this year to see if that (BoE) forecast of wage growth picking up to 3 percent is realised. But certainly relative to where I was, I see the case for rates rising somewhat sooner rather than somewhat later,” he was quoted as saying.
