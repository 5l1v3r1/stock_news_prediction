Luxury real estate auction firm Platinum Luxury Auctions reported that while the sales price of the auction will not be revealed until closing, the price handily exceeded the $3 million mark - far in excess of the auction's reserve price of $1.75 million. Platinum managed the auction sale in cooperation with South Carolina-based brokerage Atlantic Properties of the Lowcountry, represented by listing agent Mary Lou Wertz.\nMs. Renie Harwood, the owner of the property, selected Platinum for the non-distressed sale after a lengthy process of interviewing real estate auction companies. In a thank you letter sent to the Miami-based auction firm, Ms. Harwood stated that the results of the sale \"surpassed my expectations\" and called Platinum \"one of the good guys\" in the real estate industry.\n\"We were pleased to see the very robust response to this luxury auction offering, especially given that the home failed to sell after a listing period of 2 and ½ years,\" stated David Enriquez, Platinum's vice president of operations. He added that during the 5-week promotional program in advance of the sales date, more than 14,900 international website hits were registered to the property's page on the Platinum site, which resulted in 99 bona fide buyer inquiries and 7 registered bidders on auction day.\nThe winning auction bidder was described by Mr. Enriquez as a private individual who has owned multiple properties on Kiawah Island. The buyer was actually traveling abroad during the live auction, but participated via telephone with a representative who was stationed on-site to place the phone bids in real time.\nThe tri-level beach estate sits on a 0.7-acre lot offering 25 feet of direct beach frontage. The parcel's lengthy, rectangular shape includes a gently winding walkway leading directly to the beach.\nThe main residence provides 4 bedrooms, 5 full and one-half baths, and more than 5,700 square feet of living space, while a separate guesthouse - which also serves as a cabana - adds another bed, full bath, and 350 square feet of interiors. Prominent features of the home include a large salon with oversized windows offering ocean views, an elevator, gentlemen's study, and a large master suite occupying the entire third level.\nIn addition to the guesthouse/cabana, outdoor amenities include multiple terraces and patios with ocean views, a large sundeck surrounding a private pool, and an outdoor shower for rinsing off the surf and sand.\nThe sale is scheduled to close within 30 days, although Platinum noted that the all-cash sale might close sooner, at the request of the buyer and seller.
