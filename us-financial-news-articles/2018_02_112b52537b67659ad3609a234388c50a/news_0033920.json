The pickup in salary growth has stoked bets the Federal Reserve may raise key overnight borrowing costs faster to keep inflation in check.\nThe Labor Department will release the Consumer Price Index for January at 8:30 a.m. EST (1330 GMT) on Wednesday.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters expect the year-over-year increase in the government’s broadest inflation gauge likely to slow to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent in December.\n“Given the recent roller coaster ride in equities was sparked in good part by inflation fears accelerating rate hikes, the latest inflation data will be seen as increasingly important and telling, to date. A further easing of price pressures should offer welcome, further calm to the market this week,” Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income, wrote in a note.\nThe yield on five-year TIPS reached 0.600 percent, the highest since November 2009, earlier Monday before easing to 0.531 percent, Tradeweb data showed.\nThe 10-year TIPS yield was last at 0.764 percent after hitting 0.846 percent, the highest since September 2013, according to Tradeweb.
