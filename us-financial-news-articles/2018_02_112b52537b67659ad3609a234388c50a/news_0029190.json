Her lawyers said she had health complications and had suffered a stillbirth.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Vasquez appealed the 30-year penalty upheld by a lower court and El Salvador’s Supreme court reduced her sentence.\nShe has spent more than 10 years in jail.\n“My effort has been worth it and now I‘m very happy to go back to my family again,” Vasquez said after leaving prison, surrounded by family and cheering human rights activists.\nAmnesty International said the resolution was encouraging but that the case should help end the country’s ban, under which at least 27 other women are still incarcerated.\n“El Salvador is still far from fully ensuring the rights of women and girls in the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty.\nReporting by Nelson Renteria; Writing by Christine Murray; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T00:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:35:15.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
