Output has risen by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the last year to about 10 million bpd.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects U.S. output to reach an average of 10.59 million bpd in 2018 and 11.18 million bpd by 2019, potentially overtaking Russia as the world's largest producer.\n\"The strong growth that is expected in U.S. production supports our more bearish outlook for the oil market,\" Hamza Khan, head of ING commodities strategy, said in a note.\n(Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Edmund Blair)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T13:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T17:23:55.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
