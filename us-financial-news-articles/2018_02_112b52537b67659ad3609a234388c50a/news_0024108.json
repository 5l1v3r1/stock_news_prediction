We’re in the process of doing that now,” said Probst. \nFormer sports doctor Nassar last year pleaded guilty to molesting female athletes under the guise of medical treatment for nearly 20 years, and has been given two prison sentences in Michigan of 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years. \nHe is also serving a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions. \nUltraViolet Action, a women’s advocacy group in the United States, on Friday called for USOC Chief Executive Scott Blackmun to resign for failing to adequately respond to reports of Nassar’s abuse before he was criminally charged. \nA letter by the women’s group signed by sexual abuse survivors says, “It’s unconscionable and unacceptable that no one has been held accountable at the USOC.” \nU.S. lawmakers on Thursday began a second congressional investigation into USOC, USA Gymnastics and other gymnastic organisations over the abuse scandal. \nDozens of the victims have accused officials at the USOC, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University of failing to investigate complaints stretching back decades. \nThe board of directors of USA Gymnastics stepped down after U.S. Olympic officials threatened to decertify the governing body. \nThe USOC has announced an independent investigation into its own conduct that would help them understand “who knew what about Nassar’s abuse, when and what they did with that information”. \nProbst told reporters “we will take the appropriate action” after the investigation. \nBut referring to Blackmun, Probst said, “We think that he did what he was supposed to do and did the right thing at every turn.” Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Ossian Shine and Richard Borsuk", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-10T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T02:05:52.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
