Companies typically suspend those kinds of buybacks ahead of quarterly reports in order to avoid illegal insider trading.\n“What we saw last week was a lack of a bid in the market, and maybe part of the problem was a lack of buybacks,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “If you’re seeing buybacks in the market, that tends to be bullish.”\nFollowing deep corporate tax cuts signed by President Donald Trump in December, U.S. companies in recent weeks have boosted their earnings forecasts, and many have said they would increase investments and give more money back to shareholders.\nTwo thirds of the way through reporting season, S&P 500 companies’ fourth-quarter earnings have jumped 14.8 percent compared to the year-ago period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nStill, in recent weeks, companies that typically buy back a lot of their shares have not outperformed the market. The S&P 500 Buyback index .SPBUYUP which tracks stocks with the highest buyback ratios, fell 8.8 percent from Jan. 26 through last Friday, the same as the broader S&P 500 .SPX .\n“What we know is that available cash is higher. What we believe is that it’s going to be used for a combination of things: share repurchases, dividend increases, some capex and M&A, and all of those are positive,” said Steve Chiavarone, a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.\nReporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:38:58.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
