The Romanian will match his career-high ranking, climbing up to number 74 on Monday. \nUndaunted by his first final, Basic, ranked 129th in the world, was stronger on the key points and moved brilliantly around the court. \nHe wrapped up the thrilling encounter in two hours and 21 minutes before collapsing to his knees in front of the roaring fans. \nMore familiar at the Challenger level of play, Basic - whose victory earned him nearly $110,000 and 250 points for the world ranking, topped his career-best effort of a semi-final finish in St Petersburg last year. \n”It’s a special day for me,“ Basic, who will climb up more than 50 places in the ranking to reach number 76 on Monday. ”I won a tournament and I moved up into the top 100. \n“I’ve always dreamed of a place in the top 100 and I managed to fulfil my dream today.” Reporting by Angel Krasimirov; Editing by Christian Radnedge", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-11T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:07:40.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
