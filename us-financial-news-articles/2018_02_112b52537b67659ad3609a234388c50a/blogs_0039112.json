The White House said this month it is no longer considering Victor Cha, a former official who has questioned the wisdom of a preventative military strike. Cha said such a strike carried too great a risk of leading to war.\nReporting by David Brunnstrom and Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Alistair Bell and Grant McCool\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T21:48:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
