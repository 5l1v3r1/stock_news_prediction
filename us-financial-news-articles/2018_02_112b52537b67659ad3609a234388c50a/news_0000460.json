The party, which sees immigration as a danger to the “survival of the German people in its Central European Lebensraum”, is no longer in any regional parliament.\nGermany’s security services have repeatedly attempted to ban the party as unconstitutional but have always been thwarted by courts, who on one occasion found that the party was so riddled with undercover agents that it was impossible to tell what was a genuine party decision and what was not.\nReporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann and Markus Wacket, writing by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T19:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:24:12.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
