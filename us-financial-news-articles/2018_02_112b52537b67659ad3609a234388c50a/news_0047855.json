LafargeHolcim’s shares are down 17 percent.\nHeidelbergCement said demand for building products in Indonesia, its largest market, rose last year due to the start of infrastructure projects but was accompanied by pricing pressure.\nIt said construction activity fell in Britain as a result of uncertainty related to its decision to exit the European Union, a trend the group expects to continue this year.\n$1 = 0.8076 euros Editing by Maria Sheahan and Jason Neely\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T12:21:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
