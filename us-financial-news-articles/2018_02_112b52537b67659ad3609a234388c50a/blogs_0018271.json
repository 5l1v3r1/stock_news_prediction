The final terms, in price, need to provide the best value for our respective customers investors and countries to provide an optimal platform for success,\" he said in an interview at the Singapore Airshow. \nMusser was speaking after a Brazilian newspaper reported on Tuesday that Boeing had presented a plan to Brazil's government that would give it a stake of up to 90 percent in   business.
