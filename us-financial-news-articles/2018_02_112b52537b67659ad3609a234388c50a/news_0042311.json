Markets could remain range-bound today,” said Madhumita Ghosh, head corporate solutions, Tasmac Global Education.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.24 percent at 10,385.20 as of 0622 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.35 percent higher at 33,822.50. The India Volatility Index fell as much as 5.8 percent.\nAmong other top gainers, ITC rose as much as 1.4 percent after three straight sessions of declines.\nMeanwhile, selloff continued in state-run lenders after a fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB) shook the industry last week. The Nifty PSU bank index dropped nearly 1 percent and has declined 10 percent since last Wednesday.\nThe fall in public sector banks is expected to continue, said Ghosh.\nPNB shares were trading half a percent lower after snapping a four-session losing streak in the previous session. They have shed nearly 28 percent in the past week after the lender unearthed fraudulent transactions worth $1.77 billion at a branch.\nPharma stocks also fell with the Nifty Pharma index down nearly 3 percent. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries dropped as much as 8.6 percent.
