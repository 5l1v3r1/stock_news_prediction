As ever with this company, the question is whether everyone else will follow where it leads. ATACAMA PEACE DEAL \nChile is part of South America’s “lithium triangle,” home to more than half the known global reserves of the mineral and the historic production base of the “lithium oligopoly”, namely FMC , Albemarle and SQM itself. \nThe Chilean government was as slow as everyone else to see the electric vehicle (EV) revolution coming but last year sprang into action with an international tender for lithium processing projects and a green light for Albemarle to raise production. \nSQM’s Chilean expansion plans, however, were blocked by its bitter dispute with Corfo, which allocates the country’s lithium production licences. \nRooted in political intrigue dating back to Chile’s Pinochet era, the stand-off crystallized around a disagreement on royalty payments. \nThe drama has been running since 2014, the two sides locked in on-off peace talks and arbitration court battles. \nThe truce was announced on Jan. 17. \nIn return for an overhaul of its corporate governance and a lift in royalties, SQM gets an increase in its production quota to 216,000 tonnes per year of lithium carbonate and the option of partnering with state copper producer Codelco on its untapped lithium prospects. \nThe prospect of the Atacama mother-lode cranking up production sent tremors through the lithium investment community. \nThe Global X Lithium and Battery Tech exchange traded fund was trading above $40 before the news. It touched a low of $33.05 on Tuesday. Global X’s holdings are largely of lithium blue chips. The hit on the junior sector has been more savage. \nBut SQM can’t switch on new brine capacity overnight, even if it wanted to. It is, moreover, currently focused on getting its joint venture Argentinian project into production by a targeted 2020. \nAny lithium surge from its Chilean operations could still be years away. \nThe removal of the political bottle-neck in Chile is, wrote analysts at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, “good news for a lithium industry post-2021” but “until then the status quo remains.” (“Lithium Research Note”, Jan. 24, 2018) \nGraphic on Global X Lithium ETF's reaction to the Chilean peace deal: tmsnrt.rs/2sfGPtq \nGraphic on lithium carbonate pricing: BOTTLE-NECKED SUPPLY \nAnd the status quo in the lithium market remains one of physical supply bottle-neck. \nSpot carbonate prices in China experienced another mini-surge over the second half of 2017, peaking at an average $26.18 per kg in December, according to Industrial Minerals (IM), part of the Metal Bulletin Group. \nThat was just short of the levels trading at the height of the original 2016 lithium scare, when exploding prices first grabbed the world’s attention. \nOnce again it’s a sign of supply chain stress. \nThe recent tightness, totally unexpected, according to Martim Facada, lithium market reporter at IM, was down to competition for different forms of lithium and processing constraints. \nA production creep away from lithium carbonate towards higher-specification hydroxide has left the carbonate chain short of units. \nThe tension was extreme enough in September to lift the Chinese spot carbonate price over that of hydroxide for the first time ever, according to Facada. \nMeanwhile, the wave of new lithium supply from Australia’s growing band of hard-rock miners is crashing into China’s processing limits. \n“Just selling to China is not the end of the story, it’s just the beginning,” Benchmark Minerals writes. \nThe transformation of lumps of rock into battery-grade lithium compounds is a long and winding technical road, requiring experienced navigation. \nChinese processors were already working close to capacity last year, while the companies with a proven technical track record capable of building new capacity “are few and far between”, Benchmark Minerals says. \nIt may not feel like it to the owner of shares in a lithium junior, but the lithium bull market is marching remorselessly onwards, with prices outside of China still playing catch-up. TESLA - LEADING THE WAY? \nWhich is why, of course, Tesla is so interested in cutting its own lithium supply deal at its source in the Atacama desert. \nThe immediate outlook for the lithium market is for more disruptive volatility. \nCompetition for units, meanwhile, is only going to become more intense as ever more automotive companies take their EV pledge. \nSo far none, according to Benchmark Minerals, has actually locked in long-term contracted lithium supplies. \nThe current market battle is playing out between lithium producers and battery-makers. The end-users, the car companies themselves, have so far been largely by-standers. \nThat looks set to change. \nAnd it’s perhaps no surprise that Tesla, the self-acclaimed standard bearer of the electric future, is leading the way. \nOthers will almost certainly follow, since the world’s automotive sector is just waking up to the supply-chain challenges associated with mass production of electric vehicles. \nAnd if a straight-to-mine approach works in lithium, would it work for cobalt, another key battery input with an even more fragile supply chain dominated by the Democratic Republic of Congo? \nWe may not have to wait long to find out. \nThere’s a sense Tesla has just fired the starting gun on the next chapter of the battery metals revolution.
