Most people in developed countries do have smartphones, and so we think the days of double-digit growth for the industry are far behind us,\" Suva said. \"The setup is really more about growing users and net adds.\" \nApple's newest product, the HomePod smart speaker, hits shelves Feb. 9 . Its other major legacy product, the Mac, saw declines in both unit sales and revenue in the December quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T20:13:33.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
