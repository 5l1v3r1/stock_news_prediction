They kept that margin to the end.\nForward Grant Williams led Tennessee with 16 points as the only Vol in double figures.\nCold shooting put Tennessee in an early hole. The Vols started off making only two of their first 11 shots and fell back 17-6 just over six minutes into the game.\nOver the next seven minutes they managed to cut that down to 20-18, but the Tide responded with four quick points on their way to a 37-27 cushion.\nHall and Sexton combined to go 9 of 13 from the field in scoring 10 points each as the Tide finished the half shooting 16-of-29 (55.2 percent) from the field to Tennessee’s 9-of-29 (31.0 percent). Petty was 3-for-9 in adding nine points for the Tide. No Vol was in double figures in the first period.\nThe 27 points were a season-low first half for the Vols.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-11T21:13:26.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
