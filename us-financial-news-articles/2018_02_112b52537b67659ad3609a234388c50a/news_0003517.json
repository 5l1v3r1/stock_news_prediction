Revenues were up, expenses were almost flat, and Aimco achieved NOI growth greater than 4% for the 7th year in a row. The quality of the Aimco portfolio improved through value created by our redevelopment and transaction activities, contributing to average revenue per apartment home of $2,123, up 7%.\n“In 2018, we expect consumer demand for apartments to be strong, supported by favorable demographics and an accelerating economy. The diversification of the Aimco portfolio provides a hedge against elevated supply in some markets. We expect Aimco’s investment in redevelopment and development activities to increase Net Asset Value and to contribute to future earnings growth.”\nChief Financial Officer Paul Beldin adds: “2017 AFFO of $2.12 per share met the midpoint of our guidance range, Pro forma FFO of $2.45 per share was $0.01 ahead of the midpoint of guidance, and Same Store NOI growth was comfortably within our guidance range. The Aimco balance sheet is safe and strong with abundant liquidity and with minimal borrowings on our $600 million revolving credit facility.\n“In 2018, Aimco expects earnings from our Same Store, Redevelopment and Other Real Estate portfolios to add $0.10 per share to AFFO. This earnings growth will be offset somewhat by lower earnings from the planned and continuing wind down of our Asset Management business and lower income tax benefits due to the recent tax law change. We anticipate Pro forma FFO per share in a range of $2.42 to $2.52 and AFFO per share in a range of $2.11 to $2.21.”\nFinancial Results: Full Year Pro forma FFO Up 6%; AFFO Up 8%\nFOURTH QUARTER FULL YEAR (all items per common share - diluted) 2017 2016 Variance 2017 2016 Variance Net income $ 1.67 $ 1.03 62 % $ 1.96 $ 2.67 (27 %) Funds From Operations (FFO) $ 0.63 $ 0.60 5 % $ 2.45 $ 2.31 6 % Add back Aimco share of preferred equity redemption related amounts $ — $ — — % $ — $ 0.01 (100 %) Pro forma Funds From Operations (Pro forma FFO) $ 0.63 $ 0.60 5 % $ 2.45 $ 2.32 6 % Deduct Aimco share of Capital Replacements $ (0.07 ) $ (0.10 ) (30 %) $ (0.33 ) $ (0.35 ) (6 %) Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) $ 0.56 $ 0.50 12 % $ 2.12 $ 1.97 8 % Net Income (per diluted common share) - Year-over-year, fourth quarter net income increased primarily due to higher gains on the sale of apartment communities.\nPro forma FFO (per diluted common share) - Aimco’s fourth quarter Pro forma FFO increased by $0.03 per share, or 5%, on a year-over-year basis. Property results contributed the following to Pro forma FFO:\n$0.02 from Same Store Property Net Operating Income growth of 3.1%, driven by a 2.8% increase in revenue, offset by a 2.1% increase in expenses; and $0.01 from the lease-up over the last 12 months of more than 800 renovated homes at Redevelopment communities and completion of the lease-up of One Canal in Boston, Massachusetts and Indigo in Redwood City, California; offset by ($0.03) lower Property Net Operating Income from apartment communities sold in 2016.\nAs compared to 2016, lower interest rates, higher transactional income, and other factors contributed an additional $0.03 to Pro forma FFO.\nThe results above exclude Property Net Operating Income from the second quarter reacquisition of the 47% interest in the Palazzo communities, which was largely offset by higher interest expense related to temporary borrowings used to fund the purchase.\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (per diluted common share) - The $0.03 increase year-over-year in Pro forma FFO per share plus $0.03 in lower capital replacement spending due to fewer apartment homes increased AFFO per share by $0.06, or 12%.\nOperating Results: Fourth Quarter Same Store NOI Up 3.1%; Full Year Up 4.2%\nFOURTH QUARTER FULL YEAR Year-over-Year Sequential Year-over-Year 2017 2016 Variance 3rd Qtr.

Newly executed leases are classified either as a new lease, where a vacant apartment is leased to a new customer, or as a renewal.

Aimco invests in this line of business when it believes the investment will yield risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in paired trades to fund these construction projects. Aimco favors redevelopment because it permits adjustment of the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions. Aimco also undertakes ground-up development of apartment communities when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Aimco invested $51 million in redevelopment and development. In Center City, Philadelphia, Aimco completed de-leasing of and commenced construction on the fourth and final tower of Park Towne Place. Lease-up of this tower is scheduled to commence in the spring of 2018. At December 31, 2017, the first three towers combined were 89% leased with approximately 40 homes remaining to lease at the third tower in order to reach stabilized occupancy.\nAs previously announced, Aimco is developing Parc Mosaic, a $117 million, 226 apartment home community located in Boulder, Colorado on the site of its former Eastpointe apartment community. During the fourth quarter, Aimco completed de-leasing of Eastpointe and commenced demolition and construction.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Aimco leased 103 apartment homes at its redevelopment communities. At December 31, 2017, Aimco’s lease-up exposure at active redevelopment and development projects included approximately 611 apartment homes, 232 of which were in the fourth tower of Park Towne Place and 215 were in Parc Mosaic.\nPortfolio Management: Revenue Per Apartment Home Up 7% to $2,123\nAimco portfolio strategy seeks predictable rent growth from a portfolio of apartment communities that is diversified across “A,” “B” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality, and that is also diversified across the largest markets in the U.S. Please refer to the Glossary for a description of Aimco Portfolio Quality Ratings.\nAs part of its portfolio strategy, Aimco seeks to sell each year up to 10% of the apartment communities in its portfolio and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in uses such as property upgrades, redevelopment of communities in its current portfolio, occasional development of new communities, and selective acquisitions of apartment communities with projected free cash flow returns higher than expected from the communities sold to fund the activity. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, Aimco has significantly increased the quality and expected growth rate of its portfolio.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 2016 Variance Apartment Communities 136 141 (5 ) Apartment Homes 36,904 39,161 (2,257 ) Revenue per Apartment Home $ 2,123 $ 1,981 7 % Portfolio Average Rents as a Percentage of Local Market Average Rents 113 % 112 % 1 % Percentage A (4Q 2017 Revenue per Apartment Home $2,707) 53 % 51 % 2 % Percentage B (4Q 2017 Revenue per Apartment Home $1,848) 32 % 36 % (4 %) Percentage C+ (4Q 2017 Revenue per Apartment Home $1,721) 15 % 13 % 2 % NOI Margin 70 % 69 % 1 % Free Cash Flow Margin 65 % 64 % 1 % Fourth Quarter Real Estate Portfolio - For its entire portfolio, Aimco’s average monthly revenue per apartment home was $2,123 for fourth quarter 2017, a 7% increase compared to fourth quarter 2016. This increase is due to year-over-year growth in Same Store revenue as well as Aimco’s second quarter reacquisition of the 47% interest in the Palazzo communities, lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition properties, and the sale of apartment communities with average monthly revenues per apartment home lower than those of the retained portfolio.\nDispositions - In the fourth quarter, Aimco sold five lower-rated apartment communities with 2,291 apartment homes for a gain of $298 million and gross proceeds of $397 million resulting in $381 million in net proceeds to Aimco. Two of these properties are affordable communities located in Washington, DC and Philadelphia, and three are located in southern New Jersey and southern Virginia.\nIn January 2018, Aimco agreed to sell its interests in the entities owning the La Jolla Cove property in settlement of legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers who had hoped to acquire the property. As a result of the settlement, Aimco recognized in its 2017 results a gross impairment loss of $35.8 million, $25.6 million of which relates to the establishment of a deferred tax liability assumed at acquisition. Upon closing of the transaction, the tax liability will be assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss to Aimco. The remaining $10.2 million accounting loss is offset by cash distributions paid to Aimco during its ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation.\nOn an economic basis, Aimco agreed to sell the entity at roughly its purchase price, adjusted for retained cash distributions and avoided legal costs.\nAlso in January 2018, Aimco sold three additional apartment communities with 513 apartment homes for a gain of approximately $50 million, net of tax, and gross proceeds of $72 million resulting in $65 million in net proceeds to Aimco. Two of these communities are located in southern Virginia and one is located in suburban Maryland.\nProceeds from the 2017 and 2018 sales were used to repay outstanding borrowings on Aimco’s revolving credit facility, effectively funding the equity portion of the Palazzo reacquisition as well as Aimco’s 2017 redevelopment and development activities.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAimco Leverage\nAimco targets net leverage of $3.8 billion. As of the end of the year, Aimco’s leverage was above this target due to the timing of three apartment community sales discussed above, which closed in January 2018.\nNon-recourse Property Debt - During the fourth quarter, Aimco closed or rate-locked two non-recourse, fixed-rate property loans totaling $189 million. On a weighted average basis, these loans have a 7.7 year term and an interest rate of 3.48%, 117 basis points above the corresponding treasury rates at the time of pricing.\nThe net effect of 2017 property debt refinancing activities has been to lower Aimco’s weighted average fixed interest rates by about 20 basis points to 4.64%.\nAimco leverage includes Aimco’s share of long-term, non-recourse, property debt secured by apartment communities, a term loan, outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility, and outstanding preferred equity. Aimco leverage excludes non-recourse property debt obligations of consolidated partnerships served by its Asset Management business (described further in the Glossary). Please refer to Supplemental Schedule 5(a) for the presentation of Aimco leverage and a reconciliation of Aimco proportionate leverage to Aimco’s consolidated leverage.\nAS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 $ in Millions Amount % of Total Weighted Avg.\nMaturity (Yrs.)\nAimco share of long-term, non-recourse property debt $ 3,553 87% 7.2 Term loan 250 6% 0.5 Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility 67 2% 4.1 Preferred Equity* 227 5% 40.0 Total leverage $ 4,097 100% 8.5 Cash, restricted cash and investments in securitization trust assets (176 ) Net Leverage $ 3,921 * Aimco’s Preferred Equity is perpetual in nature; however, for illustrative purposes, Aimco has computed the weighted average maturity of its total leverage assuming a 40-year maturity for its Preferred Equity. Leverage Ratios\nAimco target leverage ratios are Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA below 7.0x and Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Aimco also focuses on the ratios of Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense. Please see the Glossary for definitions of these non-GAAP measures and, where appropriate, reconciliations to the nearest GAAP measure.\nAimco calculates Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Interest Expense used in its leverage ratios based on current quarter amounts, annualized.\nFOURTH\nQUARTER 2017\nProportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA 6.5x Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA 6.9x Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense 3.3x Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends 3.1x Aimco’s leverage ratios have been adjusted on a pro forma basis to reflect the disposition of five apartment communities during the period as if the sales had closed on October 1, 2017. The effect of this pro forma adjustment may be found in the Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in the Glossary.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2017, Aimco held cash and restricted cash of $95 million and had available capacity to borrow $521 million under its revolving credit facility, after consideration of outstanding borrowings of $67 million and $12 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. Aimco uses its credit facility primarily for working capital and other short-term purposes and to secure letters of credit.\nAimco also held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2017.\nDividend - As previously announced, the Aimco Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share of Class A Common Stock for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. On an annualized basis, this represents an increase of 6% compared to the dividends paid during 2017. This dividend is payable on February 28, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 16, 2018.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Aimco strategy remains unchanged: focusing on excellence in property operations; value creation through redevelopment and occasional development; portfolio management based on a disciplined approach to capital recycling; a safe, flexible balance sheet with abundant liquidity; and a simple business model executed by a performance-oriented and collaborative team. Aimco executes this consistent strategy with an eye on sustainable long-term growth.\nComponents of 2017 to 2018 AFFO Growth\n(At the midpoint of guidance range)\n2017 AFFO per Share $ 2.12 Same Store & Other Real Estate 0.09 Redevelopment & Development 0.05 Sales to Fund Capital Investments (0.04 ) Tax Benefits (0.04 ) Contribution from Asset Management (0.03 ) Offsite Costs & Other 0.01 2018 AFFO per Share $ 2.16 Aimco expects 2018 Pro forma FFO per share in the range of $2.42 to $2.52 with AFFO per share of $2.11 to $2.21. At the guidance range midpoint, Aimco’s projected 2018 AFFO growth of 2% reflects:\n$0.14 per share growth from its core business of market-rate apartment ownership and Redevelopment and Development; $0.01 per share of growth from lower offsite costs and lower casualties; and income lost from apartment communities sold to fund redevelopment and development activity ($0.04 per share), lower tax benefits primarily from the effect of the recent tax law change ($0.04 per share), and planned lower income from the wind down of Aimco’s Asset Management business ($0.03 per share).\nAimco is engaged in litigation with Airbnb to protect Aimco’s property right to select its residents and their neighbors. Due the unpredictable nature of these cases and associated legal costs, Aimco will exclude such costs from 2018 Pro forma FFO and AFFO.\nAimco projects its Same Store portfolio to provide NOI growth in the range of 1.70% to 3.10%, resulting from revenue growth in the range of 2.10% to 3.10% and expense growth between 2.60% and 3.60%. At the midpoint, Aimco expects revenue growth of 2.60%, comprised of average daily occupancy 10 basis points higher than 2017 and lease rate growth of 2.50%, based on blended lease rates similar to 2017. At the midpoint, Aimco expects expenses to increase by 3.10%, of which 110 basis points is due to the increase in real estate taxes compared to 2017 taxes that were lowered by successful appeals, and higher property hazard insurance costs resulting from worldwide casualty events in 2017.\n($ Amounts represent Aimco Share)\nFULL YEAR 2018 FULL YEAR 2017 Net Income per share $0.36 to $0.46 $1.96 Pro forma FFO per share $2.42 to $2.52 $2.45 AFFO per share $2.11 to $2.21 $2.12 Select Components of FFO Same Store Operating Measures Revenue change compared to prior year 2.10% to 3.10% 3.20% Expense change compared to prior year 2.60% to 3.60% 0.70% NOI change compared to prior year 1.70% to 3.10% 4.20% Asset Management and Other Earnings Asset Management Contribution $36M $41M\nTax Benefits [1] $16M to $18M $23M Offsite Costs Property management expenses $20M $21M General and administrative expenses $44M $44M Total Offsite Costs $64M $65M Capital Investments Redevelopment/Development $120M to $200M $172M Property upgrades $80M to $100M $101M Transactions Property dispositions - Real Estate [2] $180M to $220M $381M Property acquisitions $0M $452M Portfolio Quality Average revenue per apartment home ~$2,175 $2,123 Balance Sheet Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ~6.5x 6.5x Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDA ~6.9x 6.9x [1] 2017 tax benefits as shown above exclude a $0.5 million deferred tax revaluation adjustment recognized as a result of the recent tax reform legislation, which is excluded from Aimco’s calculation of Pro forma FFO and AFFO.

As a result of the settlement, Aimco recognized in its 2017 results a gross impairment loss of $35.8 million, $25.6 million of which relates to the establishment of a deferred tax liability assumed at acquisition. Upon closing of the transaction, the tax liability will be assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss to Aimco. The remaining $10.2 million accounting loss is offset by cash distributions paid to Aimco during its ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation. On an economic basis, Aimco agreed to sell the entity at roughly its purchase price, adjusted for retained cash distributions and avoided legal costs.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands) (unaudited) December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nAssets Real estate $ 7,927,753 $ 7,931,117 Accumulated depreciation (2,522,358 ) (2,421,357 ) Net real estate 5,405,395 5,509,760 Cash and cash equivalents 60,498 45,821 Restricted cash 34,827 36,405 Goodwill 37,808 37,808 Other assets 234,931 255,960 Assets held for sale 17,959 — Assets of partnerships served by Asset Management business: Real estate, net 224,873 245,648 Cash and cash equivalents 16,288 15,423 Restricted cash 30,928 33,501 Other assets 15,533 52,492 Total Assets $ 6,079,040 $ 6,232,818 Liabilities and Equity Non-recourse property debt secured by Aimco Real Estate communities $ 3,563,041 $ 3,648,623 Debt issue costs (17,932 ) (18,347 ) Non-recourse property debt, net 3,545,109 3,630,276 Term loan, net 249,501 — Revolving credit facility borrowings 67,160 17,930 Accrued liabilities and other 200,540 218,937 Liabilities of partnerships served by Asset Management business: Non-recourse property debt, net 227,141 236,426 Accrued liabilities and other 19,812 62,630 Deferred income [1] 12,487 18,452 Total Liabilities 4,321,750 4,184,651 Preferred noncontrolling interests in Aimco OP 101,537 103,201 Equity: Perpetual preferred stock 125,000 125,000 Class A Common Stock 1,572 1,569 Additional paid-in capital 3,900,042 4,051,722 Accumulated other comprehensive income 3,603 1,011 Distributions in excess of earnings (2,367,073 ) (2,385,399 ) Total Aimco equity 1,663,144 1,793,903 Noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships (1,716 ) 151,121 Common noncontrolling interests in Aimco OP (5,675 ) (58 ) Total equity 1,655,753 1,944,966 Total liabilities and equity $ 6,079,040 $ 6,232,818 [1] Deferred income primarily represents cash received by Aimco and other amounts required by GAAP to be recognized in earnings in future periods as Aimco performs certain responsibilities under tax credit agreements or as other events occur.
