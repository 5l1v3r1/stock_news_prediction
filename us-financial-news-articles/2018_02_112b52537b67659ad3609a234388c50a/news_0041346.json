It also announced an interim dividend of 7.5 cents per share, the same as last year.\nBiswas added that the firm had funneled capital into a turnaround plan at its loss-making Telfer mine in the state of Western Australia, installing new management and exploring for new lodes underground.\nHe also said the miner was in regular talks with the Indonesian government regarding its contract of work (COW) for its Gosowong mine which runs out in 2029. Indonesia has been renegotiating with miners to obtain a higher equity stake in their operations.\n“We’re sitting down in good faith with the government and we’ll talk it through ... if the case is, in the end, there has to be a selldown to a certain number, as long as it’s done at fair value then that’s something we’ll address at the time.”\nShares in Newcrest had dropped 3.4 percent to A$22.26 by 0103 GMT, and were the worst performer in a weaker mining sector on the Australian stock exchange.\nThe company’s $116 million profit in the last half was below a forecast of $143 million based on the average of three estimates in a poll of analysts. Operations were also hit by unplanned maintenance at Newcrest’s Papua New Guinea mine.\nThe firm said on Thursday that its cost of production on an “all-in sustaining basis” ticked up about 12 percent, reflecting the lower volume contribution from Cadia.\n“This feels very much like an ‘on the right track’ result for us, with the numbers broadly as we anticipated and outlook commentary also reiterating our current understanding of future output and ongoing technical studies,” RBC said in a report.
