The drug’s launch is now unlikely before 2019.\n“The earlier than expected authorisation (of Glatopa) and commercial launch might add an estimated $200 million to Sandoz’ 2018 top line, translating in a low-single-digit divisional growth,” said Baader Helvea analyst Bruno Bulic.\n“We see ... Glatopa 40mg offsetting the Advair setback and reiterate our buy rating.”\nNovartis developed Glatopa with Massachusetts-based Momenta Pharmaceuticals.\nTeva last week forecast sales of Copaxone would fall to $1.8 billion in 2018 from $3.8 billion last year.\n“We have anticipated and planned for a second generic Copaxone to enter the market in 2018,” Teva said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “We remain committed to providing Teva’s Copaxone 40 mg to patients and continuing to support our patients.”\nFIRST TO MARKET The Pfizer plant problems scuttled plans to have the larger Glatopa dosage on sale first in 2017, allowing Mylan to muscle in on lucrative market share with its quicker-to-market Copaxone copy.\nPfizer said last month that the FDA had upgraded the compliance status of its Kansas facility, clearing the way for the Novartis-Momenta medicine.\nOverall, Sandoz has been a drag on Novartis results in recent months, with its pills portfolio particularly sensitive to U.S. price pressure. The division’s sales fell 1 percent last year to $10.1 billion and Novartis expects sales to be dented by stagnating or declining revenue at Sandoz in 2018.\nNovartis is reviewing Sandoz’s U.S. pills business for a potential disposal and aims to focus on more complex injectible drugs in its generics portfolio, such as Glatopa, as well as biosimilars.\n“The approval and launch of Glatopa 40 mg/mL reinforces our leadership in delivering complex, differentiated generic products,” Sandoz head Richard Francis said in a statement.\nAdditional reporting by John Revill and by Tova Cohen in Tel Aviv; Editing by David Goodman and Jane Merriman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T09:19:39.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
