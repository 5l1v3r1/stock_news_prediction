A key puzzle for investors in 2018: How aggressive will the Federal Reserve be in raising interest rates? In his first appearance on Capitol Hill since taking over as Fed chief, the man who may supply the answer, Jerome Powell, conveyed an upbeat picture of the U.S. economy, indicating the central bank is on track to keep gradually lifting short-term rates. But his optimism wasn’t matched in the markets, with major indexes snapping their winning streaks and U.S. government bond prices weakening . Many investors took Mr. Powell’s comments as a sign of increased odds the Fed could lift its benchmark federal-funds rate four times in 2018, up from the three moves penciled in by officials in December. Mr. Powell said employers have continued to add jobs—180,000 a month on average over the past six months—and unemployment remains at a 17-year-low. Inflation, which has undershot the Fed’s 2% target for years, is also showing signs of accelerating and should reach the goal in coming years, he said. Bond yields have risen as a result, threatening to diminish the allure of high-dividend stocks. More than a fifth of the companies in the S&P 500 have boosted their dividends to shareholders so far this year, while no firms have slashed their payouts, a first since 2011, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nAxis of Evil North Korea shipped 50 tons of supplies to Syria for use in building what is suspected to be an industrial-scale chemical-weapons factory, according to a confidential United Nations report. A Chinese trading firm working on behalf of Pyongyang made five shipments in late 2016 and early 2017 of high-heat, acid-resistant tiles, stainless-steel pipes and valves to Damascus, the report said, citing them as evidence that Syria is paying North Korea to help the country produce chemical arms. Pyongyang’s weapons-related sales—estimated to be worth several billion dollars a year—undercut Washington’s “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against North Korea meant to thwart its nuclear-weapons program. U.S. officials have warned Syria of a possible military response to the regime’s increased use of chemical weapons against civilians. The latest details of the North Korean-Syrian military venture come as the demise of Islamic State intensifies a scramble among foreign powers in Syria , raising the risk that diverging strategic and commercial interests could lead to a wider regional war.\nRestricted Access The White House downgraded the security clearance of senior adviser Jared Kushner as part of White House chief of staff John Kelly’s push to tighten control of classified information inside the Trump administration. The change comes at a time of mounting tensions between Mr. Kelly and the president’s family in the White House. Mr. Kushner, who is also President Trump’s son-in-law and the husband of White House adviser Ivanka Trump, has played a central role in crafting policy regarding China, Mexico and Canada. He has also, until now, had access to the president’s daily brief, a top-secret intelligence report. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump have chafed under the staff chief’s initial reorganization of the West Wing that restricted their access to the president. Mr. Kelly’s changes to the security-clearance process put him on a direct collision course with Mr. Kushner. More than a dozen top officials, including Mr. Kushner, have held interim clearances for more than a year, the Journal previously reported.\nWall Street to Main Street Goldman Sachs, better known as an elite adviser to big companies and billionaires, is pushing into businesses it once dismissed as pedestrian and gimmicky, assembling a suite of banking products for the middle class it hopes will power growth. In a glass-walled tower in Utah’s capital, hundreds of Goldman employees are building what amounts to one of the world’s most ambitious consumer-finance startups. Initiatives under way include checkout-counter loans for shoppers, wealth-management and household-budgeting tools for the masses, as well as insurance, mortgages and car loans. Goldman 18 months ago began making online loans of a few thousand dollars under the brand Marcus, named after founder Marcus Goldman. Individuals once needed $10 million to get the attention of Goldman’s elite private bankers. Today, customers can open a Marcus savings account with as little as $1.\nReading Habits What do you like to read? Breaking out of one’s literary comfort zone can be intimidating. But publishing professionals and readers who regularly flick between genres say you can find a new groove by looking to reliable sources and closely examining your literary habits. Lists of top books by genre are a good place to start. Recommendations from friends and family whose taste you trust, and considering carefully why you love the books that you do can also help push you into unexpected corners of the book world. “For people who read romance, it’s not that they only like love stories, it’s how it makes them feel,” says Gwen Glazer, a librarian at New York Public Library, noting that those books often evoke cozy or hopeful emotions. “There are lots of books outside that genre that will make you feel that way.”\nToday’s Video The Wall Street Journal Warning Signs: A Theory of America on the Edge Does the rise in suicide rates among white Americans signal an emerging crisis for U.S. capitalism and democracy?

Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Phil Nobile\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on legislation U.S. lawmakers should enact in the wake of the Florida school shooting , Barry Rose of Nebraska said: “What we saw in Florida was a total breakdown on the part of the FBI and local law enforcement. This unstable individual with a history of violence should have been in the system instead of given a pass by those entrusted to serve and protect. There’s always a desire to do something after a senseless act like this, instead of getting to the root of the problem. Government needs to take a deep breath, step back and not succumb to the shouts from the antigun crowd.” Ed Van Dorn of New Quote: : “A good start would be a ban on all assault weapons, raise the age limit to buy firearms to 21, and implement universal background checks making uniform and readily accessible all registries of those prohibited from possessing firearms. As for the argument that guns are inanimate objects and therefore need no regulation, the same could be said for a needle full of heroin.” And Paula Hines of Tennessee replied: “Of course, background checks should be strengthened, mental-health issues must be dealt with and age limits for assault weapons should be on the table. But school campus and building security are items that could be addressed immediately. Outside of Virginia Tech and Columbine (are there others?), the school shooters had no business stepping foot on campus let alone inside the building. I am more secure where I work than my children are. Until the schools are treated as fortresses, schoolchildren will continue to be sitting ducks.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories.
