But it postponed the action because commissioners have splintered over the scope of the rollback, people familiar with the matter said. The SEC said in a notice posted Thursday that it anticipates holding a vote in the future. \nThe revisions would represent the first time a major securities rule passed during the Obama administration has come under the knife of Trump administration appointees at the commission. The SEC finished the measure toward the end of the Obama presidency, following the meltdown of a $789 million mutual fund with a high concentration of holdings in junk bonds and distressed debt. \nThe SEC is now weighing whether to allow funds to keep private their quarterly estimates of how much of their portfolio includes hard-to-sell debt or other securities, these people said. The data would still have to be shared with regulators.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:00:55.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
