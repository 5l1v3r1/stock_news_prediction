The difference now is that Portugal has been put on the map.”\nThe Portuguese economy grew 2.6 percent last year, the highest pace in at least a decade, partly thanks to the real estate and tourism sectors.\n$1 = 0.8026 euros Reporting by Patricia Rua; writing by Axel Bugge; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T14:55:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
