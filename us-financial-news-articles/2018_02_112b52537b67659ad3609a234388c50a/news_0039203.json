It is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThis draft guidance “gives the field more confidence in being bold about the trials that we design and then carry out,” Carrillo said. “It’s going to be really important.”\nReporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles and Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T02:07:06.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
