But “buy two, get one free” discounts would still be allowed, Travert said.\nEight months into Macron’s presidency, the move shows the new government’s interventionist instincts despite the 40-year old president’s campaign promises to cut red tape and liberalise the French economy.\nBut it comes after hefty discounts of up to 70 percent on products such as Nutella, a chocolate-and-hazelnut spread very popular in France, caused brawls in a chain of supermarkets last week.\nOn Wednesday, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he had complained to the chief executive of the Intermarché supermarket chain, where shoppers again fought over discounted products earlier this week, this time for diapers and coffee.\n“I told him this can’t happen again, that we can’t see these kind of scenes in France every five minutes,” Le Maire said.\nIntermarché did not immediately return a request for comment.\nSelling at a loss is forbidden in France. The new measures, which also include a 10 percent increase in the regulated threshold at which retailers are allowed to sell a product, will be put in place for a trial period of two years.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:26:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
