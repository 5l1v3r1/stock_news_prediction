On Friday, it tumbled by 666 points or 2.5 percent. The index closed the week down 1,095 points. \n\"When you get that 10 percent correction for investors, which is really just a day in the park... it's going to feel like 20 or 25 percent,\" the portfolio manager said recently on CNBC's \" Futures Now .\" \nA textbook correction, defined as 10 percent or more, hasn't been seen since August 2015. \nIf a 10 percent pullback were to hit the Dow right now, it would wipe out about 2552 points more, based on Friday's close. Two years ago, a sell-off of the same magnitude would have cost the Dow nearly 1000 points less. \nGlazer says he's been fielding plenty of investor about rising volatility and recent market losses in the past few days. \n\"We had investors saying to us 'Is this it? Is this the big one?' So, investors are not conditioned,\" he added. Fear vs. Greed \nGlazer, whose firm has more than $2.5 billion dollars in assets under management, points to conflicting dynamics involving greed gripping the markets. \nLonger-term, Glazer sees a fundamentally bullish backdrop for the stock market. His winning strategy is to avoid the \"same old thing that's been working\" such as FANG stocks Facebook , Amazon , Netflix and Alphabet (Google.) \n\"Investors fear being a sucker by missing the FANG stocks. And, on the other hand, investors fear they're going to get caught holding the bag if you get that inevitable 10 percent correction,\" he said. \nGlazer's top picks include small cap value stocks and commodities. They have been picking up momentum over the past six months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T00:29:34.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
