Once that happens it becomes difficult for us to offer good protection. They have now said it publicly.” \nTrack and field athlete Yulia Stepanova and her husband Vitaly, who went public about doping in Russia back in 2014, has accused WADA of doing nothing after they had tried for years to pass on information to the anti-doping body. \nAs a result Russia’s track and field team was banned from the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016 and Russia was banned from the Pyeongchang winter Olympics starting on Friday, with the athletes competing as neutrals under the Olympic flag.

We are not equipped for that and only law enforcement has those capabilities.” Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:33:21.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
