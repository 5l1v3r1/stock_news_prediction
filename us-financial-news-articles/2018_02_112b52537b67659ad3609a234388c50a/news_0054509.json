Minutes of the latest monetary policy meeting showed Mexico's central bank board members are concerned about persistent inflation pressures and risks that the local currency could be hammered, adding to consumer price pressures. Mexico's peso strengthened 1.15 percent on Thursday even as consumer prices in Latin America's second largest economy rose less than expected in early February. \"The probability that Banco de Mexico keeps hiking the key interest rate is still high,\" said Gabriela Siller, head of economic analysis at Banco BASE. Meanwhile, Chile's peso gained nearly 0.5 percent, while the Colombian peso rose 0.65 percent as the greenback fell against a basket of international currencies. Stock markets in Latin America were mostly higher, with Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index rising for a seventh straight session. Bank Banco do Brasil rose more than 4 percent after posting strong quarterly earnings.
