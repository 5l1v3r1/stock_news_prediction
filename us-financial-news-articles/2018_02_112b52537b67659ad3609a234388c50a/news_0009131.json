I don’t see why I wouldn’t be back.”\nThe strip-sack play with a little over two minutes left and his team down five points overshadowed his Super Bowl record 505 yards passing. He completed 28 of 48 passes with three touchdowns and no turnovers, moving the ball so well that the Patriots never punted.\nFor all his success, though, two failed plays will stand out in Sunday’s loss.\nOn the strip sack, he dropped back to pass and came under pressure, with Philadelphia linebacker Brandon Graham knocking the ball loose and Philadelphia’s Derek Barnett recovering and advancing the ball to the Patriots’s 31-yard line.\nThat led to a Eagles field goal and an eight-point lead that held for the rest of the game.\n“Those guys had a good rush and got it there and made a good play,” Brady said. “They made a good play at the right time.”\nIn another rare flop, he went out as a receiver on a trick play on third down in the second quarter but could not haul in the pass from receiver Danny Amendola, which was just beyond his reach.\nNFL Football - Philadelphia Eagles v New England Patriots - Super Bowl LII - U.S. Bank Stadium, Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. - February 4, 2018 New England Patriots' Tom Brady walks off dejected after the game REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Brady handed off to running back James White, who pitched it to Amendola on what appeared to be a reverse while Brady sneaked out into the flat, wide open. A catch would have resulted in a first down. Instead, it bounced off his outstretched hands.\n“Danny made a good throw. I just didn’t make the play,” Brady said.\nAsked if he caught the pass in practice, he said: “Yeah, I caught it. Didn’t catch it tonight.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) Dominant as the Patriots have been since Brady’s first championship after the 2001 season, he said: “No one is going to feel sorry for us.”\nNor will they feel sorry for Brady, who is revered in New England and in 2009 married Brazilian-born model Gisele Bundchen, the mother of their two children.\nBrady has attributed his longevity in part to a strict diet of largely organic, plant-based foods, avoiding those he says contribute to muscle inflammation, while drinking 12 to 25 glasses of water per day, including 20 ounces (60 cl) fortified with electrolytes first thing in the morning.\nHe says he goes to sleep at 8:30 p.m.\nFor now, he will have the off-season to contemplate how the Patriots will return to football’s center stage.\n“We’ll evaluate like we always do,” he said. “I‘m pretty sure everyone is tired after a long year.”\nReporting by Daniel Trotta; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T09:13:24.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
