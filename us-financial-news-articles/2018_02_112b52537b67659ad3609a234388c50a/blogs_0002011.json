Revenue dropped 19 percent to 5.7 billion euros in the fourth quarter, while the net loss widened to 2.19 billion euros from 1.89 billion in the year-earlier period. \nBoth figures were weaker than consensus, with analysts on average forecasting 6.2 billion euros in revenue and a 1.95 billion euro loss, according to a Reuters poll. \nRevenue at Deutsche Bank’s cash-cow bond-trading division dropped by 29 percent due to lower client activity in less volatile markets. Competitors have seen similar declines.
