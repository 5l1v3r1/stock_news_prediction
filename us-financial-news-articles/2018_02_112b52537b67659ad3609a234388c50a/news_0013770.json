The proposal provides that the restructuring would not take place if the closing price of the Company's shares has been at or above $2 during that period. If the closing price during that period has been between $1 and $2, then the Board of Directors may at its sole discretion decide on whether or not the restructuring shall take place.The 10-to-1 reverse split would be carried out through the statutory merger of Auris Medical Holding AG into a wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary which would assume the name of the former and the listing on Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's shares would continue trading under the ticker symbol \"EARS\".\nElections to the Board of Directors\nShareholders will be asked at the EGM to vote on several other corporate matters, including the election of the members of the Board of Directors for the term up to the ordinary General Meeting 2019. It is proposed to re-elect Thomas Meyer (Chairman), Armando Anido, Calvin Roberts and Mats Blom and to elect Alain Munoz as a new member. Oliver Kubli and Berndt Modig will not be standing for re-election.\n\"We would like to thank Oliver and Berndt for their great contributions to our company,\" commented Thomas Meyer, Auris Medical's founder, Chairman and CEO. \"At the same time, we are delighted to propose the election of Alain Munoz to our Board of Directors. Alain has built a great track record in key roles with several European biotech and pharmaceutical companies and knows our company well from having served on its Board already between 2007 and 2015.\"\nA copy of the invitation to the EGM, including detailed information on the conditional capital restructuring, is available on the Company's website www.aurismedical.com in the Investors section.\nThe Board of Directors may choose to cancel the EGM in the event that compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price rule is achieved prior to the EGM or shortly thereafter, in which case the Board of Directors would call an ordinary General Meeting instead to vote on the general agenda items.\nAbout Auris Medical\nAuris Medical is a Swiss biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing therapeutics that address important unmet medical needs in neurotology.
