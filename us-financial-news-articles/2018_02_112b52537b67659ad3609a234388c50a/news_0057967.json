REUTERS/James Akena/File Photo Kabila is facing mounting pressure in the streets to organize prompt elections. Security forces killed at least two people at a church-led march on Sunday. More than a dozen protesters have been killed since December.\nPolice said on Monday that an officer had been arrested for violating orders by firing a rubber bullet at a protester from too close a range - less than 20 meters (yards), killing him.\nHowever, a doctor at the hospital where the man, pro-democracy activist Rossy Mukendi, died on Sunday, told Reuters he had been hit in the heart by a bullet that had entered and exited his body.\nThe statement by Botswana, one of Africa’s most stable democracies, urged “the international community to put more pressure on the leadership in the Democratic Republic of Congo to relinquish power and pave way for the ushering in of a new political dispensation”.\nKabila denies he is trying to cling to power but has refused to publicly rule out trying to change the constitution to remove term limits that prevent him from running for re-election, as the presidents of neighboring Congo Republic and Rwanda have done.\nCongo’s political turmoil has emboldened the dozens of militia groups that operate in its mineral-rich eastern borderlands.\nFifteen civilians and seven militiamen were killed in two separate attacks on Sunday and Monday by the Hutu-dominated Nyatura militia, local administrator Hope Sabini told Reuters.\nThe Nyatura fighters were going after a Nande-dominated militia called Mai Mai Mazembe in the villages of Kalusi and Bwalanda, Sabini said.\nReporting by Fiston Mahamba; Additional reporting by Patient Ligodi and Amedee Mwarabu; Writing by Sofia Christensen; Editing by Aaron Ross and Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T18:53:51.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
