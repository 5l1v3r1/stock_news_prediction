The transaction is subject to the satisfactory completion of certain due diligence requirements, purchase price adjustments at closing and the receipt of required governmental and regulatory approvals.\nHana Financial’s sale of its SBA Lending business is a part of its strategic plan to focus on the firm’s factoring and asset based lending businesses. In 2017, Hana Financial was one of the top ten largest factoring service providers in the nation with approximately $1.5 billion in factored volume.
