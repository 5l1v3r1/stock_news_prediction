A U.S.-led coalition supported the Iraqi forces, especially in the battle to dislodge them from Mosul, their de facto capital in northern Iraq, in July. \nIraq reopened to foreign investment in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, but the vast majority of the billions of dollars invested went to increasing its oil and natural gas production. \nIt has become the second-largest crude exporter of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, after Saudi Arabia, with a daily output of 4.4 million barrels.
