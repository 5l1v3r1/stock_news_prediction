May it go well, may the souls of our saintly martyrs rejoice,” Ankara Mayor Mustafa Tuna tweeted.\nThe proposal will be presented to the municipal parliament later on Monday, he said. It will most likely be approved, just days before U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to visit Ankara on Thursday.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ankara and the Ankara mayor’s office were not immediately available for comment.\nAccording to a poll published on Monday by the Center for American Progress, 83 percent of Turks view the United States unfavorably, and 46 percent think their country should do more to confront it.\nTuna had ordered the re-naming of the street where the United Arab Emirates mission is located to that of the Ottoman former governor of Medina, following a row between the two countries about the state of the holy city under Ottoman rule.\nWriting by Ali Kucukgocmen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:20:48.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
