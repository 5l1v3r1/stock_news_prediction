The CDC does not require national reporting of flu deaths in adults. \n“I wish there were better news this week, but almost everything we’re looking at is bad news,” Schuchat said. “There have been far too many heart-wrenching stories in recent weeks about families who have lost loved ones to influenza.” \nIt was unclear whether the outbreak had reached its peak yet or if it would get worse, she said. Previous outbreaks had lasted between 11 and 20 weeks, and the current outbreak was in its 11th week, she said. \nThe number of people hospitalized for flu-like illnesses is the highest the CDC has seen since starting its current tracking system in 2010. \nThe dominant flu strain this season, influenza A (H3N2), is especially potent, linked with severe disease and death, particularly among children and the elderly. \nThe outbreak has reached almost every corner of the country, with every state except Hawaii and Oregon reporting widespread flu, Schuchat said. \nShe urged sick people to stay home and said it is still not too late for people to get a flu vaccine, which offers some protection.
