So we’re expanding.’ Alliance’s CEO Joe Craft told analysts recently \nExports of U.S. thermal coal used by utilities rose 117% to 42 million tons last year. That more than offset the 11-million-ton decline in coal used at U.S. power plants, which fell to 667.5 million tons last year, from 678.6 million tons in 2016. Coal accounted for 30% of U.S. electricity generation in 2016, compared with nearly 34% for natural gas. \nThe stronger export market is translating into a bump in coal-mining jobs. Last year, coal companies added nearly 1,000 jobs, a trickle compared with the 60,000 workers who lost mining jobs between 2011 and 2016. \nCoal producer Alliance Resource Partners LP ARLP, -0.28% plans to reopen an underground mine in rural Gibson County, Ind. that the company shut in 2015. The mine employed 417 miners in late 2014. \nThe export opportunities come from a tightening of global supply, attractive pricing in Western Europe and greater coal use in developing countries like India, where imports of U.S. thermal coal jumped to 6.8 million metric tons last year, from 2.4 million tons a year earlier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T22:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T22:53:38.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
