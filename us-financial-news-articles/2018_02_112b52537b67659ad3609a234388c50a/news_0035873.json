REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini “I‘m feeling much better, much more like myself,” she said on arrival in Pyeongchang, adding that after seeing a sports psychologist she has been able to re-focus.\n“I’ve gotten back to my roots in skiing and reminded myself I‘m not here just for wins but I‘m here because I love the sport,” she said.\nAlpine Skiing – – Women’s Giant Slalom – Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea – February 12, 2018 - Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. is seen as the women's giant slalom at the Winter Olympics is postponed due to high winds at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini But if Shiffrin isn’t at the top of her game on Wednesday there are no shortage of quality challengers ready to swoop for gold.\nSlovakia’s Petra Vlhova won in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, in the last World Cup race before the Winter Games, and has been a skier to watch since her junior days.\nFrida Hansdotter, 32, of Sweden is a consistent podium finisher, even if she only has four World Cup slalom wins to her name.\nSwitzerland’s Wendy Holdener, who finished runner-up to Shiffrin in the 2017 World Championship, is another racer who could take advantage of any opportunity having become her country’s main hope following the injury to Laura Gut.\n“Mikaela Shiffrin is hard to beat, she can get a medal in the games in every discipline,” said Holdener. “I just have to accept that. She is often in a different league”.\nReporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T12:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T16:14:22.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
