The transaction closed on February 8, 2018; financial terms were not disclosed.\nAvtex is a full-service consultancy focused on helping customers build lasting relationships with their customers. From strategy and technology selection to management and measurement, Avtex offers end-to-end services that support customers’ CX goals. NEP’s investment is a significant milestone that will help Avtex add incremental product and service offerings, invest in R&D and innovation, and position the Company for strategic add-on acquisitions. Led by a strong and cohesive management team, Avtex has established a differentiated go-to-market offering, an entrenched customer base, and deep relationships with its primary technology vendors.\nTodd Solow, NEP Partner, stated, “Customer experience technology is a growing need being driven through shifting customer expectations. Avtex has an attractive business model and offers unique and differentiated customer experience solutions that help the Company win new customers, expand its reach within existing customers, and strengthen value to OEMs. We look forward to working together with George Demou and his team to leverage their existing growth momentum to further build and grow Avtex for the future.”\nNEP has recently significantly grown its reach within the tech-enabled business services industry with deep experience, relationships and investments within the sector.

Customer experiences are the result of a complex combination of tools, processes and strategy, and Avtex has developed a leading edge way to effectively coordinate all of these components. The Company is in a great position for continued success, and the right team is in place to help lead the way,\" Torgerson shared.\nGeorge Demou, Avtex President & CEO, stated, “Avtex has been on a steady growth trajectory and created extraordinary value for our clients with an ‘end to end’ approach to CX Technologies and Services.
