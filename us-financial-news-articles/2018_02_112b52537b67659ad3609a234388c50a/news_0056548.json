The blitz peaked in June with more than 500 arrests, above the 443 arrests in 2016 as a whole.\nWhile Sibanye fell short of its goal of stamping out illegal mining altogether, Sibanye’s head of security Nash Lutchman said based on available intelligence, “there are only about 40 to 50 illegal miners operating now, scattered across our Kloof and Driefontein operations”.\nFroneman said last year the number of illegal miners in the company’s gold operations numbered “in the thousands”. Sibanye was the first South African gold miner to set itself a deadline to stop the practice.\nMost zamas are undocumented immigrants from neighboring countries who have long provided migrant labor for South Africa’s mines, but are now being laid off. The syndicates that support them and traffic the illegal metals are well-funded, well-established and highly dangerous, security experts say.\n‘END OF STAGE ONE’\nFILE PHOTO: A sign board is seen near the Sibanye gold mine in Westonaria, west of Johannesburg, South Africa, April 6, 2016. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo Sibanye’s drive was helped by the mothballing of its loss-making Cooke operation west of Johannesburg, which was the epicenter of illegal mining activity in its shafts.\nIllegal miners gain access to working gold mines through bribery and other means, forcing companies to dispatch security teams to the shafts and to tighten entrance measures.\nSibanye spent 300 million rand last year and will spend another 300 million rand this year on access and biometric controls at the entry points to its gold mines.\n“It still costs us so I don’t know if we will ever declare a victory but we are at the end of stage one,” Froneman told Reuters.\n“My biggest concern about illegal mining is the corruption of our supervisors and our employees. That just sets a path for creating a rotten organization. Everybody gets bribed and the integrity of the business just gets undermined,” he said.\nFroneman admitted there was no guarantee illegal miners would not try to return, so the company needed to maintain its costly vigilance.\nSecurity experts have said Sibanye would struggle to eradicate illegal mining completely but could reduce it by 90 percent.\nSibanye is the second South African gold producer to announce a milestone linked to illegal mining this month.\nAngloGold Ashanti said it would spend up to $500 million to mechanize its Obuasi mine in Ghana.\nThe gold mine was rendered worthless when it was invaded by thousands of illegal miners. They were removed by the military last year and the South African company decided to revive the mine as an automated operation after a feasibility study.\nEditing by James Macharia and David Clarke\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-26T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T15:12:02.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
