That's according to Susan Cain, the best-selling author of \" Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking .\" \nCain, who is one of the most popular TED Talks speakers of all time with over 17 million views, has long been a critic of open floor plans for all employees. \n\"There's a whole mountain of research out there talking about how problematic it can be to be working completely out there, subject to interruption all day long [and] never really getting to focus,\" she tells CNBC Make It . \nCain may be on to something. According to a survey by the research firm IPSOS , employees who work in an open floor office lose 86 minutes a day due to distractions. In fact, most employees (95 percent) would rather work in enclosed private spaces. \nOther studies have also shown that high-performing employees need quiet spaces . There's even a noted positive correlation between privacy , higher job satisfaction and work performance.

In fact, she supports the idea of companies creating \"social spaces\" where employees can choose to work in that kind of environment, mill around, connect with one another and get out of the office. \n\"That's great as long as everybody at all times has access to their own private space,\" she says. \nBut even that has its limitations. Often, when companies do utilize private spaces, employees have to sign up for them at least a week in advance and the rooms are almost always completely booked, says Cain. \n\"If you can't get the space when you need it then it's not effective,\" she says. \"If it were up to me I would abolish open plan offices.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T18:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T19:04:52.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
