He was convicted on Aug. 25 of receiving favors in exchange for sizable financial contributions to Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil. Lee was the highest-profile business person caught up in the scandal, which eventually led to Park’s impeachment.\nProsecutors had initially sought 12 years for Lee, who pleaded not guilty to all charges of wrongdoing.\nFor more on the Samsung scandal, watch Fortune’s video: \nLee has served as the de facto head of Samsung since his father, the company chair, was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T10:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:21:59.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
