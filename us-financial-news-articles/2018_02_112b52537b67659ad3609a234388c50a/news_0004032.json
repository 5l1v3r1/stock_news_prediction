It has added more than one billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) resources in the last decade in the Gulf of Mexico.\nThe company said it expected global deepwater production to exceed 900,000 boe per day by 2020, from already established areas.\nReporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru; Editing by Edmund Blair\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T06:10:15.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
