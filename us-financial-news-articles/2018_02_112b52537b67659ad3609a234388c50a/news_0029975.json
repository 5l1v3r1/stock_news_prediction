It said further updates of the terms were planned later this year.\n\"We have long had tools in place to inform people about content removals and intend to expand these tools later this year,\" a Facebook spokeswoman said.\nA Google spokesman declined to comment and Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe Commission said the U.S. trio had agreed to amend some terms that limit their liability, waive a users right to withdraw from online purchases and force European consumers to seek redress in California, where the firms are based, instead of the consumer's home country.\nThey have also agreed to change terms that release the social media firms from the duty of identifying commercial and sponsored content, the Commission said.\nU.S. technology companies have faced tight scrutiny in Europe for the way they do business, from privacy issues to how quickly they remove illegal or threatening content.\nThe Commission said national authorities would monitor the implementation of changes made, make use of the procedures offered by the companies to handle illegal content and \"may take action including enforcement measures where necessary.\"\n(Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel zAdeCar; Additional reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T22:09:52.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
