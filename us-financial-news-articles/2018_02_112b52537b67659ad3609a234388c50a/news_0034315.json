In connection with the Offering, the Issuer granted the initial purchasers of the Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $18,750,000 aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes is expected to close on February 16, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nAvadel estimates that the net proceeds from this Offering will be approximately $119.6 million, or $137.7 million, if the initial purchasers exercise their option to purchase additional Notes in full, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Avadel currently expects to use the net proceeds of the Offering for working capital and general corporate purposes. Avadel also expects to use cash on-hand to purchase approximately $18 million of American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each of which represents one ordinary share of Avadel, through the purchase of ADSs concurrently with the pricing of the Offering in privately negotiated transactions effected with or through a representative of the initial purchasers or an affiliate of such representative. The Issuer agreed to purchase such ADSs at a purchase price per ADS equal to the $8.99 per ADS closing price on The Nasdaq Global Market on February 13, 2018.\nThe Notes will be general, unsecured obligations of the Issuer, and will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Avadel on a senior unsecured basis. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2018. The Notes will mature on February 1, 2023, unless earlier exchanged, repurchased or redeemed in accordance with their terms. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.\nSubject to certain conditions and during certain periods, the Notes will be exchangeable at the option of the holders at an initial exchange rate of 92.6956 ADSs per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $10.79 per ADS. Such initial exchange price represents a premium of approximately 20% to the $8.99 per ADS closing price on The Nasdaq Global Market on February 13, 2018. Upon the exchange of any Notes, the Issuer will pay or cause to be delivered, as the case may be, cash, ADSs or a combination of cash and ADSs, at the Issuer’s election.\nIf the Issuer or Avadel undergoes a “fundamental change” (as defined in the indenture relating to the Notes), holders may require the Issuer to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date. The Issuer may redeem the Notes at its option, in whole but not in part, in connection with certain tax-related events, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, following certain corporate events that may occur prior to the maturity date or following the Issuer’s delivery of a notice of redemption, the Issuer will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to exchange its Notes in connection with such an event or redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances.\nThe Notes, Avadel’s guarantee thereof and the ADSs, if any, deliverable upon exchange thereof have not been and are not expected to be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nLeerink Partners LLC is acting as the lead book-running manager for the offering. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. is acting as passive bookrunner. T.R. Winston & Company, LLC is acting as co-manager.\nThis press release is issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, Avadel’s guarantee thereof or any ADSs deliverable upon exchange thereof, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes, Avadel’s guarantee thereof or any ADSs deliverable upon exchange thereof in any state or other jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. Any offers will be made only pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act, including by means of a confidential offering memorandum.\nAbout Avadel Pharmaceuticals plc:\nAvadel Pharmaceuticals plc (Nasdaq:AVDL) is a branded specialty pharmaceutical company committed to providing solutions for overlooked and unmet medical needs through patient-focused, innovative products.
