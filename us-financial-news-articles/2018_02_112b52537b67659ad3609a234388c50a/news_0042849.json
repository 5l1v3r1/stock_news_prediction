But that was still weaker than the 3.0 percent reading of British consumer price inflation for December.\nExcluding bonuses, earnings rose by 2.5 percent year-on-year against expectations for a 2.4 percent rise.\nThe ONS said the number of EU nationals working in Britain rose by an annual 4.5 percent over the fourth quarter, the smallest increase since the third quarter of 2013. The number of Eastern European workers fell.\nOverall migration data has shown a drop in net migration from the EU into the UK since the Brexit vote.\nThe ONS also published its first estimate for productivity in the fourth quarter.\nOutput per hour - the main measure of productivity - rose 0.8 percent in the three months to December from the previous three months, slightly slower than the third quarter’s 0.9 percent rise. That marked the strongest two quarters for productivity since the 2008/09 recession, the ONS said.\nDEFICIT PLAN ON TARGET Separate figures showed Britain’s government recorded a January budget surplus of 10 billion pounds, slightly bigger than forecast, helped by a surge of income tax receipts that typically comes at the start of the calendar year.\nWith only two months left in the 2017/18 financial year, cumulative borrowing now stands at 37.7 billion pounds, down 16 percent on the same point a year ago.\nIn November, the official budget watchdog had forecast borrowing of 49.9 billion pounds for the full year.\nThe finance ministry said Wednesday’s figures were strong.\nEditing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T11:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T12:07:17.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
