That would make the Reserve Bank of India more cautious when it announces the monetary policy review on Wednesday next week, they said.\n“The probability of rate hikes in the next fiscal year has gone up materially,” said A. Prasanna, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai.\nA cautious stance at the RBI would increase the probability of interest rate increases in the coming fiscal year. That in turn could raise tensions between the government and the central bank, which has resisted pressures for deep rate cuts to boost growth as it worried about increasing inflation.\nAnalysts said while the RBI is expected to keep interest rates on hold next week, the budget could toughen the central bank’s tone. They said the government’s decision to increase the minimum support price guarantee to farmers, in particular, is likely to have a direct inflationary impact.\nIn the budget, the government promised farmers to buy their crops at 1.5 times the cost of production, a major shift in approach after keeping the average minimum support price increase in low single digits over the past three years.\nPulses are kept on display for sale inside a shop at a wholesale market in Guwahati, February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Anuwar Hazarika The announcement spooked investors as they expected retail inflation, which is at 5.21 percent and above the central bank’s 4 percent target, could rise more.\nIt could also put pressure on the fiscal deficit and hurt exports if domestic prices are higher than global for these crops, analysts said.\nLabourers lift a sack filled with sugar to load it onto a handcart at a wholesale market in Kolkata, February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri “If the cost of production includes all expenses, including land and labour and capital, inflation and subsidy are bound to go up,” said Ashok Gulati, an agricultural economist who formerly advised the government on support prices.\nICICI Securities Primary Dealership’s Prasanna said the RBI’s “monetary policy committee will wait to see how the MSP hikes are implemented before making up their minds.”\nSome analysts, however, said there was enough slack in the economy to counter inflationary pressures and lauded the government for taking steps they said would boost growth.\n“There is no demand in the economy, then how can inflation pick up?” said Rupa Rege Nitsure, group chief economist at L&T Finance Holding.\n“With this fiscal push, if growth improves then revenues can pick up, investments will pick up. The central bank should work in tandem with the government.”\nAdditional reporting by Rajendra Jadhav in Mumbai; Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:53:42.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
