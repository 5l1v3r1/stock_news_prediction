It surpassed its previous all-time closing low of 154.60/70 hit on Tuesday. \n“There were selling on (treasury) bonds by foreigners due to the political uncertainty and also the EU listing of Sri Lanka on a money laundering blacklist,” said a currency dealer. \n“Rupee will be under pressure to depreciate until we see a solution to the political uncertainty or giving confidence to the market.” \nLast week the rupee held steady compared to the previous week, but it has fallen 0.95 percent so far this year, Thomson Reuters data showed. \nDealers said they expected the currency to be pressured by continued demand by importers for dollars. \nThey expect a 2-3 percent depreciation in the rupee and higher volatility this year on account of debt repayments by the government. The rupee fell 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nPresident Maithripala Sirisena’s administration must repay an estimated 1.97 trillion rupees ($12.85 billion) in 2018 - a record high - including $2.9 billion of foreign loans and a total of $5.36 billion in interest. \nForeign investors sold a net 6.03 billion rupees worth of government securities in the week ended Feb 7. \nThe outflow reversed the foreign holding of government securities to a net outflow of 171.4 million rupees so far this year up to Feb. 7, central bank data showed. \nThe markets will be closed for a public holiday on Tuesday. Normal trading will resume on Wednesday.
