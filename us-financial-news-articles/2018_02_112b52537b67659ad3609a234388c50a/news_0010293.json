The Hong Kong China Enterprise Index tumbled 3 percent at open, but ended the session merely 0.4 percent lower. \n“Today’s performance shows the Hong Kong market is starting to get disjointed from Wall Street, which used to call the shots,” said Pan Jiang, CEO of asset manager Shanghai V-Investment Co Ltd. \n“Chinese money will keep gushing into Hong Kong, and its pricing power will grow day by day.” \nAlthough the Hang Seng is near its record peak, valuation of Hong Kong-listed blue-chips such as banks are still low from a global perspective, making them attractive to “smart” money from China, Pan said. \nOn Monday, a net 7.6 billion yuan ($1.21 billion) of Chinese money flowed into Hong Kong via the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, the highest volume since April 8, 2015. \nBuying has been concentrated in Hong Kong-listed Chinese lenders, such as CITIC Bank and China Everbright Bank Co. \nMa Xixun, executive director at asset manger PinPoint, said he expects the Hong Kong market to remain in a “slow bull” trend, while performance divergence among big- and small-caps in China will strengthen. $1 = 6.2926 Chinese yuan Editing by Jacqueline Wong", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T12:31:29.057+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
