Others feared the Fed could be in danger of allowing the economy to overheat if it lets inflation accelerate without bumping up its pace of rate increases.\nYet by Thursday, both bond prices and major U.S. stock indexes bounced higher, suggesting to some investors and analysts that Wednesday’s selling was a knee-jerk reaction, and not a potential return to the declines that pressured global markets at the start of the month.\n“There’s the initial gut reaction, and then when you dive into the data, things calm down a bit,” said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management.\nMr. Souza, along with some other investors, remains skeptical that the recent streak of data on wage growth, consumer prices and producer prices points to a rapid acceleration in inflation. At the start of last year, for instance, the Labor Department’s readings on consumer prices suggested that after years of stagnant growth, inflation was starting to near the Fed’s 2% target . Yet that gauge retreated in the second half of the year, as weakness in categories like apparel prices offset a recovery in energy prices.\n“That’s what I’ll be watching for: Are we setting up for what we saw last year, or are we going to see a real pickup in the numbers?” Mr. Souza said.\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is used to set everything from mortgage rates to terms on auto loans, fell Thursday to 2.917%, compared with 2.943% Wednesday, which was the highest close since Jan. 9, 2014. Yields fall as bond prices rise.\nLong bonds also recouped some of their losses from earlier in the week, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond settling at 3.205%, compared with a nearly three-year high of 3.223% Wednesday.\nStill, the yield on the 10-year note remains on course to end the week higher. That would mark its seventh weekly advance in eight weeks.\nThe year’s moves are a departure from 2017, when bond yields largely traded in a narrow range as a mixed batch of data on inflation perplexed Fed officials, who had expected strong economic growth and low unemployment to help lift prices. The 10-year note’s yield closed 2017 at 2.409%, off from 2.446% at the end of 2016.\nThe Treasury Building in Washington. The Treasury Department sold $29 billion in seven-year notes Thursday.

David Ake/Associated Press This year, however, a series of data releases on wage growth, consumer prices and producer prices have led some investors to believe that inflation could finally be firming. Some investors also have worried that a wave of additional debt coming onto the market as the government expands the federal budget deficit could put additional pressure on bonds.\nMeanwhile, the Fed has been scaling back its own bond purchases, making some investors concerned that there won’t be enough demand to soak up the additional issuance without driving up yields.Still, lingering skepticism over whether inflation is picking up could help cap the rise in bond yields, investors say.\nDemand at auctions in February was weaker than in January, as both investors and bond dealers submitted fewer bids relative to the amount of debt on offer from the government, according to Treasury data.\nThe decline occurred after the Treasury raised the size of its auctions this month for the first time since 2009 during the nadir of the financial crisis, borrowing $173 billion in nominal and floating-rate debt, a $10 billion increase from the previous refunding period in November.\nThe Fed’s minutes, for instance, reflected the central bank’s thinking before data released in February showed spending at U.S. retailers dropped in January at the fastest pace in 11 months. Other data could prove to be disappointing, casting doubt on whether prices are picking up at a pace that warrants a faster pace of rate increases.\n“We might well be witnessing the peak of Fed optimism alongside the height of market sentiment,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a research note.\n—Daniel Kruger contributed to this article.\nWrite to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T23:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T01:41:47.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
