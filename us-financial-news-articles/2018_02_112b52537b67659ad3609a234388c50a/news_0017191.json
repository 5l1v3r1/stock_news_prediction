In this environment, structured products remained dynamic,” the bank said in a statement. \nEarlier this week, SocGen’s French rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) reported quarterly net profit that fell short of market forecasts although BNP Paribas slightly increased its 2020 profitability target. \nSocGen, which derives a third of its revenue from French retail banking, said that this business was still feeling the pinch from low interest rates and renegotiations of loans that were impacting margins, as its revenue declined 4.3 percent. \nHowever, SocGen said its target for 2018 was to stabilize revenue in French retail, while making progress on its restructuring plan that envisages 1.1 billion euros in savings over the next three years. \n($1 = 0.8147 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T07:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T08:13:35.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
