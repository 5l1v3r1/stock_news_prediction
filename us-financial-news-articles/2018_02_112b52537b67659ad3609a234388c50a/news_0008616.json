I knew I had to make a lot birdies to catch the leaders. I made a lot of birdies on the front nine and just continued on the back.” \nCampillo went two clear at the top with an eagle in the first hole but Sharma got within touching distance of the Spaniard with four straight birdies from the fourth. \nThe relentless Indian, who captured his maiden title at the Joburg Open in December, shot five birdies on the back nine to edge ahead of Campillo and hung on for the victory. \n”The last two months have changed my life,“ Sharma added. ”I’ve been a member on the Asian Tour for a while and I will continue to be a member on the Asian Tour. \n“I’ve always dreamt of winning and now I‘m a two-time winner on the Asian Tour and European Tour.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T11:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T13:18:01.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
