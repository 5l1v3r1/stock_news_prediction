The Senators are 4-6-1 in their last 11 games and may trade Hoffman along with defenseman Erik Karlsson before Monday afternoon’s trade deadline.\nOttawa’s Craig Anderson allowed five goals for the ninth time this season.\nProvorov made it 1-0 by getting a cross-ice feed from Giroux in between the circles in the low slot and lifting a wrist shot over Anderson’s right shoulder.\nHagg made his second career goal happen all by himself.\nHe used his glove to knock down an Ottawa clearing attempt near the neutral zone, then sped past Duchene and Mark Stone and completed the play by snapping a shot over Anderson from the left circle just before defenseman Ben Harpur could defend him.\nWith 7:46 left, Ottawa made it a one-goal game when Hoffman fired a one-timer over Mrazek’s left pad from above the left circle after getting a pass from Thomas Chabot.\nThe Senators nearly tied the game with 7:44 left in the second period when Smith jammed in a rebound by Mrazek but when the Flyers challenged, the goal was disallowed because a Senator was off-sides.\nPhiladelphia sealed its latest win when Giroux deked Anderson and moved from left to right in front of the crease to complete a breakaway 4:15 into the third. Nearly three minutes later, Patrick used his stick to deflect Manning’s shot.\nWith 11:04 remaining, the Flyers scored a fluky goal when Manning’s long-dump-in caromed off the boards and into the empty net after Anderson went to anticipate the carom behind the net.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T20:00:25.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
