Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Justice revoked an Obama administration policy that discouraged federal prosecutors from pursuing marijuana-related crimes in states that had legalized the drug.\nWhile states such as Colorado and California have legalized marijuana, there is sill a federal ban in place. Canada is expected to legalize pot in July.\nCanadian securities regulators in October asked U.S.-linked marijuana firm to clearly warn investors about the risks, given the ban.\nLeamington, Ontario-based Aphria makes and sells medical cannabis and its U.S operations are in Florida and Arizona.\nOn Monday, the company offered to buy rival Nuuvera Inc for C$826 million, as it bets on a raft of medical cannabis approvals around the world over the coming years.
