For example, it said some Nestle formulas sold in Hong Kong are marketed as healthier for not having any added vanilla flavouring, while vanillin compounds were found in several other products in Hong Kong, mainland China and South Africa. \nIt also calls out Nestle for using health claims, such as for probiotics and prebiotics, around the world that were prohibited by European health regulators for lacking sufficient scientific evidence. It said several products claim to be “the closest to breastmilk” yet each have different ingredients. \n“The report concludes that Nestle is not driven by nutritional science but instead by a sharp and prioritised focus on profit and growth at the expense of infants and their parents,” the report said. \nIt called on Nestle to conduct an independent review of its global product range, which includes brands such as S-26 Gold, Nan, Illuma, Nido and Gerber. \nNestle said it provides “products that are safe and as nutritionally complete as possible, and ensure the composition is informed by the best available science”. \nThe company, which also makes KitKat bars and Nespresso coffee, is trying to remake itself as a “nutrition, health and wellness” company. \nThe Changing Markets Foundation is a Dutch group that says it promotes campaigns to address sustainability challenges by trying to shift business away from companies with unsustainable products.
