Cement shares continued to pull back after big gains last week, with Jouf Cement down 3.3 percent. \nMediterranean & Gulf Cooperative Insurance and Reinsurance fell a further five percent, having lost almost 10 percent on each of the previous two days. The Capital Market Authority has said it might suspend or cancel trade in the stock following the central bank’s decision to prohibit the firm from issuing or renewing policies pending a capital increase. \nBut the biggest bank, National Commercial Bank, rose 0.7 percent. It reported a fourth-quarter net profit of 2.56 billion riyals ($683 million), up from 2.29 billion riyals a year ago. SICO Bahrain had forecast 2.16 billion riyals. \nPetroRabigh added a further 3.1 percent after soaring 9.9 percent on Monday, when it reported a leap in fourth-quarter net profit. \nDubai’s index fell 1.5 percent as losing stocks outnumbered gainers by 32 to three. Abu Dhabi’s index sagged 0.9 percent. \nIn Qatar, the index lost 2.1 percent. Salam International Investment, the most heavily traded stock, closed 3.2 percent lower, far off its intra-day low. It had plunged by its 10 percent daily limit on Monday, when it posted an annual net loss of 89.9 million riyals ($24.7 million) versus a year-earlier profit of 119.7 million riyals. \nDrilling rig provider Gulf International Services bucked the downtrend, rising 2.6 percent to 18.10 riyals in unusually heavy trade as it tested and held technical support on its 100-day average, now at 17.63 riyals. \nEgypt’s index lost 1.6 percent but exchange data showed foreign investors were net buyers of strocks, by a modest margin. HIGHLIGHTS \n* Index fell 1.6 percent to 7,466 points. DUBAI \n* Index dropped 1.5 percent to 3,326 points. ABU DHABI \n* Index slipped 0.9 percent to 4,541 points. QATAR \n* Index lost 2.1 percent to 8,651 points. EGYPT \n* Index lost 1.6 percent to 14,718 points. KUWAIT \n* Index fell 1.3 percent to 6,624 points. BAHRAIN \n* Index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,339 points. OMAN", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T15:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T15:26:57.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
