The United Nations is hoping that elections can be held by the end of the year.\nMembers of a Constitutional Drafting Assembly (CDA) had voted last summer in favor of a draft constitution, but an administrative court in the eastern city of Bayda had ruled that the vote was invalid.\nThe supreme court effectively quashed the Bayda decision by declaring that administrative courts do not have the jurisdiction to rule on matters relating to the CDA, said Omar Naas, a CDA member.\nThe draft constitution could still face hurdles, including challenges in the supreme court, turnout or approval requirements set by the eastern parliament or House of Representatives (HOR) for a constitutional referendum, and the difficulty of holding a nationwide poll in a country where there are no national security forces.\nSome of Libya’s minorities have also said they were excluded from a lengthy and sometimes acrimonious drafting process.\nBut Naas said the text was for “all Libyans”, and greeted the supreme court’s decision as “historic”.\n“The next steps are for the House of Representatives to discuss and write the referendum law that will enable Libyans to decide their fate,” he said.\nReporting by Ahmed Elumami; Writing by Aidan Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T17:48:39.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
