Their selling appears to be over,” said Mizuho’s Kuramochi.\nIn the currency market, the dollar stabilised off its three-year lows against a basket of currencies.\nThe euro stood at $1.2414, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556.\nThe dollar traded at 106.31 yen, bouncing back from its 15-month low of 105.545 set on Feb 16.\nThe U.S. currency has been weighed down by a barrage of factors, including worries about widening U.S. trade and budget deficits and speculation Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy.\nThere is also talk that foreign central banks may be reallocating their reserves out of the dollar.\nIn commodities, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude started the week little changed at $61.72 per barrel.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T09:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T09:06:37.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
