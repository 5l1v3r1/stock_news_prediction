REUTERS/Phil Noble The most notable absentee from the big Dutch party was Kramer himself.\nThe 31-year-old skated into the record books on Sunday by winning his third consecutive Olympic gold medal in the 5,000 meters, but chose not to celebrate at Holland House because he still has work to do.\n“Sven will race the 10,000m on Thursday,” Bakker said. “The whole country is talking about it. That is the most important race for the whole Olympics, the 10,000m for Sven.”\nAt the Vancouver Games in 2010, a blunder cost Kramer gold in the 10,000 and he is still searching for victory in the longest Olympic distance.\nKramer finished first in Vancouver, but was disqualified for choosing the wrong lane.\nHe took silver in Sochi Games four years later behind team mate Jorrit Bergsma, so the 10,000 in Korea has special significance for him.\nIf he wins, Kleintje Pils will play their part, breaking into Frisian Anthem in honor of the native of Friesland - the northwestern province that has produced some of the best Dutch speed skaters.\n“We hope Sven will win the 10,000m. It will be a big crown on his career,” Bakker said.\n“Of course he will want to not only hear the national anthem but most of all the Frisian Anthem because he is born in Friesland, the part of Holland where speed skating is in everyone’s blood and heart.”\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:31:12.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
