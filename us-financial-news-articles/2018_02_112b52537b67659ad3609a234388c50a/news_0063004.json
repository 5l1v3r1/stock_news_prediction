An earlier scheme court meeting of Booker shareholders also saw them back the takeover.\nAn earlier meeting of Tesco investors also voted through the deal, which is now expected to complete on March 5.\nReporting by James Davey and Alistair Smout\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T15:36:48.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
