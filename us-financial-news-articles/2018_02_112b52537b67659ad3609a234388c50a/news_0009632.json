Net sales slipped 11.5 percent to 39 billion rupees.\n“The quarterly performance was muted on the back of business mix as well as forex losses,” said Nilesh Gupta, managing director.\nProfit fell 65 percent to 2.22 billion rupees for the quarter ended Dec. 31, well below an average analysts' estimate of 4.21 billion rupees, Thomson Reuters data showed.
