A spokeswoman for Weinstein said on Saturday that he had apologized to Thurman for making an “awkward pass” at her 25 years ago, but that her claims about being physically assaulted were untrue.\nIn the Times article, Thurman, 47, said Weinstein pushed her down when she met him in his suite at London’s Savoy Hotel.\n“He tried to shove himself on me. He tried to expose himself. He did all kinds of unpleasant things. But he didn’t actually put his back into it and force me,” she told the newspaper.\nFILE PHOTO: Uma Thurman (L), Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman arrive at the British Academy of Film and Arts (BAFTA) awards ceremony at the Royal Opera House in London, February 16, 2014. REUTERS/Luke MacGregor/File Photo Asked for further comment by Reuters, a representative for Thurman said the Times article spoke for itself.\nA spokeswoman for Weinstein said in a statement that he was saddened and puzzled as to why someone he considers a colleague and friend had waited so long to make the allegations public.\nFILE PHOTO: Presenter Uma Thurman acknowledges the audience during the 71st Tony Awards in New York City, U.S., June 11, 2017.
