That rare situation highlighted the extreme level of fear of further near-term losses for U.S. stocks.\nOn Wednesday the backwardation had reached its most extreme level since Aug. 11, 2011, when rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded the United States’ credit rating.\nWith Wednesday’s expiry of February VIX futures, the curve was approaching its more typical contango, where investors pay more for farther out contracts than for near-term contracts.\n“Any time the front-month contracts expire, you immediately see a big adjustment in the curve,” said Frederick.\nVIX futures imply investors expect the VIX to remain in the 15 to 18 range over the next few months, he said.\nU.S. stocks were little changed on Thursday, after four straight days of gains for the S&P 500. Blue-chips Apple Inc and Cisco Systems rose as investors shrugged off fears of rising inflation and hunted for bargains.
