The impacts of U.S. tax reform may differ from this estimate, and the estimated charges may accordingly be adjusted over the course of 2018.\nAdjusted Non-GAAP Results (defined in Notes 1-4 below)\nAdjusted revenue was $439.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 8.6 percent compared to $404.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted revenue 2017 was $1,682.5 million, increasing 10.4% from $1,524.0 million in 2016. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $182.4 million, or 41.5 percent of adjusted revenue, compared to $160.4 million, or 39.6 percent of adjusted revenue, in 2016's fourth quarter, representing a 13.7 percent increase. Adjusted operating income 2017 was $665.3 million, or 39.5 percent of adjusted revenue, compared to $586.6 million, or 38.5 percent of adjusted revenue, for 2016, representing a 13.4 percent increase.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $114.5 million, up 20.3 percent compared to $95.2 million in 2016's fourth quarter.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share 2017 were $1.93, up 17.7 percent from 2016's $1.64 per share.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.54 for Q4 2017, increasing 17.4 percent from Q4 2016's $0.46 adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA increased 14.7 percent to $191.3 million in Q4 2017. Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin was 43.5 percent for the quarter. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $470.4 million, an increase of 12.4 percent. SS&C paid off $467.5 million of debt during the year ended December 31, 2017, bringing our net debt to consolidated EBITDA leverage ratio to 2.90x. SS&C entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DST Systems and is expected to close in Q2 or Q3 2018.\n\"SS&C had a strong fourth quarter in both revenue and earnings. Our growth came on the back of robust sales, completed implementations, and large new clients moving to full run-rate revenue. We also continued delivering acquisition synergies,\" says Bill Stone, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SS&C Technologies. \"We are pleased with the fourth quarter and now look forward to capitalizing on new products and services, and opportunities at DST.\"\nAnnual Run Rate Basis\nAnnual Run Rate Basis (ARRB) recurring revenue, defined as adjusted recurring revenue on an annualized basis, was $1,638.4 million based on adjusted recurring revenue $409.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. This represents an increase of 11.2 percent from $1,473.8 million and $368.5 million run-rate in the same period in 2016 and an increase of 3.7 percent from an annual run rate of $1,580.1 million and $395.0 million for the third quarter of 2017. We believe ARRB of our recurring revenue is a good indicator of visibility into future revenue.\nOperating Cash Flow\nSS&C generated net cash from operating activities of $470.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $418.4 million for the same period in 2016, representing a 12.4 percent increase. SS&C ended the fourth quarter with $64.1 million in cash and $2,092.2 million in gross debt, for a net debt balance of $2,028.1 million. SS&C's consolidated net leverage ratio as defined in our credit agreement stood at 2.90 times consolidated EBITDA as of December 31, 2017.\nGuidance\nQ1 2018\nFY 2018\nAdjusted Revenue ($M)\n$427.0 – $437.0\n$1,755.0 – $1,785.0\nAdjusted Net Income ($M)\n$113.0 – $117.5\n$480.0 – $502.0\nCash from Operating Activities ($M)\n–\n$570.0 – $590.0\nCapital Expenditures (% of revenue)\n–\n2.7% – 3.1%\nDiluted Shares (M)\n215.2 – 214.8\n217.5 – 216.5\nEffective Income Tax Rate (%)\n23%\n23%\nSS&C does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted Revenues and Adjusted Net Income to comparable GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. SS&C is unable, without unreasonable efforts, to forecast certain items required to develop meaningful comparable GAAP financial measures. These items include acquisition transactions and integration, foreign exchange rate changes, as well as other non-cash and other adjustments as defined under the Company's Credit agreement, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted consolidated EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures. See the accompanying notes to the attached Condensed Consolidated Financial Information for the reconciliations and definitions for each of these non-GAAP measures and the reasons our management believes these measures provide useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations.\nEarnings Call and Press Release\nSS&C's Q4 2017 and Full Year 2017 earnings call will take place at 5:00 p.m. eastern time today, February 15, 2018.
