Brazil’s EMS has already built a small presence in Central and Eastern Europe with the 2017 purchase of Serbian laboratory Galenika.\nSanofi first hinted at a possible disposal of its European generic drugs business in late 2015 but has so far focused on selling its animal health unit by finalising a $20 billion asset swap deal with Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim last year.\nFrance’s largest drug maker has also embarked on a series of big acquisitions this year, spending more than $16 billion to clinch control of U.S. haemophilia specialist Bioverativ and Belgian biotech company Ablynx.\nZentiva operates in 50 markets and has a strong presence in Eastern Europe, particularly in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania.\nIts generic drugs portfolio includes cardiovascular and gastrointestinal drugs as well as painkillers and anti-inflammatory drugs based on ibuprofen and leflunomide molecules.\nReuters reported on Jan. 18 that bankers have put together around 1.2 billion euros of debt financing to back a potential sale of Sanofi’s generic drug business.\n($1 = 0.8030 euros)\nAdditional reporting by Matthias Blamont in Paris, Tatiana Bautzer in Sao Paulo and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bangalore; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T19:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T20:15:02.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
