Anything beyond that is a hike in “base pay.”\nBut many firms are wary of raising wages as it commits them to higher fixed personnel costs, so they prefer to pay one-off bonuses instead.\nThe survey was conducted between Jan 31 and Feb 14 on behalf of Reuters by Nikkei Research. Of some 240 companies that responded, 52 percent said they would not raise base pay.\n“It would leave a burden when the business environment turns for the worse,” wrote a manager at a transport equipment maker in the survey.\nThe remaining 48 percent said they intended to raise base pay, but 76 percent of this group said the rise would be the same as last year. About 14 percent saw pay rises exceeding last year, while 10 percent said they would undershoot last year’s increase.\nThe firms intending to boost wages cited returning a portion of profits to employees and motivating workers. Some even cited government pressure.\n“We have no choice but to raise base pay because of policies by the government and Keidanren,” wrote a manager of another transport equipment firm.\nVIRTUALLY FROZEN In Japan, base salary accounts for the bulk of monthly wages. Rises in base pay had been virtually frozen since the early 2000s amid persistent deflation.\nSeveral economists have forecast major companies would agree this year to base pay increases of around 0.5-0.6 percent, which with the seniority-based automatic salary rise would bring overall wage growth to around 2.3-2.4 percent.\n“Keidanren set an unusually high target of 3 percent for wage hikes and the government has expanded tax incentives for companies raising wages,” said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at Barclays Securities, which forecast a wage hike of 2.3 percent.\nStill, 52 percent of respondents said the 3 percent target was unrealistic and 7 percent said it was “out of the question.” Some 41 percent said it was realistic.\nAsked the same question in the December poll, 31 percent said it was realistic, 61 percent said it was unrealistic while 7 percent called it “out of question.”\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Malcolm Foster and Neil Fullick\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T01:28:20.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
