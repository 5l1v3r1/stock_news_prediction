We don’t have any access to them,” he said. “We don’t know where they are being held. Police has said they are arrested under state of emergency and that they don’t have to give the information.”\nRaajee TV, an independent media outlet, said police had attacked journalists covering the Friday’s protests and said one had been treated for injuries.\nPolice declined to comment on any arrests or other incidents related to the protest, which was the latest in a series of demonstrations against Yameen’s government.\nPolice told hundreds of protesters near the Artificial Beach area of Male that demonstrations were prohibited in the capital, drawing boos from the crowd. Police dispersed the rally using pepper spray and detained several protesters, a witness said.\nPolice also closed down the main MDP campaign office near Artificial Beach, the opposition said.\nDemonstrators later gather in two other locations of Male, before being police dispersed them and made several further arrests, the witness said.\nWriting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Edmund Blair\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T05:15:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
