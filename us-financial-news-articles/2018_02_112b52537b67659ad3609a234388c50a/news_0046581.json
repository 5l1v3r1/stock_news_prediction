The government took a majority stake in each.\nThe Treasury Department ended up pumping $187.5 billion into the companies. They have since returned to profitability. In court papers, Perry Capital said the Treasury Department has now received back its entire investment plus an additional $88 billion.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last year that a lower court had correctly barred claims that the government overstepped its authority in 2012 by eliminating dividend payouts to various shareholders and requiring the companies to pay the U.S. Treasury an amount equal to their quarterly net worth.\nThat court said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors could still pursue some damages claims, including for breach of contract.\nPerry Capital, which in 2016 announced plans to shut down, was among those that sought to challenge the lower court’s dismissal of lawsuits, arguing the government’s confiscation of profits was illegal.\nOther shareholders that sued included Fairholme Funds Inc and individual investors. Another hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management LP( IPO-PERS.L ), the biggest common shareholder in both companies, filed a brief asking the justices to take the case.\nThe appeals court said the government had the authority under a 2008 law that laid the groundwork for its seizure of the two companies.\nBoth companies are now under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said before taking office last year that the companies should be returned to private control but has since said that they should not be privatized.\nReporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T23:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:25:44.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
