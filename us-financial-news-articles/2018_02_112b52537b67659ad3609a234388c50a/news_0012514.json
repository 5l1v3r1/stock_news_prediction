(“Poseida”), a San Diego-based company translating best-in-class gene engineering technologies into lifesaving cell therapies, today announced that Martin Giedlin, Ph.D., has joined the company as vice president, technical operations.\nDr. Giedlin brings significant expertise in cell therapy process development, manufacturing, and strategy in immunotherapies. Most recently, he led the process development teams that generated the clinical and commercial manufacturing process in support of the first FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapy, Novartis’ Kymriah™ (CTL019).\n“Poseida has a broad array of proprietary CAR-T, gene insertion, gene editing and gene delivery tools that can be combined to create products that treat a wide range of oncologic and orphan diseases,” said Eric Ostertag, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer at Poseida. “Martin’s background in manufacturing both CAR-T therapeutics and gene-edited T cell products is a rare combination that is a perfect match for Poseida, and will immediately enrich our lead autologous and allogeneic CAR-T programs for hematologic cancers and solid tumors.”\nDr. Giedlin brings more than 20 years of experience supporting immunotherapy options for cancer and infectious disease through the development of recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy and vaccines. He most recently served as executive director, process sciences, in Novartis Pharmaceuticals’ Cell and Gene Therapy group that focused on gene-editing of autologous T cells. He also served as vice president, development, at Sangamo Inc., which used zinc-fingered proteins for both cellular and vector-mediated gene-editing to generate therapies for the treatment of genetic and infectious disease. Prior to that he served as senior director, in vivo biology, at Cerus Corporation and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. Dr. Giedlin received his Ph.D. in Microbiology from the Medical College of Virginia (Virginia Commonwealth University) and his Bachelor of Science in Biology and Chemistry from the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.\nAbout Poseida Therapeutics Inc.\nPoseida Therapeutics is translating best-in-class gene engineering technologies into lifesaving cell therapies. The company is developing CAR T-cell immunotherapies for multiple myeloma, prostate and other cancer types, as well as gene therapies for orphan diseases. P-BCMA-101 is Poseida’s lead CAR-T therapy currently in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Poseida has assembled a suite of industry-leading gene engineering technologies, including the piggyBac™ DNA Modification System, TAL-CLOVER™ and Cas-CLOVER™ site-specific nucleases, and Footprint-Free™ Gene Editing (FFGE).
