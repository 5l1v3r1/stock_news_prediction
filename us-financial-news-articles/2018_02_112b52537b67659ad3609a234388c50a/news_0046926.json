Steinhoff said it would pay Seifert for his half of POCO as soon as a separate ongoing legal case in Germany over the ownership of POCO was settled.\nThe Amsterdam court also ordered Steinhoff to revise the contingent liabilities in its 2016 accounts to remove a reference to the payable liability to Seifert for the holding in POCO, according to Steinhoff.\n“The company is in the process of studying the judgment (including whether it provides grounds for appeal) and considering the impact of the decision on the Group’s accounts and will update shareholders in due course,” the group said.\nThe vast majority of POCO’s more than 100 outlets are in Germany, where the brand generated sales of 1.52 billion euros ($1.88 billion) in 2016, according to its website.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips and Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T17:37:34.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
