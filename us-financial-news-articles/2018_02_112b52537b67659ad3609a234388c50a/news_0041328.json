Daniel Berger, a lawyer for the plaintiff, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nThe lawsuit seeks damages on behalf of shareholders from Feb. 26, 2013 to Jan. 24, 2018.\nGE’s market value fell to roughly $143 billion by the end of the class period from more than $290 billion in July 2016.\nThe Boston-based company has faced earlier shareholder lawsuits over its falling stock price.\nLong-term care insurance has become a more troublesome and costly business, including for the Genworth Financial Inc business that GE spun off in 2004, as policyholders live longer and their medical expenses rise.\nThe complaint said GE knew or should have known it was not immune from that trend, and Quote: d from analysts covering GE who wrote that it was “hard to believe” or “hard to imagine” that the company suddenly discovered its problems.\nGE stopped writing long-term care insurance contracts in 2006, but has said it provides reinsurance on about 300,000 policies.\nThe case is Cleveland Bakers and Teamsters Pension Fund v General Electric Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01404.\nReporting by Alwyn Scott and Jonathan Stempel, Editing by Franklin Paul and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T18:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T19:35:33.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
