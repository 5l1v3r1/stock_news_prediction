REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui The decision by India’s stock exchanges is likely to force foreign investors to either migrate their trading onshore to India, with its uncertain regulatory environment and higher taxes, or give up their exposure to a hot emerging market.\nForeign markets offer dollar-based derivative contracts based on Indian indexes, shares and other securities under licensing agreements with Indian exchanges, allowing overseas investors to gain exposure to Asia’s third-largest economy without having to trade onshore.\nThose licensing agreements were terminated with immediate effect last week, subject to notice periods.\nThe most popular of these contracts has long been the SGX Nifty 50 index futures offered by the Singapore Exchange under a licensing agreement with the National Stock Exchange, India’s biggest exchange. It tracks the NSE’s main index of its top 50 shares, the Nifty 50 index.\nReporting by Ankit Ajmera in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Phil Berlowitz\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T01:56:48.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
