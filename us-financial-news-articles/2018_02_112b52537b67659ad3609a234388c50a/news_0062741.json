Cogan’s “ Why America Is Going Broke ” (op-ed, Feb. 22): Why does every solution to our budget problem revolve around cutting Social Security and Medicare payments? Contrary to Mr. Cogan’s assertions, these aren’t entitlements. Rather, for boomers, these are benefits paid for through a lifetime of non-optional payroll deductions. President Trump is correct. These should be the last option considered, not the first. For many seniors, these are their only means of survival. To even consider cutting them is unconscionable until the real entitlement programs, most of which are rife with fraud and abuse, are addressed.\nChuck McGee\nMoultonborough, N.H.\nPhoto: iStock/Getty Images Can we agree that Mr. Cogan’s “presidential leadership” solution to “restraining the growth of entitlement spending” may not come in time to avoid the demise of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, Venezuela-style hyperinflation or a financial crisis like Greece’s?\nSwitzerland faced the same problem of excessive government spending growth driving unsustainable deficit spending. It solved it in 2001 with a constitutional amendment called a “debt break.” This limited the growth in spending to the growth in average revenues adjusted for population and inflation over the business cycle. As a result, Switzerland has been paying down its debt as a percentage of GDP, has the lowest borrowing cost of any country in the world and passed the U.S. in GDP per capita to be No. 1 among the 100 largest countries.\nA Swiss-style “spending growth limit” constitutional amendment could be drafted by 34 states and ratified by 38 state in less than two years. When six more states pass the required amendment application, an amendment-drafting conference of states would be called to start the process. It will take decades to slowly work our way out of this mess. But what choice do we have?\nDavid Biddulph\nNew Symrna Beach, Fla.\nMr. Cogan correctly identifies the entitlement programs as the primary cause of our nation’s pending financial crisis. However, he and otherswho rightly see that entitlement spending must be addressed, fail to point out that the design of Social Security was deeply flawed from the outset. It was designed as a Ponzi scheme in which current workers’ payroll taxes are used to fund retired workers’ benefits. If the payroll taxes of the current retirees had been segregated and invested (much like a 401(k)) rather than being spent by the federal government along the way, we wouldn’t be in this mess. A private investment fund run like our Social Security program would be illegal and unethical. There is a reason Bernie Madoff is in jail for the rest of his life.\nDavid Mahoney\nSummit, N.J.\nMy suggested additions are to chart our total debt including the burden of unfunded liabilities of entitlements, and to add financing by printing more money, Venezuela style, in addition to crushing levels of taxation and more debt.\nLewis Hamilton\nBoca Grande, Fla.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T18:32:02.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
