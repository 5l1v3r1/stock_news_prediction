The S&P 500 increased 6.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was up 19.4% for the full year 2017. Low volatility and decreased transaction volumes in the equities markets persisted during the period. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in December 2017, the fifth 25 basis point increase since the Fed began raising rates in December 2015. The increase in short-term interest rates has led to a flattening of the yield curve as long-term rates have remained historically low reflecting low inflation expectations and heightened demand from overseas investors taking advantage of the relatively higher U.S. interest rates. The 10-Year Treasury Yield ended the quarter at 2.41%.\nAlbert G. Lowenthal, Chairman and CEO commented, \"We are encouraged by operating results for the period which continued to be positively impacted by higher equities markets and higher interest rates. Our fee-based business within Asset Management continued to perform well driven by higher equity prices and the continued adoption of fee-based strategies by our wealth management clients. Assets under management rose to new highs during the quarter. The performance for the year of the hedge funds that we sponsor led to a significant increase in incentive fees from alternative investments which are measured and earned at the end of each year.\nSpreads continue to widen on our interest rate sensitive assets which will likely further benefit from the December 2017 rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Trading activity and transaction revenues continued to be negatively impacted by low volatility and changing investor behavior leading to lower retail and institutional commission revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 and full year 2017. We are optimistic about the investment banking pipeline as we begin 2018 and continue to see the benefits of the changes made to our investment banking business.\nThe enactment of corporate tax reform had a significant positive effect on the fourth quarter of 2017 with the one-time gains associated with the re-measurement of our deferred taxes. The Company is also positioned to benefit from corporate tax reform through a lower effective tax rate on the business going forward. The positive performance of our stock price during the period led to a significant increase in compensation costs from the Oppenheimer Stock Appreciation Rights Plan (\"OARs Plan\"). The environment continues to look bright for the economy and for our business as we move into 2018.\"\nNotable Items for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nThe Company recorded an after-tax benefit of $9.0 million, or $0.69 basic net income per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to re-measuring deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017 (^) .\nIncentive fees earned during the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $27.3 million as a result of the return on assets under management on alternative investments exceeding certain benchmark returns over a 12-month period.\nThe Company recorded compensation and related expenses of $7.6 million related to its OARs Plan due to the price of its Class A Stock increasing from $17.35 at the end of the third quarter of 2017 to $26.80 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nCommission revenue was $88.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 2.7% compared with $90.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to reduced transaction volumes from retail and institutional investors as well as lower financial adviser headcount during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, commission revenue was $336.6 million compared with $377.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 10.8% due to reduced transaction volumes from retail and institutional investors as well as lower financial adviser headcount during the 2017 year.\nAdvisory fees were $104.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 49.9% compared with $69.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to increases in advisory fees on traditional managed products and incentive fees on alternative managed products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, advisory fees were $320.7 million compared with $269.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 19.2% due to increases in advisory fees on traditional managed products and incentive fees on alternative managed products.\nInvestment banking revenue decreased 29.2% to $20.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $29.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to lower fees from mergers and acquisition activity and debt capital market transactions partially offset by higher fees from equities underwriting transactions during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, investment banking revenue was $78.2 million compared with $81.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 3.5% due to lower fees from mergers and acquisition activity and debt capital market transactions partially offset by higher fees from equities underwriting transactions during the 2017 year.\nPrincipal transactions revenue increased 447.1% to $7.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher trading profits in fixed income trading during the fourth quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, principal transactions revenue was $23.3 million compared with $20.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 13.6% due primarily to increases in the valuation of firm investments during the 2017 year.\nBusiness Segment Results (Unaudited)\n('000s)\nFor the 3-Months Ended\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenue\nPrivate Client (1)\n$\n167,684\n$\n127,455\n31.6\n$\n592,753\n$\n504,192\n17.6\nAsset Management (1)\n32,649\n23,874\n36.8\n89,896\n92,852\n(3.2)\nCapital Markets\n63,214\n67,641\n(6.5)\n231,632\n254,933\n(9.1)\nCorporate/Other\n1,426\n(25)\n*\n6,057\n5,802\n4.4\n264,973\n218,945\n21.0\n920,338\n857,779\n7.3\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes from Continuing Operations\nPrivate Client (1)\n35,077\n15,273\n129.7\n128,840\n66,072\n95.0\nAsset Management (1)\n15,555\n9,561\n62.7\n26,685\n31,412\n(15.0)\nCapital Markets\n(14,743)\n(13,857)\n6.4\n(39,978)\n(17,713)\n125.7\nCorporate/Other\n(19,319)\n(18,473)\n4.6\n(95,811)\n(101,663)\n(5.8)\n$\n16,570\n$\n(7,496)\n*\n$\n19,736\n$\n(21,892)\n*\n(1)\nEffective January 1, 2017, the allocation of advisory fees between Private Client and Asset Management changed from 77.5% and 22.5% to 90.0% and 10.0%.\n*\nPercentage not meaningful.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nPrivate Client\nPrivate Client reported revenue of $167.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 31.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher management and incentive fees, fees earned on the FDIC-insured bank deposit program, and margin interest as well as the increase in the cash surrender value of Company-owned life insurance partially offset by lower commissions during the fourth quarter of 2017. Income before income taxes was $35.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 129.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the foregoing as well as lower legal and regulatory costs partially offset by increases in share-based (see discussion on OARs Plan above) and deferred compensation expenses during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nClient assets under administration were $86.9 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with $77.2 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of 12.6%.\nFinancial adviser headcount was 1,107 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, down from 1,158 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2016. The decline in financial adviser headcount since the fourth quarter of 2016 has resulted from the Company's attention to adviser productivity leading to attrition of less productive financial advisers. The decline in headcount also has been impacted by retirements and normal attrition.\nRetail commissions were $52.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 3.8% from the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdvisory fee revenue on traditional and alternative managed products was $71.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 54.1% from the fourth quarter of 2016. (see Asset Management below for further information). The increase in advisory fees was due to the increase in the value of client assets under management (\"AUM\"), a change in the allocation of advisory fees between the Private Client and Asset Management segments, effective January 1, 2017, which resulted in an increase of $5.9 million in revenue, and an increase in incentive fees generated from hedge funds.\nIncentive fees from the participation in hedge funds were $17.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $708,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Incentive fees allocated to this business segment are computed at the fiscal year-end of the underlying fund when the measurement period ends and generally are earned in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year.\nFees earned on client cash deposits in the FDIC-insured bank deposits program were $23.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $10.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher short-term interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAsset Management\nAsset Management reported revenue of $32.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 36.8% higher than the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher management and incentive fees partially offset by the change in the allocation of advisory fees between the Private Client and Asset Management segments which became effective January 1, 2017. Income before income taxes was $15.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 62.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdvisory fee revenue on traditional and alternative managed products was $32.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 40.4% from the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in advisory fees was due to the increase in the value of AUM offset by the change in the allocation of advisory fees between the Private Client and Asset Management segments, effective January 1, 2017, which resulted in a decrease of $5.9 million in revenue, and an increase in incentive fees generated from hedge funds.\nAdvisory fees are calculated based on the value of AUM at the end of the prior quarter which totaled $27.2 billion at September 30, 2017 ($24.6 billion at September 30, 2016) and are allocated between the Private Client and Asset Management business segments.\nIncentive fees from the participation in hedge funds were $9.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $25,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Incentive fees allocated to this business segment are computed at the fiscal year-end of the underlying fund when the measurement period ends and generally are earned in the fourth quarter of the Company's fiscal year.\nAUM increased 14.1% to $28.3 billion at December 31, 2017 compared with $24.8 billion at December 31, 2016, which is the basis for advisory fee billings for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in AUM was comprised of asset appreciation of $2.5 billion and net contribution of assets of $1.0 billion.\nCapital Markets\nCapital Markets reported revenue of $63.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, 6.5% lower than the fourth quarter of 2016 due to lower fees from mergers and acquisition activity and debt capital market transactions partially offset by higher fees from equities underwriting transactions during the fourth quarter of 2017. Loss before income taxes was $14.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 6.4% compared with a loss before income taxes of $13.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInstitutional equities commissions decreased 0.4% to $25.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to lower volatility and trading volumes in the equity markets.\nAdvisory fees earned from investment banking activities decreased 36.8% to $9.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a decrease in mergers and acquisitions activity during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEquities underwriting fees increased 236.8% to $6.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher capital raising activity during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRevenue from Taxable Fixed Income decreased 36.6% to $12.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to low volatility and client activity leading to a reduction in commission and debt capital markets revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPublic Finance and Municipal Trading revenue increased 130.0% to $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher municipal commissions and trading profits in municipal bonds during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCompensation and Related Expenses\nCompensation and related expenses (including salaries, production and incentive compensation, share-based compensation, deferred compensation, and other benefit-related items) totaled $173.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 14.0% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was due to higher production, incentive, share-based, and deferred compensation expenses partially offset by lower healthcare costs during the fourth quarter of 2017. As indicated above, compensation and related expenses of $7.6 million were recorded during the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the Company's OARs Plan due to the price of its Class A Stock increasing from $17.35 at the end of the third quarter of 2017 to $26.80 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Compensation and related expenses as a percentage of revenue was 65.5% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 69.5% during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-Compensation Expenses\nNon-compensation expenses were $74.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 0.9% compared with $74.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to lower legal and regulatory costs partially offset by higher interest costs during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 27.7% (benefit) compared with 67.7% (benefit) for the fourth quarter of 2016. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was positively impacted by the estimated impact of the TCJA which resulted in a net discrete after-tax benefit of $9.0 million (^) . The net discrete after-tax benefit was comprised of a benefit of $29.0 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities offset by a detriment of $19.6 million related to the re-measurement of deferred tax assets as well as a detriment of $0.4 million related to miscellaneous non-deductible items. The effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2016 was positively impacted by income tax provision to tax return true-ups and higher nontaxable benefits received with respect to Company-owned life insurance.\nFULL-YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nPrivate Client\nPrivate Client reported revenue of $592.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, 17.6% higher than the year ended December 31, 2016 due to higher management and incentive fees, fees earned on the FDIC-insured bank deposit program, and margin interest as well as the increase in the cash surrender value of Company-owned life insurance partially offset by lower commissions during the year ended December 31, 2017. Income before income taxes was $128.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 95.0% compared with the year ended December 31, 2016 due to the foregoing partially offset by increases in share-based (see discussion on OARs Plan above) and deferred compensation expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRetail commissions were $203.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of 8.0% from the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAdvisory fee revenue on traditional and alternative managed products was $232.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 28.3% from the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in advisory fees was due to the increase in the value of AUM, a change in the allocation of advisory fees between the Private Client and Asset Management segments, effective January 1, 2017, which resulted in an increase of $22.2 million in revenue, and an increase in incentive fees generated from hedge funds.\nFees earned on client cash deposits in the FDIC-insured bank deposit program were $76.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 versus $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 was positively impacted by the estimated impact of the TCJA which resulted in a net discrete after-tax benefit of $9.0 million as discussed above in the Provision for Income Taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 (^) . The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was positively impacted by income tax provision to tax return true-ups and higher nontaxable benefits received with respect to Company-owned life insurance partially offset by the valuation allowance established on deferred tax assets related to net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring 2016, the Company completed the sales of substantially all of the assets of its Oppenheimer Multifamily Housing and Healthcare Finance Inc.
