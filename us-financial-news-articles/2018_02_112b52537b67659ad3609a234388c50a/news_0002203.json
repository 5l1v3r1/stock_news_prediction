Asda, owned by Walmart, grew sales by 2.2 percent in the period to Jan. 29, data from research group Kantar Worldpanel showed, with Morrisons also on 2.2 percent, while Sainsbury's saw a 1.5 percent rise. Growth at Aldi and Lidl came in at 16.2 percent and 16.3 percent respectively, boosting their respective market shares to 6.9 percent and 5 percent at the cost of the top four players. Healthy eating helped drive the sales growth, Kantar said, as consumers switched to vegetarian and vegan meals and bought more spinach, cherries and aubergines. Grocery inflation stood at 3.6 percent for the period, Kantar said. Market share and sales growth (percent) 12 wks to 12 wks to pct change Jan. 28.
