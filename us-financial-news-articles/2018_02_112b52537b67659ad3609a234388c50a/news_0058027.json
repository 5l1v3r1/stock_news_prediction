If they agree to the rehabilitation terms, then they move,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nThe NTCA is studying NCST’s order, which it received on Monday, and will respond in time, Swain said over the phone.\nIndia’s Forest Rights Act gives indigenous people and forest dwellers the right to harvest and use forest resources to maintain their traditional livelihoods.\nMore than a fifth of India’s 1.2 billion population was expected to benefit from the 2006 law covering vast areas of forest land roughly the size of Germany.\nBut implementation has been slow and conflicts between states and indigenous people have risen as more land is sought for industrial projects in one of the world’s fastest growing economies.\nWildlife tourism is also a growing money-spinner, and hundreds of tribal villagers have been evicted in sometimes violent clashes from land reserved for tigers, elephants and rhinoceros.\nLast November, advocacy group Survival International asked tourists to boycott India’s tiger reserves until the rights of indigenous people in them are upheld.\nOfficials must ensure their forest rights are settled, and offer more compensation, said Rahul Choudhary, co-founder of non-profit Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment.\n“These are people who have lived in the forest for generations. The government must offer better terms for their rehabilitation,” he said.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran. Editing by Jared Ferrie.
