Giordano, M.D., to its Board of Directors.\n“We welcome Michael to the Board and look forward to the unique insight he brings from his successful tenure leading oncology and immunotherapy programs through development,” said Brian Wong, M.D., Ph.D., President and CEO. “With his impressive track record, we believe his strategic guidance and expertise will be instrumental as we continue to advance our small molecule immuno-oncology compounds for the treatment of cancer.”\nDr. Giordano spent 17 years at Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), serving in various development and medical affairs leadership positions across multiple therapeutic areas. Most recently, he served as Senior Vice President and Head of Development, Oncology and Immuno-Oncology where he was responsible for the development strategy of the enterprise for this therapeutic area, as well as direction for eight teams working on innovative medicines to improve the standard of care for patients, including Opdivo®, Yervoy®, Empliciti™, and Sprycel®. Prior to this role, Dr. Giordano held positions of increasing responsibility within the research and development organization, leading the development of more than a dozen molecules in the United States, the European Union and Asia. Before joining BMS, he served as Assistant Professor of Medicine and Founding Director of the Cornell Clinical Trials Unit, a National Institutes of Health and Industry supported AIDS clinical trials center at New York Hospital-Cornell University Medical Center. He earned his M.D. and completed his residency and fellowship training at The New York Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical and received his B.A. in Natural Sciences cum laude from The Johns Hopkins University.\n“FLX Bio, with its integrated drug discovery, preclinical and clinical development capabilities under one roof and its deep expertise in cancer biology, is positioned to address key immuno-suppressive pathways in cancer,” commented Dr. Giordano. “I believe the company has tremendous potential to bring revolutionary new therapies to patients in need of therapeutic alternatives, and I am excited to be a part of this effort.”\nAbout FLX Bio\nFLX Bio, Inc. is an immuno-oncology company focused on the discovery and development of orally-available, small molecule drugs to activate the immune system and eradicate cancer. Using its integrated immuno-oncology drug discovery platform, FLX Bio’s small molecule compounds specifically target proteins and pathways important for regulatory T cells or myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment. Its lead candidate FLX475, a best-in-class CCR4 inhibitor, entered Phase 1 studies in December 2017 and has the potential to be used alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors to treat a variety of cancers. The company employs a precision medicine strategy for prospective patient selection in clinical studies, applying its robust computational and translational biology capabilities to identify key biomarkers that should maximize clinical response and increase the probability of clinical success. In addition, FLX is developing small molecule inhibitors of GCN2, a stress response kinase that detects amino acid starvation in the tumor microenvironment, and USP7, a therapeutic target involved in multiple cancer pathways.\nLocated in South San Francisco, Calif., and funded by leading investors, including The Column Group (TCG), Kleiner Perkins (KP), Topspin Partners, GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Celgene Corporation, FLX Bio has assembled a leadership team and advisory group with a proven track record of success and team of scientists with substantial knowledge and expertise in drug discovery and translational areas essential to execute on this approach.
