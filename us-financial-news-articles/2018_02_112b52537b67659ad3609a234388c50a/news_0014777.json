Derek Forbort had three assists while Andy Andreoff and Alex Iafallo each had one.\nAaron Ekblad scored for the Panthers, and Denis Malgin and Mike Matheson added helpers.\nRookie goalie Harri Sateri posted 23 saves for Florida.\nThe win opened the Kings’ season-long 7-game road trip, which moves to Tampa on Saturday for the second of a back-to-back.\nThe loss ended Florida’s bid for a fifth straight win to match its high for the season. The Panthers won five straight from Dec. 19-30.\nEkblad gathered a rebound off the end boards on a deflected shot by Malgin and flipped a shot from below the left circle over Quick for his 11th goal at 11:32 of the first period for a 1-0 lead.\nThe goal beat the Kings’ penalty-kill unit, which is tops in the NHL. Kyle Clifford went off for holding Jared McCann to give Florida the man-advantage.\nIn just his fourth season, Ekblad ranks third in organizational history among defensemen with 48 goals.\nThe 2014 overall No. 1 pick is tied for the third-most goals in his first four seasons among defensemen.\nShore scored his fourth goal when he fired a shot over Sateri from the slot at 3:09 to tie the game 1-1 in the second period.\nIt was Shore’s first goal since tallying in a 4-2 loss against Anaheim on Jan. 13.\nBrodzinski floated in a long backhander that tipped off Malgin’s glove and by Sateri for his third goal at 16:03 to give the Kings a 2-1 lead.\nKopitar chipped in his 22nd goal just 25 seconds into the third period for a 3-1 edge.\nThe Panthers begin a 5-game road trip through western Canada starting Monday in Edmonton.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:08:20.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
