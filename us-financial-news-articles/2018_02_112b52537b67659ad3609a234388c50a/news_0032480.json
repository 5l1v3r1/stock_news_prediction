The Treasury attributed the increase to the fiscal outlook, while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it was due to the new tax law, the Post reports.\nRieder said the Treasury's borrowing plan would increase supply in fixed-income markets at time of decreasing demand from the Federal Reserve , which is reducing the size of its portfolio of debt assets, and the European Central Bank , which is extinguishing its bond-buying program this year.\nOn Thursday, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury touched a new four-year high of 2.94 percent amid of new economic data that provided more evidence of inflation pressures.\nRieder first joined BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with more than $6 trillion of total assets under management, in 2009. He previously served as vice chairman and member of the borrowing committee for the U.S. Treasury. He also served as CEO Officer of R3 Capital Partners.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
