Siegel, Richard A. Helmick, and Ellen M. Edmundson are joining the firm as Senior Counsel, focusing largely on broadcast regulatory matters. The three were formerly with the storied communications law firm Cohn & Marks LLP, which is ceasing operations after 72 years.\nMr. Siegel brings decades of experience in communications law—including representation of broadcast, cable and other media, as well as programmers and telecommunications companies. Over the years, Mr. Siegel has played a major role in the legal and strategic issues involved in the relocation of TV broadcast facilities. Mr. Siegel proved instrumental in the development of the concept of telecommunications satellite centers-office parks and the establishment of the world’s first teleport on Staten Island, New York. Among his many accomplishments is his induction into the Cable TV Pioneers.\nMr. Helmick specializes in broadcast radio and television law with representation of both commercial broadcast clients and nonprofit educational and religious broadcasters. His expertise encompasses many facets of federal regulations governing broadcast radio and television, other media and common carrier operations that allow him to be well-versed in the legal issues which arise in connection with the day-to-day operations of broadcast stations, including matters such as advertising and promotional acceptability, political broadcasting, and technical compliance and programming related matters. Mr. Helmick also brings years of experience in handling complex litigation proceedings before the FCC and federal courts.\nMs. Edmundson brings nearly 40 years of communications law experience, representing broadcast-licensee clients in regulatory matters before the FCC, including licensing, day-to-day operational compliance, and complex regulated transactions. Prior to law school, Ms. Edmundson worked in the publicity and advertising departments for major recording labels in New York City, and wrote freelance about music business topics for national and international publications.\nMr. Siegel said, “As Cohn & Mark LLP winds down after 72 years, Ellen, Dick, and I wanted to assure that our clients would have access to the highest quality legal services available. WBK has an incredibly deep stable of attorneys steep in the representation of broadcasters, and our move assures that our clients will be well cared for. We are looking forward to this exciting new chapter.”\nBryan Tramont, Managing Partner of Wilkinson Barker Knauer, said, “We welcome Ron, Dick, Ellen, and their clients to the WBK Team. Their deep experience and passion for the law have made them leaders in the Bar and the media policy community. These are transformational times in the media economy, and we look forward to providing their clients with the highest quality of service.”\nWilkinson Barker Knauer, LLP, one of the largest law firms in the nation dedicated primarily to the practice of communications and energy law, is ranked as a “first tier” firm by Chambers USA (Telecom, Broadcast, and Satellite: Regulatory), and Legal 500 (Telecoms and broadcast: regulatory), and is the only firm to be named “Law Firm of the Year” in communications law multiple times by U.S. News - Best Lawyers (2012, 2014, & 2018). The firm, with offices in Washington, D.C. and Denver, Colorado, advises clients ranging from global Fortune 100 companies to small start-ups in regulatory, transactional, privacy, consumer protection, intellectual property, corporate and litigation matters involving all aspects of communications and energy law, at both the state and federal levels.\nMr. Siegel, Mr. Helmick, and Ms. Edmundson will be resident in the firm’s Washington D.C. office.
