Forward Derek Ogbeide added a season-high 16 off the bench.\nGuard Lamonte Turner scored 14 points and forward Kyle Alexander had a double-double with 10 points and 13 rebounds for the Vols (19-7, 9-5).\nGeorgia pulled away from a two-point halftime lead out to a 10-point cushion, 38-28, in the first three minutes of the second half and was still up 46-37 with 11:21 left in the game before Tennessee began chipping away.\nThe Vols got within 51-49 at the 7:35 mark, but fell back 57-51 over the next couple of minutes, and Georgia rode out the win. Guard Tyree Crump’s 3-pointer gave Georgia a 62-54 lead with under two minutes to play.\nThe two teams struggled mightily trying to get shots to fall in the early going. It was 8-8 after nearly nine minutes had been played.\nApproaching the six-minute mark of the first half, the Bulldogs and Vols were a combined 10-of-38 (26.3 percent) from the field, and Georgia was clinging to a 15-10 lead.\nBut the two teams both began finding the mark with some regularity in the remaining time, and the Bulldogs went to the locker room up 28-26 at the break after leading 21-12 with under five minutes left in the period.\nGeorgia was 8-of-23 (34.8 percent) for the first half to Tennessee’s 11-of-29 (37.9 percent). The 26 points were a season low in a first half for the Vols, who ended up shooting 34.9 percent for the game to Georgia’s 42.6.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:10:33.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
