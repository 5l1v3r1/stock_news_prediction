(NYSE:MSGN) today reported financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the fiscal 2018 second quarter, MSG Networks Inc. generated revenues of $181.2 million, an increase of 3% as compared with the prior year period. In addition, the Company generated operating income of $75.6 million, adjusted operating income of $82.8 million and income from continuing operations of $155.6 million. (1)(2)\nAs a result of the recently enacted Federal tax reform legislation, which reduces the Company's Federal tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018, fiscal 2018 second quarter income from continuing operations reflects a non-cash income tax benefit of approximately $106 million to reduce the Company’s net deferred tax liabilities.\nPresident and CEO Andrea Greenberg said, \"We are very pleased with our achievements so far this fiscal year. For the second quarter, we again delivered solid financial results, while also making important progress in expanding the reach of our networks. Underscoring our confidence in the strength of our business, we recently put in place a $150 million stock repurchase program - our first as a standalone media company. Looking ahead, we are confident about the Company’s outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and believe we are well positioned to create ongoing value for our shareholders.\"\nFiscal Year 2018 Second Quarter Results (In thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Revenues $ 181,222 Operating income 75,586 Adjusted operating income 82,807 Income from continuing operations 155,568 Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 2.05 See page 3 of this earnings release for the definition of adjusted operating income included in the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07. The adoption of this standard resulted in the non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented separately in the income statement from the service cost component and the non-service cost components to no longer be included in the subtotal for operating income. As this standard was applied retrospectively, the Company reclassified $0.3 million and $0.8 million of net periodic benefit cost from selling, general and administrative expenses and direct operating expenses to a separate line item within other income (expense) in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended December 30, 2016. Furthermore, all prior period amounts presented throughout this release reflect reclassifications made as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2017-07.\nSummary of Reported Results from Continuing Operations\nFiscal 2018 second quarter total revenues of $181.2 million increased 3%, or $5.6 million, as compared with the prior year period. Affiliation fee revenue increased $4.4 million, primarily due to higher affiliation rates, partially offset by the impact of a low single-digit percentage decrease in subscribers versus the prior year period. Advertising revenue increased $0.7 million, primarily due to a higher net decrease in deferred revenue related to ratings guarantees, partially offset by other net advertising decreases. Other revenues increased $0.5 million as compared with the prior year period.\nDirect operating expenses of $78.9 million increased 13%, or $9.0 million, as compared with the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher rights fees expense and, to a lesser extent, higher other programming-related cost increases. The increase in rights fees expense primarily reflects annual contractual rate increases and a step-up in expense related to the renewal of a rights agreement with the Buffalo Sabres, as well as additional league fees related to streaming rights and a shift in the timing of the recognition of certain other rights fees expense. The increase in other programming-related costs was primarily due to the absence of the positive impact of the finalization of a matter related to the sale of Fuse recorded in the prior year quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $24.3 million increased 6%, or $1.3 million, as compared with the prior year period, primarily due to higher employee compensation and related benefits (as a result of an increase in share-based compensation expense).\nOperating income of $75.6 million decreased 6%, or $4.6 million, as compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher selling, general and administrative expenses (including share-based compensation expense), partially offset by the increase in revenues.\nAdjusted operating income of $82.8 million decreased 4%, or $3.2 million, as compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses, partially offset by the increase in revenues.\nAbout MSG Networks Inc.\nAn industry leader in sports production, and content development and distribution, MSG Networks Inc. owns and operates two award-winning regional sports and entertainment networks, MSG Network (MSG) and MSG+, and a live streaming and video on demand platform, MSG GO. The networks are home to 10 professional sports teams, delivering live games of the New York Knicks; New York Rangers; New York Islanders; New Jersey Devils; Buffalo Sabres; New York Liberty; New York Red Bulls and the Westchester Knicks, as well as coverage of the New York Giants and Buffalo Bills. Each year, MSG and MSG+ collectively telecast approximately 500 live professional games, along with a comprehensive lineup of other sporting events, including college football and basketball, and critically-acclaimed original programming. The gold standard for regional broadcasting, MSG Networks has won 162 New York Emmy Awards over the past ten years.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe define adjusted operating income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as operating income before 1) depreciation, amortization and impairments of property and equipment and intangible assets, 2) share-based compensation expense or benefit, 3) restructuring charges or credits and 4) gains or losses on sales or dispositions of businesses. Because it is based upon operating income, adjusted operating income also excludes interest expense (including cash interest expense) and other non-operating income and expense items. We believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense or benefit allows investors to better track the performance of the Company without regard to the settlement of an obligation that is not expected to be made in cash.\nWe believe adjusted operating income is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of our Company. Adjusted operating income and similar measures with similar titles are common performance measures used by investors and analysts to analyze our performance. Internally, we use revenues and adjusted operating income measures as the most important indicators of our business performance, and evaluate management’s effectiveness with specific reference to these indicators. Adjusted operating income should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows from operating activities, and other measures of performance and/or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Since adjusted operating income is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures with similar titles used by other companies. For a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income, please see page 6 of this release.\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow (“Free Cash Flow”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, both of which are reported in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations excludes net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations. The Company believes the most comparable GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities. The Company believes that Free Cash Flow is useful as an indicator of its overall ability to generate liquidity, as the amount of Free Cash Flow generated in any period is representative of cash that is generated for debt repayment, investment, and other discretionary and non-discretionary cash uses. The Company also believes that Free Cash Flow is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors for comparison of the Company’s generation of liquidity with other companies in the industry, although the Company’s measure of Free Cash Flow may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations, please see page 8 of this release.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
