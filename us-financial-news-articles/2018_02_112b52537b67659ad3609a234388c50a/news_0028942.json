Ekblad, Malgin, Jonathan Huberdeau, Michael Matheson and Keith Yandle also had two-point nights for the visitors.\nFor the Oilers, Patrick Maroon and Connor McDavid collected one goal and one assist apiece, while Leon Draisaitl, also on a penalty shot, Anton Slepyshev and Drake Caggiula scored.\nNot only did the Oilers surrender the first goal in a game for the 33rd time in 55 outings, but they were torched for three more power-play goals against. Edmonton has allowed 38 man-advantage markers in its 28 home games.\nGoalie Cam Talbot stopped 33 shots for the Oilers, who are now on a four-game losing skid.\nThe score was 3-3 before Trocheck put the visitors on top 18 seconds into the third period. His second power-play goal of the night, at 6:05 of the third, doubled the lead, but Slepyshev replied for Edmonton 48 seconds later.\nDadonov’s penalty shot put Florida up 6-4 at 10:46, but McDavid’s goal at 14:58 kept the Oilers close.\nTrocheck’s empty-netter with exactly a minute left sealed the Panthers’ victory.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T15:27:20.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
