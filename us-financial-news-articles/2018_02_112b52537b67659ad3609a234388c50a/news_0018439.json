Bergeron has eight goals in his last nine games and 22 points in his last 16 contests.\nZdeno Chara scored the tiebreaking goal late in the first period and added an assist on Bergeron’s second goal. Riley Nash scored the tying goal in the first, and Tim Schaller and Sean Kuraly also scored for Boston, which gave coach Bruce Cassidy a win on the one-year anniversary of replacing Claude Julien.\nBackup goaltender Anton Khudobin stopped 21 shots for Boston.\nRick Nash, who recently was asked to waive a no-trade clause, scored the lone goal for the Rangers. New York lost its fourth straight since the All-Star break and fell for the eighth time in 11 games.\nHenrik Lundqvist was pulled for the third time in the last two weeks after allowing four goals on 16 shots.\nThe Rangers took a short-lived 1-0 lead when Rick Nash broke past two defenders on a breakaway five minutes into the game. Just 2:54 later, Riley Nash tied it for Boston by converting a cross-crease feed from David Backes into the vacated side of the net.\nChara gave Boston the lead for good shortly after keeping the puck alive in the offensive zone. From behind the net, he stole the puck from New York defenseman Stephen Kampfer and eventually worked his way back to the high slot where his shot through traffic beat Lundqvist to the stick side with 3:51 left in the first.\nBoston scored three times in a span of 6:13 in the second. Bergeron beat Lundqvist with a wrist shot 3:47 into the period and Schaller chased Lundqvist with a high shot off the crossbar from near the crease nearly four minutes later.\nBergeron scored his second goal during a New York power play by simply converting a nice pass through the crease from Brad Marchand and firing into the vacated net. Kuraly scored the final goal 6:34 into the third.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:47:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
