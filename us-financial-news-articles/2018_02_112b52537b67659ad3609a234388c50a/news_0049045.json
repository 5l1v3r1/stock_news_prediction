A report from Sky News late yesterday said that Lloyds will unveil a 1 billion pound ($1.40 billion) share buyback plan with its annual results, but Lloyds has declined to comment on the report. We've also got miner Glencore reporting full year figures, and a couple of UK housebuilders giving updates. More broadly, European fourth quarter earnings are expected to increase 14.6 percent from the same period in 2016, which would be an increase of 11.6 percent excluding the energy sector, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
