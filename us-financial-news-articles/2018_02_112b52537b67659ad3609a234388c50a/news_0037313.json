Brands like Chipotle, Redbox, The Home Depot, and PetSmart currently use Vibes’ solutions to drive more consumer engagement, encourage in-store device use, and increase conversations.\n\"Brian joins our team at a pivotal time in our business – and in the renaissance of messaging as a mobile marketing imperative. Brands now understand that they must approach mobile marketing as a holistic strategy rather than as a slice of their digital marketing initiatives,” said Jack Philbin, co-founder and CEO of Vibes. \"Brian’s expertise in building digital marketing applications and scaling high performance, highly automated SaaS platforms will provide us with the technical leadership needed to enter this new era of mobile marketing.”\nGarofola comes to Vibes with more than 15 years of experience leading software engineering teams. He previously served as the vice president of platform engineering at CDK Global, a global provider of information technology and digital marketing solutions to the automotive retail industry. He arrived at CDK through the acquisition of Promollis by ADP Dealer Services (now CDK) in 2007 where he was Co-Founder and Chief Architect. Promollis was a software consulting firm that worked with the largest privately held auto dealer group to help them increase transparency in the car buying process through the video recording of finance and insurance transactions.\n“Vibes is a one-of-a-kind mobile platform that enables marketers to run sophisticated campaigns and deliver compelling and profitable conversations at scale,” said Garofola. “We’re introducing marketers to new modes of communication with their audiences, and we’re employing highly relevant and fast-moving technology to do it. It’s a fun industry and a fantastic team.”\nFor information about Vibes, visit www.vibes.com .\nAbout Vibes\nVibes helps marketers increase revenue and engagement through technology and expertise.
