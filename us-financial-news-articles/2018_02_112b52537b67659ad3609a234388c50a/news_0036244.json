Lou Williams scored 19 points off the bench and ex-Celtic Avery Bradley, Austin Rivers and Milos Teodosic each added 10 for Los Angeles.\nKyrie Irving had a game-high 33 points and eight assists to pace the Celtics. Al Horford had 20 points, Terry Rozier and Marcus Morris each contributed 13 and Jaylen Brown added 12 in the losing effort.\nLos Angeles enters the All-Star break having won 13 of its last 18 games despite trading away franchise cornerstone Blake Griffin to Detroit during that stretch.\nBoston has dropped four of five entering the break.\nJordan went 8 of 9 from the free-throw line, with a number of those shots coming down the stretch in the clutch.\n“My teammates have a lot of confidence in me (at the line),” Jordan said. “Just doing the same routine and taking my time and just being patient.”\nAt one point, Jordan exchanged words with Celtics coach Brad Stevens, who implemented the hack-a-Jordan strategy, with Stevens telling Jordan he was playing the numbers game.\n“I think he’s a smart guy. So I was like, ‘Hey, I‘m 3-for-4 -- that’s 75 percent, that’s pretty good,” Jordan said he told Stevens.\nThe Celtics were outscored 36-28 in the final period.\nA back-and-forth third quarter featuring six ties and 12 lead changes produced a 93-91 lead for the Clippers. Irving had 15 points in the period and 29 through three.\nThe Clippers led by as many as 14 in the first half before the Celtics pulled within 61-57 at halftime.\nBoston won 113-102 when the teams first met Jan. 24 in Los Angeles.\nAs part of ESPN’s “The Crossover” special, legendary college basketball commentator Dick Vitale was part of the network’s broadcast team for the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:56:56.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
