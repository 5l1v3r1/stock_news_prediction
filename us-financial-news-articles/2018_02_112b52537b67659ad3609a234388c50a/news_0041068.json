If he takes no action, the bill automatically becomes law.\nIt is unclear what day the president received the bill from parliament but Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu said at a conference on Feb. 7 that the code was “with the president”.\nThat would give Kabila until Thursday at the latest to act. Asked about this, Kambila told Reuters: “The law has not been promulgated. That’s all I can tell you.”\nInternational mining companies in Congo, Africa’s largest copper producer, include Randgold, Glencore, China Molybdenum and Ivanhoe.\nThey are lobbying Kabila not to sign the new code, saying the proposed changes would discourage investment and violate existing agreements. Randgold has threatened to challenge the law through international arbitration.\nThe code could see royalties on cobalt, a vital component in electric car batteries, increase five-fold to 10 percent and it removes a stability clause in the current law protecting miners from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years.\nCongo is the world’s biggest source of cobalt, of which its output jumped 15.5 percent last year to 73,940 tonnes.\nReporting by Aaron Ross; Editing by Joe Bavier and David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T16:54:29.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
