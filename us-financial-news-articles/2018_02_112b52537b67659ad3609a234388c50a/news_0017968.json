While traditional immunotherapy discovery methods have largely used predictive methods to propose T cell targets, or antigens, Genocea has successfully developed ATLASâ„¢, its proprietary technology platform, to identify clinically relevant antigens of T cells based on actual human immune responses. Genocea uses ATLAS in immuno-oncology applications to develop neoantigen cancer vaccines while also exploring partnership opportunities for general cancer vaccines and a vaccine targeting cancers caused by Epstein-Barr Virus. Genocea expects to begin clinical development of its first neoantigen cancer vaccine, GEN-009, in 2018. Genocea is exploring strategic alternatives for GEN-003, its Phase 3-ready immunotherapy candidate for the treatment of genital herpes.\nFor media:\nJennifer LaVin\nGenocea Biosciences, Inc.\nO: 207-360-0473\nJennifer.lavin@genocea.com\nFor investors:\nJonathan Poole\nGenocea Biosciences, Inc.\nO: 617-715-7795\njonathan.poole@genocea.com\nSource:Genocea Biosciences, Inc.", "external_links": ["https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=OfaGg9OHEdnN0I66LnvO-pb112pRpu89gfCKAfvcLG2D0xd-97yOl6AQwdg0YZKWM99Y5hZeELThss8FgYHd3XsVVl7jmsA8I5g5AckWSLNTieNXQY5Yk3k8_3GoRl1Z", "https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/a96e7367-1813-41f6-a1b0-00c26ec4b0a9", "https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ThXXj8dGD0-6deU-U67dToy0TNhezi-y4nAO28Nn2Hx4QFSBS2W1DbP011iW_w-UZ52kS7gNog-1Xh-287yvDeGOIULKpfkOamY6qsQ-2zvmzFicFm1OeRXa8CKojsrA"], "published": "2018-02-08T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T16:55:22.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
