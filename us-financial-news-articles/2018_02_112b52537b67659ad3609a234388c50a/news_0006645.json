The auto giant’s autonomous cars were involved in 22 fender benders over the course of the reporting period (and two more in 2018). That’s one crash for every 5,985 miles of testing. \nThe reports are further evidence that the intense competition to create self-driving cars is — for now — a two-person race between Waymo and GM. That was also the message from Navigant’s leaderboard analysis released earlier this year. In a sign that Waymo and GM only have eyes for each other, Waymo’s Medium post on the news today accidentally linked to GM’s report rather than its own, as noted by Jalopnik’s Ryan Felton. (The link was later fixed.) \n@ryanfelton tweet \nNo other company came close to racking up the same number of miles as Waymo and GM. Drive.ai drove 6,127 miles; Nissan 5,007 miles; Zoox 2,244 miles; Bosch 2,052 miles; Aptiv 1,810 miles; and so on. (If you haven’t heard of some of these companies, don’t feel bad. Some are auto suppliers, others still fairly small startups.) \nSeveral major automakers like Ford , BMW, Honda , and Volkswagen reported driving zero miles autonomously on public roads in California. This shouldn’t be interpreted as these companies lagging in the self-driving race. Some are testing their vehicles in other states or countries, or on closed-course proving grounds. And the fact that they applied for permits from the DMV seems to indicate they will be testing at some point down the road.
