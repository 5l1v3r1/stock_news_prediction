The operator of Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotels said it would not pay out any additional capital to investors in 2018 as it announced a better-than-expected profit and a new strategy to speed growth.\nReckitt Benkiser fell for a second day as brokers cut their price targets on the stock, after a disappointing update and a vague outlook on Monday that sent its shares down more than six percent at a one-year low.\nTop gainers on the FTSE were shares in Evraz, up four percent after the steel making and mining company inked a $2 billion supply deal with Russia.\nAmong mid caps, Fidessa soared 22 percent on news that Swiss banking software supplier Temenos is in advanced talks to buy the British trading software provider in a cash deal valuing Fidessa at about 1.41 billion pounds.\nHikma rose 8.4 percent after it named former Teva executive Sigurdur Olafsson as its CEO, as the drugmaker looks to improve its struggling generics business.\nA “tough” first half homewares retailer Dunelm down eight percent to lead mid cap losers.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni, Editing by William Maclean\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:11:02.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
