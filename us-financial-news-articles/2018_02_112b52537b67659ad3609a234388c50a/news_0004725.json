Georgia Tech capitalized with three free throws to extend the lead.\nSyracuse had one last surge. Tyrus Battle knocked down a 3-pointer to trim the deficit to five with 1:48 to play.\nThe Yellow Jackets answered. Lammers had a put-back off an offensive rebound with a minute left, and Okogie had a breakaway dunk late to help the Yellow Jackets hold off Syracuse, which had its three-game winning streak end.\nBattle scored 19 points to lead the Orange (15-7, 4-5), and Oshae Brissett and Howard each added 11 points.\nIn a battle of defensive-minded squads, the game was a grind from the beginning. Syracuse had just one field goal in the first 10 minutes and trailed 14-5. Georgia Tech was unable to take full advantage of the Orangeâ€™s cold start, though. Jackson hit a late 3-pointer to help the Yellow Jackets take a 24-21 lead into halftime.\nBoth teams tried to push the pace whenever they could, looking for opportunities before the half-court defenses got set. Jackson got behind the Syracuse defense for a couple of easy baskets in the second half. Okogie got loose for a breakaway dunk that gave Georgia Tech a 46-40 lead with five minutes to play.\nThe Orange got off to a 1-4 start to conference play but rebounded to win three straight before falling to the Yellow Jackets.\nGeorgia Tech travels to Boston College on Sunday. Syracuse returns home to host No. 2 Virginia on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T11:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T15:48:19.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
