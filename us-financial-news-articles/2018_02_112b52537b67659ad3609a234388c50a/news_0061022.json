It’s not our position to challenge that.”\nUS regulators said they are open to revising restrictions on leveraged lending, offering an olive branch to a Republican-controlled Congress keen to roll back banking regulations. The response from regulators indicated a desire to avoid a protracted battle with a Congress.\nLeveraged lending, which has been under intense regulatory scrutiny for the past four years, was not listed as a priority for the OCC in 2018.\nThe Comptroller of the Currency is the administrator of the federal banking system and chief officer of the OCC. The OCC supervises nearly 1,400 national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks operating in the US.\nReporting by Eleanor Duncan; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Jack Doran\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-28T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T13:27:14.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
