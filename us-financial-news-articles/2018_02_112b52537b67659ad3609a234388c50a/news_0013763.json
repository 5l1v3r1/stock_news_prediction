(NYSE: TCO) today reported financial results for the quarter and full year periods ended December 31, 2017.\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Year Ended Year Ended Net income attributable to common\nshareowners, diluted (in thousands) $20,291\n$29,361\n$55,381\n$107,615\nGrowth rate\n(30.9)% (48.5)% Net income attributable to common\nshareowners (EPS) per diluted common share $0.33\n$0.48\n$0.91\n$1.77\nGrowth rate\n(31.3)% (48.6)% Funds from Operations (FFO) per diluted\ncommon share $1.02\n$1.10\n$3.51\n$3.91\nGrowth rate\n(7.3)%\n(10.2)%\nAdjusted Funds from Operations (Adjusted\nFFO) per diluted common share $1.03 (1)\n$1.01 (2)\n$3.70 (1)\n$3.58 (2)\nGrowth rate\n2.0% 3.4% (1) Adjusted FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 excludes a restructuring charge, costs associated with shareowner activism, and a gain recognized upon the conversion of the company’s remaining investment in Simon Property Group Limited Partnership units (SPG LP Units) to common shares of SPG. Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2017 also excludes a charge recognized in connection with the partial write-off of deferred financing costs related to an amendment of the company's primary line of credit in February 2017.\n(2) Adjusted FFO for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016 excludes costs associated with shareowner activism and a gain, net of tax, recognized upon the conversion of a portion of the company’s investment in SPG LP Units to common shares of SPG. Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2016 also excludes a one-time payment the company received in the second quarter due to the termination of the company’s leasing services agreement at The Shops at Crystals (Las Vegas, Nev.).\n“Notwithstanding a very challenging retail environment, we saw growth in nearly all our key metrics in 2017,” said Robert S. Taubman, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Taubman Centers. “Adjusted FFO, sales, occupancy and average rent were up, and total NOI increased over 10 percent, primarily due to the growth of our newest assets in the U.S. and Asia. We continue to execute on our promise to deliver growth and value to shareholders.”\nOperating Statistics\nFor the year, comparable center NOI was up 1.7 percent (up 0.7 percent excluding lease cancellation income). For the fourth quarter, comparable center NOI was up 0.1 percent (up 0.5 percent excluding lease cancellation income). Comparable center NOI for the year and the quarter benefited from favorable net recoveries and other income. Higher bad debt expense impacted the year-to-date and quarterly comparable center NOI by 0.8 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively.\nComparable center mall tenant sales per square foot were $810 for 2017, an increase of 2.3 percent from 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 was up 3.2 percent. “This marked our sixth consecutive quarter of positive sales growth, and Holiday sales were especially encouraging,” said Mr. Taubman.\nEnding occupancy in comparable centers was 95 percent at year-end, up 0.3 percent from 94.7 percent on December 31, 2016. Ending occupancy in all centers was 94.8 percent, up 0.9 percent from last year.\nLeased space in comparable centers was 96 percent at year-end, essentially flat compared to December 31, 2016. Leased space in all centers was 95.9 percent, up 0.3 percent from last year.\nFor the year, average rent per square foot in comparable centers was $61.66, up 1 percent from $61.07 in 2016. For the fourth quarter, average rent per square foot in comparable centers was $61.35, up 0.6 percent from $60.97 last year.\nThe trailing 12-month releasing spread per square foot for the period ended December 31, 2017 was 5 percent. This spread was impacted, for the third quarter in a row, by a small number of spaces that opened in early 2017. These spaces have an average lease term of less than two-and-a-half years. Without these leases, the spread was nearly 15 percent.\n“As the retail environment continues to stabilize, we’re seeing very good demand for space in our centers,” said Mr. Taubman. “Occupancy, rent, and sales are all at, or near, all-time highs.”\n2017 Milestones, Events and Financing Activities\nDuring 2017, the company:\nAmended and restated the company’s primary revolving line of credit, which included a new, unsecured, $300 million term loan and an extension of the $1.1 billion revolving credit facility to February 2021, with two six-month extension options. Both the term loan and the revolving line of credit facility bear interest at a range based on the company’s total leverage ratio.

TAUBMAN CENTERS, INC.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company uses certain non-GAAP operating measures, including EBITDA, beneficial interest in EBITDA, Net Operating Income, and Funds from Operations. These measures are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures. Additional information as to the use of these measures are as follows.\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of the Operating Partnership's consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. Beneficial interest in EBITDA represents the Operating Partnership’s share of the earnings before interest, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses. The Company believes EBITDA and beneficial interest in EBITDA provide useful indicators of operating performance, as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure.\nThe Company uses Net Operating Income (NOI) as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers, both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases. The Company defines NOI as property-level operating revenues (includes rental income excluding straight-line adjustments of minimum rent) less maintenance, taxes, utilities, promotion, ground rent (including straight-line adjustments), and other property operating expenses. Since NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, pre-development charges, interest income and expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, restructuring charges, and gains from peripheral land and property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared period over period, reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties, as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales, occupancy and rental rates, and operating costs. The Company also uses NOI excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period, which can affect comparability and trend analysis. The Company generally provides separate projections for expected comparable center NOI growth and lease cancellation income. Comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period presented, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity. In addition, The Mall of San Juan has been excluded from “comparable center” statistics as a result of Hurricane Maria and the expectation that the center’s performance will be impacted for the foreseeable future.\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines Funds from Operations (FFO) as net income (computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of REITs. The Company primarily uses FFO in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation.\nThe Company may also present adjusted versions of NOI, beneficial interest in EBITDA, and FFO when used by management to evaluate operating performance when certain significant items have impacted results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items. The Company believes the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand management's view on comparability of such measures between periods. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, FFO and EBITDA were adjusted to exclude a restructuring charge, costs incurred associated with shareowner activism, and a gain recognized upon the conversion of the Company's remaining investment in SPG LP Units to common shares of SPG. For the year ended December 31, 2017, FFO was also adjusted for a charge recognized in connection with the partial write-off of deferred financing costs related to an amendment of the Company's primary unsecured revolving line of credit in February 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, EBITDA was also adjusted to exclude a gain recognized in connection with the sale of the Valencia Place office tower at Country Club Plaza. For the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, FFO and EBITDA were adjusted to exclude costs incurred associated with shareowner activism and a gain, net of tax recognized upon the conversion of a portion of the Company's investment in SPG LP Units to common shares of SPG. For the year ended December 31, 2016, FFO and EBITDA were also adjusted to exclude the lump sum payment received in May 2016 for the termination of the Company's third party leasing agreement at The Shops at Crystals (Crystals) due to a change in ownership of the center. These non-GAAP measures as presented by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions. These measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Additionally, these measures do not represent cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities as defined by GAAP. The Company also provides its beneficial interest in certain financial information of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. This beneficial information is derived as the Company’s ownership interest in the investee multiplied by the specific financial statement item being presented. Investors are cautioned that deriving the Company’s beneficial interest in this manner may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of holding a non-controlling interest in the investee.\nThese non-GAAP measures as presented by the Company are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other REITs due to the fact that not all REITs use the same definitions.
