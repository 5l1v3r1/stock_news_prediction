The median earnings for Americans between 25 and 34 years old is $40,352 , meaning the 16 percent with $100,000 in savings are well ahead of schedule.\nHow much should you have stashed away at other ages?\nWhile the amount you need in savings is highly personal, and specific dollar amounts can be arbitrary, money expert at Intuit Kimmie Greene has a simple formula to help you figure out if you're setting aside enough money.\nIn your 20s: Aim to save 25 percent of your overall gross pay, Greene tells CNBC Make It . \"That 25 percent is the combination of 401(k) withholdings, matching funds from your employer and any cash savings that you have,\" she notes. \"It can also include debt repayment.\n\"Just make sure your lifestyle expenses don't exceed 75 percent of your gross income.\"\nshow chapters Retirement in America is changing rapidly      8:26 AM ET Thu, 9 March 2017 | 00:56 By age 30: Have the equivalent of your annual salary saved, Greene says.

You may have to adjust accordingly and save more or less in any given year, depending on major life events, such as having a kid or buying a home.\nAt the end of the day, the sooner you start saving — for retirement or any other major purchases you hope will be in your future — the better off you'll be.\nTo start spending less and saving more, check out these helpful resources:\n8 strategies for saving money from a couple that banked $50,000 last year After living on $60 a week for a month, here are my 7 best money-saving tips 11 useless things to stop wasting your money on in 2017 This is an update of a previously published article . \nLike this story?
