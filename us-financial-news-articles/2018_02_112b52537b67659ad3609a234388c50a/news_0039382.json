Champions Real visit Real Betis the same day.\nBarca also stretched their unbeaten run in the league to 31 games across two seasons, matching a club record set by Pep Guardiola’s side in April 2011.\n“It was very important for us to win today after the two draws,” said Barca coach Ernesto Valverde.\n“They (Eibar) pushed us very hard and played at a very high level. We struggled in the second half and took a long time to get into their area but it was easier once they went a man down.”\nValverde fielded a full-strength starting 11 despite the fact his side face a vital Champions League last-16 first-leg game at Chelsea on Tuesday, and he started veteran midfielder Andres Iniesta over record signing Philippe Coutinho, even though the Brazilian is Cup-tied from European games.\nThe coach insisted he was not concerned by the manner in which his side struggled against Eibar so close to the clash with Chelsea.\n“I‘m not really worried. Our objective was to win again after drawing the two games,” he said. “Everyone suffers against Eibar away from home -- no-one wins easily here. Tuesday is another story and we’ll try to play well over there.”\nSLICE OF FORTUNE Elsewhere on Saturday Sevilla warmed up for their Champions League game against Manchester United by winning 2-1 away to relegation-fighting Las Palmas to go fifth, provisionally, in the standings, above Villarreal.\nVincenzo Montella’s side marched into a two-goal lead through strikes from Wissam Ben Yedder and Pablo Sarabia either side of halftime.\nThe home team pulled a goal back through Jonathan Calleri’s converted penalty and Sevilla enjoyed a huge slice of fortune when Alejandro Galvez scored for Las Palmas in injury time but his chipped goal was incorrectly ruled offside.\nDeportivo La Coruna suffered a second straight defeat under Clarence Seedorf, the Dutch coach’s side losing 1-0 at Alaves to a scorching strike from former Barcelona loanee Munir El Haddadi. Deportivo remain second-bottom of the standings on 17 points while Alaves move 10 clear of the relegation zone.\nReporting by Richard Martin,; Editing by Neville Dalton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T21:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T22:03:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
