I can’t do this because I need my training during the week in the technical disciplines.”\nFor now, the combined remains on the FIS’s draft World Cup calendar for the next two seasons, a spokeswoman for the ruling body said, but the plan is to move towards replacing it with parallel events by the 2021 world championships.\nThe combined event’s Olympic future remains unclear.\nSilver medallist Alexis Pinturault of France echoed Hirscher, telling reporters the combined was special because it determines the best overall skier.\n“Combined is a historic discipline,” he said.\n”It is going to be a shame if they decide to stop this discipline in the future and in the next Olympics.\n“It’s the only discipline where the best downhill guys can compete against the best tech guys,” Pinturault added.\nReporting by Rory Carroll, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:31:01.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
