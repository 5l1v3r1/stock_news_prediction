(NYSE:PZN) reported the following U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and non-GAAP basic and diluted net income and earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nGAAP Basis Non-GAAP Basis 1 For the Three Months Ended For the Three December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) Basic Net Income $ (1,046 ) $ 10,986 $ 3,597 $ 3,034 Basic Earnings Per Share $ (0.06 ) $ 0.67 $ 0.21 $ 0.18 Diluted Net Income 2 $ (1,046 ) $ 18,434 $ 13,633 $ 10,482 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2 $ (0.06 ) $ 0.27 $ 0.19 $ 0.15 GAAP Basis Non-GAAP Basis 1 For the Twelve Months Ended For the Twelve December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (unaudited) Basic Net Income $ 6,908 $ 16,179 $ 11,551 $ 7,958 Basic Earnings Per Share $ 0.40 $ 1.01 $ 0.67 $ 0.50 Diluted Net Income 2 $ 6,908 $ 39,600 $ 44,706 $ 31,379 Diluted Earnings Per Share 2 $ 0.40 $ 0.58 $ 0.63 $ 0.46 1 Please refer to the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations on Page 12 of this release for a reconciliation to the GAAP financial measures. 2 During the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the calculation of GAAP diluted earnings per share resulted in an increase in earnings per share. Therefore, diluted net income and diluted earnings per share are assumed to be equal to basic net income and basic earnings per share.\nGAAP diluted net income and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $(1.0) million and $(0.06), respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $18.4 million and $0.27, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. GAAP diluted net income and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $6.9 million and $0.40 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, and $39.6 million and $0.58, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nIn evaluating the results of operations, management also reviews non-GAAP measures of earnings, which are adjusted to exclude changes in the deferred tax asset and corresponding liability to the Company's selling and converting shareholders associated with a prior period adjustment, the release of the valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Management believes that these accounting items add a measure of non-operational complexity which obscures the underlying performance of the business. Management uses the non-GAAP measures to assess the strength of the underlying operations of the business. It believes the non-GAAP measures provide information to further analyze the Company's operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider the non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared\nAs adjusted, non-GAAP diluted net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $13.6 million and $0.19, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and $44.7 million and $0.63, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As adjusted, non-GAAP diluted net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $10.5 million and $0.15, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, and $31.4 million and $0.46, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. GAAP and non-GAAP net income for diluted earnings per share generally assume all operating company membership units are converted into Company stock at the beginning of the reporting period, and the resulting change to Company GAAP and non-GAAP net income associated with its increased interest in the operating company is taxed at the Company's effective tax rate, exclusive of the adjustments noted above and other adjustments. When this conversion results in an increase in earnings per share or a decrease in loss per share, diluted net income and diluted earnings per share are assumed to be equal to basic net income and basic earnings per share for the reporting period.\nIn December 2017, the Company changed the classification of assets under management (\"AUM\") to better reflect the composition of its client base. The Company now groups its assets into three new categories: Separately Managed Accounts, Sub-Advised Accounts, and Pzena Funds, which better illustrate the characteristics inherent in its client relationships. Historical data has been reclassified for all periods presented and did not impact reported totals of AUM.\nAssets Under Management\n(unaudited) 1 ($ billions) For the Three Months Ended For the Twelve September 30, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 2017 2016 Separately Managed Accounts Assets Beginning of Period $ 14.3 $ 13.8 $ 11.5 $ 12.5 $ 11.0 Inflows 0.3 0.1 0.3 1.4 1.7 Outflows (0.5 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) (1.6 ) (2.0 ) Net Flows (0.2 ) (0.2 ) — (0.2 ) (0.3 ) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) 0.9 0.7 1.0 2.7 1.8 End of Period $ 15.0 $ 14.3 $ 12.5 $ 15.0 $ 12.5 Sub-Advised Accounts Assets Beginning of Period Assets $ 19.7 $ 18.2 $ 14.8 $ 16.3 $ 14.1 Inflows 1.3 0.8 1.1 3.5 2.6 Outflows (0.7 ) (0.3 ) (1.1 ) (1.8 ) (2.9 ) Net Flows 0.6 0.5 — 1.7 (0.3 ) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) 1.5 1.0 1.5 3.8 2.5 End of Period $ 21.8 $ 19.7 $ 16.3 $ 21.8 $ 16.3 Pzena Funds Assets Beginning of Period Assets $ 1.4 $ 1.5 $ 1.1 $ 1.2 $ 0.9 Inflows 0.3 — 0.1 0.5 0.3 Outflows — (0.1 ) — (0.3 ) (0.2 ) Net Flows 0.3 (0.1 ) 0.1 0.2 0.1 Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) — — — 0.3 0.2 End of Period $ 1.7 $ 1.4 $ 1.2 $ 1.7 $ 1.2 Total Assets Beginning of Period $ 35.4 $ 33.5 $ 27.4 $ 30.0 $ 26.0 Inflows 1.9 0.9 1.5 5.4 4.6 Outflows (1.2 ) (0.7 ) (1.4 ) (3.7 ) (5.1 ) Net Flows 0.7 0.2 0.1 1.7 (0.5 ) Market Appreciation/(Depreciation) 2.4 1.7 2.5 6.8 4.5 End of Period $ 38.5 $ 35.4 $ 30.0 $ 38.5 $ 30.0 Financial Discussion\nRevenue (unaudited) ($ thousands) For the Three September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Separately Managed Accounts $ 20,416 $ 19,756 $ 16,206 Sub-Advised Accounts 15,565 14,073 10,856 Pzena Funds 2,928 2,400 2,011 Total $ 38,909 $ 36,229 $ 29,073 For the Twelve December 31, 2017 2016 Separately Managed Accounts $ 76,419 $ 61,165 Sub-Advised Accounts 55,003 40,018 Pzena Funds 9,873 7,153 Total $ 141,295 $ 108,336\nRevenue was $38.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 7.4% from $36.2 million for the third quarter of 2017 and 33.8% from $29.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncluded in these amounts for the fourth quarter of 2017 were performance fees recognized of $1.5 million, an increase from $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2017 and from $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAverage assets under management for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $36.8 billion, increasing 7.0% from $34.4 billion for the third quarter of 2017, and 29.1% from $28.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily reflects market appreciation and net inflows.\nThe weighted average fee rate was 0.423% for the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing from 0.421% for the third quarter of 2017, and from 0.408% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe weighted average fee rate for separately managed accounts was 0.560% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.563% for the third quarter of 2017, and 0.549% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease from the third quarter of 2017 reflects a decrease in assets in our Focused Value strategies that generally carry higher fee rates. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects an increase in performance fees recognized.\nThe weighted average fee rate for sub-advised accounts was 0.302% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 0.298% for the third quarter of 2017, and 0.280% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016 primarily reflects an increase in performance fees recognized. In addition, certain accounts related to one sub-advised relationship have fulcrum fee arrangements. These fee arrangements require a reduction in the base fee, or allow for a performance fee if the relevant investment strategy underperforms or outperforms, respectively, the agreed-upon benchmark over the contract's measurement period, which extends to three years. During the fourth quarter of 2016 a reduction in base fees related to these fee arrangements was recognized. A reduction in base fees was not recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017 due to improved relative performance, contributing to the increase in weighted average fee rate. To the extent the three-year performance records of these accounts fluctuate relative to their relevant benchmarks, the amount of base fees recognized may vary.\nThe weighted average fee rate for Pzena funds was 0.737% for the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing from 0.660% for the third quarter of 2017 and from 0.684% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016 reflects an increase in performance fees recognized. The increase from the third quarter of 2017 also reflects an increase in assets in non-U.S. strategies that generally carry higher fee rates.\nTotal operating expenses were $18.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing from $17.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 and from $15.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses from the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflects an increase in general and administrative costs, partially offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense during the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in general and administrative costs from the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016 primarily reflects an increase in professional fees and travel expenses. The decrease in compensation expense from the third quarter of 2017 reflects a one-time charge recognized in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in compensation expense from the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects an increase in headcount and compensation rates.\nOperating Expenses (unaudited) ($ thousands) For the Three September 30, December 31, 2017 2017 2016 Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 14,223 $ 14,763 $ 12,366 General and Administrative Expense 3,752 3,062 2,998 Operating Expenses $ 17,975 $ 17,825 $ 15,364 For the Twelve December 31, 2017 2016 Compensation and Benefits Expense $ 58,904 $ 48,330 General and Administrative Expense 13,337 12,788 Operating Expenses 72,241 61,118\nAs of December 31, 2017, employee headcount was 105, down from 108 at September 30, 2017 and up from 100 at December 31, 2016.\nThe operating margin was 53.8% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 50.8% for the third quarter of 2017, and 47.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOther income/ (expense) was income of approximately $22.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, income of $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, and an expense of $48.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Other income/ (expense) includes the gains and other investment income recognized by the Company on its direct investments, the majority of which are held to satisfy obligations under its deferred compensation plan, as well as those recognized by external investors on their investments in investment partnerships that the Company consolidates. A portion of gains and other investment income associated with the investments of outside interests are offset in net income attributable to non-controlling interests. Other income/ (expense) for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $20.8 million of income associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Changes in the liability to selling and converting shareholders associated with changes in the deferred tax asset generated an expense of $50.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 associated with the release of the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset.

Income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $26.5 million in income tax expense resulting from the re-measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in the United States. Income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2016 included $60.0 million in income tax benefit associated with the release of the valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax asset.\nExcluding changes in the realizability and expected future tax benefits associated with the deferred tax asset recognized during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, the Company has recognized income tax expenses of $2.6 million, $2.5 million, and $0.6 million for the fourth and third quarters of 2017, and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2016 reflects a $0.7 million benefit associated with the reversal of uncertain tax position liabilities and interest related to unincorporated and other business tax expenses.

On January 30, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors approved a year-end dividend of $0.42 per share of its Class A common stock. The following dates apply to the dividend:\nRecord Date: February 16, 2018\nPayment Date: March 2, 2018\nDuring the last twelve months, inclusive of the dividend noted above, the Company declared total dividends of $0.51 per share of its Class A common stock.\nChange in Dividend Policy\nOn January 30, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors determined that it intends to reduce the targeted cash dividend payout ratio from 70% to 80% of non-GAAP diluted net income to 60% to 70% of non-GAAP diluted net income. Barring any changes in the Company’s financial condition, with the beneficial impact of the lower future effective tax rate due to the corporate tax rates enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we should expect to maintain the absolute level of the dividend despite the reduction in payout ratio. The Board regularly reviews the Company's long-term capital allocation strategy and determined that it is prudent to have additional financial flexibility to allow for investment in future business initiatives, while still returning a meaningful cash dividend to shareholders.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Call Information\nPzena Investment Management, Inc.
