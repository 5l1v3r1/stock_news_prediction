That left the Orange with a 4-2 lead after over four minutes in.\nSyracuse finally began finding the range and pulled out to a 16-9 lead with just over 11 minutes played as Miami continued to struggle from the field, making only one of its next five shots.\nBut then the Orange reverted to their cold-shooting ways and the Hurricanes fought back to take their first lead since an early 8-7 lead to take a 21-20 on guard Lonnie Walker’s driving bank shot at the 2:14 mark.\nThey ended the first 20 minutes deadlocked at 25 as both teams blew opportunities for leads. Miami turned the ball over with 5.1 seconds left when the arrow on tie-up favored the Orange, but guard Tyus Battle’s running jumper was short at the buzzer.\nWalker opened the second half with a 3-pointer to give Miami a quick 28-25 lead, but the Hurricanes missed their next five shots while the Orange went on an 13-0 run, making all six of their attempts, for a 10-point bulge less than five minutes into the period.\nThey stretched that to 40-28 before Miami scored again on Lyke’s 3-pointer to ignite a comeback that resulted in a 43-43 tie with 9:34 left in the game.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T20:13:27.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
