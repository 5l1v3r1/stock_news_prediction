Additionally, SIGNA Holding GmbH has withdrawn its offer, thus concluding discussions.\n“The Board has unanimously concluded that Signa’s proposal is not in the best interest of HBC’s shareholders. It significantly undervalues our German business and related real estate assets and is not supported by sufficient certainty of financing to warrant further consideration at this time,” said David Leith, lead independent Director of the Board.\n“Our European business and related real estate assets represent critical components of our long-term strategy and we continue to have a high degree of confidence in our ability to drive results across our iconic retail banners. Our diverse European real estate holdings add significant value to our global real estate assets and we remain committed to creating opportunities to improve the productivity of our portfolio. The Company appreciates the interest in its European business and real estate assets, which validates the Company’s view of the considerable underlying value these assets provide to HBC’s shareholders. As always, we remain committed to any and all opportunities to enhance shareholder value,” said Richard Baker, HBC’s Governor, Executive Chairman and interim CEO.\nAbout HBC\nHBC is a diversified global retailer focused on driving the performance of high-quality stores and their all-channel offerings, growing through acquisitions, and unlocking the value of real estate holdings.
