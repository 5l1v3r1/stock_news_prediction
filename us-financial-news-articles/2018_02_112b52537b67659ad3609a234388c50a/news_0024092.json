He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone. \nThe lawsuit alleges that Weinstein sexually harassed employees and abused women for years. It says that Weinstein Company executives, including his brother and co-CEO Bob, failed to act despite repeatedly being presented with credible evidence of his sexual harassment and misconduct. \nThe Weinstein Company and a spokeswoman for Harvey Weinstein were not immediately available for comment.

REUTERS/Joe Penney/File Photo \nSchneiderman is seeking an unspecified amount of restitution and damages, plus penalties, for harm to victims. \nAny sale of The Weinstein Company must ensure that victims will be compensated, Schneiderman said in a statement. \nThe studio has been in talks to sell itself to a group of investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but Schneiderman’s lawsuit has put deal negotiations on hold, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe New York Times first reported in October on multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the allegations. \nSince then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement has emerged of victims using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.
