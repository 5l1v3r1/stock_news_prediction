View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180201006665/en/\nAcquisition of a leading player in the healthcare market\nEnovacom is a French software publisher, established in Marseille in 2002, whose business is dedicated to e-health. A leader in the sector and an expert in interoperability, Enovacom designed a software suite to facilitate the exchange, sharing and security of data between all players in the healthcare system. Its solutions are found in over 1 500 healthcare institutions in France and abroad. In particular, Enovacom software is used to manage and secure hospitals’ electronic exchanges with their various partners.\nThis acquisition is a key step in Orange Healthcare’s growth. Beyond its infrastructure and certified healthcare data hosting solutions, Orange Healthcare wants to develop innovative solutions that will enable healthcare players to communicate with each other and stay in contact with patients throughout their treatment. The digitalisation and streamlining of care is a major issue for the industry and it is for this reason that Orange Business Services chose to invest in Enovacom. Its neutral position enables it to interface with all players on the market.\n“Incorporating the skills of a healthcare publisher like Enovacom enables us to move up the value chain to offer more comprehensive e-heath solutions to our customers and in particular to hospitals. By acquiring such an innovative and effective player, we are strengthening our growth strategy in the healthcare market, especially under the Territorial Hospital Groups (Groupements Hospitaliers de Territoire) reform, which has made communication between hospitals and equipment interoperability a major issue,” says Thierry Bonhomme, Deputy CEO of the Orange Group, in charge of Orange Business Services.\n“By joining forces with Orange Healthcare, Enovacom's customers will benefit from the Orange Group’s wide-ranging skills and capacity to innovate in cloud computing, communication infrastructure, security, connected objects and customer experience. I am overjoyed that through this deal, Enovacom will continue to grow with respect for and in the interest of its employees,” commented Laurent Frigara and Renaud Luparia, Chief Executives of Enovacom.\nAt the end of negotiations and subject to the usual suspensive conditions, Enovacom will become a subsidiary of Orange Business Services and will be operationally attached to Orange Healthcare, under the management of Elie Lobel. Laurent Frigara and Renaud Luparia will continue to play an active role in the development of the company as Deputy Chief Executives of Enovacom.\nThe closing of the operation is expected to be carried out in the coming weeks.\nAbout Orange Business Services\nWithin the Orange telecommunications group, the 21,000 Orange Business Services employees are dedicated to French and multinational businesses on all five continents, supporting them with their digital transformation on a daily basis.
