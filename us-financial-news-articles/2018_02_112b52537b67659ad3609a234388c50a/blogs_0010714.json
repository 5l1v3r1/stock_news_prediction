It was one of only two stocks on the S&P 500 to rise on the day. Church and Dwight closed up 2.4 percent. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average suffered its largest single-day point drop on Monday , going down almost 1,600 points before closing down 1,175. The S&P also experienced its biggest one-day decline since August 2011, closing down more than 7 percent down from the all-time high it set in January and below its 50-day moving average. \nDespite TripAdvisor's gains today, the company has been suffering from increased competition from AirBnB. TripAdvisor is the worst-performing tech stock in S&P 500 over the past year.
