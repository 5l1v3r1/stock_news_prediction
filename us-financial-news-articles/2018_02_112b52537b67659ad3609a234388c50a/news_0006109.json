Kingdom shares do not reflect that gain, suggesting investors are still discounting the stock.\nKingdom published a photo of Prince Alwaleed reviewing documents behind a large wooden desk and still sporting the grey beard he grew in detention.\n“We are very pleased to welcome back (His Royal Highness) Prince Alwaleed to continue his important work as Chairman of Kingdom Holding Company,” Chief Executive Talal Almaimansaid said.\nThe firm’s strategy is aligned with the Vision 2030 reform agenda “to create strong investor appeal and a business environment in which KHC and our partners can flourish”, he added.\nReporting By Stephen Kalin, editing by Larry King\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:24:49.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
