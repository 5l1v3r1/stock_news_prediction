Both reports were delayed a day due to a U.S. holiday on Monday.\nRising U.S. shale output should lead to a modest inventory build, said Stewart Glickman, an energy analyst at CFRA Research in New York\n\"U.S. shale continues to rise to the occasion,\" he said.\nHigher oil prices and rising output should feed increased investment in drilling and production, in turn boosting shale output more, he said.\nU.S. crude oil production surpassed 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in November for the first time since 1970. Rising U.S. shale output has hindered efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, led by Russia, to reduce bloated global inventories and prop up oil prices by cutting output.\nThe dollar index hit a one-week high after the release of minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's January policy meeting.\nA stronger dollar makes oil and other dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.\nOil gained some support from a rise on Wall Street markets.\n\"Oil prices and the S&P have been highly correlated, of late, with economic strength translating into improved company performance and higher energy demand,\" said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.\nFutures prices have been dented by physical crude markets, which are showing signs of seasonal weakness as refineries prepare to shutdown for maintenance between peak summer and winter fuel demand periods.\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T00:37:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
