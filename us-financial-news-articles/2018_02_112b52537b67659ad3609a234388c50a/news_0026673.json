It has played six of eight straight games at home.\nVancouver goalie Jacob Markstrom, who had his only career shutout in December against Carolina, was credited with 29 saves.\nThe Hurricanes kept the pressure on by posting 14 third-period shots, sending the Canucks to their fourth consecutive loss.\nPesce gave the Hurricanes a much-desired fast start after the team was too often stalling in that area in recent games. It came after a turnover in the neutral zone, with Jordan Staal and Aho picking up assists.\nThe franchise record for a defenseman’s quick strike had been held by current teammate Justin Faulk and retired Aaron Ward.\nDi Giuseppe delivered his first goal of the season after Elias Lindholm did much of the leg work on the sequence. Di Giuseppe was playing in his 22nd game of the season.\nSo Pesce, who picked up his only other goal earlier in this homestand, and Di Giuseppe had the game’s first two goals, yet they’ve now combined for only three all season.\nAho made it 3-0 on a breakaway with his 20th goal of the season. Pesce assisted on Aho’s goal for part of his two-point night.\nAho registered his fourth goal in six games since the All-Star break.\nCarolina’s victory came on a day of roster changes. The Hurricanes assigned forwards Josh Jooris and Marcus Kruger to the American Hockey League’s Charlotte Checkers after they passed through waivers. Those moves came following coach Bill Peters’ insistence last weekend that changes could be coming.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-10T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-10T14:02:35.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
