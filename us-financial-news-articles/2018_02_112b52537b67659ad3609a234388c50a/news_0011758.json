If you give them an inch, they’re going to make it a tough day. \n“They’ve got experienced players we’ve all played against and again it’s going to be a very physical battle,” the loose forward told a news conference on Monday. \nIreland kept pace with England by winning at the Stade de France, going through an extraordinary 41 phases to set up Johnny Sexton for the drop goal that won the game. \n“If you slip up once, it’s probably the end. Paris is a tough place to go. If we can work on and fix what we did prior to the drop goal, we can push on,” Stander added. \n“After the seventh or eighth phase you just switch off and go into a deep, dark place where all of us have been before in training,” said the Ireland number eight. \n“So you just keep pushing until something happens. It happened in our favour. As forwards, our perspective is to keep working hard and the backs will do some magic.” Reporting by Mark Gleeson; Editing by Ken Ferris", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T22:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T22:30:45.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
