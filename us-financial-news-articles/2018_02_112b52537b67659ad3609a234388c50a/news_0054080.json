Such bad luck.”\nAll Olympic sports have their heroes and minnows, but the contrast sometimes seems especially stark in Alpine skiing, where the elite athletes set out long before the rest and the result has usually been effectively decided long before the also-rans have competed.\nThe exception to the rule was Ester Ledecka, the Czech skier - better known as a world champion snowboarder - who caught both rivals and experts unawares by storming through to win the women’s super-G with starting bib number 26.\nBut generally, for those ranked outside the top flight, the lure of the Olympics is about representing their country, putting in a personal best, or simply sharing the stage with famous names like American Lindsey Vonn or Austrian Marcel Hirscher.\nYet in their hearts, if not their heads, they still dream of springing a surprise.\n“You always kind of say: ‘What if today is the magical day that I get a medal?’ I think everyone thinks that, even the last finishers,” said Chilean skier Noelle Barahona, who finished 25th in the women’s downhill and finds it a little annoying when the later starters are dismissed out of hand.\n”Sometimes it’s weird when we have tech (slalom) races and they do, like, the medal ceremony before the last people go - it’s like ‘Wait, I‘m still here’, you know? It’s a little bit bumming, like, ‘Oh man, nobody has faith in me.’\nFILE PHOTO - Alpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's Slalom - Yongpyong Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Muhammad Karim of Pakistan competes.

I don’t know, it’s just magical energy.”\n‘DOWNHILL DENTIST’\nThe long tail of also-rans is especially conspicuous in the slalom events, which are less fast and dangerous than the downhill and super-G and therefore more attractive to second-tier skiers.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Albin Tahiri, a newly qualified dentist who works in Slovenia but skis for Kosovo, had the rare distinction of completing all five individual Alpine events, his best result being 37th in the combined which includes both downhill and slalom.\n“Just being on the same course as the world’s top athletes is an honor for me,” he said at the slalom. “I think the audience respects all of us who are at the finish line.”\nPatrick Brachner, representing Azerbaijan, was less fortunate on his first run: “It was fun, until I straddled unfortunately. I got a gate between my legs.”\nNew Zealander Willis Feasey, who lives out of a suitcase and has not been home since October as he travels the World Cup circuit from Europe to North America and back, recorded mid-30s finishes in the super-G and giant slalom, but also came to grief on the first run of the slalom - as did team-mate Adam Barwood.\nFor the Pakistani Karim, it has been a tough Olympics: apart from his slalom failure, he managed only 72nd in the giant slalom, exactly one place lower than in Sochi four years ago.\nStill, he intends to be back.\n“When you hold your country’s flag at the Winter Olympics it’s so good for us... it’s a big thing for us,” he said.\n“Hopefully we will do more good training for the next Olympics and we improve our position.”\nReporting by Mark Trevelyan; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T07:03:10.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
