Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex with anyone.\nMamet gave few details of the play, and his representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jeffrey Richards, a Broadway producer with whom Mamet has collaborated often, also did not immediately respond.\nMamet explored the theme of sexual harassment in his controversial 1992 play “Oleanna” about a male university professor and a female student.\n“I think about this a lot now. I have a bunch of daughters, a young son,” Mamet said in the interview.\n“Every society has to confront the ungovernable genie of sexuality and tries various ways to deal with it and none of them work very well.”\nThe Tribune report said an unnamed “Chicago stage legend who is now a movie star” has expressed interest in the play’s lead role.\nMamet won a Pulitzer Prize in 1984 for his play “Glengarry Glen Ross” about male power set in the cut-throat world of real estate.\nReporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T21:39:43.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
