Over a 12-month period non-food sales showed their first annual decline in nine years.\n“The going remains bumpy as consumers are still seeing wages fall in real terms,” Dickinson said. “Although inflation will ease a bit this year these pressures will remain.”\nBritain’s inflation rate was pushed up by the fall in the pound after the 2016 Brexit vote and hit a nearly six-year high of 3.1 percent in November. The Bank of England expects that to prove a peak and is hoping that wage growth will catch up soon.\nConsumers are the main drivers of Britain’s economy which is growing more slowly than many other rich economies.\nPayments firm Barclaycard ( BARC.L ) painted a similar picture to the BRC on Tuesday, saying its card users upped the pace of spending on essentials in January while increases in spending on non-essentials slowed.\nOverall spending rose by an annual 3.9 percent, a touch slower than December’s increase of 4.0 percent and driven by the strongest increase in supermarket spending in seven months which was up 4.4 percent.\nBarclaycard Managing Director Paul Lockstone said January’s rise in overall spending represented a strong start to 2018.\n“But faltering confidence levels across the board suggests that consumers are feeling the effects of a post-Christmas slump, as well as the wider impact of inflation, on their everyday lives,” Lockstone said.\nReporting by William Schomberg, editing by Andy Bruce\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:01:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
