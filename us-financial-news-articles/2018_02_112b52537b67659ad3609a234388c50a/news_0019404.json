His appointment follows a comprehensive external search and has the full support of our major shareholders,” Ian Ashby, Petropavlovsk Chairman, said in a statement.\nDeniskin’s appointment was the board’s decision after a recruitment process, which was begun before Rakishev invested in the company, Rakishev said in an emailed statement to Reuters.\n“In my capacity as a shareholder I am not in a position, legally, to interfere in the process”, he added. Rakishev bought the stake in Petropavlovsk in late December.\nDeniskin, who was most recently Deputy Chairman of Kazakh mining firm Eurasian Resources Group, is expected to replace interim CEO Sergey Ermolenko in April, Petropavlovsk said.\nPetropavlovsk’s shares were down 0.1 percent in London at 1057 GMT.
