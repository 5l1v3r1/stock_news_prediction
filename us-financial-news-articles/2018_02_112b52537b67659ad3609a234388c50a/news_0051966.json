Nikita Kucherov and Yanni Gourde each had two assists, and Namestnikov also had a two-point game.\nRyan Dzingel, Mark Borowiecki and Derick Brassard scored for the Senators, who were playing the second of back-to-back contests. Mark Stone had two helpers, and Brassard added an assist.\nBackup goaltender Louis Domingue made 33 saves for Tampa Bay while Ottawa’s Craig Anderson had 20 stops.\nJohnson scored at 9:31 of the first period on a wrist shot that sailed over Anderson’s blocker for a 1-0 Lightning lead. Chris Kunitz slid the puck over from the boards to Johnson, who netted his 17th goal.\nJohnson’s marker broke a 17-game stretch without finding the net. His last goal was when he recorded a hat trick against the Carolina Hurricanes on Jan. 9 in Tampa.\nThe primary assist earned Kunitz, a four-time Stanley Cup winner, his 600th career point.\nDzingel took a backhanded pass from Stone and maneuvered past a sprawling Domingue to tie it 1-1 on his 16th goal at 14:54 of the first period.\nDzingel set a career high with the goal. Stone became the 32nd player in Ottawa history to skate in his 300th career game.\nHedman gave Tampa Bay its second lead when he skated through the left circle and beat Anderson from in close for his ninth goal at 16:26 of the opening period for a 2-1 edge.\nKucherov set up Namestnikov for his 20th goal 3:37 into the second period for a 3-1 lead.\nPoint scored his 24th from the low slot with one second left in the second for a 4-1 lead.\nBorowiecki scored his third on a rebound goal at 8:11 of the third period.\nBrassard’s 18th goal at 17:44 came on the power play with Anderson pulled and an extra skater on the ice, but the Senators couldn’t produce a tying goal.\nTampa Bay improved its NHL-best records on the road in a number of categories. The Lightning are tops in road wins (21), road points (44), road goals (118) and road scoring differential (plus-27).\nThe 41-17-3 start through 61 games is the best in Lightning history.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T11:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:07:40.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
