(\"Sierra\"), one of the largest shareholders of Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. (\"Safeguard,\" or the \"Company\")(NYSE: SFE), with ownership of approximately 5.1% of the Company's outstanding shares, issued a statement today announcing that it is preparing to nominate a slate of highly-qualified individuals for election to Safeguard's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") at the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the \"Annual Meeting\").\n\"We appreciate the ongoing dialogue we have had with the Company thus far, however, we continue to believe that significant and urgent changes are required at Safeguard in order to substantially improve value for shareholders, including with respect to board composition. As detailed in our January 29 th letter to the Safeguard Chairman, as part of our good faith effort to work constructively with the Company, we submitted a list of director candidates for potential appointment to the Board per Safeguard's request. We remain hopeful that the Board will seriously consider the candidates we have recommended in good faith and importantly, in a timely manner.\nIn light of the upcoming February 23 rd nomination deadline, we have no choice but to begin preparing to nominate a slate of highly-qualified candidates for election to Safeguard's seven-person Board at the Annual Meeting in the event we cannot reach an amicable resolution with the Company beforehand. We are still in the process of evaluating the degree of change that we believe is necessary on the Board and the number of candidates we will seek to elect. At this time, our intention is to nominate at least three of the highly-qualified director candidates whom we have submitted for interviews with Safeguard.\nIt has always been our preference to work constructively with Safeguard and we continue to remain hopeful that we can avoid a costly proxy contest and reach an amicable resolution that is in the best interests of all Safeguard shareholders. We nonetheless must reserve our rights as shareholders to take any action that we deem necessary to ensure the interests of Safeguard shareholders remain paramount in the boardroom.\nWe certainly hope the Board is acting in good faith and caution the Board against taking any steps to diminish or suppress the rights of its shareholders to nominate and seek the election of director candidates at the Annual Meeting, including, without limitation, any changes to its corporate governance structure.\"\nAbout Sierra Capital Investments, L.P.\nSierra Capital Investments, L.P. is an entity owned by Maplewood Partners, LLC (\"Maplewood\") and Horton Capital Partners, LLC (\"Horton\").
