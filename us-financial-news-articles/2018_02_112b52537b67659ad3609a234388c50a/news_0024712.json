But in the 18 months following the privatization, Ciech shares rose 180 percent to 87 zlotys.\nKI Investment said the sales process - via a public tender offer - was transparent and that apart from the 38 percent sold by the state, private investors sold a combined 12 percent stake at the tender. It attributed the subsequent price rise to the confidence investors put in the new owner and a rise in the price of Ciech’s products, among other factors.\nAll of the detained will have charges pressed against them, said a spokesman for the regional prosecutor’s office in the southern city of Katowice. If they are found guilty by courts, they could face prison terms of up to 10 years.\nReuters tried unsuccessfully to contact two of the detained people. The local unit of ING declined to comment on the case.\nThe leader of Poland’s main opposition party Civic Platform (PO), which was in power at the time of the privatization, said he suspected a political vendetta on the part of PiS.\n“I believe that all issues need to be cleared up ... but it looks like a politically motivated case,” state news agency PAP Quote: d Grzegorz Schetyna as saying.\nPiS ousted PO in Poland’s 2015 national election.\nReporting by Marcin Goettig, additional reporting by Marcin Goclowski; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T09:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T09:23:26.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
