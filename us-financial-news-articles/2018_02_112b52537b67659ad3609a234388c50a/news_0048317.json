On a U.S. GAAP (\"GAAP\") basis, fourth quarter 2017 diluted loss per share from continuing operations was $0.42, which included expenses incurred to reprice the Company's outstanding term loan as previously disclosed and a provisional non-cash adjustment to the Company's deferred tax assets due to the impact of U.S. tax reform. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.20. These figures compare with fourth quarter of 2016 GAAP diluted loss per share from continuing operations of $0.19 and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.16, excluding unusual items such as early extinguishment of debt costs and a forward loss provision in Rail.\nGAAP operating income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $38 million, which exceeded the guidance range of $28 million to $33 million previously provided by the Company.\n“We finished the year with a strong fourth quarter, and I’m pleased with our achievements in the year,” said President and CEO Nick Grasberger. “Execution of our strategic objectives along with positive market momentum led to a very successful year for Harsco. We exceeded the operating targets established at the beginning of the year, with positive contributions from each operating business. We also continued to generate strong cash flow, realized a meaningful improvement in our ROIC and further strengthened our financial flexibility.”\n“We expect that 2018 will be another year of positive momentum for Harsco, with each business again expected to see a year-over-year improvement in underlying performance. Our strategic priorities remain focused on portfolio growth and development as well as serving our customers and operational excellence. We announced a number of growth investments over the past year and I’m very enthusiastic about the pipeline of growth opportunities within our businesses. We remain confident that these opportunities and priorities, along with supportive markets, will further strengthen Harsco’s capital returns and create value for shareholders.”\nHarsco Corporation—Selected Fourth Quarter Results\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 Revenues $ 455 $ 360 Operating income from continuing operations - GAAP $ 38 $ 24 Operating margin from continuing operations - GAAP 8.5 % 6.7 % Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ (0.42 ) $ (0.19 ) Return on invested capital (TTM) - excluding unusual items 11.5 % 6.9 % Consolidated Fourth Quarter Operating Results\nTotal revenues were $455 million, an increase of 26 percent compared with the prior-year quarter as a result of higher revenues in each of the Company's segments. The fourth quarter of 2017 included revenues of approximately $42 million for a number of base vehicles and other related equipment under the Company's multi-year contracts with SBB, or the federal railway system in Switzerland.\nGAAP operating income from continuing operations of $38 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compares with GAAP operating income of $24 million and operating income of $28 million excluding the unusual items in the same quarter last year. Operating income in each of the Company's operating segments improved in comparison with the prior-year quarter.\nThe Company's operating margin was 8.5 percent versus a GAAP operating margin of 6.7 percent and adjusted operating margin of 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHarsco Corporation—Selected 2017 Results\n($ in millions, except per share amounts) 2017 2016 Revenues $ 1,607 $ 1,451 Operating income/(loss) from continuing operations - GAAP $ 143 $ 63 Operating margin from continuing operations - GAAP 8.9 % 4.4 % Diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 0.09 $ (1.07 ) Return on invested capital (TTM) - excluding unusual items 11.5 % 6.9 % Consolidated 2017 Results\nTotal revenues were $1.6 billion in 2017, compared with $1.5 billion in 2016, with each of the Company's segments realizing a growth in revenues during the year. Metals & Minerals' revenues were positively impacted by higher customer steel output, new contracts, higher commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Improved demand for air-cooled heat exchangers from U.S. energy customers led to higher revenues in Industrial, while Rail revenues increased as a result of higher demand for equipment and after-market parts from international customers (including SBB) and Protran Technology products.\nGAAP operating income from continuing operations was $143 million in 2017, while GAAP operating income from continuing operations in 2016 was $63 million. These figures are $147 million and $116 million, respectively, when excluding the unusual items in each of the periods. Financial performance in each segment improved compared with the previous year due mainly to the above factors as well as a more favorable mix of services and products in the Metals & Minerals and Industrial segments and operating efficiency improvements delivered through the course of the year. These benefits offset higher Corporate costs, resulting from increased pension and other benefit program costs as well as professional fees.\nOn a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in 2017 was $0.09, including the fourth quarter items noted above and a third-quarter bad debt expense related to a Metals & Minerals customer that previously entered voluntary administration under Australian law. The figure compares with a diluted loss per share in 2016 of $1.07, which included a site exit charge, Metals & Minerals Separation costs, debt refinancing costs and charges, a loss related to the sale of the Company's remaining interest in Brand Energy, and a forward loss provision related to the Company's railway maintenance equipment contracts with SBB.\nExcluding unusual items, adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased to $0.74 in 2017 from $0.48 in 2016.\nFourth Quarter Business Review\nMetals & Minerals\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 %Change Revenues $ 250 $ 235 6 % Operating income - GAAP $ 22 $ 20 13 % Operating margin - GAAP 8.9 % 8.4 % Customer liquid steel tons (millions) 37.4 34.5 8 % Revenues increased 6 percent to $250 million, as a result of higher steel output and service levels as well as foreign exchange translation. Meanwhile, GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $22 million compared with operating income of $20 million and operating income of $19 million after adjusting for the unusual items in the prior-year period. The improvement in operating earnings is attributable to higher underlying demand for mill services, which offset increased compensation expenses and professional fees. As a result, the segment's operating margin rose to 8.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIndustrial\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 %Change Revenues $ 82 $ 56 46 % Operating income - GAAP $ 10 $ 3 nmf Operating margin - GAAP 12.7 % 5.5 % nmf=not meaningful Revenues increased 46 percent to $82 million, due to increased demand within each of the three product businesses. Operating income increased to $10 million from $3 million in the prior-year quarter, as improved demand as well as a more favorable sales mix offset higher compensation and commission expenses. As a result, the segment’s operating margin increased to 12.7 percent from 5.5 percent in the comparable quarter last year.\nRail\n($ in millions) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 %Change Revenues $ 123 $ 70 77 % Operating income - GAAP $ 14 $ 5 184 % Operating margin - GAAP 11.3 % 7.1 % Revenues increased 77 percent to $123 million, mainly as a result of higher equipment sales. As noted above, the fourth quarter of 2017 included revenues of approximately $42 million from SBB (at zero margin). Operating income totaled $14 million in comparison with operating income of $5 million in the prior-year quarter. The 2016-quarter included a forward loss provision on the Company's contracts with SBB. Otherwise, the improvement in operating income is attributable to the demand trends noted above and a more favorable services mix, and these positive impacts offset lower contributions from after-market parts and additional compensation and administrative expenses. As a result, the segment's operating margin was 11.3 percent, or 17.2 percent excluding the SBB revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCash Flow\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $94 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $55 million in the prior-year period. Further, free cash flow was $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $38 million in the prior-year period. The year-over-year increase in free cash flow reflects higher net cash from operating activities principally as a result of the improvement in cash earnings and reduced inventories in Rail, offsetting the impact of higher capital investments in the quarter.\nFor the full-year, net cash provided by operating activities was $177 million and free cash flow was $93 million. These figures compare to $160 million and $100 million respectively in 2016. This change in free cash flow reflects incremental growth capital spending in Metals & Minerals and modest working capital investments, partially offset by higher cash earnings.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company's 2018 guidance reflects an overall positive outlook across its services and products businesses. For Metals & Minerals, adjusted operating income is expected to increase modestly as higher customer steel output and commodity prices, new site ramp-ups, operational savings and improved profitability in certain Applied Products businesses are expect to be only partially offset by exited sites, less favorable services mix, investments to support growth initiatives and pension. Meanwhile, Industrial earnings are projected to increase significantly due to improved demand for heat exchangers, industrial grating and commercial boilers as well as a more favorable product mix and manufacturing savings. And in Rail, adjusted operating income is also anticipated to be modestly higher compared with 2017, as increased demand for after-market parts and Protran Technology products will be partially offset by a less favorable mix of equipment sales and lower contributions from contracting services. Lastly, Corporate spending is expected to be comparable with 2017.\nThis outlook also reflects:\nAn anticipated 800 basis point to 1000 basis point reduction in Harsco's effective tax rate following recent U.S. tax reform; The implementation of the new pension classification standard and estimated net periodic pension costs, which are expected to be positive to overall Harsco earnings but negative to Metals & Minerals income as indicated above compared with 2017; and Expected impacts of the new revenue recognition standard that are not material to the overall guidance below for FY 2018 or Q1 2018.\nKey highlights in the Outlook are included below.\nFull Year 2018*\nGAAP and adjusted operating income for the full year is expected to range from $150 million to $170 million; compared with GAAP operating income of $143 million and adjusted operating income of $147 million in 2017. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year are expected in the range of $0.97 to $1.14; compared with GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 and adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 in 2017. Free cash flow is expected in the range of $80 million to $100 million, including total net capital expenditures of between $125 million and $145 million and growth-oriented capital spending of $45 million to $50 million; compared with $93 million in 2017. Net interest expense is forecasted to range from $34 million to $36 million as a result of lower interest costs following the term loan repricing; compared with $45 million in 2017. The effective tax rate is expected to range from 26 percent to 28 percent. Adjusted return on invested capital is expected to range from 12.0 percent to 13.5 percent; compared with 11.5 percent in 2017.\nQ1 2018*\nGAAP and adjusted operating income of $30 million to $35 million; compared with GAAP and adjusted operating income of $28 million in the prior-year quarter. GAAP and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.16 to $0.21; compared with GAAP and adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 in the prior-year quarter.\n*Comparable 2017 figures do not reflect pension reclassification.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its results and respond to questions from the investment community.
