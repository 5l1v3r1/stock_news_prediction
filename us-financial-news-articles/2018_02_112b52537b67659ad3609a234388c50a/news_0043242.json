But I think the middle section I skied quite well,” said American.\n”Maybe I can make some adjustments on the bottom, I was watching Sofia’s run and she skied a little bit of a different line than I did in a couple of sections.\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women’s Downhill Training - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - Sofia Goggia of Italy trains. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann “So I am going to look at that tonight and do some analyzing and see what is actually faster.”\nGoggia, who leads the downhill World Cup standings from Vonn after wins in Bad Kleinkirchheim and Cortina d‘Ampezzo last month, had a less technical explanation for her run.\n“I think it’s not the line, it is how you feel the downhill, how you feel your skis and the set-up,” said the 25-year-old.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “Downhill is about how you connect together and I will try to (bring the) love!”\nVonn, the most successful female World Cup racer of all time, pushed Goggia into second place in the two most recent downhills on the elite circuit at Garmisch-Partenkirchen earlier this month.\nThe 33-year-old, who won gold in downhill at Vancouver in 2010 but missed Sochi through injury, will be looking to land her first medal in Pyeongchang after finishing joint sixth in the super-G on Saturday.\nSwiss Michelle Gisin, whose sister Dominique shared the 2014 downhill gold with Tina Maze, was seventh fastest in 1:40.75 immediately behind Liechtenstein’s super-G bronze medalist Tina Weirather (1:40.66).\nAustrian Ramona Siebenhofer was fourth in 1:40.45 with Corinne Suter the fastest Swiss in 1:40.54, the fifth fastest time.\nSnowboarder Ester Ledecka, who stunned the Alpine skiing world with her victory in the super-G on Saturday, has not skied in either of the two training runs for the downhill and looks unlikely to compete on Wednesday.\nEditing by Amlan Chakraborty\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-19T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T07:38:21.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
