Authorities said that the mass of wet wipes, nappies, fat and oil was one of the largest they had ever encountered. \nIt was as long as three football pitches and weighed as much as 11 double-decker busses. \nThe exhibition also showcases the work that went in to clearing the fatberg, which involved a crew using jet hoses to break up the mass before sucking it out with a tanker. It took nine weeks. \nThe exhibition runs from Feb. 9 to July 1 and is free to visit.
