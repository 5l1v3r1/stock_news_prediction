He posted a photograph of what he said was the white Chevrolet minivan that hit the barrier according to the witness.\nLive Reuters video showed the minivan with an American flag emblem on the back and with both its rear window and a side window smashed. The video showed a law enforcement officer checking the underside of the van with a mirror.\nCNN, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, said the woman intentionally drove into the barricade. She was known to the Secret Service, CNN reported, but the action of driving into the barricade was not directed at the president or anyone at the White House.\nMental health issues may have been a factor, CNN said, citing the sources.\nReporting by Eric Beech; Writing by Eric Walsh; Editing by Sandra Maler and Tom Brown\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T23:04:23.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
