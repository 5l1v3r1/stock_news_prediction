Analysts have said previously that CFIUS is likely concerned by the prospect of potential access by Chinese state actors to Americans’ personal information.\nGenworth also said Tuesday that it would seek secured debt to address an upcoming maturity, given the delay in securing approval for the acquisition, with further details to be announced “upon the planned launch in the near future”.\nThe insurer had warned in October it was evaluating options, including asset sales and debt refinancing, to address around $600 million of debt coming due in May 2018.\nIt is the third refiling of the CFIUS application by Genworth and Oceanwide. The government body has 75 days from the submission date to approve the deal, although if no conclusion is reached in that time then the merging parties can withdraw and refile their application and start a new 75-day clock.\nGenworth and Oceanwide extended the deadline to conclude the deal for a second time in November to allow for CFIUS approval to be secured. The current deadline is April 1.\nReporting by David French and Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:33:23.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
