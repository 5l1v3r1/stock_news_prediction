The ride-hailing company is currently valued at $11.5 billion.\nOn its Q4 2017 earnings call on Wednesday afternoon, Elon Musk said that Tesla has no plans to replace McNeill, and that the company's sales and service staff will now report directly to him.\nIn his role as global sales and service president, Jon McNeill stood to earn a $700,000 bonus if the company met its vehicle delivery target during the last two quarters of 2017, a task made nearly impossible by delays to Model 3 production.\nMcNeill was known for personally responding to Tesla customers who were angry over service issues on online forums.\nMcNeill's is one of a series of high-profile departures from Tesla in recent months. Among other departures, Lyft competitors Uber recruited a former lead battery engineer, Celina Mikolajczak, to head up its flying car initiative.\nWATCH: Lot of Progress for Tesla show chapters A lot of instances of progress for Tesla: Analyst 19 Hours Ago | 02:28", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:40:26.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
