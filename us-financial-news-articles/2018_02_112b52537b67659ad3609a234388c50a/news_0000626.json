The $192 million sought represents 12 percent of that payment. \nBoth companies agreed to have disputes under the agreement decided by New York courts, the complaint said. \nArray’s revenue totaled $150.9 million in the year ended June 30, 2017, a regulatory filing shows. \nLast July, AstraZeneca agreed to collaborate with Merck to study cancer drug combinations using its drug Lynparza, which regulators have approved to treat ovarian cancer and which could have other uses when combined with immunotherapy. Merck agreed to pay AstraZeneca up to $8.5 billion in exchange for half of future Lynparza sales. \nAstraZeneca has said it plans to report full-year results on Friday. \nThe case is Array BioPharma Inc v AstraZeneca AB, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 650517/2018.
