Zach LaVine scored 23 points, and David Nwaba added 21 points and nine boards for the Bulls.\nChicago lost for the fifth time in seven games.\nSimmons also recorded a first-half block, joining Michael Jordan and Ron Harper as only the third player since the 1963-64 season to record 100 steals and 50 blocks through their first 55 games.\nPortis extended his career-best streak of games with double-digit scoring to seven.\nThe Bulls led 69-67 at halftime after falling into an early 18-point hole before rallying to post a season high for first-half points.\nThe 76ers led 93-91 after three quarters and were up 104-103 after an Amir Johnson free throw with 7:52 to play, but Chicago used a 12-6 run to go up 115-110 heading into the final minute.\nBulls center Robin Lopez, who had started the first 57 games of the season, was inactive for the contest. Justin Holliday was also inactive for Chicago as coach Fred Hoiberg reshuffled the lineup, with Nwaba and Cristiano Felicio (five points) starting.\n“I want to be playing, obviously, but we have a great group of guys,” Lopez told reporters prior to tip-off. “Our squad has a great future, and I can be a part of that future.”\nThe 76ers won two of their three games against the Bulls this season.\nChicago plays at Minnesota on Saturday. Philadelphia hosts Orlando on Saturday.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T16:08:00.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
