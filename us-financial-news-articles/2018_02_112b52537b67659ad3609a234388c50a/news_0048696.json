Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration extended the status several times after the initial designation.\nIn January, the Trump administration announced that the Salvadorans’ temporary protected status would end on Sept. 9, 2019, giving them 18 months to leave or seek lawful residency.\nThat move came after the administration in November ended TPS for people from Haiti, similarly giving people from that country 18 months to return to the impoverished Caribbean country or legalize their status in the United States.\nIn announcing the end of the designations of Haiti and El Salvador for TPS, the Department of Homeland Security said the conditions in those countries no longer supported their special statuses.\nThe Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice filed Thursday’s lawsuit on behalf of six immigrants from El Salvador and two from Haiti as well as Centro Presente, a Massachusetts-based Latin American immigrant organization.\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People filed a similar case in January over the decision to rescind TPS for Haitian immigrants.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Additional reporting by Yeganeh Torbati in Washington; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T19:30:14.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
