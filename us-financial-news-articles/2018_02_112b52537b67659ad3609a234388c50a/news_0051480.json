Markets also digested new bond supply from Italy.\nLatest polls point to a hung parliament and analysts expect a short period of volatility that could weigh on bonds and stocks.\nItaly’s 10-year bond yield was unchanged and lagging better rated peers at 2.07 percent. It has risen about 8 bps this week, set for its biggest weekly rise since December, according to Tradeweb data.\nThat has left the gap between Italian bond yields and those of benchmark euro zone issuer Germany at around 141 bps, its widest since January.\nStill, this gap - a gauge of how investors view relative country risks - remains close to the some 126 bps it stood at in early February, which was the tightest in over a year.\n“If I just observe bond yield spreads for now, they have compressed, which suggests there is confidence relative to the outcome of the Italian election,” said J Patrick Bradley, senior vice president, investment research at Brandywine Global.\n“That is surprising given the uncertainty.”\nThe cost of insuring exposure to Italian sovereign debt hit the highest in more than five weeks. Italy’s 5-year credit default swaps rose by 1 basis point from Thursday’s close to 105 bps, according to data from IHS Markit.\nMost euro zone bond yields fell on Friday, with Germany’s 10-year Bund yield down 5 bps to a near one-month low at 0.65 percent.\nAnalysts noted comments from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, who was reported warning about Italian election risk.\n“Some long-forgotten patterns return to euro bond markets with Bunds rallying while Italy sells off,” said Commerzbank rates strategist Christoph Rieger.\n“Juncker’s election warning seems more like an excuse rather than an explanation, but it underscores that markets should become increasingly jittery in coming days when the election grabs more headlines.”\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Additional reporting by Karin Strohecker; Editing by Richard Balmforth and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:38:57.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
