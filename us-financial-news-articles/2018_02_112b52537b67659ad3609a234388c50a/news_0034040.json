Labor Department figures on Tuesday showed consumer prices rose more than expected last month.\nConcerns that rising inflation will push the Federal Reserve to accelerate its path of interest rate hikes have erased the S&P 500’s gains for the year even after January’s 5.6 percent rise, its strongest performance for that month since 1997.\nOverall, hedge funds have their highest exposure to commodities since 2012, according to a report by Credit Suisse.\nHedge funds posted an estimated 4.1 percent gain in January, the report said, with the largest gains coming in long positions in consumer discretionary stocks and short positions in healthcare stocks.\nHedge funds often use leverage to increase the size of their wages, supercharging potential rewards but also boosting risk.\n“January’s record performance provided a buffer to February’s vol-inspired risk-off move,” said Mark Connors, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said in the note. “Managers appear to be weathering the storm well.”\nHEALTHCARE BETS Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision, are one of the few public ways of tracking what managers are buying and selling.\nRelying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions.\nThe filings showed managers expected healthcare stocks to trade higher during the last three months of 2017.\nA number of managers added fresh positions in these stocks before the sector came under pressure from increased volatility and Amazon’s move to team with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to reduce employee healthcare costs.\nLeon Cooperman’s Omega Advisors listed a new position in Humana Inc, which is working with private equity firms to buy Kindred Healthcare Inc. The stock price has gained 8 percent this year, likely benefitting Jason Karp’s Tourbillion which bought in with 90,000 shares in the fourth quarter.\nReporting by David Randall; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Andrew Hay\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T19:30:58.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
