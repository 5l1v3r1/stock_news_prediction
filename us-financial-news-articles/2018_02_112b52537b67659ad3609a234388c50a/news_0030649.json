Appointments will be partly based on how much business the banks do with Thomson Reuters, they added.\nOnce the bank group is complete, the highly anticipated US$14bn financing is expected to launch for wider syndication to institutional investors in March, the sources said.\nBlackstone and Thomson Reuters declined to comment.\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS Recent market volatility has had a destabilising effect on the debt markets, which could be exacerbated by Wednesday’s US inflation figures.\nThe financing was underwritten before stock markets slumped on February 2, and the three lead banks may wait until market conditions are more stable to launch the deal.\n“US inflation figures will be a catalyst ... I would expect they (the lead banks) will want to see how the next few days play out, then they’ll either rush it out or hold out and hope things improve,” a senior investor said.\nProlonged volatility could encourage banks joining the deal to negotiate for better fees and titles to compensate for increased market risk, the investor said.\nThe jumbo deal is being run from New York and will require participation from nearly all Transatlantic loan and bond investors in order to play markets off against each other and achieve best execution for the borrower.\nSecondary prices are a key indicator of volatility and sentiment and could also dictate timing as falling bids often encourage investors to seek more compensation.\nBanks and investors are confident that the financing will be well received as cash-rich funds are eager to put fresh capital to work in size, the sources said.\nDEAL STRUCTURE The financing is expected to be structured with 60 percent loans and 40 percent bonds, which will give an $8 billion-equivalent loan financing, and a potential split of $3 billion-equivalent secured bonds and $3 billion-equivalent of unsecured bonds, the sources said.\nThe debt will be mainly denominated in dollars and bankers are currently assessing how much will be denominated in euros. Even a small euro tranche could mean €1 billion-€2 billion of debt being syndicated in Europe, the sources said.\nA $14 billion financing would give leverage of around 7.5 times, based on last 12 months Ebitda of approximately $1.7 billion for the F&R unit. Senior leverage of roughly 4.5-5.0 times could give a loan of $8 billion-$9 billion, and junior debt of $4 billion-$5 billion, sources said.\nAnother source familiar with the matter said previously that leverage was expected to be below 6.0 times.\nBlackstone will acquire a 55 percent stake in the F&R business and Thomson Reuters will retain a 45 percent holding.\nLoan Pricing Corp is a unit of Thomson Reuters.\nEditing by Tessa Walsh\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T21:39:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
