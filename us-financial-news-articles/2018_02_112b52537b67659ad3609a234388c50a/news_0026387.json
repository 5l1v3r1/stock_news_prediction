Organic sales exclude the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe snacks business contributes about 25 percent of overall revenue.\nOrganic sales at PepsiCo’s North American beverages business that sells Gatorade and Mountain Dew dipped 3 percent.\nTotal revenue rose slightly to $19.53 billion, topping analysts’ average estimate of $19.39 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nPepsiCo recorded a loss of $710 million, reflecting a $2.5 billion one-time charge related to new U.S. tax laws, compared to a year-earlier profit of $1.40 billion.\nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.31 per share, edging past analysts’ estimates of $1.30.\n“We are broadly impressed with Pepsi’s ability to deliver bottom-line results despite the dynamic retail environment and their continued underperformance in the beverages,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said.\nFor 2018, the company expects earnings of $5.70 per share, slightly above analysts’ estimates of $5.67. PepsiCo forecast organic revenue to be largely unchanged compared with 2017.\nThe company also said it would give up to a $1,000 cash bonus to some U.S.-based employees, as it benefits from the tax reform.\nShares of PepsiCo were slightly higher on Tuesday morning.\nReporting by Sangameswaran S and Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T14:36:30.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
