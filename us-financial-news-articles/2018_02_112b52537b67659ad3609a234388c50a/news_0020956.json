The UK-based group recorded 197 deaths of defenders of land and environment in 2017.\nViolent confrontations in Southeast Asia have risen in recent years, with the Philippines recording the highest number of casualties amidst a government crackdown on rural communities, according to a separate report. [nL8N1OD40I]\nIn Indonesia, policemen employed by a subsidiary of commodities firm Wilmar International, shot at and wounded two farmers on a palm oil plantation in December, according to a coalition of rights groups.\nThe group of nearly 60 indigenous and farmers’ organizations said that farmers have been locked in a battle with the plantation for years, because their land was taken without their consent or compensation.\n“The state failed to be present to protect its citizens and instead let law enforcement become corporate shields,” the coalition said in an open letter to RSPO.\nA Wilmar spokeswoman said the case was not related to a land claim, and that the company’s security officers were investigating a theft when the shooting occurred.\nShe denied that Wilmar had hired policemen as security, and said that the company had instead called police to the plantation.\nPolice officers then fired rubber bullets at a suspect’s leg when he ignored their warning to stand down, said the spokeswoman in an email.\nReporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.
