REUTERS/Neil Hall/File Photo One package will include the rights to show a whole round of matches at the same time, an option that could be more attractive to a digital provider than a traditional broadcaster.\nIn the previous auction Sky, which built its business on the back of the Premier League, picked up 126 games to BT’s 42 and analysts expect they will want to achieve at least a similar outcome this time around.\nBoth are to some extent limited, however.\nFILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Sky, present in 13 million homes, had to cut costs, hike prices and drop other sports to afford the last round of rights.\nIt also has an uncertain future as it is not clear who will own Sky when the 2019 season begins, with Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox trying to buy the 61 percent it does not own. Sky could then be sold to Disney if a separate sale of Murdoch’s TV and film assets receives the green light.\nFor BT, investors would be unlikely to welcome a blow-out bid with its shares at five-year lows. It faces other calls on its cash, including investments in ultrafast fiber, pension deficit top-ups and dividend payments.\nBut the companies have recently agreed a wholesale deal to allow their customers to watch the other service’s channels, in an easing of the previous competition in their relationship.\n“We continue to see the Premier League content as being an important part of BT Sport but it’s only one part of the channel,” BT Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said last week.\n“We know what it’s worth to us, and we model that and we bid up to but no further than the value of it, and we always have a plan B if we do not get the content we want.”\n($1 = 0.7093 pounds)\nReporting by Kate Holton; editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T18:17:33.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
