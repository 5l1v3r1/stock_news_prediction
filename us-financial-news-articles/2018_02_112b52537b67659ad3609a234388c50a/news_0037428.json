This allows retailers to keep their inventory close to customers, not in hangars far removed from cities.\nThe company is deploying its robots in its first operational facility and plans to open more facilities in the United States, UK and Israel in 2018.\nReporting by Tova Cohen\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T14:34:14.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
