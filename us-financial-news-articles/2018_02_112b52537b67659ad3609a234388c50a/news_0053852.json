To promote a budding commercial space industry that created some 1,700 new companies around the globe last year—with roughly half based in the U.S.—Mr. Ross said “we need an adaptive and relatively permissive” environment.\nPressure for such action has been building for some time, particularly in light of President Donald Trump’s emphasis on promoting private space projects. Commerce’s newfound prominence in the space arena isn’t a surprise because Mr. Ross, a former private-equity investor who is personally close to Mr. Trump, for months has maneuvered to become the architect of rolling back regulations that apply to rockets and satellites. Many in the industry consider the current regulatory regime, overseen by several agencies including Commerce and the Federal Aviation Administration, outdated and overly stringent.\nAerospace trade associations welcomed the move, which envisions Mr. Ross personally coordinating with the Transportation Department and other agencies to create a “one-stop shop for space commerce.”\nDuring Wednesday’s meeting of the White House Space Council, a cabinet-level group seeking to coordinate U.S. military, civilian and commercial space priorities, members also heard presentations highlighting persistent Russian and Chinese efforts to develop antisatellite weapons.\nSusan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, said both countries “will probably reach initial operational capability in the next few years” with such technology. She said China and Russia also have laser weapons designed to “dazzle or damage sensitive space-based optical sensors” used on some of the most advanced American spy satellites.\nBut starting with the opening speech of Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the council, much of the focus was on short- and long-term fixes to the industry’s regulatory headaches. The nation’s “prosperity, security and even our national character depend on American leadership in space,” Mr. Pence said.\nReferring to current requirements to obtain discrete launch licenses for every facility, even if the same type of rocket repeatedly is involved, Mr. Pence said, “the government has figured out how to honor drivers’ licenses across state lines; there’s no reason we can’t do the same for rockets.”\nDeputy Transportation Secretary Jeffrey Rosen told the group his goal was creating a more responsive, “twenty first-century ‘file and fly’ kind of licensing framework.”\nThose standing to lose the most clout under the new oversight structure, which is expected to get the final signoff from Mr. Trump, are the FAA and its parent, the Transportation Department.\nActing FAA chief Dan Elwell has disputed arguments that current launch licensing is fundamentally flawed. The agency needs to move faster, he told a government-industry conference earlier this month, but he also said “industry must improve its safety performance.” Before too many changes are made, he added, “I think more talk about safety is time well spent.”\nMr. Ross and a new space-policy lieutenant also will have jurisdiction to establish governmentwide deregulatory goals affecting export licenses, radio spectrum used by satellites and in-orbit servicing of spacecraft. Mr. Ross said the shifts were decided after consultations with an ambitious but frustrated industry.\n“If the United States is to continue to lead in space, we have got to create the right conditions,” according to the commerce chief.\nThe Trump administration’s more-lenient approach has plenty of adherents on Capitol Hill, where there is bipartisan support for generally reducing the industry’s compliance times and costs.\nWrite to Andy Pasztor at andy.pasztor@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T04:54:39.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
