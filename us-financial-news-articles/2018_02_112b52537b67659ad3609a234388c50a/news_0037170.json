Additionally, funds from TBTF instruments transferred to group companies are to be excluded from the group parent company’s consolidated financial position.\n“More taxes lead to lower capital and are thus inconsistent with the TBTF legislation’s aims,” the government said in a statement.\nReporting by John Miller, editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:50:15.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
