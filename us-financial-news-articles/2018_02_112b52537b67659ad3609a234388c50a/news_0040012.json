So many people on the track to watch the first two heats of the two-man bobsleigh competition!” the IBSF tweeted on its official account.\nEditing by Clare Fallon\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T22:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:54:19.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
