Not because of getting second place, I am not a sore loser. I was just curious as to the 100,” the two-time world champion added.\n“Personally, and I have spoken to a lot of other snowboarders, it’s pretty tough to get a perfect score. I didn’t agree with that at all.”\nDespite his comments, James was quick to stress it was not White, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, he was frustrated with, but the judging in general as they began final preparations ahead of next Tuesday’s qualifying competition.\n“I have got a lot of respect for the guy, he achieved a lot of amazing things in snowboarding,” James said of the 31-year-old American.\n”He has been a pioneer in the sport for a long time.\n“He is an amazing athlete, one of those one-percent people.”\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T08:31:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
