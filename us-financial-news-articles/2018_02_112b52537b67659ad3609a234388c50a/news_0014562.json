Waymo is the self-driving car division of Google parent company Alphabet , and was spun out from Google in 2016.\nWhen Google's venture capital arm invested $258 million into Uber in 2013, Kalanick didn't see the two companies as being competitive, since Google was working on autonomous vehicles and Uber was working on ride-sharing. \nGoogle CEO Larry Page even took Kalanick for a ride in a self-driving car after the investment, and the two companies discussed possible partnerships, according to Kalanick. \nHowever, things started to fall apart in 2015 when rumors swirled that Google was getting into ride sharing. Kalanick emailed David Drummond, the Google exec who was on Uber's board of directors, to ask what was going on.\nAs Uber lost confidence in an Google partnership coming to fruition, the company hired a bunch of autonomous vehicle engineers from Carnegie Mellon . That move, Kalanick says, upset Page. \"He was sort of angsty,\" Kalanick testified.\nUltimately, Uber acquired the self-driving truck company Otto in 2016, which was founded by a former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski, around whom this week's trial hangs. Waymo is trying to prove that Uber improperly acquired, used, and benefited from eight \"trade secrets\" taken by Levandowski. \nHere are some tweets of the courtroom drama from CNBC reporters on the scene:\nLittle brother tweet \nAngsty tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T20:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T20:25:55.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
