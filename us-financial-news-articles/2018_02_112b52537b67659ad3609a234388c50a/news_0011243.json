Since then, Greenpeace has raised about 300,000 crowns in donations.\nA Facebook poll on the group’s website showed 95 percent support for an appeal and Greenpeace said the money involved shows the case is far more than a publicity stunt among greens.\nThe two groups appealed directly to Norway’s Supreme Court, hoping to bypass the Appeals Court. If the Supreme Court refuses to hear the case, it would go to the Appeals Court instead, they said.\nNorway is western Europe’s largest producer and exporter of oil and gas and is looking ever further north. So far in the Arctic, it produces oil at Eni’s Goliat field and gas from Statoil’s Snoehvit.\nConservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg says the nation can keep pumping for decades while complying with the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century and replace it with renewable energies.
