Sorghum is considered an alternative to corn.\nChina also imported 30,000 tonnes of sugar in January, the lowest monthly volume since August, 2014, the customs data showed, after hefty tariffs imposed last year continued to curb buying.\nThe volumes were down by 92.5 percent on the same month in 2017 and down 77 percent on December’s level.
