The bill, designed to address the pension system’s massive deficit, requires an amendment to the constitution, which is banned during any such federal intervention.\nDeadly violence in Rio de Janeiro has spiked in recent years, with an 8 percent increase in killings last year over 2016 and a 26 percent jump since 2015, according to statistics from the Rio state government.\nThe army has already been employed in Rio in recent years in an effort to quell violence, mainly centered on slums in Rio’s metropolitan area. There, powerful drug gangs and paramilitary militias battle each other for turf, while all confront police.\nThere are intense, daily shootouts in Rio’s poorer areas, and that violence has increasingly hit the city’s richer and relatively safer areas.\nDuring Carnival celebrations that ended on Wednesday, images of gangs of young men surrounding and robbing tourists en masse were repeatedly broadcast on national TV, adding to concerns the city’s security situation had spiraled out of control.\nPENSION PROBLEMS Temer, who is due to step down at the end of the year following elections in October, has pushed to hold a vote on the unpopular pension reform by the end of this month before Congressmen start to focus on their reelection.\nHowever, his top ministers acknowledge they still lack 40 votes to pass a watered-down version of the unpopular measure through the lower house of Congress.\nCarlos Marun, Temer’s minister of political affairs, told Reuters it should still be possible to vote on pension reform through a technicality. The federal government could simply lift its federal decree on Rio security for the time needed for any vote to take place, he said.\nLegislation to streamline Brazil’s costly social security system has been lined up for a first crucial vote in the lower house of Congress next week.\nIt is being watched closely by investors worried about the government’s ability to bring a huge budget deficit under control and avoid a further credit rating downgrade.\nReporting by Pedro Fonseca, Alexandra Alper and Rodrigo Viga Gaier in Rio de Janeiro, Lisandra Paraguassu in Brasilia and Brad Brooks in Sao Paulo; Writing by Brad Brooks; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:12:53.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
