Tweet \nInsurance company Metlife joined another car rental company Enterprise and the First National Bank of Omaha in ending their relationships with the NRA this week, announcing the end of discounts and promotions previously offered to the group's members. \n\"Customer feedback has caused us to review our relationship with the NRA,\" First National Bank of Omaha told CNBC. \"As a result, First National Bank of Omaha will not renew its contract with the National Rifle Association to issue the NRA Visa Card.\" \nHere's a list of the firms that have discontinued their partnerships with the NRA so far. \nNote that Chubb said it gave notice to the NRA three months ago to discontinue its program, but made the announcement Friday. Metlife and Symantec also made their announcements Friday. \nMany companies listed on the NRA website as providing deals for members, including mortgage bank First Horizon National , had not yet return calls for comment as to whether they would be continuing their relationship with the gun group. \nHotel chain Wyndham Worldwide told CNBC it ended its relationship with the NRA late last year. \nThe outcry comes amid signs Americans' interest in gun control is not waning like it typically has in the wake of past mass shootings. Google searches for \"gun control\" have remained elevated a week after the Parkland, Florida shooting. \nBlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, said this week it was going to reach out to the publicly-traded gunmakers \"to understand their response\" to the shooting. BlackRock indirectly owns shares in companies like American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger as a provider of exchange-traded funds.
