The service has said it had its busiest month in December, when Amazon started in the world's twelfth-largest economy.\nAmazon said its FBA service saved businesses time \"as they will no longer need to individually purchase shipping materials, individually pack orders, and make multiple trips to the post office.\"\nSo far, Amazon has run its Australian business from a single warehouse outside Melbourne city, on the country's east coast where most of the population lives.\nAs with Canada , where it also launched its fulfillment service with only one warehouse, analysts now expect Amazon to open more warehouses to service far-flung Australian communities.\n\"Australia is big. It's a signal that they're going to build more,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.\nMarc Wulfraat, president of Montreal-based logistics consultancy MWPVL International, said it made sense for Amazon to open depots in Sydney, the country's most populous city, and Perth on the west coast.\n\"The logic is that Sydney and Perth will follow,\" he said.\nSubscription fees from Prime would help offset any shipping losses that Amazon incurred, he added.\nShares of Australian brick-and-mortar non-food retailers were higher in mid-session trading, in line with the broader market.\nShares of the country's biggest stand-alone online retailer, Kogan.com, were down 4 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T05:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T05:48:52.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
