In Canada , the same storm was snarling flights at Toronto Pearson â€“ that nation's busiest air hub.\nMost big carriers were waiving change fees for customers ticketed to fly to the region during the storm. Details varied by airline, but they generally allowed fliers to make one change to their itineraries without paying change fees or recalculated fares. Airports included in the waivers also varied by carrier, but they covered a spread of destinations from Iowa and Minnesota east through western New York state and Ontario.\nIn the U.S. , nearly all of Friday's cancellations were made preemptively on Thursday as airlines tried to get ahead of the storm. Still, the tally of delayed and canceled flights could grow Friday as snow continues to fall across the region.\nScroll down for links to the winter-weather waivers currently in place at big North American carriers:\nAir Canada \nAlaska Airlines \nAmerican \nDelta \nJetBlue \nFrontier \nSouthwest \nSpirit \nUnited", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T18:16:28.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
