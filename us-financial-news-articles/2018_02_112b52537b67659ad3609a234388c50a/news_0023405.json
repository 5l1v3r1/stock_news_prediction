Like Lucas Oil products, SpillVak is a name known for striving to reach the highest standards in our market and we look forward to working with them in this new partnership. There could not be a more natural fit for us.\" Kyle Bybee, CEO/CFO for SpillVak added, \"Being part of Team Lucas is thrilling. SpillVak and Lucas Oil both have so much in common, such as the early story of each company as well as the current focus of providing high-quality products to our customers. This really is the perfect fit!\"\nAs a part of this partnership, SpillVak will sponsor various race series and will be the lead sponsor for motorcycle drag racer Anthony Vanetti for the 2018 drag racing season. More details on those sponsorships will be announced in the coming weeks.\nAlex Striler, Director of Team Lucas Marketing states, \"SpillVak is a perfect addition to Team Lucas. We're fortunate to have them join our marketing program because Lucas Oil and SpillVak share a core customer. Whenever someone changes a vehicle's oil or flushes out a radiator, he also needs to be prepared to clean up the inevitable mess that's going to happen. Spills are part of life. We use SpillVak absorbents at Lucas Oil because we need fast results. We also like that they are free of carcinogens and made from all-natural materials. SpillVak is powerful and it's efficientâ€”just like the professionals who use it.\"\nFor more information contact:\nTrent Whatcott\nDirector of Marketing\nSpillVak\ntwhatcott@SpillVak.com\n702-419-6824\nPhotos:\nhttps://www.prlog.org/12691322\nPress release distributed by PRLog\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spillvak-fluid-absorbent-company-joins-team-lucas-oil-300596442.html\nSOURCE SpillVak", "external_links": ["https://lucasoil.com/team-lucas", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spillvak-fluid-absorbent-company-joins-team-lucas-oil-300596442.html", "https://www.prlog.org/12691322", "http://www.spillvak.com/", "https://www.prlog.org/"], "published": "2018-02-09T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T22:21:32.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
