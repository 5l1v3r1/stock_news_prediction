The meeting today was called to arrange the NEC. We will discuss Zuma’s recall (removal) but it’s not clear whether we will arrive at a decision,” one of the sources said.\nFILE PHOTO: President Jacob Zuma gestures as he addresses parliament in Cape Town, South Africa, November 2, 2017. REUTERS/Sumaya Hisham/File Photo The rand, which has tended to strengthen on signs that Zuma could step down before his second term as president ends next year, was slightly firmer on Monday.\nZuma’s tumultuous time in power has been marked by a string of corruption allegations and street protests against his rule though he has managed to survive several no-confidence votes.\nScandals include 783 counts of corruption which he is still fighting over a 30 billion rand (now $2.5 billion) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s when he was deputy president.\nZuma weathered a no-confidence vote in parliament after an anti-corruption watchdog investigation found he had “unduly” benefited from renovations at his home and paid back more than $500,000 after unsuccessfully trying to argue his case in the Constitutional Court.\nSlideshow (5 Images) ZUMA MEETS ZULU KING Zuma met Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini on Monday at the king’s residence in Ulundi in the Kwa-Zulu Natal province, said Prince Thulani Zulu, a spokesman for the Zulu royal household.\nThe spokesman declined to speculate on whether the king, a key ally of Zuma, who is also a Zulu, would add his voice to those urging the president to step down. It was not clear when the meeting would end.\nZuma’s spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said the meeting with Zwelithini was “a longstanding courtesy meeting between the President and His Majesty which was initially meant to take place in January but was postponed due to diary challenges on both sides”.\nZwelithini is the influential traditional head of South Africa’s biggest ethnic group, with around 10 million first-language Zulu speakers out of a total population of around 55 million, but he holds no role in government.\n“Zuma would listen to the Zulu king. Zuma is a traditionalist and has a power base in KwaZulu-Natal province,” said political analyst Ralph Mathekga.\n“The king is a bargainer, he could help Cyril (Ramaphosa) heal KwaZulu-Natal after Zuma goes.”\nZuma has not said in public whether he will step down voluntarily. But he faces a new confidence-vote in parliament against his leadership on Feb. 22 filed by the opposition far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party (EFF).\nAdditional reporting by Ed Cropley and Tiisetso Motsoeneng; Writing by James Macharia; Editing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T09:35:38.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
