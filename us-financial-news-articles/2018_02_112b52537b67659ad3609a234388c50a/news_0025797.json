As this is a BWF investigation, we have to wait for them to make any announcement,” she was quoted saying. Under the BWF’s rules, players found guilty of match-fixing can be banned for life. “This definitely tarnishes the reputation of Malaysian badminton, so I want to make a strong stand that BAM will not tolerate any form of match fixing or gambling,” BAM President Datuk Seri Norza Zakaria was quoted telling the publication. No-one at the BWF or BAM could immediately be reached for comment.
