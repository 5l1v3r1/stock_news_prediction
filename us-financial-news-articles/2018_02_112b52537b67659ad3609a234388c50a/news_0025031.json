The eurozone is the biggest market for Norwegian salmon.\nOne exporter expected a somewhat lower recovery.\n“It’s about stable, around 50 crowns per kilo next week, the big producers are pushing up prices, so we are a bit squeezed,” the exporter said.\nSalmon prices peaked at around 80 crowns per kilo in early January of 2017 at a time when supply constraints supported prices, but have since fallen as volumes grew.\nProduction growth from Norway is expected to be around 9 percent in 2018, the Norwegian Seafood Council predicted in early January.\nNorway is the world’s top salmon exporter, and the share price of listed farming companies depends heavily on changes in the price of fish.\nAverage production costs for whole fish, including the cost of harvesting, rose by 13 percent to 34.29 crowns per kilo in 2016, according to data from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries.\nLeading Norwegian producers include Marine Harvest, Salmar, Leroy Seafood, Grieg Seafood and Norway Royal Salmon.
