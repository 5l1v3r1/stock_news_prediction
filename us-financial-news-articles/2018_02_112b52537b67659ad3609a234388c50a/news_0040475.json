The signal they gave us that they are positioning for a May interest rate hike relies on this assumption,” she added.\nFoley added that investors had become more nervous about Brexit negotiations, having started the year confident that Britain would secure a transitional deal but having become less so. Sterling slumped earlier this month when the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said such a deal was “not a given”.\nSterling was down 0.2 percent on Monday at $1.4007, just over 2 percent down from an 18-month high hit in late January.\nIt was also down 0.1 percent at 88.57 pence per euro.\nPositioning data released on Friday showed speculators trimmed their bets on further sterling strength against the dollar for a third straight week, though they were still net-long the currency. [IMM/FX]\n“We must stress that (Brexit) negotiations are only just starting and one might bear in mind that trade negotiations are quite hard to settle,” wrote Didier Borowski, head of macroeconomic research at Amundi, in a note to clients.\n“Our base case scenario foresees an intermediate relationship (between Britain and the EU), with free trade in goods but only very partial passporting in financial services,” they added. “There is clearly scope for the pound to depreciate in this scenario.”\nEditing by Richard Balmforth\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:40:09.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
