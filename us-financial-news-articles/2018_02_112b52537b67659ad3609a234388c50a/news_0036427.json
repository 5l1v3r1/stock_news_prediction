You are putting a stranger within a family,” said Ayda.\nDespite the kafala system and Ethiopia banning its citizens from working in Lebanon since 2008, nearly 48,000 Ethiopians entered Lebanon between 2013 to 2016, government data shows.\nBut there are no official numbers of workers like Betty - so-called “irregular” workers - who do not have the legal paperwork to let them stay and work in the country.\nGroups working with migrants see this as a widespread problem as it leaves people with no legal right to escape abusive bosses or poor working conditions.\n“The sponsorship system allows this to be a systematic problem ... you don’t have the right to be in the country, workers become trapped and they can’t leave without their passport,” said Zeina Mezher, migrant specialist for the ILO.\n“SYSTEM OF SLAVERY”\nUnder the kafala system an employer sometimes holds the worker’s passport, residency and work permits even though the Ministry of Labor states migrants have the right to keep their passport and all legal papers.\n“The employer holds everything relating to their freedom,” said Farah Salka, executive director of local non-government group Anti-Racism Movement.\n“There is no way to negotiate under this system of slavery ... You can’t upset the person who is your sponsor because they are the only the legal tie for you in Lebanon.”\nBetty said she managed to get to Lebanon after a smuggler gave her a visa to get into the country via Yemen with a promise she would be paid $250 per month and have regular working hours with a family.\nBut her first job was working unpaid for an illegal recruiter for three months because of the “debt” she owed him.\nBetty said she was sponsored twice by two different families but faced physical, sexual and verbal abuse, limited meals, no days off, and was often forced to work for other relatives too.\n“I went through a lot,” said Betty in a soft voice, adding that she felt she had no choice but to flee, leaving behind her passport and legal papers with her last sponsor.\n“That time it was about surviving,” she said, adding that she dreams of working legally and maybe getting a law degree in Lebanon with the hope of one day returning to Ethiopia.\nLIFE WITHOUT LEGAL PAPERS Betty is now living with relatives picking up jobs in various houses around Lebanon, but without legal papers.\n“Without my papers I can’t do anything. (The sponsor) didn’t sign a release paper. It’s like you own a slave. No matter where you go, you are somebody’s property unless that person sets them free,” she said.\nSponsors can sign release papers, but rights groups say migrant workers would still have be under another sponsor to allow them to legally work.\n“The system doesn’t allow a person to escape an abusive situation without falling into irregularity,” said Ghada Jabbour, head of the anti-trafficking unit at Kafa, a local NGO working with migrants and against gender-based violence.\n“The sponsorship system traps the worker since there is no legal protection ... the worker has no way to untie this knot.”\nRights groups have called for the sponsorship system to be abolished but the government has ruled that out.\n“The situation is not perfect. We strive for improvement - but we will not be going down the road of abolishing kafala. If you take away kafala there will be no guarantee that the employee will respect the contract,” said Ayda.\nAyda told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the Ministry of Labor is looking into the possibility of domestic migrant workers being sponsored by cleaning companies, allowing them not to live-in with a sponsor and to have flexible hours.\n“If we go into something like this, in my opinion we fix many of the problems and we guarantee better rights for the domestic migrant worker,” he said.\nReporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.
