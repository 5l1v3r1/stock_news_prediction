That vote is due to take place from Feb 20 to March 2. A result is expected on March 4.\nSchulz, 62, is expected to become foreign minister in a new coalition government with the conservatives.\nReporting by Holger Hansen; Writing by Michelle Martin, editing by Thomas Escritt\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T05:54:59.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
