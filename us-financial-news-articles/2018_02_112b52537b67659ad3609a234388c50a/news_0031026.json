Taking their foot off the gas almost proved costly.\nZack Kassian twice beat Sharks goalie Aaron Dell on a pair of breakaways and Leon Draisaitl added a goal within a 10-minute span to make it 3-3 before the second period was finished.\nThe craziness wasn’t over, either. Brandon Davidson put the Oilers ahead early in the third period, but San Jose’s Tomas Hertl drew the hosts even a couple of minutes later.\nThe Oilers even wasted a couple of power-play opportunities late in the third period before Ryan’s winner. Pavelski added an empty-netter in a four-point game. He’s collected four goals and six points in two games.\nDell stopped 27 shots for the Sharks, who snapped a two-game losing skid but have a new injury to deal with as Joel Ward missed the game due to a shoulder problem. In his place was Jannik Hansen, who’s suited up in only four of the last 20 games, and he responded with an assist.\nOn a night captain Connor McDavid was held without a point, Al Montoya made 24 saves for the Oilers, who are riding a three-game losing skid.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-11T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T04:43:58.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
