Security Council resolutions for its banned nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, but relations with South Korea have softened in the lead-up to the Pyeongchang Olympic Games opening on Feb. 9.\nNorth Korea accused the United States of seeking to aggravate the situation on the divided Korean peninsula by “deploying large nuclear assets” nearby and lay the ground for a possible pre-emptive strike against it.\n“In view of the nature and scale of U.S. military reinforcements, they are designed to make a pre-emptive strike against the DPRK,” North Korean diplomat Ju Yong Chol told the talks, referring to his country’s official name the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n“U.S. officials including the defense secretary and the CIA director repeatedly talked about DPRK nuclear and missile threat to justify their argument for a military option and a new concept of a so-called ‘bloody nose’, a limited pre-emptive strike on the DPRK is under consideration within the U.S. administration,” Ju said.\nWood took the floor to retort: “If you claim to want peace, end your nuclear and ballistic missile tests and stop your provocative behaviour and threats”.\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T11:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T12:41:06.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
