(NASDAQ:BEAT), the leading mobile and wireless medical technology company focused on the delivery of health information to improve quality of life and reduce cost of care, today reported results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nCompany Highlights\nRecognized highest quarterly revenue in Company’s history of $91.7 million Achieved 10% organic revenue growth Achieved 22 nd consecutive quarter of year over year revenue growth Recorded GAAP net loss attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. of $15.6 million, impacted by tax reform and integration related costs, and adjusted net income of $11.3 million Realized record quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $22.9 million, or 25.0% of revenue Realized approximately $5.0 million of synergies in the fourth quarter from the integration of LifeWatch, on track to achieve $30.0 million of annualized synergies\nPresident and CEO Commentary\nJoseph H. Capper, President and Chief Executive Officer of BioTelemetry, Inc., commented: “2017 was an exceptional year for the Company, having achieved new highs in revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin in each successive quarter. Our outstanding fourth quarter results were not driven just by the addition of LifeWatch, but by the successful combination of the two companies, as evidenced by our 10% organic revenue growth. I am pleased to report that we have been able to grow our business in our top 500 healthcare accounts, which is a major accomplishment during any integration. This success enabled us to reach $91.7 million of revenue and a 25.0% adjusted EBITDA margin in the quarter, exceeding our expectations.\n“As we enter 2018, we are very well-positioned for continued success. We have the largest and most productive sales force in the industry, selling the most comprehensive suite of cardiac monitoring solutions with more products being introduced in 2018. We are experiencing accelerated growth in our Research business, with double digit growth expected for the year. Additionally, we have established strategic relationships in our digital population health business, which have the potential to drive significant future growth. Given these factors, we have an abundance of opportunities on which to capitalize, and we expect 2018 to be another standout year for the Company, with approximately $380 million of revenue and an adjusted EBITDA margin percent in the mid-twenties.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $91.7 million compared to $54.0 million for the fourth quarter 2016, an increase of $37.7 million, or 70.0%.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter 2017 was $54.4 million, or 59.3% of revenue, compared to $33.0 million, or 61.2% of revenue, for the fourth quarter 2016.\nOn a GAAP basis, net loss attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the fourth quarter 2017 was $15.6 million, or a loss attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. of $0.48 per diluted share, compared to net income of $40.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016.\nOn an adjusted basis 1 , net income attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the fourth quarter 2017 was $11.3 million, or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted net income of $7.0 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter 2016. This increase was attributable to the LifeWatch acquisition, the 10% organic revenue growth and the continued impact of operational efficiencies in the existing business. The details regarding the exclusions from adjusted net income are included in the reconciliation tables included in this release.\n1 The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures offers a meaningful representation of the Company’s performance as they exclude expenses that are not necessary to support the Company’s ongoing business.

The remaining $4.8 million of other charges related to the integration of LifeWatch, the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard, other restructuring activities and ongoing patent litigation partially offset by a reduction in contingent consideration related to the Telcare acquisition.

This was a nonrecurring expense for the Company and is the only time in the Company’s history when such a bonus was awarded. There are no additional agreements outstanding of this nature. This was recorded in general and administrative expense.\nf) In the fourth quarter 2016, the Company released the tax valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.

The remaining $2.2 million of other charges resulted from other restructuring activities, ongoing patent litigation and the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard partially offset by a reduction in contingent consideration related to the Telcare acquisition. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $8.6 million of other charges related to patent litigation and costs associated with the Company’s 2016 acquisitions.\nb) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized $6.0 million of expense related to the amortization of intangibles as a result of the LifeWatch AG acquisition. The Company has excluded the LifeWatch amortization of intangibles from adjusted net income for year over year comparative purposes. This was recorded in general and administrative expense.\nc) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1.5 million for the second half of a one-time performance bonus paid to a third party in the form of stock-based compensation. The first of two performance measures was achieved in the fourth quarter 2016, resulting in $1.3 million of expense at that time. The second performance measure was achieved in the first quarter 2017, resulting in $1.5 million of expense. This is a nonrecurring expense for the Company and is the only time in the Company’s history when such a bonus was awarded. There are no additional agreements outstanding of this nature. This was recorded in general and administrative expense.\nd) During the first quarter 2017, the Company reached a $2.5 million settlement with the United States Department of Health and Human Services. This was related to the conclusion of an investigation into the theft of two unencrypted laptop computers that occurred in 2011. This was recorded in other non-operating income (expense), net.\ne) For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company incurred $1.3 million of expense for a foreign currency option related to the acquisition of LifeWatch AG which is included in other non-operating income (expense), net.\nf) During the third quarter 2017, in connection with the acquisition of LifeWatch AG, the Company entered into a credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as a lender and an agent for the lenders. This credit agreement provided the Company a term loan for $205.0 million and a $50.0 million revolving credit facility which remains undrawn. A portion of the proceeds from the term loan were used to pay off the Company’s existing credit agreement with Healthcare Financial Solutions LLC, formerly General Electric Capital Corporation. As a result, the Company had a loss of $0.5 million on the extinguishment of the debt which was recorded in loss on extinguishment of debt.\ng) In the third quarter 2017, the Company reached a settlement with the seller of Mednet Healthcare Technologies, Inc. and related companies, which the Company acquired in early 2014. The Company sought indemnification for alleged breaches of certain representations and warranties. As part of the settlement, common stock with a fair value of $2.7 million was returned to the Company. The value of the stock exceeded the indemnification asset of $1.4 million previously recorded by the Company, resulting in a gain of $1.3 million which is included in other non-operating income (expense), net.\nh) Represents the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments.\ni) In December 2017, tax reform was enacted that required the Company to revalue its deferred tax assets based on the prospective lower tax rate of 21% instead of the current federal tax rate of 35%.

This reduction resulted in a one-time income tax benefit in the fourth quarter 2016 in the amount of $37.6 million.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, this press release also includes certain financial measures which have been adjusted and are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“Non-GAAP financial measures”). These Non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA. In accordance with Regulation G of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThese Non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace GAAP financial measures. They are presented as supplemental measures of our performance in an effort to provide our stakeholders better visibility into the Company’s ongoing operating results and to allow for comparability to prior periods as well as to other companies’ results. Management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to assess the financial health of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Management encourages our stakeholders to consider all of our financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our performance.\nAdjusted net income attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the fourth quarter 2017 excludes other charges of $16.9 million driven by a $12.1 million asset impairment charge related to certain trade names and internally developed software that are no longer going to be used as a result of rebranding and system rationalization efforts, $4.4 million related to the integration of LifeWatch, $1.0 million for other restructuring activities, ongoing patent litigation and the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard offset by a $0.6 million reduction in contingent consideration related to the Telcare acquisition. Adjusted net income attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the fourth quarter 2017 also excludes $3.3 million of amortization expense related to LifeWatch intangibles, $8.7 million of tax expense related to the one-time revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% stemming from tax reform enacted in December 2017 and the tax effect of these adjustments. By excluding expenses that are considered not necessary to support the ongoing business, are nonrecurring in nature or which limit year over year comparability, the Company believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures offer a meaningful representation of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Included in these excluded items are transaction related expenses, primarily legal and professional fees, legal fees related to patent litigation, costs related to restructuring programs aimed at streamlining operations and reducing future expense as well as other one-time items. These excluded charges are not part of the ongoing operations, and therefore, not reflective of the Company’s core operations. The Company views patent litigation as an extreme measure not typically required in our industry to protect a company’s intellectual property and which has not been common practice for the Company. The Company commenced patent litigation proceedings after the Company uncovered specific evidence of four distinct cases of misappropriation and infringement. The Company can choose to resolve the outstanding matters and terminate the expense at any time. The Company also included the income tax effect of these adjustments.\nAdjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2016 excludes $2.8 million of other charges related to patent litigation and costs associated with the Company’s 2016 acquisitions, $1.3 million of expense paid to a third party in the form of stock-based compensation, and a $37.6 million benefit related to the release of the Company’s tax valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nAdjusted net income attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excludes other charges of $31.4 million driven by $17.1 million related to the acquisition of LifeWatch, a $12.1 million asset impairment charge related to certain trade names and internally developed software that are no longer going to be used as a result of rebranding and system rationalization efforts, $3.1 million for other restructuring activities and the implementation of the new revenue recognition standard and $1.1 million for ongoing patent litigation offset by a $2.0 million reduction in contingent consideration related to the Telcare acquisition. Adjusted net income attributable to BioTelemetry, Inc. for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 also excludes $8.7 million of tax expense related to the one-time revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction of the prospective federal tax rate from 35% to 21% stemming from tax reform enacted in December 2017, $6.0 million of amortization of intangibles related to LifeWatch, a $2.5 million non-operating charge recorded for a settlement with the Department of Health and Human Services related to the theft of two unencrypted laptops in 2011, a $1.5 million one-time performance bonus paid to a third party in the form of stock-based compensation, $1.3 million of expense for a foreign currency option related to the acquisition of LifeWatch AG, a $1.3 million gain on a legal settlement, a $0.5 million loss on the extinguishment of the Company’s previous debt and the tax effect of these adjustments. By excluding expenses that are considered not necessary to support the ongoing business or which are nonrecurring in nature or which limit year over year comparability, the Company believes that these Non-GAAP financial measures offer a meaningful representation of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Included in these excluded items are transaction related expenses, primarily legal and professional fees, legal fees related to patent litigation, costs related to restructuring programs aimed at streamlining operations and reducing future expense as well as other one-time items.

The first of two performance measures was achieved in the fourth quarter 2016, resulting in $1.3 million of expense at that time. The second performance measure was achieved in the first quarter 2017, resulting in $1.5 million of expense. This is the first time in the Company’s history that such a bonus was offered and issued and the expense is nonrecurring. There are no additional agreements outstanding of this nature. The Company also included the income tax effect of these adjustments.\nAdjusted net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 excludes $8.6 million of other charges related to patent litigation and costs associated with the Company’s 2016 acquisitions, $1.3 million of expense paid to a third party in the form of stock-based compensation, and a $37.6 million benefit related to the release of the Company’s tax valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nIn addition to adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share, we also present adjusted EBITDA. This Non-GAAP financial measure excludes income taxes, interest, noncontrolling interest, Other charges, other excluded items included in total other income (expense), depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense. EBITDA is a widely accepted financial measure which we believe our stakeholders use to compare our ongoing financial performance to that of other companies. Adjusting our EBITDA for Other charges and other one-time items is a meaningful financial measure as we believe it is an indication of our ongoing operations.
