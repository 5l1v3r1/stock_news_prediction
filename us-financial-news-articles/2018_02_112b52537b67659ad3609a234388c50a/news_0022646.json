Some traders have bought it to close out their bets on its weakness, while others favored the dollar in a safe-haven move over higher-returning but riskier currencies, analysts said. \n“Overall, it’s just a highly volatile environment where the idiosyncratic things that drive (the market) - fundamentals, economic data – are taking second stage … Everything is becoming much more correlated in a very volatile environment,” said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York. \nThe dramatic moves in equities and bonds this week were stoked by concerns about signs of inflation amid an improving global backdrop and speculation whether the Federal Reserve and other major central banks would act quicker to raise interest rates. \nEquity and bond market volatility .VIX has surged this week. While foreign exchange markets EUR1MO= JPY1MO= have been calmer, the turbulence was enough to upend some popular trades, analysts said. \nBetting on the dollar weakening against the euro has been one of them, with an expanding euro zone economy stoking expectations   Bank will shrink its balance sheet sooner than expected. \nThe single currency was last down 0.08 percent at $1.2235, marking a 1.7 percent drop this week which would be its steeply weekly decline since November 2016, Reuters data showed. \nThe greenback stabilized versus safe-haven currencies after Thursday’s decline. \nIt rebounded from a four-month low to 108.66 yen, down 0.07 percent JPY= . It was up 0.47 percent at $0.9402 Swiss franc CHF= . \nAgainst a basket of six major currencies, the greenback was up 0.21 percent at 90.420. On the week, the dollar index .DXY has risen 1.41 percent for its best week in almost 15 months. \nThe dollar's advance was supported by some stabilization in U.S. stock prices, a day after heavy selling sank the Dow .DXY and S&P 500 .SPX into correction territory. \nThe bond market also calmed from its wild moves earlier this week. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR was 1 basis point lower on the day at 2.838 percent, which was below a four-year peak of 2.885 percent on Monday. \nThe dollar also received support after Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump approved a federal budget plan that ended an overnight federal shutdown.
