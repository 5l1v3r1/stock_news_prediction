He reiterated that policymakers remained both data-dependent and alert to developments with NAFTA. The central bank has raised rates three times since the middle of 2017.\nThe Canadian dollar was little changed on the news. Data released in Washington showed the U.S. trade deficit hit a nine-year high in December.\nImports rose by 1.5 percent to a record C$49.70 billion on increases in nine of 11 sections as volumes posted a 1.0 percent gain. Imports of energy products jumped by 16.9 percent.\nExports increased for the third month in a row, strengthening by 0.6 percent to C$46.51 billion. Exports of energy products, which had been hit by pipeline disruptions in November, expanded by 6.2 percent to hit the highest level in more than three years.\n“It was a flat month and not a great handover into 2018. I am still optimistic that trade in 2018 will be positive, given the strength of global growth,” said Ross Prusakowski, a senior economist at Export Development Canada.\nExports to the United States fell by 0.8 percent, while imports dropped by 1.3 percent. As a result, the trade surplus with the United States, which accounted for 75.1 percent of Canadian goods exported in December, edged up to C$3.42 billion from C$3.28 billion in November.\nThe annual merchandise trade deficit with the world in 2017 was C$24.00 billion, the second highest on record after the C$25.87 billion posted in 2016.
