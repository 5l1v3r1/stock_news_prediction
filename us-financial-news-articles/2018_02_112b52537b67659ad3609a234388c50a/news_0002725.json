Boston was also without Marcus Morris (hip), Marcus Smart (hand) and Shane Larkin (knee).\nTaurean Prince paced the Hawks with a career-high 31 points.\nAtlanta led 55-53 at halftime and hung within 80-72 before the Celtics ran away over the final 3:40 of the third period.\nRozier ignited a 14-3 spurt with a jumper and a 3-pointer. Then, after he and Tatum combined to make six free throws, Rozier capped the run with another 3-pointer, giving Boston a 94-75 lead headed into the final period.\nAl Horford, who played his first nine seasons for the Hawks before leaving for a four-year, $113 million offer in free agency in 2016, contributed 17 points, six rebounds and seven assists to Boston’s win.\nJaylen Brown had 19 points and Aron Baynes 11 for the Celtics, who were playing the middle game of a three-game homestand. They host Portland on Sunday.\nBoston shot 50.6 percent from the field and 11-for-24 on 3s, with Rozier connecting on six of his eight 3-point attempts.\nRozier’s previous career-high had been 23 points, set in November against Orlando.\nPrince had 30 at Toronto in December for his previous career-best.\nDennis Schroder, hampered of late with a sore shoulder, added 25 points on 10-for-20 shooting for the Hawks, who were tipping off a three-day, two-game trip to Boston and New York.\nSchroder, who entered the game with a team-leading 19.4 scoring average, had averaged just 12.8 points in his previous three games, shooting just 35 percent from the field and missing 14 of his 15 3-point attempts. He made one of his two 3-pointers against the Celtics.\nMarco Belinelli (15) and Kent Bazemore (11) also scored in double figures for the Hawks, who have lost five of six.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T11:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:30:35.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
