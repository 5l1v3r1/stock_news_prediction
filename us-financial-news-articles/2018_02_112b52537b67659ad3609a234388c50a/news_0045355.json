Winning this medal together is something really emotional and we really enjoy it.”\nFourcade’s day job as a soldier may help his aim, but it is his never-say-die attitude that makes him so special.\nHe shot impeccably and skied brilliantly in the relay, making the most of errors by his opponents as he swept to victory, waving the tricolour flag as he skated across the line and into the arms of his waiting team mates.\n“I was very stressed because it is not a race like any other one, individual races. I go fast in the first lap and (I‘m) shooting and no question in my head - go, just that,” he said.\nAfter a poor start to the Games in the sprint, Fourcade found his range and won the pursuit before edging out German Simon Schempp in a thriller to take the mass start gold.\nHis performances have prompted congratulatory messages from French President Emmanuel Macron, but on Tuesday he had to share the plaudits with his team mates.\n“It is not a man that crosses the finish line, but a team, and picks up the gold once again. Inspiring demonstration of the strength of the collective,” Macron said on Twitter.\nFor all the President’s celebration of the team, however, the French relay victory was firmly rooted in Fourcade’s refusal to accept second-best.\nReporting by Philip O'Connor, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:19:48.003+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
