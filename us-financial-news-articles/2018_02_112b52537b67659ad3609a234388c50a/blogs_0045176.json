He has also frequently attacked Time Warner’s CNN for what he sees as negative coverage of his campaign and administration.\nThe Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November aimed at stopping AT&T, which owns DirecTV, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, arguing that the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers.\nIt is unclear how much the judge’s decision will impact the case. Antitrust cases are judged legal or illegal depending on whether prices go up or innovation is lost because of a deal.\nIn a pre-trial hearing last week, AT&T&rsquo;s Petrocelli derided the government’s case as “weak,” saying that their economists had determined the price of AT&T&rsquo;s DirecTV could go down and that there could be a small increase to non-DirecTV consumers.\nThe Justice Department’s Craig Conrath disagreed, saying the deal would cause “hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.”\nAT&T and Time Warner shares both fell slightly.\nReporting by Diane Bartz and David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler and Bill Rigby\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T22:22:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
