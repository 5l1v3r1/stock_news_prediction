We are getting on now with everything we need to do to get back on track,” he said.\nHowever, the company said it expected the impact from back orders and lost orders at its Ostomy Care division to persist in the first half of 2018.\n“Performance in the fourth quarter was well ahead of re-set expectations, suggesting the supply disruption issues have not been as bad as feared,” Bernstein analysts said.\nConvaTec said it was targeting medium-term revenue growth in line with the market, with momentum returning through 2018.\n“Expectation that they will only reach market revenue growth in the medium-term is a disappointment,” the Bernstein analysts added, while Peel Hunt analysts described the 2018 outlook as a “modest miss” but said there could be some “relief rally” for the stock.\nThe company’s closest rival Coloplast this month posted weaker than expected quarterly revenue for the fourth time in a row.\nConvaTec’s Organic revenue rose 2.3 percent to $1.76 billion, slightly above its lowered guidance and compared with analyst expectations of $1.74 billion.
