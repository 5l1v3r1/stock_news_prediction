It noted the measures related exclusively to its business with private clients, adding it is primarily engaged in corporate banking and conducts only limited business with private individuals. \n“The bank will pursue its ongoing efforts to further enhance its organization, risk management and compliance functions,” it said. \nGermany weeks ago said it had found no evidence of substantial breaches of money laundering rules by 11 of its banks named in the Panama Papers. \nIn a separate crackdown on money laundering, FINMA ordered PKB Privatbank SA Lugano to turn over 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.40 million) in unlawfully generated profits from business linked to scandal-plagued Brazilian groups Petrobras ( PETR4.SA ) and Odebrecht.
