His case was handled by judges from an EU mission, who take cases seen as too sensitive for the local judiciary.\nThe 61-year-old was convicted of drug trafficking but acquitted on eight other counts including participating in organized crime and aggravated murder.\nOrganized crime flourished in the Balkans during the ethnic wars that followed Yugoslaviaâ€™s break-up in the 1990s, leaving the region awash with weapons and a transit route for drug traffickers.\nBosnia prosecutors had accused him of involvement in the 2007 killing of Ramiz Delalic, a Bosnian Muslim warlord who switched to organized crime after the wars in the Balkans.\nHe denied all the charges, which also included the possession, distribution and sale of drugs.\nKosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 but Bosnia has not recognized it because of resistance from its Serb-dominated autonomous region, which comprises a half of the country and wants to show solidarity with Serbia.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci; Editing by Andrew Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T18:10:50.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
