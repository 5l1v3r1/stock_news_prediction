America, or GAAP. However, management believes that, in order to properly understand our short-term and long-term financial and operational trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non-cash or non-recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP. These items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and impact on continuing operations. In this release, HubSpot's non-GAAP operating income (loss), operating margin, subscription margin, expense, expense as a percentage of revenue, net income (loss), and free cash flow are not presented in accordance with GAAP and are not intended to be used in lieu of GAAP presentations of results of operations.\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period-over-period operating performance. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain non-cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations, or reduce management's ability to make useful forecasts. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including analysis of the company's performance against prior periods, the preparation of operating budgets and to determine appropriate levels of operating and capital investments. In addition, management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing our financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to our peers and competitors. However, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be an alternative to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, it should be noted that these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We intend to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. Management may, however, utilize other measures to illustrate performance in the future. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures has been provided in the financial statement tables included above in this press release.\nThese non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related expenses, non-cash interest expense for the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, and the deferred income tax benefit from convertible notes and business combination. We believe investors may want to exclude the effects of these items in order to compare our financial performance with that of other companies and between time periods:\n(a)\nStock-based compensation is a non-cash expense accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense allows for financial results that are more indicative of our operational performance and provide for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies because stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period and company to company due to such things as differing valuation methodologies and changes in stock price.\n(b)\nExpense for the amortization of acquired intangible assets is a non-cash item, and we believe that the exclusion of this amortization expense provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(c)\nAcquisition related expenses, such as transaction costs and retention payments, are expenses that are not necessarily reflective of operational performance during a period. We believe that the exclusion of this these expenses provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(d)\nIn May 2017, the Company issued $400 million of convertible notes due in 2022 with a coupon interest rate of 0.25%. The imputed interest rate of the convertible senior notes was approximately 6.95%. This is a result of the debt discount recorded for the conversion feature that is required to be separately accounted for as equity, and debt issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the convertible debt instrument. The debt discount is amortized as interest expense together with the issuance costs of the debt. The expense for the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe the exclusion of this interest expense provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\n(e)\nThe deferred income tax benefit from the convertible notes issued in May 2017 is a non-cash item created by the difference in the carrying amount and tax basis of the convertible notes. This taxable temporary difference resulted in the Company recognizing a $9.4 million deferred tax liability which was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet. The creation of the deferred tax liability is recognized as a component of equity and represents a source of future taxable income which supports the realization of a portion of the income tax benefit associated with historical net operating losses. The deferred income tax benefit from the convertible notes is a non-cash item that is unique to the issuance of the Company's convertible notes, and we believe the exclusion of this deferred tax benefit provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\nThe deferred income tax benefit from the business combination entered into in September 2017 is a non-cash item created by the difference in the carrying amount and tax basis of the assets and liabilities acquired. This taxable temporary difference resulted in the Company recognizing a $2.2 million deferred tax liability which was recorded as an adjustment to goodwill on the consolidated balance sheet. The creation of the deferred tax liability represents a source of future taxable income which supports the realization of a portion of the income tax benefit associated with historical net operating losses. The deferred income tax benefit from the business combination is a non-cash item that is unique to the business combination, and we believe the exclusion of this deferred tax benefit provides for a useful comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hubspot-reports-strong-q4-and-full-year-2017-results-300598222.html\nSOURCE HubSpot", "external_links": ["http://www.hubspot.com/", "http://t.signauxcinq.com/e1t/c/5/f18dQhb0S1KL8bGch0W2n0x6l2B9nMJW7t6js65v0zwxN1qwcPx1G0TFf5_P0r603?t=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hubspot.com%2F&si=8902043&pi=e32243af-3e5d-4293-d026-38567d861c23", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hubspot-reports-strong-q4-and-full-year-2017-results-300598222.html", "http://ir.hubspot.com/investors/investor-overview/default.aspx", "https://www.hubspot.com/"], "published": "2018-02-14T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T01:03:57.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
