But much like yesterday, the market’s shaking it off.”\nMSCI’s all-country world index gained 0.81 percent while the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares in Europe gained 0.36 percent to close provisionally at 1474.26.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80 points, or 0.32 percent, to 24,973.49. The S&P 500 gained 10.51 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,709.14 and the Nasdaq Composite added 51.61 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,195.23.\nRising interest rates need not be a worry as long as the economy is underpinned by good economic growth, he said.\n“The market’s growing increasingly comfortable that maybe 3 percent on a 10-year Treasury note is OK,” Grohowski said.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 7/32 in price to push yields down to 2.8894 percent. Earlier in the session they had shot up to 2.944 percent.\nThe gap between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs reached its widest point since April after the higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data led to a sharp sell-off in U.S. Treasuries earlier in the day.\nWhile investors also shed European government bonds after Wednesday’s inflation data, political risks kept a cap on yields.\nGerman 10-year government bond yields were a basis point higher at 0.76 percent.\nThe dollar fell across the board. “Forex markets rotate from theme to theme all the time. The theme right now is global growth and strong global growth has historically pushed the dollar lower,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York.\nThe dollar index fell 0.28 percent, with the euro up 0.15 percent to $1.2467. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.42 percent versus the greenback at 106.56 per dollar.\nOil slipped below $64 a barrel as record U.S. production and rising inventories outweighed a weak dollar.\nU.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude and gasoline inventories rose last week, U.S. data showed.\nBrent crude, the global benchmark, fell 35 cents to$64.01. U.S. crude rebounded to gain 19 cent to $60.79.\nGold was on track for its fourth straight session of gains as the dollar skidded to its lowest in two weeks.\nSpot gold added 0.2 percent to $1,353.40 an ounce.\nReporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T01:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T23:27:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
