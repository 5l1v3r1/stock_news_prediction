We were in the changing room and I asked Thorsten and I said I‘m not sure I understood what just happened, did we tie?,” Canadian brakeman Kopacz said.\nKnowing that it had been a tie - the first in the two-man bobsleigh event since Nagano in 1998 - an overjoyed Friedrich and Margis had rushed over to Kripps and Kopacz to celebrate as they finished their final run.\n“At first I thought we had won outright but then these guys jumped over and were super excited and I thought ‘Wow these guys are really happy for us!',” said Kripps, who thought the Germans had been ecstatic about winning silver.\nBobsleigh - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Men's 2-man Finals - Olympic Sliding Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 19, 2018 - Gold medalists Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis of Germany celebrate with gold medalists Alexander Kopacz and Justin Kripps of Canada during the victory ceremony.
