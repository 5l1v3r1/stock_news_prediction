Nearly a decade later, in 2008, Kosovo declared independence, backed by the United States and most of the Western European states.\nKosovo’s independence has been recognised by 115 states so far.\nThaci said the agreement with Serbia would bring full normalisation of relations between the former foes, although they may not be required to recognise each other as independent states.\nKosovo’s relations with Western countries was soured by an initiative to scrap a law that established a war crimes court. The initiative was shelved under pressure by Western embassies in Pristina, and the court was set up in 2015, although it has yet to hear a case.\nThe Specialist Chamber, which has the authority to try ex-Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas for alleged atrocities in the war that led to independence from Serbia, is part of Kosovo’s legal system but based in The Hague to minimise the risks of witness intimidation and judicial corruption.\nKosovo’s media have reported that some of the leading Kosovo politicians, including Thaci, who was commander of the KLA, could be indicted by the court or called to testify.\n“This was an historic injustice but for the sake of keeping the strategic partnership with the US, EU and NATO we created that (the court),” Thaci said. “Kosovo has nothing to hide.”\nAsked what he would do if called to testify as a witness or defendant by the court, he said: “The president or any other citizen of this country has no reason to be afraid.”\n”We never violated Kosovo law or international laws. We have fought against a dictator, against a man who committed genocide,” he said, referring to former Yugoslav and Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who died in 2006 while on trial for war crimes.\nThe 1.8 million-strong country is preparing for a big celebration on Saturday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its declaration of independence. Kosovo-born British singer Rita Ora is due to hold a big concert in Pristina.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci; Editing by Ivana Sekularac and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T22:17:50.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
