These incidents never happened,” Kahr’s lawyer Manfred Ainedter said on ORF radio of the German newspaper report. \nReuters could not immediately reach Ainedter for further comment. \nThe OSV said it had already set up an expert commission to deal with a series of allegations related to historical sexual abuse in Austrian skiing and said it would present the findings to the public in the summer. \nThe commission will also now examine the Kahr case, the spokeswoman said. \nAllegations of systematic abuse by coaches, supervisors and athletes in Austrian skiing first emerged publicly late last year with former Olympic skier Nicola Werdenigg saying that she was raped when she was 16 by a male team colleague. \nWerdenigg, the 1975 Austrian downhill champion, did not reveal the name of her alleged attacker, but she told ORF radio on Friday that it was not Kahr. \nThe OSV spokeswoman said Werdenigg has been invited to give evidence in the investigation. WINTER OLYMPICS \nOn Friday the 2018 Winter Olympics opened in South Korea, and the OSV spokeswoman said the federation hoped the issue of historical sexual abuse would not affect the focus of Austrian athletes taking part in the Games, which run until Feb. 25. \nAsked whether the OSV was concerned about how all the allegations might affect the sport in Austria or harm the image of the OSV, she said: “The focus is fully on the Winter Olympic Games.” \nAsked by Reuters to comment on the latest allegations, a spokesman for Austrian Sports Minister Heinz-Christian Strache said: “This was 60 years ago, but of course everything must be cleared up.” He declined to comment on the Kahr case. \nStrache is also vice chancellor and leader of the junior party in the governing coalition, the far-right Freedom Party. \nSexual abuse scandals have become a major issue in a number of countries over the past year, spreading from the world of entertainment to sport, politics and business. \nOn Feb. 5, former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to an additional 40 to 125 years in prison for molesting young female gymnasts, capping weeks of testimony from nearly 200 victims about his decades of abuse.
