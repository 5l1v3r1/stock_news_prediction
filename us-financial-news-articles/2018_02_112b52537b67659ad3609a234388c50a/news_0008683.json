They persevered in spite of all danger and discouragement because they knew their cause was right,” she will say, according to excerpts of the speech.\n“As we remember the heroic campaigners of the past, who fought to include the voices of all citizens in our public debate, we should consider what values and principles guide our conduct of that debate today.”\nMay, a former interior minister, will say her government will create an annual internet safety transparency report to track progress in stamping out online abuse, publish a safety strategy and review legislation, drafted before social media, to ensure it can deal with offensive online communications.\nHer measures will sit alongside a commitment from the minister for women and equalities, Amber Rudd, to offer 2.5 million pounds ($3.5 million) for schemes to increase women’s participation in political and public life.\nAs in many other countries, social media outlets in Britain are home to passionate debates -- not least over the vote to leave the EU -- which sometimes spill over into cat-calling and abuse. Some lawmakers have received death threats.\nMany of the suffragettes, who with the Representation of the People Act in 1918 won the vote for women over the age of 30 and “of property”, received hate mail. Some were imprisoned or hurt, and some were killed, during their protests.\n“For while there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening. That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process,” May will say.
