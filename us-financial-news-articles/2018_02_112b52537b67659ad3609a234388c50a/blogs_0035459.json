The remaining 35 percent of respondents ranked their job satisfaction at 6 or less, including 24 percent who gave it a 4, 5 or 6 and 11 percent who gave it a 3 or less.\nFor workers in the doldrums, spending the bulk of their waking hours in a place delivering little joy can become a downward spiral. While misery on the job can seem insurmountable at times, breaking down what you can control — and therefore change — can go a long way toward improving your happiness at work before it gets worse.\n\"The biggest problem comes from disengagement,\" said Anne Marie Segal, founder of Segal Coaching in Stamford, Connecticut. \"Employees will feel unsatisfied and start to separate their goals from the company's, and then start to ask, 'Why am I here?'\"\nWhile the current climate for job seekers is good — low unemployment of 4.1 percent means less competition for open positions — not everyone is able to leave their current job, for reasons like schedules, key employee benefits, location or family obligations.\nJob satisfaction among U.S. workers By age Job satisfaction rating (out of 10) Silent Generation 8.9 Baby Boomers 7.2 Generation X 7 Millennials 6.9 Source: Bankrate.com If looking for a new job is not an option or you're unconvinced the grass will be greener elsewhere, there are ways to try making your current working situation more palatable.\nReconnect with the bigger picture Like an interconnected web, all positions in an organization have a purpose that feeds into the big-picture goals. Yet if you feel like you're doing busy work or repeating the same monotonous tasks, it can be easy to forget that you actually are contributing in a meaningful way to the company's goals.\n\"A lot of times we become disengaged because we don't feel like we're moving the ball forward,\" Segal said. \"If you can think about your job as playing a role in what the company is trying to achieve, it can help you feel tied to something bigger than yourself.\"\nBasically, reconnecting can bring a sense of purpose to your work.\nThe upshot? \"You feel more connected, more in charge of your career and you feel like you are driving your own ship,\" Segal said.\n\"If you can think about your job as playing a role in what the company is trying to achieve, it can help you feel tied to something bigger than yourself.\" -Anne Marie Segal, founder of Segal Coaching Expand your horizons Depending on your company or organization, there could be opportunities to get involved in a group that pulls its members from across the firm.\nFor instance, your company could have a wellness committee or diversity committee, Segal said. Or, maybe there's even a bowling or softball team your company sponsors.\nReaching out beyond the confines of your daily responsibilities can give you a break from the usual.\n\"A lot of times we start feeling like we're doing the same things over and over,\" Segal said.\nIt also gives you a chance to meet other people across the company that might end up becoming positive influences in your professional pursuits.
