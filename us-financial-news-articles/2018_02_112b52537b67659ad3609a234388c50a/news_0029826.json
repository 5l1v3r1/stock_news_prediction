Sources have said it is in talks with creditors about its outstanding loans.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, HNA said it was in a “very healthy financial position” with total assets of 1.5 trillion yuan ($236 billion) at end-2017, and that its staff purchased the bonds due to “full confidence” in its business prospects.\nIn the last couple of years, HNA and its units have issued bonds, both in China and overseas, to finance some acquisitions as well as to refinance some of its maturing debt.\nHainan Airlines Holdings ( 600221.SS ), the group’s flagship firm, has bonds issued worth $4.8 billion, denominated in both Chinese yuan and U.S. dollars, according to Thomson Reuters data. About $1.5 billion will mature in 2018.\nHNA Group itself has about $16 billion worth of bonds outstanding, of which $2.4 billion will come up for repayment this year and $4.8 billion in 2019, the data showed. A $52-million tranche, issued offshore, will be due on July 18.\nIn November, the group sold a short-dated bond at a coupon of 9 percent, higher than the 8 percent yield indicated on its December 2018 bond, underlining the pressure to refinance its debt-laden balance sheet.\nThe yield on a group unit’s three-year, December 2018 bond CN125936105= has nearly tripled from a year-ago, underscoring investor concerns and raising future borrowing costs.\nIn December, senior executives of HNA agreed to purchase $13 million worth of shares in another group subsidiary Bohai Capital Holdings ( 000415.SZ ) to bolster “investor confidence” and promote stability.\nBohai is one of many HNA listed units that have suspended trading in their shares, pending announcements.\nRATING DOWNGRADE Rating agency S&P cut HNA’s credit profile by one notch to ‘ccc+', a “speculative grade”, on Tuesday.\n“While it appears to have made some progress, and has valuable assets and highly liquid stakes in public traded companies, in our view HNA Group is dependent upon favorable market conditions to meet its upcoming financial commitments,” S&P said in its report on the group as well as some units\nS&P also lowered the credit rating of HNA’s IT outsourcing unit Pactera and airline caterer Gategroup Holding, as a result of the downgrading of the parent’s credit profile.\nIt said it expects Pactera’s debt leverage to remain high and its cash inflows to fall short of its outflows over the next 12 months. The company would need to raise new funds to meet its upcoming debt obligations, S&P said.\nHNA Group declined to comment on S&P&rsquo;s move.\n($1 = 6.3530 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; additional reporting by Matthew Miller in Beijing and Kane Wu in Hong Kong; Editing by Edwina Gibbs/Simon Cameron-Moore/Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T04:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T04:53:49.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
