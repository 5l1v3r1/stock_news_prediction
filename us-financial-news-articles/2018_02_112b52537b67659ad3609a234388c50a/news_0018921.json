By comparison, it posted a net profit of $214 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe company, which employs some 40,000 people around the world, said it posted fourth quarter consolidated net sales of $3.4 billion, up 8 percent versus a year earlier. It said sales were up 4 percent on a like-to-like basis for ongoing operations and considering foreign exchange fluctuations.\nCemex said sales grew due to higher prices for its products in local currency terms in Mexico, the United States and Europe, and because of higher cement volumes in the United States, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\nCemex makes around 40 percent of its operating profit in Mexico, which is subject to uncertainty this year with presidential elections and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nThe company’s second-largest market is the United States, accounting for around 20 percent of operating profit.\nHigher U.S. construction spending, which increased more than expected in December as investment in private projects rose, benefits Cemex’s unit, which is becoming increasingly important.\nCemex’s operating earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) slipped 5 percent to $625 million during the fourth quarter.\nBarclays said in January it expected Cemex’s EBITDA to grow this year as interest expenses on debt come down.\nThe global cement industry is preparing for a slightly better year in 2018 as developed markets recover in Europe and the United States, the head of the World Cement Association said in January.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito and Christine Murray; Editing by Will Dunham\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:07:27.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
