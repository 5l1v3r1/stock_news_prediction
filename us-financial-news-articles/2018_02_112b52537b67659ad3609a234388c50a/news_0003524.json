The terminals are the legacy business for which people think of them but that’s not where the future of that company is,” said James, without giving any further details.\nU.S. private equity firm Blackstone this week agreed to buy a majority stake in the Financial and Risk business of Thomson Reuters Corp in a $20 billion deal.
