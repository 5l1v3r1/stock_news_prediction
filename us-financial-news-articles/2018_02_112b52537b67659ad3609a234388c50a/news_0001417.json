K.C. wheat open interest reached an all-time high of 342,096 contracts on Jan. 25, before easing amid the short-covering this week.\nA lack of moisture was stressing wheat plants that were seeded last autumn in the top U.S. growing state of Kansas and in Oklahoma and Texas. HRW wheat primarily is used to make flour for bread.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture this week rated the Kansas wheat crop 14 percent good to excellent condition, down from 37 percent at the end of December.
