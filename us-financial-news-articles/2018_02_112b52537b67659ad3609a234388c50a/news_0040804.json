The company met or exceeded its 2017 guidance targets, generated net earnings of $827 million, cash from operating activities of $1.1 billion and expanded its non-GAAP cash flow margin by 81 percent from 2016. Encana is positioned to meet or exceed the targets outlined in its five-year plan and sees potential to generate significantly more cash available than originally expected.\nDemonstrating its focus on shareholder returns, Encana plans to spend up to $400 million to repurchase up to 35 million common shares over the next 12 months through a normal course issuer bid (NCIB). The commencement of the NCIB is subject to and following Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) approval. The company plans to fund the NCIB with cash on hand.\nFull-year and fourth quarter 2017 highlights include:\nNet earnings of $827 million, up from a net loss of $944 million in 2016. Cash from operating activities of $1.1 billion, up over 65 percent from 2016; fourth quarter cash from operating activities of $369 million, up 85 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 60 percent from 2016; fourth quarter non-GAAP cash flow of $444 million, up 47 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP cash flow margin up 81 percent from 2016 to $11.75 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE), significantly exceeding the original 2017 target of $10 per BOE. Core asset production growth of 31 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017, significantly exceeding the original 2017 target of greater than 20 percent. Fourth quarter Permian production of 82,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), significantly exceeding the original 2017 target of 75,000 BOE/d; fourth quarter Montney liquids production more than doubled from the fourth quarter 2016 to 29,000 barrels per day (bbls/d). Replaced 168 percent of full-year 2017 production on a Canadian protocols proved plus probable reserves basis after royalties (2P reserves) and 228 percent on an SEC proved reserves basis (U.S. protocols), excluding dispositions. Permian and Montney together replaced 331 percent of their full-year 2017 production on a Canadian protocols 2P reserves basis and 339 percent on an SEC proved reserves basis, excluding dispositions.\n“We delivered very strong financial and operational results in 2017,” said Doug Suttles, Encana President & CEO. “Driven by disciplined capital allocation, consistent performance and relentless pursuit of improvement, we significantly exceeded our cash flow margin target and delivered substantial oil and condensate growth. We are well positioned for 2018 and expect to fund our 2018 capital program from corporate cash flows.”\n“We have further demonstrated our confidence in our five-year plan and our commitment to shareholder returns with the announcement of our share repurchase program which we plan to fund with cash on hand,” added Suttles. “We are firmly on track to deliver quality returns and compelling growth through our five-year plan and we see strong financial upside.”\nInnovation, efficiency and commercial ingenuity drive well performance and value\nEncana’s strong and consistent performance is driven by a relentless focus on innovation and efficiency. The company’s large-scale cube development model, high-intensity completions and precision targeting continue to maximize margin, resource recovery and capital efficiency. These innovations increased average 180-day initial production rates by over 25 percent for only 9 percent additional cost. Encana has secured the majority of expected field services and materials for 2018 and expects efficiencies to offset inflation.\nOperational highlights include:\nPermian: strong finish to 2017 sets stage for significant 2018 production growth\nCube development, advanced completions and precision targeting continue to drive well productivity, efficiencies and returns. 2017 total production averaged 66,200 BOE/d, up 37 percent from 2016. Total production in 2018 is expected to increase by approximately 30 percent from 2017.\nMontney: high-quality condensate play driving significant margin expansion\nFourth quarter 2017 liquids production more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2016 to 29,000 bbls/d. This is expected to double again in the fourth quarter of 2018 to between 55,000 and 65,000 bbls/d. Montney condensate receives premium pricing similar to WTI. Encana has diversified the markets for its Western Canadian gas with only four percent of total expected company revenue exposed to AECO in 2018 and approximately five percent in 2019 and 2020.\nEagle Ford and Duvernay: quality assets generating free cash flow\nEnhanced completion designs continue to drive productivity improvements. These plays averaged total combined production of 67,800 BOE/d in 2017 which was consistent with 2016. Both assets delivered free operating cash flow in 2017 and are expected to deliver significant free operating cash flow again in 2018.\n2017 year-end and fourth quarter results: driving quality growth and quality returns\nEncana reported full-year net earnings of $827 million or $0.85 per share and a fourth quarter net loss of $229 million, reflecting a non-cash deferred tax charge primarily due to a decrease in tax rates in 2017 arising from U.S. tax reform. Cash from operating activities in 2017 was $1.1 billion and $369 million in the fourth quarter. Full-year non-GAAP operating earnings were $422 million, up from $76 million in 2016. Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating earnings were $114 million, up from $85 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP cash flow for 2017 was $1.3 billion, up 60 percent from 2016. Non-GAAP cash flow in the fourth quarter was $444 million, up 47 percent year-over-year.\nIn 2017, Encana delivered total production of 313,200 BOE/d with the company’s core assets contributing 83 percent. Total fourth quarter production averaged 335,200 BOE/d, with core assets contributing 93 percent. Full-year liquids production averaged 129,100 bbls/d with fourth quarter liquids volumes of 152,600 bbls/d, up 40 percent from the same period in 2016. Full-year natural gas production averaged 1,104 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d).\nDiscipline, innovation and efficiency: lowering costs and maintaining a strong balance sheet\nEncana continued to drive efficiencies across its business in 2017 and met all cost savings targets for the year. The company reduced transportation and processing expense by $56 million or six percent compared to 2016; operating expense (excluding long-term incentives costs) by $78 million or 14 percent; and administrative expense by $11 million or six percent (excluding the impact of long-term incentive costs and restructuring charges).\nAt year-end 2017, Encana had approximately $5.2 billion in total liquidity, composed of $719 million in cash and cash equivalents and $4.5 billion in available credit facilities.\n2018 capital and production guidance: disciplined capital allocation, liquids growth and margin expansion\nEncana expects its 2018 capital program will be between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion which will be fully funded from cash flows. Approximately 70 percent of its capital program will be focused on growing oil production from the Permian and high-margin condensate production in the Montney. The company’s core assets are expected to contribute over 95 percent of total 2018 production. Encana expects to grow 2018 total annual production to between 360,000 to 380,000 BOE/d and grow total liquids production to between 165,000 bbls/d and 175,000 bbls/d. Visit the company’s website to download its 2018 corporate guidance.\nManaging risk and maximizing realized price\nEncana has a fully integrated and robust risk management program to manage balance sheet risk and support the efficient execution of its strategy. This includes financial derivatives, transportation contracts and a diversified physical sales portfolio. Encana has secured access to diverse, premium markets across North America, limiting its exposure to AECO natural gas pricing through 2020.\nAs at February 12, 2018, the company has hedged approximately 104,000 bbls/d of expected oil and condensate production for the balance of the year using a variety of structures at an average price of $54.48 per barrel (bbl). In addition, Encana has hedged approximately 790 MMcf/d of expected natural gas production for the balance of the year at an average price of $3.03 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf).\nFor 2019, the company has hedged approximately 15,000 bbls/d of expected oil and condensate production at an average price of $58.30 per bbl.\nEncana announces planned share repurchase program\nThe company has announced plans to repurchase up to $400 million of the company's common shares over the next 12 months through the NCIB, subject to and following TSX approval. The company will be submitting a notice to the TSX of its intention to commence the NCIB (the “Notice”) through which Encana may purchase for cancellation up to 35,000,000 common shares, which is equal to approximately 3.6 percent of Encana’s 973,123,364 common shares issued and outstanding as of January 31, 2018. Purchases will be made on the open market through the facilities of the TSX, New York Stock Exchange and/or alternative trading systems at the market price at the time of acquisition, as well as by other means as may be permitted by stock exchange rules and securities laws. The company plans to fund the NCIB with cash on hand.\nEncana intends to execute the NCIB in a manner that is consistent with its commitment to capital discipline by ensuring that the level of spending is aligned with the prevailing commodity price environment and resulting cash flows. The actual number of common shares that may be purchased under the NCIB and the timing of any such purchases will be determined by Encana. Encana believes that, depending on the trading price of its common shares and other relevant factors, purchasing its own shares represents an attractive opportunity that is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Encana has not purchased any of its shares pursuant to a normal course issuer bid within the past 12 months.\nDividend declared\nOn February 14, 2018, the Board declared a dividend of $0.015 per share payable on March 29, 2018 to common shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Reconciliation (for the period ended December 31)\n($ millions, except per share amounts) Q4\n2017 Q4\n2016\n2017\n2016 Cash from (used in) operating activities 369 199 1,050 625 Deduct (add back): Net change in other (13 ) (11 ) (40 ) (26 ) Net change in non-cash working capital (62 ) (92 ) (253 ) (187 ) Non-GAAP cash flow 1 444 302 1,343 838 Non-GAAP cash flow margin 1 14.40 10.21 11.75 6.49 Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Reconciliation Net earnings (loss) (229 ) (281 ) 827 (944 ) Before-tax (addition) deduction: Unrealized gain (loss) on risk management 46 (149 ) 442 (614 ) Impairments - - - (1,396 ) Non-operating foreign exchange gain (loss) (19 ) (104 ) 281 135 Restructuring charges - (1 ) - (34 ) Gain (loss) on divestitures (1 ) (3 ) 404 390 Gain on debt retirement - - - 89 26 (257 ) 1,127 (1,430 ) Income tax (369 ) (109 ) (722 ) 410 After-tax (addition) deduction (343 ) (366 ) 405 (1,020 ) Non-GAAP operating earnings (loss) 1\n114\n85\n422\n76\n1 Non-GAAP cash flow, non-GAAP cash flow margin and non-GAAP operating earnings are non-GAAP measures as defined in Note 1.\nProduction Summary\n(for the period ended December 31)\n(average) Q4\n2017 Q4\n2016\n% ∆\n2017\n2016\n% ∆ Oil (Mbbls/d) 85.0 66.4 28 76.3 73.7 4 NGLs – Plant Condensate (Mbbls/d) 33.7 19.9 69 26.3 20.3 30 Oil & Plant Condensate (Mbbls/d) 118.7 86.3 38 102.6 94.0 9 NGLs – Other (Mbbls/d) 33.9 22.6 50 26.5 28.1 (6 ) Oil and NGLs Total (Mbbls/d) 152.6 108.9 40 129.1 122.1 6 Natural gas (MMcf/d) 1,096 1,276 (14 ) 1,104 1,383 (20 ) Total production (MBOE/d) 335.2 321.5 4 313.2 352.7 (11 )\nLiquids and Natural Gas Prices Q4 2017 Q4 2016 2017 2016 Liquids ($/bbl) WTI 55.40 49.29 50.95 43.32 Encana realized liquids prices 1 Oil 52.94 50.78 49.76 48.68 NGLs – Plant Condensate 52.65 45.39 48.92 39.84 NGLs – Other 24.29 17.86 20.63 12.35 Natural gas NYMEX ($/MMBtu) 2.93 2.98 3.11 2.46 Encana realized natural gas price 1 ($/Mcf) 2.34 2.35 2.42 2.10 1 Prices include the impact of realized gain (loss) on risk management.\nYear-End 2017 Reserves Estimates\n2017 Reserves Estimates – Canadian Protocols (Net, After Royalties) 1\nUsing forecast prices and costs; simplified table\n(MMBOE) 1P\nProved 2P\nProved +\nProbable 3P\nProved +\nProbable +\nPossible Canadian Operations 521 1,249 1,504 USA Operations 341 660 735 Total as of December 31, 2017 861 1,909 2,239\n2017 Proved Reserves Estimates – Canadian Protocols (Net, After Royalties) 1 Using forecast prices and costs; simplified table.

A description of the primary differences between the disclosure requirements under Canadian standards and under U.S. standards will be set forth under the heading “Note Regarding Additional Reserves Information” in the Form 51-101F1.\nADVISORY REGARDING OIL AND GAS INFORMATION - All estimates in this news release are effective as of December 31, 2017, prepared by qualified reserves evaluators in accordance with procedures and standards contained in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation (\"COGE\") Handbook, National Instrument 51-101 (NI 51-101) and SEC regulations, as applicable. On August 14, 2017, Encana was granted an exemption by the Canadian Securities Administrators from the requirements under NI 51-101 that each qualified reserves evaluator or qualified reserves auditor appointed under section 3.2 of NI 51-101 and who execute the report under Item 2 of Section 2 of NI 51-101 be independent of Encana. Notwithstanding this exemption, for year-ended December 31, 2017, Encana involved independent qualified reserves auditors to audit a portion of the Company’s reserves and economic contingent resources estimates. Detailed Canadian and U.S. protocol disclosure will be contained in the Form 51-101F1 and Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively, as described in Note 2. Additional detail regarding Encana's economic contingent resources disclosure will be available in the Supplemental Disclosure Document filed concurrently with the Form 51-101F1. Information on the forecast prices and costs used in preparing the Canadian protocol estimates will be contained in the Form 51-101F1. For additional information relating to risks associated with the estimates of reserves and resources, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of the Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReserves are the estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be recoverable from known accumulations, from a given date forward, based on: analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical and engineering data, the use of established technology, and specified economic conditions, which are generally accepted as being reasonable. Proved reserves are those reserves which can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves. Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves. There is a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of proved plus probable plus possible reserves.\nContingent resources do not constitute, and should not be confused with, reserves. Contingent resources are defined as those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development, but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. There is a range of uncertainty of estimated recoverable volumes. A low estimate (1C) is considered to be a conservative estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the low estimate, which under probabilistic methodology reflects at least a 90% confidence level. A best estimate (2C) is considered to be a realistic estimate of the quantity that will actually be recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate, which under probabilistic methodology reflects at least a 50% confidence level. A high estimate (3C) is considered to be an optimistic estimate. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the high estimate, which under probabilistic methodology reflects at least a 10% confidence level. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.\nAll of the resources classified as contingent are considered to be discovered, and as such have been assigned a 100% chance of discovery, but have however been risked for the chance of development. The chance of development is defined as the likelihood of a project being commercially viable and development proceeding in a timely fashion. Determining the chance of development requires taking into consideration each contingency and quantifying the risks into an overall development risk factor at a project level. All of the contingent resources disclosed herein are classified as either Development Pending or Development On Hold. Development Pending is where resolution of the final conditions for development is being actively pursued (high chance of development). Resources classified in this sub-category must be economic and have been assigned a chance of development ranging between 80 percent and 99 percent. Development On Hold is where there is a reasonable chance of development, but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Resources classified in this sub-category must be economic and have been assigned a chance of development ranging between 50 percent and 79 percent. Contingent resources are defined as “economic contingent resources” if they are currently economically recoverable and are categorized as economic if those contingent resources have a positive net present value under currently forecasted prices and costs. In examining economic viability, the same fiscal conditions have been applied as in the estimation of Encana's reserves. Contingencies include factors such as required corporate or third party (such as joint venture partners) approvals, legal, environmental, political and regulatory matters or a lack of infrastructure or markets. None of Encana’s estimated contingent resources are subject to technical contingencies.\nThe conversion of natural gas volumes to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is on the basis of six thousand cubic feet to one barrel. BOE is based on a generic energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent economic value equivalency at the wellhead. Readers are cautioned that BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. 30-day initial or peak production and other short-term rates are not necessarily indicative of long-term performance or of ultimate recovery.\nADVISORY REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS - This news release contains certain forward-looking statements or information (collectively, “FLS”) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
