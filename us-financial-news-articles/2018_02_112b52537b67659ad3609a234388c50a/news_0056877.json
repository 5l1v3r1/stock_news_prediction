Sophomore guard Markus Howard entered the day as the Big East’s No. 2 scorer at 21.3 points per game, but DePaul limited him to 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting.\nThe Blue Demons limited Marquette to 35 percent accuracy from the field in the second half and 40.7 percent for the game as they held the Golden Eagles without a point for 6:26 midway through the half and 2:32 during the final four minutes to halt the visitors’ rally. DePaul also owned the boards by a 49-30 margin.\nMarquette held a 35-28 lead in the opening minute of the second half before DePaul launched its attack. Maric’s layup with 15:22 left gave the Blue Demons a 39-37 edge -- their first lead since 7:11 of the first half -- and DePaul’s defense stayed stout.\nFrom 16:25 to 7:15 of the second half, Rowsey’s 3-pointer at 13:41 served as Marquette’s only points. DePaul pushed its lead all the way to 52-40 on a pair of free throws by junior guard Eli Cain (14 points, seven rebounds) with 7:36 to go before the Golden Eagles pushed back.\nMarquette cut its deficit to 5 two times -- the last on sophomore guard Markus Howard’s layup with 3:47 to play -- but that’s when DePaul forced Marquette to wait nearly three minutes for its next basket.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-25T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-25T19:59:07.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
