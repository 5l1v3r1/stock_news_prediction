So the intensity level comes up. The more comfortable Christian is, the more relaxed, he is going to run better.” MAINTAINING SPEED \nGreene, a former world record holder in the 100m, believes Coleman can eventually run the 60 in 6.35 or 6.36 seconds. \n“I told him, ‘Now you know you can run that fast, don’t worry about trying to chase it (the world record), start perfecting your race’,” the 2000 Olympic champion said. \nThe start is already there. \n“He does not look that tall, but he has very long legs,” Greene said. “He’s able to cover ground and he’s very powerful. He’s so explosive, everybody else is just chasing.” \nLearning to maintain his top speed will be a key, both in the 60 and the outdoor 100 meters, the retired Greene suggested, adding he believed Coleman could run the 100 in 9.7 seconds this year, a time only seven runners have ever achieved. \n“Instead of him being upright about 20 or 25 metres and being top speed there, I would rather him hit his top speed a little further down the track, maybe about 40-45 metres,” Greene said. \nColeman agreed \n“Like Maurice said, I’ve got to work on holding my form and not slowing down as fast at the end,” the U.S. collegiate champion said. \nHe would also like to correct a flaw from his Clemson race. \n“I had a decent start,” Coleman said. “Then I kind of felt an imbalance on my third and fourth steps and that kind of threw me off in my transition.” \nPrecious 100ths of a second could be dropped with improvement there, all other things being equal, Greene said. \n“If he can push it out, and pick up his top-end speed a little further down the track, he is going to fly.” Reporting by Gene Cherry in Salvo, North Carolina; Editing by John O'Brien", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T12:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T12:09:36.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
