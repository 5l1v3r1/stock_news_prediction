It strengthened our Olympic spirit,” she said at a news conference on Thursday.\n”When CAS took that away, it did the opposite. So I think we’re all turning to the IOC for reform and to take a strong stance to give us that spirit back.\n“We’re holding to an Olympic spirit that feels like it’s dying.”\nThe IOC invited 169 carefully screened Russian athletes to compete as independents after the nation was banned from Pyeongchang over the Sochi 2014 doping scandal.\nIt then refused to invite any of the Russian athletes who had their bans overturned by CAS.\nDozens of Russians, including some who had not been named in the investigations or had any prior doping offences but were still not invited, have since lodged appeals with CAS seeking to be admitted to the Games.\nNikitina is in Pyeongchang awaiting news on her appeal.\nUhlaender warned that if the IOC, WADA and CAS failed to find a solution to the anti-doping system’s problems it would open a “Pandora’s Box”.\n“I‘m looking to the IOC to take a harder stance and I think all the athletes are looking to the IOC to make sure that the athletes are tested -- not just increased in competition, because we know when we’re going to compete,” said Uhlaender, who will be competing in her fourth Olympics.\n“It’s the out-of-competition testing that’s most important. Why can’t we have the top 10 athletes in the world tested out of competition mandatory by an independent source?”\nEditing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-08T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T14:16:09.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
