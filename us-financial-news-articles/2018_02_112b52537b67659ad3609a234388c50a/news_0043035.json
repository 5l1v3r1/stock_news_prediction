On a clinical level, we successfully deployed the PIVOTAL study abroad, by performing the first implantations of our bioprosthesis in Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic, in medical centers renowned for their expertise in undertaking clinical trials with cardiac devices for the European market. We also continued to train medical teams in four additional countries, which should allow us to complete the study on time. Our discussions with the FDA are progressing in accordance with our goal of initiating a first clinical evaluation in the United States during 2018. From an industrial standpoint, our technical teams have intensified their efforts, and we should soon have a modern and efficient production tool. The arrivals of Wenzel Hurtak as Director of Manufacturing and Francesco Arrechi as Marketing Manager has accelerated CARMAT’s transformation into an industrial and commercial company. On the back of these breakthroughs, we successfully completed a €52.9 million capital increase enabling us to finance our industrial and clinical development through to CE marking, which we expect in 2019.”\n1 Annual accounts were approved by the Board of Directors on February 12, 2018. Audit procedures relative to these accounts have been carried out. The auditor’s report is currently being prepared.\nStrengthened financial structure\nAt December 31, 2017, cash and marketable cash instruments of €60.7 million, a substantial increase compared to December 31, 2016 (€31.2 million) due to:\nthe completion of a €52.9 million capital increase in December 2017; drawdowns on the second tranche of the contingent equity line subscribed to with Kepler Cheuvreux for a gross total of €8.0 million. Within the framework of this financing, CARMAT has access to an additional €29.9 million of financing that may be exercised depending on its requirements and on market conditions.\nThese financial resources will allow the Company to continue its industrial and clinical development until it receives CE marking, which is expected in 2019.\n2017 annual results\nCARMAT recorded no revenue in 2017, as its total artificial heart is still in clinical development. The CE marking process, which is a prerequisite to marketing the product in Europe, is progressing in line with the Company’s expectations.\nOperating expenses totaled €31.1 million in 2017, a 25% increase on 2016 due to:\nthe continuation of the CE marking process undertaken with DEKRA materialized by the completion of the majority of the technical dossier; the ramping up of the Company’s industrial development with a view to opening a new manufacturing site in the first quarter of 2018; the analyses and actions undertaken by the Company enabling it to be granted approval to resume the PIVOTAL study during the first half of the year; the internationalization of the PIVOTAL study, notably with the training of the teams from the investigation centers involved in the study and the performing of the first implantations in Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic.\nIn euros (€) 31/12/2017 31/12/2016 Operating income Operating subsidies 28,000 173,167 Other operating income (reversal of provision) 89,827 Total operating income 28,000 262,994 Operating expenses Purchases and external expenses 21,889,776 17,912,185 Salaries and benefits 7,383,695 6,174,384 Other operating expenses 1,789,126 755,633 Total operating expenses 31,062,597 24,842,202 Operating profit/loss -31,034,596 -24,579,208 Financial profit/loss -472,363 -1,142,716 Exceptional items -55,642 -75,370 Research tax credit 2,334,690 2,817,116 Net profit/loss -29,227,910 -22,980,178 Once a financial loss (-€472.3 thousand), exceptional items (-€55.6 thousand) and Research Tax Credit (€2.3 million) are taken into account, the net loss at December 31, 2017 was of €29.21 million, versus a loss of €23.0 million at December 31, 2016.\n2017 highlights\nIn 2017, CARMAT achieved major breakthroughs on all of its project’s fundamental routes:\nClinical development On May 2, 2017, the ANSM (French national agency for the safety of medicines and health products) granted CARMAT the approval to resume the PIVOTAL study in France. During the second half of 2017, CARMAT internationalized the PIVOTAL study by performing the first human implantations of its bioprosthesis in Kazakhstan and the Czech Republic, in compliance with the protocol approved by the ANSM and the authorizations received from those countries’ respective health authorities. In accordance with its clinical strategy, the Company is pursuing its efforts aimed at expanding the PIVOTAL study to four other European countries and initiating a clinical study in the United States in 2018. Industrial development During the second half of 2017, work on the new automated assembly plant entered its final phase, and the site should become fully operational during the first quarter of 2018. It will allow manufacturing on a larger scale with a higher yield to meet the requirements of the PIVOTAL phase and the commercial launch. In November 2017, CARMAT signed a partnership agreement with AddUp, the Michelin and Fives Joint Venture, regarding a unique collaboration in the medical sector that will eventually lead to the 3D printing of certain components and the production acceleration in the commercial phase.
