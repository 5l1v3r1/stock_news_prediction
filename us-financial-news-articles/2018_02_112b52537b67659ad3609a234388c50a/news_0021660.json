One of the men is wearing a jacket that says MS-13, the name of a criminal street gang that has ties to the Central American country of El Salvador. Republican President Donald Trump has blamed illegal immigration for the spread of MS-13 in the U.S.\nIn the cartoon, the woman utters a profanity and the man responds, “Now, Honey ... I believe they prefer to be called ‘Dreamers’ ... or future Democrats.”\nAnother armed man in the cartoon holds a sword, with a mask on his face and sticks of dynamite around his chest, in an apparent depiction of a suicide bomber.\n“In hindsight, instead of generating debate, this cartoon only inflamed emotions,” Karen Moses, executive editor of the Albuquerque Journal, said in a statement. “This was not the intent, and for that, the Journal apologises.”\nAll of the U.S. senators and members of Congress from New Mexico condemned the cartoon in a joint statement, saying it “plays to the most false and negative stereotype of ‘Dreamers,’ which can only serve to enrage extremists.”\nA photographer at the Albuquerque Journal who is originally from El Salvador also criticized the cartoon on Twitter.\nSean Delonas, the artist who drew the cartoon, could not be reached for comment.\nHe told the New York Times that he believed immigrants should come legally to the United States, the Times reported.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Christian Schmollinger\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T07:15:27.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
