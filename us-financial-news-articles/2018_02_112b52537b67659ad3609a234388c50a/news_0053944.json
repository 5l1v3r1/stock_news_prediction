But the investigation could also be dropped.\nThe three were arrested over suspicion of links to Driss Oukabir who is in custody in Spain. He is charged with membership of a terrorist organization and murder for his part in a Barcelona van attack that killed 14 people in August. He has denied involvement.\nIn the attack, a man drove a rented vehicle into crowds in Barcelona’s famous Las Ramblas boulevard on Aug. 17, killing 14 and injuring more than 100.\nOne day later, police shot dead five people in Cambrils, down the coast from Barcelona, after they drove their car at pedestrians and police officers, killing a woman.\nReporting by Caroline Pailliez and Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-23T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:18:13.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
