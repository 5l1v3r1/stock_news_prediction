Jacobs\nExecutive Chairman of the Board of Directors\nQualcomm Incorporated\n5775 Morehouse Drive\nSan Diego, CA 92121\nDear Dr. Jacobs:\nBroadcom has long sought a meeting to discuss Broadcom's acquisition of Qualcomm. Following Qualcomm's announcement today that it is willing to meet with us, we offered to meet with Qualcomm on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I was astonished to hear that Qualcomm is not willing to meet until Tuesday â€“ only after Qualcomm's and Broadcom's respective meetings with Glass Lewis and ISS. We hope that your willingness to meet with us reflects Qualcomm's genuine intent to reach an agreement with respect to our February 5 proposal. After having met with most of your largest stockholders this past week, we have no doubt that this is their strong desire as well. We urge you to meet with us without further delay, and stand ready to meet this Saturday or Sunday in New York or another mutually convenient location.\nTo make our meeting more productive, we are providing you with a proposed merger agreement that we are prepared to enter into. As you will see, the agreement is highly favorable to Qualcomm and its stockholders and includes an $8 billion regulatory reverse termination fee and a 6% per annum regulatory ticking fee on the cash portion of the merger consideration (net of dividends). We want to reiterate that $82 per Qualcomm share is our best and final offer.\nWe look forward to meeting with you promptly.\nThis letter does not constitute a binding obligation or commitment of either company to proceed with any transaction. No such obligations will in any event be imposed on either party unless and until a mutually acceptable definitive agreement is formally entered into by both parties.\nSincerely,\n/S/ Hock Tan\nHock Tan\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nThe proposed merger agreement is available on www.AVGO-QCOM.com and will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nMoelis & Company LLC, Citi, Deutsche Bank, J.P.
