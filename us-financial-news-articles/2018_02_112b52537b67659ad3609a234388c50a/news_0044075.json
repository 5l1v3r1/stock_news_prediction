But both have declined to give their consent to the withdrawal bill because they say it fails to respect the devolution agreement made 20 years ago.\nWhile they do not have a veto on Brexit legislation, ignoring them would stretch already tense relations with London, and could feed public appetite for Scottish independence.\nScottish and Welsh ministers and officials from Northern Ireland will discuss the amendments to the EU withdrawal bill with the British government later on Thursday.\n“I will be making it abundantly clear that we need to see further progress on safeguarding devolution,” Scotland’s Brexit minister Michael Russell said in a statement.\nHe added that Scotland would continue to argue for Britain to remain part of the EU’s single market and customs union in order to limit the economic damage of Brexit - something Prime Minister Theresa May’s government in London has ruled out.\n“We are not opposed to UK-wide frameworks, when they are in Scotland’s interest, but devolved powers can only be changed with the agreement of the Scottish parliament,” said Russell.\n“Failing that commitment from the UK government, we will be unable to recommend consent to this legislation.”\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T02:28:59.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
