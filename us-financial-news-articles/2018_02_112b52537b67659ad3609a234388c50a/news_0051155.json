He called Kim Jo Yong, the younger sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, is “a central pillar of the most tyrannical and oppressive regime on the planet.”\nA North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser, is due to attend the closing of the Olympics this weekend.\n“We stand up to murderous dictatorships. And we will keep standing strong until North Korea stops threatening our country, our allies or until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missiles once and for all,” Pence said.\nNorth Korea has thus far resisted the “maximum pressure” campaign led by the United States to try to force Pyongyang to cede its nuclear weapons.\nU.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a speech on Thursday at the University of Chicago that sanctions are having an impact because North Korea now has less money to spend on its ballistic missile tests.\n“It is this fact, more than anything else, that prompted the Kim regime to reach out to South Korea and do public relations damage control at the Olympics,” she said.\n“Their sources of revenue are drying up. Sending cheerleaders to Pyeongchang was a sign of desperation, not national pride,” she said.\nAdditional reporting by Matt Spetalnick, David Brunnstrom and Makini Brice\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T05:40:40.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
