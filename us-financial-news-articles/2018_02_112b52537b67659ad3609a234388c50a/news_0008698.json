In contrast to the time of his arrest four months later in his native Brussels, Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported that he had long hair and a beard.\nDespite hopes in Paris that Abdeslam might break more than two years of silence on the carnage, RTBF said he told the court that he would not answer questions and refused to stand when the judge read out the charges against him.\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:48:00.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
