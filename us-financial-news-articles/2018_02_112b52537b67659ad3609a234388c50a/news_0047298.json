Words such as “will”, “anticipates”, “expects” and “intends” or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on Shopify’s current expectations about future events and financial trends that management believes might affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs, and on certain assumptions and analysis made by Shopify in light of the experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments and other factors management believes are appropriate. These projections, expectations, assumptions and analyses are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could cause actual results, performance, events and achievements to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Although Shopify believes that the assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements are reasonable, they may prove to be incorrect, and readers cannot be assured that the Offering discussed above will be completed on the terms described above. Completion of the proposed Offering is subject to numerous factors, many of which are beyond Shopify’s control, including but not limited to, the failure of customary closing conditions and other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in Shopify’s filings with the SEC and the securities commissions or similar securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces or territories of Canada. The forward-looking statements contained in this news release represent Shopify’s expectations as of the date of this news release, or as of the date they are otherwise stated to be made, and subsequent events may cause these expectations to change. Shopify undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005747/en/\nShopify\nINVESTORS:\nKatie Keita\nDirector, Investor Relations\n613-241-2828\nIR@shopify.com\nor\nMEDIA:\nSheryl So\nPublic Relations Manager\n416-238-6705 (ext. 302)\npress@shopify.com\nSource: Shopify Inc.", "external_links": ["http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sec.gov&esheet=51762030&newsitemid=20180221005747&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sec.gov&index=2&md5=b7526e0f7a5cd66248fb0e39bdb5bea5", "http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180221005747/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sedar.com&esheet=51762030&newsitemid=20180221005747&lan=en-US&anchor=www.sedar.com&index=1&md5=4aae24b31b4e418edd43a1871e636e98"], "published": "2018-02-21T16:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T19:30:08.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
