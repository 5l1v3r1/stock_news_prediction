The stock has lost 61 percent over the past year, excluding gains on Wednesday.\nIf gains hold, Fossil Group is on track to gain over $350 million market capitalization.\nWhile there were bright spots in the quarter - tighter cost control and a 31 percent surge in e-commerce sales - nothing had fundamentally changed for the company, analysts said.\n“The company is seeing no stabilization of the traditional watch category,” Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow said. “This simply isn’t a fundamentally sound business right now.”\nBoruchow, however, raised his price target by $4 to $8, citing a two percent gain in same-store sales, helped by higher demand in the Americas and Europe - the company’s biggest contributors to sales.\nThe company said on Tuesday that it had introduced a number of new models before the holiday quarter, which fueled a double-digit increase in Armani watch sales.\nBut Fossil, which also sells watches for brands such as DKNY and Skagen, discounted slow-moving items in the December quarter, a sign that it was struggling to compete with a certain section of the wearables market dominated by Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) and Garmin Ltd ( GRMN.O ).\nFive out of 10 brokerages covering the stock rate it a “hold”, while only one rates it a “buy”. The remaining rate the stock a “sell” or lower.\n(This version of the story corrects ticker symbol to FOSL.O from FOSL.N in first paragraph.)\nReporting by Karina Dsouza and Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T16:53:51.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
