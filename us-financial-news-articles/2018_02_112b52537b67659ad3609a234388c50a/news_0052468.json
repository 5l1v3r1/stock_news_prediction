His words were caught on video and haunted him for the rest of his term.\nMacron responded differently to provocation on Saturday, scrapping his itinerary to engage several of his hecklers in a lengthy and detailed exchange on trade policy, social charges and food standards in front of TV cameras.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The budget for the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy should not be cut by more than Britain’s contribution as it exits the 28-member bloc, he also said.\nThibault Guybert, a cereal farmer from the Paris region who had joined in the booing, said the president would be judged on his actions, and bigger protests should not be ruled out.\n“We wanted to jostle President Macron a bit to make our displeasure known and let him know we’re not just going to leave it there,” Guybert said on BFM TV.\n“We’ll have to be very clear with him and find out whether he wants to keep French agriculture or not.”\n($1 = 0.8135 euros)\nReporting by Laurence Frost; Additional reporting by Gus Trompiz and Simon Carraud; Editing by David Holmes\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T15:59:39.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
