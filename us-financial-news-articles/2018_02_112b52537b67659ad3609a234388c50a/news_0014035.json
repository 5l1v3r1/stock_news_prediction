(NASDAQ:PRCP), a leading global provider of 3D automated metrology solutions and coordinate measuring machines, today announced results for the second quarter of its 2018 fiscal year (quarterly period ended December 31, 2017).\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Sales $ 20.4 $ 21.8 $ (1.4 ) $ 39.7 $ 39.3 $ 0.4 Net Income 0.4 2.5 (2.1 ) 1.9 0.1 1.8 Diluted Income per Share $ 0.04 $ 0.27 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.20 $ 0.02 $ 0.18 Second quarter fiscal 2018 results compared to second quarter fiscal 2017:\nSecond quarter consolidated net sales were $20.4 million, a decrease of 6.4% as compared to a strong second quarter in fiscal year 2017 Consolidated gross profit was $7.4 million and gross margin was 36.3% Second quarter and year-to-date results include a charge of $0.7 million for a court award in a trade secrets case granting defendants’ motions for the recovery of attorney fees Second quarter reported operating income totaled $0.5 million and recurring operating income of $1.1 million Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $0.4 million Second quarter diluted earnings per share was $0.04 per diluted share Bookings were $20.0 million; bookings have been at least $20 million for six out of the last seven quarters Backlog increased 16.3% to $48.5 million, a record for the Company’s second quarter Cash and short-term investments totaled $9.0 million for the period ending December 31, 2017\nYear-to-date fiscal 2018 results compared to year-to-date fiscal 2017:\nYear-to-date consolidated net sales increased 1.0% to $39.7 million Year-to-date consolidated gross profit increased $1.1 million to $15.1 million Consolidated gross margin was 38.0%, an increase of 240 basis points Year-to-date reported operating income totaled $2.0 million and recurring operating income was $2.6 million Net income increased considerably, growing by $1.8 million to $1.9 million for year-to-date fiscal 2018 Year-to-date diluted earnings per share also improved significantly, achieving $0.20 as compared to $0.02 per share in the prior year-to-date period Bookings increased 1.2% to $43.2 million for year-to-date fiscal 2018\nThird quarter and full year 2018 guidance:\nExpect revenue in the range of $18.0 million to $21.0 million Reaffirm our previous guidance of mid-single digit revenue growth for fiscal year 2018\nDavid Watza, President and CEO, commented, “We are pleased with the progress we continue to make this fiscal year, as we were able to achieve recurring operating income in excess of $1.0 million for the third consecutive quarter, excluding the $0.7 million charge related to a court award in a trade secrets case, which we plan to appeal. Year-to-date bookings and backlog remain strong, while revenue grew slightly. Our elevated backlog levels mark a second quarter record for the Company.”\n“We remain well positioned this fiscal year with an increase of 54% in our year-to-date reported operating income, while we also generated strong operating cash flows of $4.0 million so far in fiscal 2018,” added Watza. “The strategic plan we put into place continues to drive strength in key customer demand metrics, as evidenced by the robust backlog this quarter. We are confident that a relentless focus in our core markets will continue to provide sustainable and profitable long-term growth opportunities as we continue to remove cost from our system and deliver more value to our customers.”\n“Finally, and most importantly, when I look at our development initiatives, we made several significant steps during the quarter,” continued Watza. “We launched our Helix®evo product line in October and delivered several systems with this product during our fiscal second quarter. The Helix®evo product is our most advanced 3D scanning sensor and we are very excited about its potential, based on customer feedback. In addition, we demonstrated our AccuSite™ product line at the Quality Show in Chicago with several customer deliveries expected during our current fiscal year. AccuSite™ is our next evolution in accurate measurement. Perceptron pioneered Absolute Accuracy for robotic measurement systems in 2005. Our AccuSite™ solution provides best-in-class system accuracy and eliminates the need to offset to a CMM. This capability dramatically increases the applications available in the marketplace.”\n“Looking ahead to our third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we expect revenue in the range of $18.0 million to $21.0 million, and affirm our previous guidance of mid-single digit growth in our top line results for the full year fiscal 2018. Our longer-term aspirations are for sustained high-single digit revenue growth and resulting double-digit earnings growth,” Watza concluded.\nHighlights of Operations\nINCOME STATEMENT KEY METRICS (in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Americas Sales $ 10.0 $ 9.1 $ 0.9 $ 18.0 $ 14.3 $ 3.7 Europe Sales 6.4 7.7 (1.3 ) 14.2 17.7 (3.5 ) Asia Sales 4.0 5.0 (1.0 ) 7.5 7.3 0.2 Total Sales $ 20.4 $ 21.8 $ (1.4 ) $ 39.7 $ 39.3 $ 0.4 Gross Profit $ 7.4 $ 9.4 $ (2.0 ) $ 15.1 $ 14.0 $ 1.1 Gross Profit as a percent of sales 36.3 % 43.1 % 38.0 % 35.6 % Operating Income $ 0.5 $ 3.3 $ (2.8 ) $ 2.0 $ 1.3 $ 0.7 Operating Income as a percent of sales 2.5 % 15.1 % 5.0 % 3.3 % Net Income $ 0.4 $ 2.5 $ (2.1 ) $ 1.9 $ 0.1 $ 1.8 Diluted Income per Share $ 0.04 $ 0.27 $ (0.23 ) $ 0.20 $ 0.02 $ 0.18 Recurring Operating Income $ 1.1 $ 3.4 $ (2.3 ) $ 2.6 $ 2.1 $ 0.5 Recurring Operating Income as a percent of sales 5.4 % 15.6 % 6.5 % 5.3 % Total sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $1.4 million, or 6.4%, versus the same quarter in the prior year, reflecting decreases in Europe and Asia regions. The Europe region was down due to decreases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions, partially offset by small increases in Off-Line Measurement Solutions and Value-Added Services. The decline in the Asia region was primarily due to decreases in the In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions as well as the 3D Scanning Solutions, partially offset by an increase in sales of Off-Line Measurement Solutions. The year-over-year improvement in the Americas region was primarily due to increases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions and Value-Added Services, partially offset by decreased sales of 3D Scanning Solutions.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, gross profit as a percentage of sales declined by 680 basis points compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the lower volume of sales, the mix of the Company’s revenue, the timing of certain expenses in cost of goods sold under applicable accounting rules and higher warranty costs.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, our SG&A, Engineering and R&D expenses were up $0.3 million, primarily as a result of strategic investments in several engineering, research and development initiatives as well as increased legal and audit fees and an increase in Board of Director fees, partially offset by lower bad debt expense.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Six Months Ended December 31, BOOKINGS (in millions) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Geographic Region Americas $ 6.9 $ 8.5 $ (1.6 ) $ 16.5 $ 19.3 $ (2.8 ) Europe 8.0 8.6 (0.6 ) 17.4 14.8 2.6 Asia 5.1 3.8 1.3 9.3 8.6 0.7 Total Bookings $ 20.0 $ 20.9 $ (0.9 ) $ 43.2 $ 42.7 $ 0.5\nBACKLOG (in millions) 12/31/2017 9/30/2017 6/30/2017 3/31/2017 12/31/2016 Geographic Region Americas $ 18.0 $ 21.1 $ 19.5 $ 20.9 $ 15.6 Europe 19.6 18.0 16.4 16.7 16.2 Asia 10.9 9.8 9.1 11.0 9.9 Total Backlog $ 48.5 $ 48.9 $ 45.0 $ 48.6 $ 41.7 Second quarter bookings were $20.0 million. The decrease in booking activity is primarily due to decreases in 3D Scanning Solutions and Value Added Services, partially offset by increases in Off-Line Measurement Solutions and In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions. The significant booking activity in Asia was driven by increases in In-Line and Near-Line Measurement Solutions and Off-Line Measurement Solutions, partially offset by a decrease in 3D Scanning Solutions.\nRevenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 exceeded bookings by $0.4 million, which resulted in a decrease in backlog to $48.5 million at December 31, 2017. This is the highest backlog level for a second quarter in the Company’s history. As the levels of bookings and backlog typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter, management does not necessarily consider these metrics to be indicative of the future operating performance of the Company.\nFINANCIAL POSITION\nCash and short-term investment balance was $ 9.0 million at December 31, 2017, up from $8.1 million at September 30, 2017 and up from $6.3 million at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, bank debt outstanding totaled $1.6 million, up from an outstanding balance of $0.4 million at September 30, 2017 and up from $1.4 million at December 31, 2016.\nQuarterly Investor Call and Webcast\nPerceptron, Inc., will hold its second quarter fiscal year 2018 investor conference call/webcast, chaired by David L.

These are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting our performance. However, it should be viewed as supplemental data, rather than as a substitute or an alternative to the comparable GAAP measure.
