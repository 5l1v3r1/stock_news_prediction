(NASDAQ:WMGI) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and provided 2018 annual guidance. Unless otherwise noted, all net sales growth rates in this release are stated on a constant currency basis, which includes the benefit of the extra four business selling days in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNet sales from continuing operations totaled $217.6 million during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, representing 12.7% as reported and 11.2% constant currency growth, including the benefit from the extra four business selling days, which the company estimates to be approximately 4.5%. Gross margins from continuing operations were 78.3% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and were 78.8% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in the attached financial tables.\nRobert Palmisano, president and chief executive officer, commented, “As previously reported, our fourth quarter results represent an outstanding performance in our U.S. upper extremities business, which grew 29% including the benefit of the extra four business selling days. This performance was driven by the launch of our PERFORM Reversed glenoid and continued contribution from our SIMPLICITI shoulder system. We anticipate that our ongoing PERFORM Reversed launch and accelerating adoption of the recently acquired BLUEPRINT enabling technology will continue to drive strong shoulder sales growth in 2018.”\nPalmisano further commented, “As anticipated, we did not see any benefit in the fourth quarter in our U.S. lower extremities business from the sales force expansion. Additionally, we had some supply constraints primarily related to a third-party coating vendor in the fourth quarter, which we believe have been addressed. However, this affected our total ankle business during the fourth quarter. As previously discussed, we will continue to focus on improving our execution and building our physician relationships to restore growth in our core U.S. lower extremities business and expect to see improvement in 2018 as our larger sales footprint, new products, new reps and expanding relationships begin to take effect.”\nNet income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $26.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share.\nThe company’s net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $16.0 million tax benefit related to the realizability of net operating losses, a $9.8 million benefit from incentive and indirect tax projects, an $8.3 million tax benefit related to tax law reform in the U.S. and France, an unrealized gain of $1.4 million related to mark-to-market adjustments on contingent value rights (CVRs) issued in connection with the BioMimetic acquisition, an unrealized gain of $0.6 million related to mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives, non-cash interest expense of $11.7 million related to its convertible notes, and $2.9 million of transaction and transition costs.\nThe company's fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, as adjusted for the above items, was $3.5 million. The company's fourth quarter 2017 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as defined in the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, was $38.0 million. The attached financial tables include reconciliations of all historical non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $167.7 million as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. None of the cash was considered restricted at the end of fourth quarter of 2017.\nPalmisano concluded, “I believe we are positioned well for future success in both our upper and lower extremities businesses. We have focused sales organizations, highly differentiated products and robust future product development pipelines. Our 2018 guidance assumes improving underlying constant currency growth, driven by successfully executing our new product launches, including the PERFORM Reversed glenoid and minimally-invasive lower extremity procedure instruments, and improving the productivity of the U.S. lower extremities sales force. I believe that we are set up well for double-digit net sales growth and significant margin expansion in 2018 and beyond.”\nOutlook\nThe company anticipates net sales for full-year 2018 of approximately $800 million to $812 million. This guidance range has approximately 1% cushion from foreign currency exchange rates as compared to current rates. In addition, this range implies full-year 2018 constant currency net sales growth of 9% to 11%, excluding the estimated $9 million impact of the four fewer selling days in fourth quarter of 2018.\nThe company anticipates full-year 2018 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, as described in the non-GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, to be in the range of $104 million to $111 million.\nThe company expects its non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, including share-based compensation, as described in the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation provided later in this release, for full-year 2018 to be a loss of $0.16 to $0.23 per diluted share.\nThe company estimates approximately 106.9 million diluted weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for fiscal year 2018.\nThe company's non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations target is measured by adding back to net loss from continuing operations charges for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses, non-cash share-based compensation expense and non-operating income and expense. Additionally, the company’s adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations target excludes possible future acquisitions; other material future business developments; and due diligence, transaction and transition costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures.\nThe company’s non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations target is measured by adding back to net loss from continuing operations non-cash interest expense associated with the convertible notes; due diligence, transaction and transition costs associated with acquisitions and divestitures; mark-to-market adjustments to CVRs; non-cash mark-to-market derivative adjustments; and charges for non-cash amortization expenses, net of taxes. Note that as a result of the company’s relatively low effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance impacting a substantial portion of the company’s income/loss, the company is currently estimating the tax effect on amortization expense at 0%. Further, this adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations target excludes possible future acquisitions; other material future business developments; and gains and losses related to currency fluctuations on our intercompany receivable and payable balances that are denominated in foreign currencies.\nAll of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With respect to the company’s 2018 financial guidance regarding non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, however, the company cannot provide a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures without unreasonable effort due to its inability to make accurate projections and estimates related to certain information needed to calculate some of the adjustments as described above, including the foreign currency fluctuations and market driven fair value adjustments to CVRs and derivatives. The anticipated differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most directly comparable GAAP measure are described above qualitatively.\nThe company's anticipated ranges for net sales from continuing operations, non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations are , as are any other statements that anticipate or aspire to future events or performance. They are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from the anticipated targets. The anticipated targets are not predictions of the company's actual performance.

All other trademarks and trade names referred to in this release are the property of their respective owners.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release. Reconciliations of the historical non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in tables later in this release. Wright’s non-GAAP financial measures include net sales, excluding the impact of foreign currency; net income, as adjusted; EBITDA, as adjusted; gross margin, as adjusted; earnings, as adjusted; and earnings, as adjusted, per diluted share, in each case, from continuing operations. The company's management believes that the presentation of these measures provides useful information to investors. These measures may assist investors in evaluating the company's operations, period over period. Wright’s non-GAAP financial measures exclude such items as tax impacts from changes in the realizability of net operating losses, impacts from incentive and indirect tax projects, impacts from tax law reform, non-cash interest expense related to the company's convertible notes, transaction and transition costs, net gains and losses on mark-to-market adjustments on CVRs and derivative assets and liabilities, all of which may be highly variable, difficult to predict and of a size that could have substantial impact on the company's reported results of operations for a period. It is for this reason that the company cannot provide without unreasonable effort a quantitative reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for its 2018 financial guidance regarding non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations. Management uses the non-GAAP measures in this release internally for evaluation of the performance of the business, including the allocation of resources and the evaluation of results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only as a supplement to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis release includes under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
