REUTERS/Jonathan Drake Graham preached Christianity to more people than anyone else in history during his 70-year career, reaching hundreds of millions of people either in person or via TV and satellite links, his ministry said.\nGraham became the de facto White House chaplain to several U.S. presidents, most famously Richard Nixon. He also met with scores of world leaders and was the first noted evangelist to take his message behind the so-called Iron Curtain, the term used for the communist bloc countries of East Europe and the Soviet Union in the decades after World War II.\nSlideshow (5 Images) The U.S. Capitol tribute will follow Graham’s remains lying in repose at the family house, which is at the Billy Graham Library in Charlotte, his organization said.\nHis funeral is planned for March 2 at a venue that holds about 2,300 people in front of the library. He will be buried on library premises next to his wife, Ruth, who died in 2007.\nGraham will be only the fourth person to lie in honor at the Rotunda since the tribute began in 1998 for two U.S. Capitol Police officers slain in the line of duty. Civil rights figure Rosa Parks was the last person to receive the honor following her death in 2005.\nLying in honor at the Capitol is granted for private citizens. It is distinct from lying in state, a tribute normally reserved for elected U.S. officials or military figures.\nEditing by Cynthia Osterman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T20:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T20:45:22.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
