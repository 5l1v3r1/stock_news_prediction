Germany’s digital bank N26, which has expanded across Europe, declined to disclose details on its financials.\nUnlike its rivals, Revolut offers paid-for premium and business accounts, that have proven lucrative for the start-up.\nIt is also the only British digital bank to operate across Europe so far. Strong growth in countries like France, Germany and Switzerland and the Nordic region helped drive its user base up by 50 percent in the last two months. Expansion plans are also underway in India, Brazil, South Africa and the UAE.\nRevolut is in the process of securing a banking license in Lithuania, which it then plans to passport elsewhere in Europe.\nIt already offers device and travel insurance through its marketplace, two of the new products that helped grow users and the firm’s monthly transaction volume to $1.5 billion - a 700 percent increase in the past 12 months.\nAnother was the ability to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies within the Revolut app.\nStoronsky said there had been strong demand for this from customers since the capability launched, although this fell back a bit when the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies dropped.\nReporting by Emma Rumney, Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T03:33:07.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
