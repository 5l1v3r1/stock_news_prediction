New Fed Chair Jerome Powell took up his post on Monday while four of the seven board seats, including the No. 2 position, are currently unfilled.\nPolicymakers have forecast three U.S. interest rate hikes this year as the Fed continues to steer the economy away from the \"easy money\" era. Investors widely expect the central bank to lift U.S. borrowing costs at the next policy meeting in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T21:17:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
