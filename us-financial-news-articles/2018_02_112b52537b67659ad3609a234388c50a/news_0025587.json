That separate charge has not been made against the operating arm. \nBarclays faces other legal issues ahead, with regulators weighing up how to respond to attempts by Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley to unmask a whistleblower. \nAnalysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said that while it was unhelpful for Barclays that the SFO has added charges, it should not change the dynamics of the case materially. \n“However, it is negative that the group hasn’t been able to settle a number of outstanding litigation issues, with outstanding litigation representing an unhelpful distraction to the management of the core franchise,” the financial services firm said in a note to clients. \nBarclays shares were up 0.3 percent to 193.4 pence by 1609 GMT, helped by a broader market rebound and UBS raising its price target for the stock to 225 pence from 220 pence.
