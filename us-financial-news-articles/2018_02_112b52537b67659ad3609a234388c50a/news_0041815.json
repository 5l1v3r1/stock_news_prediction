Asking for a friend.\" \nGates, who built his career on strong mathematical skills, said he wishes he'd known that intelligence isn't one-size-fits-all: \"I was so naive about different skill sets. I thought if somebody had a high IQ, they could be good at everything. The idea that you needed to blend these different types of skills together, that always continued to surprise me.\" \nThe self-made billionaire learned that there are different types of intelligence, and the key to success is to find yours . \n\"Intelligence takes many different forms,\" he tweeted in 2017. \"It is not one-dimensional. And not as important as I used to think.\" \nIn the 1980s, psychologist Howard Gardener identified nine types of intelligence. Funders and Founders designer Mark Vital highlighted what each type of intelligence can offer in this infographic . Spatial: Visualizing the world in 3D Naturalist: Understanding living things and reading nature Musical: Discerning sounds, their pitch, tone, rhythm and timbre Logical-Mathematical: Quantifying things, making hypotheses and proving them Existential: Tackling the questions of why we live and why we die Interpersonal: Sensing people's feelings and motives Bodily-Kinesthetic: Coordinating your mind with your body Linguistic: Finding the right words to express what you mean Intra-personal: Understanding yourself, what you feel and what you want \nBy figuring out and embracing your type of intelligence, you can stop comparing yourself to others and find your best work environment. Plus, you'll be more aware of the skills you may need to develop. \nAs for Melinda's answer to Zuckerberg's question, she said she would tell her younger self, \"Trust yourself. You probably know more than you think you do.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T18:18:16.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
