U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned in September after an uproar over his use of costly private charter planes for government business.\nReporting by Mohammad Zargham\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-17T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T03:37:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
