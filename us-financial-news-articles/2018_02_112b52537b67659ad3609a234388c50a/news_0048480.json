Personally, I am very excited to deliver to the Company’s shareholders the commitment of these talented finance professionals and the organization they represent.”\nOur new CEO, Mr. Wang stated that: “It is an honor that CMFH is asking me to succeed Bing Lin and become the CEO and director of the Company. I do so based on the belief that the commitment of CMIG and that of its affiliates to the success of CM Seven Star is significant. I’d like to commend Mr. Bing Lin’s success in launching CM Seven Star. However, I am confident that my more than 25 years of experience in professional investment management with some of the top firms in the financial services industry will be most applicable in this next phase of CM Seven Star’s development.”\nOur new Chairman of the Board, Mr. Ho, further added: “CMIG would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Bing Lin for his tremendous efforts and success in launching CMIG’s first SPAC, and in fact our group’s first public offering in the US capital markets. We appreciate that Mr Lin will continue in his role as a director of CM Seven Star, and his support that he will continue to provide in this role. \"\nMr. Sing Wang, our new CEO added further: “We are committed to finding attractive merger targets for CM Seven Star with the single purpose of creating shareholder value regardless of the source and type of assets. We will be open to additional management changes in the future, to strengthen our team to address any needs of the SPAC.”\nThe Company\nThe Company is a blank check company for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
