Maduro, 55, whose main rivals are barred from standing against him, presented his candidacy at the national election board in Caracas before joining a rally of supporters. “I will be loyal to the legacy of the giant Hugo Chavez!” he said, dancing reggaeton on stage with his wife Cilia Flores in front of a large banner showing his and Chavez’s faces. Maduro narrowly won election after Chavez’s 2013 death from cancer, but has seen his popularity plunge during a punishing economic crisis for OPEC member Venezuela that has exposed the failure of government policies and worsened by the fall in global oil prices. Maduro blames a U.S.-led “economic war”, including sanctions imposed last year by President Donald Trump, for the unprecedented recession that has left millions hungry, created widespread shortages and fueled a migration exodus. Critics say incompetent policies, such as dysfunctional currency controls, and rampant graft are behind the crisis.

REUTERS/Marco Bello Venezuela’s opposition coalition is boycotting the April 22 vote, given its two most popular leaders - Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles - are prohibited from running, various parties have been outlawed, and the election board is pro-Maduro. “Elections in these conditions will not solve anything,” the coalition said in a statement on Tuesday.

The most significant figure to have expressed an interest in running against Maduro is a former state governor, Henri Falcon, but by breaking with the opposition coalition to do that, he would find it tough to mount a serious challenge. In his speech, Maduro called for the blessing of Jesus Christ, Chavez and Venezuelan independence hero Simon Bolivar for his re-election campaign. “I am the people’s president, the oligarchy have under-estimated me,” said Maduro, a former bus driver and union activist.
