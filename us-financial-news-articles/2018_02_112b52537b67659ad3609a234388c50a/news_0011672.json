They’re both very good levels. \n“It gives them the opportunity to grow as players and so far we are trying different players there and all the experiences have been very positive and that’s the most important thing.” ASIAN CUP \nSanchez is hoping the experience will begin to pay off when he leads the senior team to the finals of the 2019 Asian Cup in the United Arab Emirates as the final drive towards the 2022 World Cup commences. \n”We have to push the players to get better and better,“ he said. ”In one year there is the Asian Cup in the Emirates, in 2019, and this is another good test to see our players, not the youth but the national team. \n”We hope the players are going to keep working hard and this will be a big motivation for them to continue their work. \n“To play a good Asian Cup, and also if we can qualify for the Olympic Games, this will be very good for the players, to get the experience and to get the confidence that we can compete against all of the top national teams.” Editing by Sudipto Ganguly", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T11:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T11:20:50.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
