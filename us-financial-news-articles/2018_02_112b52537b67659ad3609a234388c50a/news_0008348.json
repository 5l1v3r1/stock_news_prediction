Tonight, there are no winners or losers, there is (only) a Cyprus for all of us.” \nAnastasiades, 71, steered the Cypriot economy to recovery after it was plunged into crisis in 2013, days after he was first elected, by its exposure to debt-racked Greece and by fiscal slippage under a previous left-wing administration. \nCyprus emerged from a bailout programme from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund in 2016. Unlike other austerity programmes, the Cyprus model put most of the painful measures up front, including recapitalising banks by seizing uninsured deposits, a so-called ‘bail-in’ - used in the euro zone for the first time. \nMalas, a geneticist who served as health minister in the former leftist administration, had also come second to Anastasiades in 2013.

REUTERS/Stefanos Kouratzis \nPolitical analyst Hubert Faustmann said Anastasiades had entered the race as favourite in a field of relatively uninspiring candidates, adding: “He handled the economic crisis very well, he got a lot of credit for that.” \nAs leader of the island’s Greek Cypriot community, Anastasiades oversaw peace talks with the breakaway Turkish-Cypriot controlled north.

It’s apparently the second which prevailed,” Faustmann said.
