His background also includes positions at other community and academic health care systems.\n“It’s an exciting honor to be named CFO of one of the nation’s leading health care systems,” said Rieber. “UCHealth has grown significantly over the past several years, and we now deliver advanced care, close to home for 1.4 million patients. We will continue to focus on providing high-value care with the very best outcomes for patients throughout the Rocky Mountain region.”\nIn addition to overseeing finances for the $3.5 billion organization, Rieber will work closely with UCHealth’s leadership and innovation teams to help design the future of health care. Already, many of UCHealth’s innovation initiatives are being used to help make care easier for patients and to improve the overall efficiency, quality and safety of medical care.\n“Health care delivery is in a period of rapid disruption which, when harnessed creatively, can improve our patients’ experiences, increase quality and lower the overall costs of care,” said Concordia. “UCHealth is already partnering with a dozen innovative companies, and Dan will continue to advance our investment in this area.”\nRieber earned a Masters of Business Administration from Regis University, a Bachelors of Business Administration from Iowa State University, and he is a certified public accountant.\nAs a nonprofit health system, UCHealth is dedicated to the communities it serves.
