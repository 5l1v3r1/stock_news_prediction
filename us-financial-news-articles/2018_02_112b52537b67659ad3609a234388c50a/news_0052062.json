Over 60 percent of Venezuelans said that during the previous three months they had woken up hungry because they did not have enough money to buy food, according to a university study.\n“Colombians or Venezuelans who wants to enter or leave our country present the document and a technological system authorizes or denies the next step,” Kruger said via telephone from the frontier city of Cucuta.\n“What we want with these doors is to continue improving our process of immigration control.”\nTwo weeks ago, Colombia’s President Juan Manuel Santos announced tougher migratory controls along the 2,219 km (1,379-mile) border, temporarily suspending the issuance of new daily entry cards for Venezuelans and deploying 3,000 new security personnel.\nEntry at all migration checkpoints fell from an average of 48,000 per day to 35,000 per day, the agency said.\nKruger said armed forces had stepped up control on illegal crossings and destroyed several entry points used to enter the country for migration and smuggling.\n“We don’t want to impede the migratory flow, but we want it done in an orderly manner,” he said.\nReporting by Luis Jaime Acosta; Writing by Helen Murphy; Editing by Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T13:23:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
