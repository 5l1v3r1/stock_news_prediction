Analysts had expected a dividend of 42.5 crowns, according to the median forecast in a Reuters poll.\nThe bank said it intended to pay out 65 percent of its 2018 recurring net profit, a higher portion than for 2017 but still below payouts of recent years as banks face higher capital requirements imposed by the central bank to get ahead of a lending boom.\nWith a growing economy and unemployment the lowest in two decades, banks have seen strong lending growth in recent years. The central bank started raising interest rates last August, delivering three rate hikes so far.\nHowever, Komercni Banka lagged the lending market last year, with its gross loans rising by 1.8 percent, as more companies seek funding in euros rather than crowns following the central bank’s currency cap regime that ran from 2013 to 2017. The bank has been cautious of this trend.\nNet banking income rose 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter to 7.93 billion crowns, helped by a 5 percent rise in net interest income.\nProfit in the quarter was also helped by the release of loan provisions. The bank, though, said its current low level in cost of risk, reflecting provisioning against losses from loans and investments, was not sustainable.
