It expects women’s wealth to grow 7 percent a year, which Gifford put down to the rise of female entrepreneurs.\nUBS says it has responded to the demand for impact investing by giving investors options to address social issues, such as helping military veterans find employment.\nThat fund tracks the price of U.S. companies actively encouraging the employment of veterans, who suffer more unemployment than civilians, according to the Labor Department.\nUBS clients also invested $325 million in the Rise Fund, which counts Irish rock star Bono among its co-founders and aims to achieve “measurable, positive social and environmental outcomes alongside competitive financial returns.”\nInvestments are changing partly because the economy is more transparent, said Gifford.\nHe cited photos showing clothing labels in the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza factory, which killed 1,100 workers in Bangladesh in 2013, as an example.\nThe pictures showed that Western brands had people in their supply chain working in unsafe conditions, raising awareness about corporate responsibility.\n“There is nowhere to hide for unethical companies. The lowest income people in the world now have smartphones and they are one or two clicks away from a journalist,” said Gifford.\nThe amount of money going into impact investing increased by 18 percent annually between 2013 and 2015, according to the Global Impact Investing Network, which monitors market activity.\nReporting by Lee Mannion; editing by Lyndsay Griffiths. @leemannion; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.
