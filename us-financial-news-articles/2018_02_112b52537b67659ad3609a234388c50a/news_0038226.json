He said the charges underscore the importance of protecting the integrity of future elections. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, pledged to press social media companies “to be far more aggressive and proactive in responding to this threat.” (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; editing by Grant McCool)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T22:23:29.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
