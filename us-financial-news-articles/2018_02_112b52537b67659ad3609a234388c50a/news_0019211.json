The company already has agreements in place with Chinese distribution partners, he said.\nCalls to China’s General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine went unanswered after office hours.\nDanish Crown already sells large volumes of fresh pork China, which accounts for about 5 percent of its sales. China bought around 217,000 tonnes of meat from the company in its 2016/17 financial year, worth about 403 million euros.\nThe company is aiming to capture growing Chinese demand for higher-value processed meat, however, and is due to open a new factory near Shanghai next year.\nDanish Crown recently partnered with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group to encourage consumers to order more costly cuts of pork online.\n$1 = 6.0013 Danish crowns Reporting by Dominique Patton; Editing by Tom Hogue\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T22:00:07.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
