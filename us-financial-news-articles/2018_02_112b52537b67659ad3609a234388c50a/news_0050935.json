(NYSE:EVTC) (“EVERTEC” or the “Company”) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nRevenue decreased 2% to $99.6 million GAAP Net Income attributable to common shareholders was $5.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA decreased 22% to $37.0 million Adjusted earnings per common share was $0.24, or a 44% decline\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRevenue grew 5% to $407.1 million GAAP Net Income attributable to common shareholders was $55.1 million, or $0.76 per diluted share Adjusted EBITDA decreased 5% to $178.0 million Adjusted earnings per common share was $1.47, or a 12% decline $29 million returned to shareholders in share repurchases and dividends\nMac Schuessler, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated “We executed well in the fourth quarter and exceeded the high end of our full year 2017 revenue guidance range, as fourth quarter transaction volume was stronger than previously expected in Puerto Rico. Reflecting on 2017, we made significant progress on our core growth initiatives, including advancing our Latin American expansion strategy through acquisitions and recent customer wins.”\nSchuessler continued, \"Looking to 2018, while the post-hurricane economy in Puerto Rico has improved, many uncertainties still remain and are reflected in our 2018 financial outlook. We will continue to work to restore our customers' operations in Puerto Rico and remain committed to supporting our community as the Island rebuilds. At the same time, we are focused on capitalizing on our expanded opportunities in Latin America.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue. Total revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $99.6 million, a decrease of 2% compared with $101.9 million in the prior year. The decrease in the quarter was driven primarily by the impact of reduced volumes caused by the significant hurricanes in the third quarter of 2017 partially offset by the acquisition of PayGroup.\nNet Income attributable to common shareholders. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, GAAP Net Income attributable to common shareholders was $5.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared with $16.0 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year. The decline was primarily caused by the impact of the hurricanes.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $37.0 million, a decrease of 22% compared to the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by reduced high margin revenues due to the hurricanes and a $5.0 million impairment charge on a multi-year software development project that was impacted by delays caused by the hurricane and projected increased costs with a third party vendor.\nAdjusted Net Income. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income was $17.7 million, a decrease of 43% compared with $31.3 million in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per common share was $0.24, a decrease of 44% compared with $0.43 in the prior year. The results included the impact of an increased tax rate in our Latin American region and a higher than anticipated proportion of Puerto Rico taxable income outside our preferential tax decree.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nRevenue. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $407.1 million, an increase of 5% compared with $389.5 million in the prior year. The increase in revenues was driven by increases in ATH debit network transaction volumes and card processing volumes, revenue generated from the PayGroup acquisition, increased revenue from the Accuprint acquisition and an increase in core banking revenue. Revenues in 2017 were negatively impacted by the two hurricanes that made landfall in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in September of 2017.\nNet Income attributable to common shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2017, GAAP Net Income attributable to common shareholders was $55.1 million , or $0.76 per diluted share, compared with $75.0 million or $1.01 per diluted share in the prior year. The decline was caused by the impact of the hurricanes, charges taken in connection with an exit activity for a third party software solution that is no longer commercially viable, an impairment loss related to a software asset under development, expenses attributable to the PayGroup acquisition, increased depreciation expense, and higher interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $178.0 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by reduced high margin revenues due to the hurricanes and an impairment loss related to a software asset under development.\nAdjusted Net Income. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Adjusted Net Income was $107.1 million, a decrease of 14% compared with $124.7 million in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per common share was $1.47, a decrease of 12% compared with $1.67 in the prior year. The decline was primarily caused by the impact of the hurricanes, increased depreciation, higher interest expense and an increased tax rate.\nSegment Reporting Change\nThe Company realigned its operating segments in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.

For more information, visit www.evertecinc.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThe non-GAAP measures referenced in this release material are supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). They are not measurements of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to total revenue, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as indicators of operating performance or as measures of the Company’s liquidity. In addition to GAAP measures, management uses these non-GAAP measures to focus on the factors the Company believes are pertinent to the daily management of the Company’s operations and believes that they are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the industry. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the schedules to this release. These non-GAAP measures include EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share and are defined below.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, Adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as net income adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments\nAdjusted Earnings per common share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted shares outstanding\nIn addition, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is substantially consistent with the equivalent measurements that are contained in the senior secured credit facilities in testing EVERTEC Group’s compliance with covenants therein such as the senior secured leverage ratio. We use Adjusted Net Income to measure our overall profitability because we believe better reflects our comparable operating performance by excluding the impact of the non-cash amortization and depreciation that was created as a result of Apollo Global Management LLC’s acquisition of a 51% indirect ownership in EVERTEC Group. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per common share, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses such as those excluded in calculating them. Further, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future operating results will not be affected by unusual or nonrecurring items.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of, and subject to the protection of, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of EVERTEC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Any statements that refer to expectations or other characterizations of future events, circumstances or results are forward-looking statements.\nVarious factors that could cause actual future results and other future events to estimated by management include, but are not limited to: the Company’s reliance on its relationship with Popular for a significant portion of revenue; our ability to renew our client contracts on terms favorable to us; the effectiveness of our risk management procedures; our dependence on our processing systems, technology infrastructure, security systems and fraudulent-payment-detection systems, and the risk that our systems may experience breakdowns or fail to prevent security breaches or fraudulent transfers; our ability to develop, install and adopt new technology; a decreased client base due to consolidations in the banking and financial-services industry; the credit risk of our merchant clients, for which we may also be liable; the continuing market position of the ATH® network; reduction in consumer confidence leading to decreased consumer spending; the Company’s dependence on credit card associations; regulatory limitations on our activities, including the potential need to seek regulatory approval to consummate transactions, due to our relationship with Popular and our role as a service provider to financial institutions; changes in the regulatory environment and changes in international, legal, tax, political, administrative or economic conditions; the geographical concentration of the Company’s business in Puerto Rico; operating an international business in multiple regions with potential political and economic instability; increased compliance risks associated with operating an international business; operating in countries and counterparties that put us at risk of violating U.S. sanctions laws; our ability to execute our expansion and acquisition strategies; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel; our ability to comply with federal, state, and local regulatory requirements; evolving industry standards; the Company’s high level of indebtedness and restrictions contained in the Company’s debt agreements; and the Company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to service the Company’s indebtedness and to generate future profits.\nConsideration should be given to the areas of risk described above, as well as those risks set forth under the headings “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” in the reports the Company files with the SEC from time to time, in connection with considering any forward-looking statements that may be made by the Company and its businesses generally.
