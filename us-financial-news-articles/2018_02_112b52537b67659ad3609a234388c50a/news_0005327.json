The SAFE-BioPharma® digital identity and signature standards were crafted to mitigate risk associated with electronic transactions by protecting intellectual property and patient data using secure, enforceable, and regulatory compliant mechanisms. A single SAFE-BioPharma-certified credential can be used and trusted within multiple platforms across the healthcare sector and is recognized by all U.S. Government agencies and the European Union.\n\"Weak identity trust – hijacked user names and passwords – is the major cause of health care breaches. Identity credentials that comply with SAFE-BioPharma standards require use of two-factor authentication, which proves with greater certainty the user's actual identity,\" explained Terrence Rice, Chairman, SAFE-BioPharma Association and VP, IT Risk Management and CISO, Merck & Co.\n“With the retirement of Mollie Shields-Uehling, SAFE-BioPharma’s President and CEO and the strength of NH-ISAC’s diverse, global membership and initiatives already underway in the identity and access management (IAM) space, merging the efforts of the two organizations made complete sense,” says NH-ISAC’s President, Denise Anderson. “We aim to broaden the reach of IAM across the healthcare community so that the entire sector will benefit.”\nSAFE-BioPharma Identity and Access Management services will be available to NH-ISAC members through NH-ISAC’s CYBERFIT® suite of services.\nFor more information on NH-ISAC and its services, visit https://nhisac.org/ .\nABOUT NH-ISAC – National Health Information Sharing and Analysis Center ,\n(NH-ISAC), is a global, non-profit, member-driven organization offering healthcare stakeholders a trusted community and forum for coordinating, collaborating and sharing vital Physical and Cyber Threat Intelligence and best practices with each other.
