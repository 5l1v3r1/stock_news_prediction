Most recently CFO of Bazaarvoice, Jim has significant experience in CEO, COO, CFO and board of director positions for high-growth technology companies. Jim will join a distinguished group of CognitiveScale advisory board members, including the former senior vice president and chief technology and innovation officer at USAA, Rickey Burks; retired senior vice president of IBM Cloud, Robert LeBlanc; and Kony chairman and CEO, Tom Hogan.\nWith more than 25 years of experience and significant expertise in working with both public and private companies, Offerdahl is known for his ability to grow revenue and profits both domestically and internationally.
