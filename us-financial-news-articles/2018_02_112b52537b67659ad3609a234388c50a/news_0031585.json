President Donald Trump has had an adversarial relationship with CNN — a Time Warner-owned network — during his entire presidency.\nThe Justice Department sued to block the multi-billion-dollar deal in late November . The government believes the deal would harm competition and raise prices for consumers. The department also denies allegations that it is blocking the deal as punishment for CNN's news coverage. \nAT&T, meanwhile, notes its deal with Time Warner is a so-called vertical merger, meaning it would combine the two companies are on the same supply chain, in this case content (Time Warner) and media distribution (AT&T). AT&T also notes that a vertical merger has not been blocked in about 50 years.\nThe trial is scheduled to start on March 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T14:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T14:52:20.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
