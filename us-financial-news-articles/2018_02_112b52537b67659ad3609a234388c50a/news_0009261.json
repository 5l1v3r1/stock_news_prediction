It didn’t work out. Let’s move on,'” he said, adding that he expected consolidation to take some time. \nKelly said he expected pressure on the newer lessors as interest rates begin to creep up. \nLeasing is a major part of the aircraft market with 40 percent of jet deliveries going to companies that rent them to airlines, rather than directly to airlines themselves.Kelly said the cost of funding was an important part of the leasing business but “what’s far more relevant is are you able to move the airplanes, do you know which airplanes to buy, do you know how much to pay for them, do you know the value of an airplane?” he said. \nAt the annual aircraft industry’s gathering in Dublin last month, global air finance titans pondered whether the boom will ever end.
