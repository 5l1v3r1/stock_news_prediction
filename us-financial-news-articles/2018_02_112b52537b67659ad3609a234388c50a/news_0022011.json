On Friday it scored its best performance since Oct. 26.\nThe dollar has benefited as investors sold off riskier assets for the relative safety of the greenback. On Monday, the Dow and S&P 500 U.S. stock indexes posted their biggest declines since August 2011.\n“The U.S. dollar has seen a little bit of strength across most trading pairs,” said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana.\n“The longer-term impacts around the dollar will really be drawn from economic fundamentals and the path of monetary policy relative to other major trading partners, inflation, and not likely due to short-term market volatility.”\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 17.64 points, or 0.65 percent, to 2,712.78.\nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe last gained 0.76 percent.\nThe U.S. dollar had reached a high of 109.720 yen earlier as regional equities such as Japan’s Nikkei soared, taking their cue from a late rebound on Wall Street.\nBut it drifted lower as the Nikkei, which rose as much as 3.4 percent, gave back most of its gains on anxiety over more weakness in U.S. share markets as U.S. stock futures fell during Asian trade.\nAgainst the yen, the dollar was last down 0.26 percent to 109.27 yen.\nThe Swiss franc, a perceived safe haven along with the yen, was down more than half a percent against the dollar.\nEURO FALLS The euro slipped against the greenback on Wednesday, on disappointment over reports that the leader of Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD), Martin Schulz, would not be taking over as finance minister for Europe’s biggest economy.\n“There was speculation that Mr Schulz could be the next finance minister,” said DZ Bank currency strategist Soeren Hettler, in Frankfurt. “(In that scenario), Germany could be more flexible with regard to its financial situation and spend more money.”\nThe euro, which had been trading higher before the news, last fell 0.37 percent to $1.233.\nReporting by Stephanie Kelly; Additional reporting by Jemima Kelly in London; Editing by Andrew Hay\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T23:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-08T01:48:04.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
