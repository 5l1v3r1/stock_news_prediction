The club had long partnered with Adidas. \nEarlier this month, Puma agreed a partnership with Senegal’s soccer federation, bringing to three the number of teams it is sponsoring at this year’s World Cup, along with Switzerland and Uruguay, although its top side Italy failed to qualify. \nPuma reported quarterly earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) more than doubled to 30 million euros ($37.8 million) on sales that rose by a currency-adjusted 14.5 percent to 1.04 billion euros, broadly in line with average analyst forecasts. \nSales growth was particularly strong for its core footwear business, up a currency-adjusted 19 percent. Sales rose fastest in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, up 18.5 percent, followed by the Americas, up 14 percent. \nPuma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden said momentum that built in 2017, along with positive feedback from consumers and retail partners, made the firm positive for 2018, predicting a 10 percent rise in sales in constant currencies. \nPuma expects 2018 EBIT of between 305 million and 325 million, up from 245 million in 2017. \nGulden has said the spin-off from Kering would not affect Puma’s strategy but the firm said it would give more details on March 20 at a capital markets day in London. \n($1 = 0.8146 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T12:07:51.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
