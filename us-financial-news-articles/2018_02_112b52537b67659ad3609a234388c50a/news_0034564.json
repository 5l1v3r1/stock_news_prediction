Azubuike had three straight buckets during that surge, as the Jayhawks had little trouble throwing lobs to their big man or driving with their guards.\nEach of the Kansas starters scored in double figures, including senior guard Devonte’ Graham, who shot just 3-for-16 but scored 13 points and added team-highs with six rebounds and five assists in his ninth consecutive 40-minute performance.\nIowa State, which had won three straight Big 12 home games against ranked opponents, responded to the 13-point deficit by crawling within 81-77 on a drive by junior forward Zoran Talley Jr. with 21.6 seconds left. Talley missed a chance for a three-point play, and the Cyclones (13-12, 4-9) did not score again.\nGuard Lindell Wigginton, the conference’s second-leading freshman scorer (16.3 average) behind Oklahoma’s Trae Young, went just 3-for-12 and netted 12 points after scoring 27 in the first meeting against Kansas. Freshman forward Cameron Lard posted 19 points and 11 rebounds to pace Iowa State, which also placed five scorers in double figures.\nTally had 14 points for the Cyclones, Nick Weiler-Babb contributed 14 and Solomon Young scored 12.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:22:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
