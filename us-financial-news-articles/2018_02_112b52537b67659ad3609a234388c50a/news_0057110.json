REUTERS/Rafael Marchante The letter said pilots had noticed in recent weeks an increase in the number of requests to work on days off, something pilots say happened in the lead-up to the cancellations. \nAt the same time, the letter repeated an offer to help convince pilots to work extra hours and it described O‘Leary’s predictions of strike action in the coming weeks as “alarmist.” \nO‘Leary said last week that he believed strike action was likely during Easter week. \nThe airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognize pilots’ unions for the first time in its 32-year history. \nBut talks with pilot unions to formalize union recognition and improved terms have stalled in recent weeks. While Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement. \n“We suggest you leave now, and we call on the board and investors to engage a new CEO to return this airline to its rightful place,” the EERC letter said. \nRyanair said in a statement that the EERC and its communications had “no legal standing or validity.” \nIt said that 80 percent of Ryanair pilots had already accepted a 20 percent pay increase that the EERC has opposed on the grounds that accepting it could prejudice future talks between management and trade unions. \nReporting by Conor Humphries, editing by Louise Heavens\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T11:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T12:10:20.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
