(OTCBB:SRNN), the holding company for The Southern Bank Company announced a net loss of approximately $560,000, or ($0.72) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to a net loss of approximately $177,000, or ($0.23) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.

The increase in non-interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in miscellaneous income of approximately $7,000. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to increases in salaries and benefits of approximately $13,000, other operating expenses of approximately $41,000, offset in part by decreases in professional service expenses of approximately $1,000, data processing expenses of approximately $1,000, office building and equipment expenses of approximately $4,000.\nFor the six-months ended December 31, 2017, net interest income increased approximately $532,000 or 31.8%.

The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to decreases in salaries and benefits of approximately $26,000, occupancy expenses of approximately $9,000, professional fees of approximately $17,000, data processing fees of approximately $7,000 offset in part by an increase other operating expenses of approximately $13,000.\nThe Company’s total assets at December 31, 2017 were approximately $98.3 million, as compared to $96.5 million at June 30, 2017.
