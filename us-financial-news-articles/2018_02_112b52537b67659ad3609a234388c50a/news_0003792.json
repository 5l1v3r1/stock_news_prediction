Henry McMaster said at a news briefing. A coroner identified the deceased as the train’s engineer and its conductor. \n”It appears to me that the CSX was on the track that it was supposed to be on, and that appears to be a loading track or a switch track,” McMaster said. “It appears Amtrak was on the wrong track.” \nThe National Transportation Safety Board has launched an investigation of the crash. The Federal Railroad Administration’s investigative team is on site to assist, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Amtrak said CSX CSX, -2.35% owns and controls the track where the accident happened, and that CSX is responsible for maintenance of track and signals there as well as for the dispatching of all trains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-04T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-04T23:30:39.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
