Stadler said at the time that Audi would continue its work to address the scandal “until the job is done,” promising to make law and ethics its “ultimate benchmark”.\nAudi admitted in November 2015 that its 3.0 litre V6 diesel engines were fitted with an auxiliary control device deemed illegal in the United States that allowed vehicles to evade U.S. emissions limits.\nThe issue has come back into focus as German prosecutors said earlier this month they had searched Audi’s headquarters and one of its plants, widening their inquiry into the manipulation of diesel emissions tests.
