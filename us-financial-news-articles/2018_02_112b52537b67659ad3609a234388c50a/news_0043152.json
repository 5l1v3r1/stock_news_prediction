Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net OPENING SNAPSHOT: STOXX SET FOR FOURTH DAY OF GAINS (0843 GMT) A positive open in Europe has put the STOXX 600 benchmark index on course for a fourth straight session of gains, even though today's holiday closure on Wall Street could reduce activity. All major indexes in Europe were posting small gains, as banks rose and steel companies such as Tenaris and Outokumpu rallied after the U.S unveiled plans to impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries. Here's where we stand on European equity markets: (Danilo Masoni) WHAT WE'RE WATCHING BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0752 GMT) European shares are expected to open higher today and put the pan-regional STOXX 600 benchmark index on track for a fourth session of gains, as a strong rebound in global equities from a tumultuous start of the month continues. Futures were last up 0.2-0.6 percent. A return of fund inflows and big upwards revisions to earnings expectations last week has given fuel to the rebound in Europe but the STOXX 600 needs to gain another 6 percent to climb back to the 2-1/2-year peak hit at the end of January. Likely signalling intact confidence in equity markets is news this morning that Siemens plans to list a \"significant\" minority stake of its Healthineers division on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in the first half of 2018. Still in healthcare, AstraZeneca could find support after the FDA approved its immunotherapy drug Imfinzi for lung cancer. In earnings news, Reckitt Benckiser will be in focus after the household goods company posted a 10 percent increase in fourth-quarter adjusted net income and forecast 13-14 percent revenue growth this year.
