Premiums for local North Sea grades are at multi-month lows.\nLogistical constraints in the United States have even caused prices for regional grades to diverge.\n\"Less crude oil is being transported from Canada to Cushing due to the restricted capacity of the Keystone pipeline. And for another, new pipeline capacities mean more crude oil is leaving Cushing,\" Commerzbank analysts said in a note.\n\"Light Louisiana Sweet, the reference type for comparable oil on the U.S. Gulf Coast, even costs only $2 more than WTI. It therefore makes hardly any sense for refineries on the Gulf Coast to buy WTI from Cushing indeed this would not be cost effective at all if the price gap narrowed any further.\"\nLouisiana light sweet crude <WTC-LLS> is trading at a premium of around $2 a barrel to WTI, down from nearly $5 a month ago.\nOverall, oil markets remain supported by supply restraint on the part of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started last year to draw down excess global inventories.\n\"OPEC and Russia continue to support the production cuts that are due to expire at the end of this year, and they assure markets that there will be an orderly ramp-up of production once the cuts expire,\" said William O'Loughlin, analyst at Rivkin Securities.\nSaudi Arabia - not least in an attempt to give the planned listing of its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco a boost - wants Russia and other producers to keep withholding supplies to prop up prices. But soaring U.S. production is threatening to erode those OPEC's efforts.\nLast week, the number of U.S. oil rigs drilling for new production rose for a fourth straight week to 798, an indication that U.S. crude output <C-OUT-T-EIA>, already at a record 10.27 million bpd, may rise further.
