More than 90 percent of Kosovo’s 1.8 million population is of Albanian descent.\n“Permanent and firm delimitation between Serbs and Albanians must be established in Kosovo,” Vulin told the round table of experts convened as part of a national dialogue on Kosovo.\nLater on Tuesday the European Commission is due to announce a Western Balkans strategy that will set 2025 as target date for Serbia and its small former federal partner Montenegro to join the EU.\nForeign Minister Ivica Dacic has previously suggested partition as a possible solution to the territorial dispute, but it is not government policy.\nUnder a 2013 EU-brokered deal Belgrade, Pristina agreed to give Serb enclaves in Kosovo more autonomy and grant protected status to Orthodox monasteries. Most Kosovo Albanians oppose these measures, fearing Serbia’s influence.\nBelgrade says Pristina has failed to abide by the agreement. Kosovo officials deny this.\nKosovo seceded from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after NATO bombing campaign ousted Serbian forces and ended the crackdown on ethnic Albanians during a two-year war.\nIt has been recognized by 115 countries, including 23 out of 28 EU members, but its UN membership is being blocked by Serbia’s allies Russia and China.\nReporting by Aleksandar Vasovic and Fatos Bytyci in Pristina; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T20:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T00:17:38.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
