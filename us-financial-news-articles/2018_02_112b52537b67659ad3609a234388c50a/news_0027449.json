The parties were still discussing a convenient date, he added.\nThe Games in South Korea are due to finish on Feb 25.\n“All the parties concerned have welcomed this invitation to North Korea...,” he said. “We are talking about this convenient date in order to continue the dialogue on the sports side. We will see when this is going to happen.”\nNorth and South Korean leaders swapped warm handshakes and smiles at Friday’s opening ceremony, enabling the IOC to present the Games as enablers of peace and take the media spotlight away from a Russian doping scandal that has plagued it for years.\nRussian athletes marched under the Olympic flag, and in neutral colors, at the ceremony, having been banned from competing formally for their country by the IOC. Many critics had called on the IOC to ban Russia outright.\nNorth Korea agreed to participate in Pyeongchang after the South and IOC encouraged the heavily sanctioned state to participate as a gesture of peace.\nAthletes from both sides, technically still at war, marched together at the opening ceremony and have fielded a unified women’s ice hockey team, the first time an inter-Korean team has competed at any Olympic Games.\nPyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics Ð Pyeongchang Main Press Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea Ð February 12, 2018 - Thomas Bach, the President of the International Olympic Committee, is pictured during a Reuters interview at the Main Press Centre (MPC).

REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger “For our side, for the sports side, this dialogue will continue..,” he said, adding that the IOC was in constant dialogue with North Korea’s national Olympic committee.\nThe IOC and the two Koreas signed a tripartite agreement on Jan. 20 in Lausanne that set out the details of North Korea’s Olympic participation, including the number of athletes, the sports they would take part in as well as their joint march.\nThe agreement was seen as a breakthrough given the Koreas had not marched together at an Olympics for more than 12 years.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in hosted two of North Korea’s most senior officials at the opening ceremony, including North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister. Moon warmly shook hands with her and later held talks with her in Seoul.\nKim Jong Un has invited Moon for talks in Pyongyang, South Korean officials said, setting the stage for the first meeting of Korean leaders in more than a decade.\nThe thaw in relations has centered on the Olympics, with a senior American member of the IOC calling for the joint ice hockey team, which included 12 North Korean players, to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.\nAdditional reporting by James Pearson; Editing by Mark Bendeich\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T09:44:03.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
