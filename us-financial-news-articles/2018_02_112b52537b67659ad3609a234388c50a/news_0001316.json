Earlier this week, AWE gave Mineral Resources till midnight Friday to match a A$594 million ($480 million) takeover offer from Mitsui & Co, or it would back the Japanese bid as a superior offer.\nAWE’s stock has risen more than 80 percent, since it received CERCG’s takeover bid in late November.\nReporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:32:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
