Two demonstrations will be held near Pyeongchang, while the team will travel to the capital Seoul for the remaining two.\nDuring their Seoul visit, home will be the five-star Grand Walkerhill for the North Koreans, which overlooks the Han River and previously hosted American celebrities like Michael Jackson and Paris Hilton.\nAs the art troupe arrived on Tuesday in a ferry, which will also be used as accommodation, they were greeted by angry protesters who held large photos of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with black crosses drawn through them.\nPyongyang’s state media lashed out at the rallies as a “never-to-be-condoned farce of confrontation with fellow countrymen”.\n“Those conservatives have staged such disgusting farces”, the official KCNA news agency said. “Not content with it, they put an affront on the mission that came to celebrate an event of the nation”.
