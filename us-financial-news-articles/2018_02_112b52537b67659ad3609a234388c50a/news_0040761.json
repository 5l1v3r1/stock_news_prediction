A further 468 suspects were discharged and 28 suspects were remanded for trial in Abuja or Minna.\nReporting by Camillus Eboh; Writing by Paul Carsten; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T15:08:01.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
