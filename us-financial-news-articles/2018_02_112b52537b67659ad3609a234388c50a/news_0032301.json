Certain capabilities will not be delivered,” the person said.

But the largest buyer Germany has criticised Airbus for failing to do what it promised. \nDespite being a transporter plane, designers say the A400M’s advanced systems such as ground-hugging technology make it one of the most complex military aircraft ever built in Europe. France has praised its performance on operations in Africa. \nUnder last week’s deal, Airbus has re-committed to bringing new deliveries up to the final operational standard, known as “SOC3,” which includes flights at low level. It must also retrofit earlier planes in two stages by April 2027. \nAirbus must meanwhile pay or give credit notes for all damages for delays due as of last week, when the agreement was signed: a move that underscores likely fourth-quarter charges. \nAirbus warned last week it may post new provisions for losses on the A400M in its Feb. 15 annual results. It has already written off almost 7 billion euros on the project. \nThe agreement calls, however, for an easing of key cash-retention clauses which had allowed buyers to freeze payments to Airbus because of equipment problems. Instead, these will be modified to introduce “suitable incentivisation mechanisms”. \n($1 = 0.8166 euros)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T18:49:30.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
