It said this was a five point increase on 2007 when the global financial crisis was beginning.\nS&P, which agreed to pay $1.5 billion to resolve a collection of lawsuits over its ratings on mortgage securities that soured in the run-up to the financial crisis, also said global earnings growth has caught up with debt growth since 2016, having lagged in prior years.\nChina, the ratings agency said, was the main driver of leverage growth in 2007-2017 and represented the largest leverage risk. With a debt burden of $18.9 trillion, the world’s second largest economy makes up 28 percent of the world’s total.\nReporting by Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-05T14:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T14:57:34.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
