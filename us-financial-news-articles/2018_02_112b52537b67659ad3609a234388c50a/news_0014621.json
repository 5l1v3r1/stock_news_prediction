The news followed warnings late last year that the contract was in trouble.\n“The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price,” he told lawmakers.\n“It is now clear that this franchise will only be able to continue in its current form for a matter of a very small number of months and no more.”\nGrayling said he would now be seeking a new arrangement to run the railway, which could include the government running it until 2020, or Stagecoach continuing to operate the line on a not-for-profit basis.\nIn the meantime, Grayling said that the line would continue to operate as usual. From 2020, there will be a new long-term plan for the route in place, he added.\nStagecoach’s financial miscalculations had cost it 200 million pounds ($280 million), the minister said.\n$1 = 0.7161 pounds Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-06T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T21:59:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
