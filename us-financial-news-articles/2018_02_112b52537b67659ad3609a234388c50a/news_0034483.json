Red packets, which are gifts of money from married to unmarried people, have propelled the growth of China's tech companies like Tencent. The week-long holiday is a time for Chinese travelers to go on vacation, and 6.5 million Chinese holidaymakers are expected to travel abroad this week. \nThe Lunar New Year, which kicks off on Feb. 16, is East Asia's most important holiday season. \nThe festival, also known as Chinese New Year, can be described as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and even New Year's Eve rolled into one holiday, which marks the beginning of spring and the coming together of families. \nOther than China , where many go on a week-long holiday, countries like Singapore , Malaysia , South Korea and Vietnam also celebrate the festival as public holidays. \nAs a result, the celebration impacts stock markets, factory production and economic activity. \nThis year, it's also being cited by some as contributing to bitcoin's slump in January as Asian traders are perceived to be cashing out their cryptocurrencies to buy gifts for the holiday season. Big budgets for the holidays \nLast year, Singapore-based United Overseas Bank polled respondents in three Southeast Asian countries to find out their budgets for the Lunar New Year. \nIn Singapore, a survey of about 500 revealed the average holiday budget to be $1,890 (roughly 2,500 Singapore dollars).

Gifting money goes digital \nRed packets, also known as hongbao in Mandarin Chinese, are an important tradition of the festival. They're envelopes containing gifts of money given by married people to unmarried people — although many also have the practice of giving money to their parents. \nIn China , digital red packets have contributed to the growth of mobile payments, notably for Tencent social media platform WeChat. \nThe tech conglomerate only introduced e-hongbaos in 2014, but their popularity has skyrocketed. More than 16 million digital packets were sent on the eve of Chinese New Year in 2014, but that grew to 14.2 billion for the same day last year. \nThe phenomenon hasn't quite taken off in Southeast Asia in the same fashion, but consumers are starting to bite. \nSingapore-headquartered bank DBS declined to reveal total digital red packet numbers, but said that there were five times more e-hongbaos sent last year compared with 2016. \nMore importantly for consumers, DBS revealed that the average amount sent in digital red packets in Singapore last year was S$26 (about $19.60) — several times higher than the going rates of physical red packets, which is between S$6 ($4.50) and S$10 ($7.60). Chinese tourism boom \nIn China , the festival also results in the largest annual migration of people in the world. During what is known as chunyun, a 40-day travel season, nearly 3 billion trips are expected to be made using public transport between Feb. 1 and March 12, according to China's Ministry of Transport . \nMany of those trips are made by city dwellers heading home, but many also take the time to go elsewhere, with top destinations being Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. \nDomestic travel spending last year rose 15.9 percent from 2016, with 344 million domestic tourists spending 423.3 billion yuan ($61.5 billion), according to China's National Tourism Administration . \nIncreasingly affluent Chinese are also looking to travel abroad. Last year, 6.15 million Chinese travelers took international trips , a 7 percent increase from 2016, with overseas spending estimated to amount to about 100 billion yuan (nearly $16 billion). \nThe number is expected to grow again this year. Last week, a report from the China Tourism Academy and Ctrip said they expected the number of outbound Chinese travelers this year to reach a new record of 6.5 million. \nThese vacationers are expected to spend an average of about 9,500 yuan (about $1,500) and are looking to popular destinations such as Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam. \nCIMB private banking economist Song Seng Wun said Chinese New Year always brings a \"short-term lift for consumption for Chinese communities around the world from Beijing , Jakarta , London, Los Angeles, to Singapore.\" \nHe added that, in Singapore, some indicators of Chinese New Year spending that give him signals for the health of the economy are the demand for gift baskets and hampers and the queues for bakkwa – a sweet barbecued pork jerky in Singapore which sells for about $38 (S$50) per kilogram, and gets more expensive the closer it gets to the actual holiday. \n\"And since more and more Chinese are taking their long holiday breaks outside of China, I'll be watching out for how busy our Merlion will be over this Chinese New Year period,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T05:58:05.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
