The asset managers declined to comment. \nChina’s foreign exchange regulator, which said in December that Shanghai had started vetting new QDLP licenses, didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment on the matter. \nFrom 2013-2015, Shanghai awarded QDLP quotas worth a combined $1.23 billion to 15 asset managers including UBS Asset Management, BlackRock, Oaktree Capital, Citadel, OZ Management and Man Group. \nAnother offshore investment scheme, the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program, apparently remains suspended. No new QDII quotas have been granted since 2015. \nAlthough Chinese investors can buy Hong Kong stocks via the Connect scheme, suspension of the QDII and QDLP schemes have greatly limited their ability to allocate assets globally. YUAN ON STRONGER FOOTING \nChina burned through nearly $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves from mid 2014 to early 2017 as authorities sought to shore up the falling yuan and reduce potentially destabilizing capital flight. \nBut the Chinese currency has staged a remarkable turnaround since, thanks largely to a floundering U.S. dollar and stronger-than-expected economic growth in China. \nThe yuan rose around 6.8 percent against the greenback in 2017 and is up another 4 percent so far this year. Forex reserves have climbed for 12 straight months. \n“In the current environment, yuan’s strong appreciation has greatly eased the fears of capital outflows,” said Stephen Zhu, Shanghai-based representative of Ashland Partners, which provides compliance consultation and verification services to the asset management industry. \n“Resumption of QDLP also fits with China’s broader policy shift toward greater financial deregulation,” he said, referring to Beijing’s recent pledge to widen foreign access to its giant financial sector. \nRevival of the QDLP business would also help support Shanghai’s longer-term ambition to challenge other Asian cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong in attracting global asset managers. \nShanghai, which aims to become a global financial center by 2020, is already ramping up efforts to woo global asset managers to settle in Lujiazui, China’s answer to Manhattan. \nSo far, 34 global asset managers have set up wholly-owned units in Shanghai - the prerequisite for launching QDLP and onshore private fund businesses, while 27 others are setting up, or plan to set up subsidiaries in the city. \n“We hope that Shanghai can become an Asia-Pacific center for global asset managers ... and the city of choice to launch their China businesses,” said Neo Yuan, a director at the Shanghai Lujiazui Financial City Authority.
