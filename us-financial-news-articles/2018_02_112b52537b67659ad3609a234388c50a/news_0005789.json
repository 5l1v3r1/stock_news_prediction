The new rules will come into effect by 2020.\nResponding to an analyst question on the impact of the new rules on the fuel oil market, Kang Dong-soo, head of the corporate planning office at SK Energy, said that spreads between low-sulphur fuel oil and high-sulphur fuel oil should narrow after 2020 from their current level of about $26.\nAdditionally, the company said it is considering an initial public offering (IPO) of its lubricant oil unit, SK Lubricants Co Ltd, but the schedule and size of the IPO have not been decided yet.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, SK Innovation ran its crude distillation units at its refineries in Ulsan and Incheon at 93 percent of capacity on average, up from 83 percent over the same period in 2016, the company said in the earnings statement. SK Innovation shares fell 2.6 percent on Wednesday while the KOSPI index dropped 0.05 percent.
