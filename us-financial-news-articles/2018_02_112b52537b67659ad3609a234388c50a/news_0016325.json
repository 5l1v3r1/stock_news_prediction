(NASDAQ:ONTX) (“Onconova” or “we”), a Phase 3 stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing small molecule drug candidates to treat cancer, with a primary focus on Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering (the “Offering”) of 8,650,000 shares of its common stock (“Common Stock”) (or Common Stock equivalent) and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 865,000 shares of Onconova’s Series A convertible preferred stock (“Preferred Stock Warrants”) at a public offering price of $1.01 per share and accompanying Preferred Stock Warrant. This Offering is expected to close on or about February 12, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the sole book-running manager for the Offering.\nIn addition, Onconova has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,297,500 additional shares of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 129,750 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions.\nThe Preferred Stock Warrants will be exercisable immediately at an exercise price of $1.01 per 0.1 share of Series A Preferred Stock and will expire on the later of (i) the one-year anniversary of the date on which we publicly announce through the filing of a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Charter Amendment has been filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and (ii) the earlier of (A) the one-month anniversary of the date on which Onconova publically releases certain topline results of the INSPIRE Pivotal phase 3 trial and (B) December 31, 2019. The shares of Common Stock (or Common Stock equivalent) and the accompanying Preferred Stock Warrants can only be purchased together in this Offering but will be issued separately.\nThe gross proceeds of the Offering are expected to be approximately $8.7 million, or approximately $10 million if the underwriter exercises its option to purchase additional securities in full, prior to deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. In addition, in the event the Preferred Stock Warrants are exercised in full, Onconova expects to receive approximately $10 million in additional proceeds. However, there is no assurance that all or a portion of the Preferred Stock Warrants will be exercised prior to their expiration.\nOnconova intends to use the net proceeds from this Offering to fund the development of its clinical and preclinical programs, for other research and development activities and for general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and funding working capital needs.\nA registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-222374) relating to these securities was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 7, 2018.
