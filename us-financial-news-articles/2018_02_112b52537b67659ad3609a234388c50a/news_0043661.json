REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon SoftBank is an investor in ride-hailing firms around the world including Didi, most recently becoming Uber Technologies Inc’s largest shareholder in January.\nDidi and taxi firm Daiichi Koutsu Sangyo Co Ltd plan to offer taxi-hailing services to visitors from mainland China, with the taxi firm saying on Monday that it was also in talks with Uber.\nOn Tuesday Uber’s new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, told investors in Tokyo that Uber must change the way it does business in Japan.\n“It is clear to me that we need to come in with partnership in mind and in particular partnership with the taxi industry,” he said without providing specifics.\nSome of the most vigorous opposition to industry deregulation has come from the “prince of taxis” Ichiro Kawanabe, chairman of Japan’s largest taxi firm Nihon Kotsu Co Ltd.\nKawanabe has set up its own taxi-hailing company, JapanTaxi, winning investment from Toyota Motor Corp along the way, and has 60,000 taxis registered with the service.\nReporting by Minami Funakoshi and Sam Nussey; Additional reporting by Susan Mathew; Editing by Stephen Coates and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T06:21:55.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
