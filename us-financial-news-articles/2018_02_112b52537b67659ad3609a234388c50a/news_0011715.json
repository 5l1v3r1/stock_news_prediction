The Olympic spirit has brought real hope for a brighter future for everyone on the Korean Peninsula,” Bach said.\nWhile the Olympics had opened the door to opportunity for talks between the two Koreas, Bach said it was important to see the process through.\n“This initiative gives all parties the chance to reflect on what the future could look like, if we were all guided by this Olympic spirit,” he added.\n“But Korea’s journey does not end here. The political tensions will not disappear overnight. Sport cannot create peace, but the Olympic Games can open the way with powerful symbols.”\nThe talks between Koreas on the Olympics have brought some respite from the standoff over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks during the 132nd IOC Session ahead of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, February 5, 2018.
