REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Sponsorship revenues had now topped $2.91 billion, Coates said, calling the program “extraordinarily successful”.\n“There are 47 partners in total, 15 in tier one, 29 in tier two and three in tier three. $2.91 billion of national sponsorship and there is more to come,” he said.\n“It is a pleasure dealing with this local organising committee,” he said.\nThe London 2012 Games raised roughly $1.1 billion, while Rio de Janeiro in 2016 claimed it had slightly surpassed London, but final accounts are sketchy given investigations into corruption linked to Olympics projects in Brazil.\nTokyo initially struggled with preparations after being awarded the Games in 2013, scrapping plans for an expensive new stadium, reducing a ballooning budget from more than $26 billion to $16.8 billion and dealing with a number of environmental issues.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by John O'Brien\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T04:49:51.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
