As the market, fresh from all-time highs, recovers from a massive correction, we think the premium placed on owning strong businesses increases, while the risk of owning those with zero valuation support becomes even more pronounced.\"\nSnap and Twitter shares are up 38 percent and 29 percent this month through Wednesday, respectively. Both companies reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings results in early February.\nNathanson reaffirmed his $10 price target for Snap shares, representing 46 percent downside to Wednesday's close. He also reiterated his $19 price target for Twitter shares, representing 43 percent downside to Wednesday's close.\nThe analyst noted how Wall Street's 2018 consensus earnings per share estimates improved by 5 percent for Snap and rose by 19 percent for Twitter after their fourth-quarter earnings reports.\n\"Despite huge positive moves in Snap and Twitter … we find these names even more overvalued than before given that our estimates didn't change nearly as dramatically as the stocks moved,\" Nathanson wrote.\nSnap and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n— CNBC's Patricia Martell contributed to this report.\nDisclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap.\nDisclaimer", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T16:27:31.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
