They closed 12 percent lower while the broader market rose 0.8 percent.\n“Of course they’ll lose some mandates but they’re big enough for that,” said Geoff Wilson, founder and chairman at Wilson Asset Management ( WAM.AX ), which holds Platinum shares.\nPlatinum has A$27.1 billion in funds under management and announced Nielson’s departure with its half-year results, which beat analyst expectations, after the market closed on Thursday.\nNeilson has focused the fund on Asian investments, but said a mid-1990s investment in IBM ( IBM.N ), and timely purchases of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc ( GOOGL.O ) are among his best-performing picks.\n“The tech bubble we played beautifully; we’ve been quite good at big turning points,” he said.\n“Then the big balls-ups: I stayed too long in my shorts the whole of 2008 onwards,” he said listing Walmart as a short target that had soared.\n“But we’ve outperformed even with that ... so there’s a system in the stock selection here that is pretty robust.”\nNeilson, who steps down on July 1, will be replaced as chief executive by younger co-founder Andrew Clifford. Neilson said he closely studied individual stocks, often paying as much A$600 per hour to interview former executives.\n“You get a profile that is much deeper than simply the numbers,” Neilson said.\n“We try to find when there’s been a disproportionate action to an event and then the analysis lies in assessing whether that event is character-changing or not.”\nReporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Stephen Coates\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T08:11:49.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
