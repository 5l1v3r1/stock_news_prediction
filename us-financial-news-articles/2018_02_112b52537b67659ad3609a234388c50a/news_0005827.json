Reach him on Messenger to share your thoughts on market moves: danilo.masoni.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net VIEW FROM THE STREET: THE CASE FOR NOT BUYING THE DIP IN CAPITA (1043 GMT) After a 48 percent fall yesterday, brokers are digesting UK outsourcer Capita's latest profit warning and outlining the possibilities for its future. Down another 4 percent today to 177p the stock is certainly cheap - but why are bargain-hunters not snapping it up? \"Too early to buy back in despite the fall,\" say Deutsche Bank analysts. \"Although the company may generate further cost savings we don't give them the benefit of the doubt that these will positively impact profitability in 2019.\" They don't see Capita showing growing profitability until 2020 at the earliest - a date UBS also targets as a potential recovery point. \"We think a (required) focus on internal execution will see negative earnings growth and free cash flow for FY18e and FY19e, but FY20e could see both turn positive,\" write UBS analysts. Barclays says Capita is a five-year turnaround story which must also grapple with \"profound change and uncertainty\" in its markets. \"This is a first and necessary step on the road to recovery, but the lack of visibility coupled with experience at Serco (where three years on the recovery in revenue and profits is still elusive) will likely keep new money on the sidelines for a while yet,\" Barclays analysts write. (Helen Reid) BINGE-BUYING EUROPACORP SHARES, NETFLIX AND NO CHILL (1003 GMT) Shares in French film director Luc Besson's EuropaCorp are on fire this morning, up as much as 40 percent after French business daily Les Echos reported Netflix is in talks - not clear at this stage exactly about what - with the company which made a hit with \"Lucy\", staring Scarlett Johansson, in 2014. After a box office disappointment for its big budget sci-fi movie \"Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets\" this summer, EuropaCorp has been on the look-out for new partners to bring in fresh cash or help it restructure its debt. EuropaCorp is worth currently a bit less than 100 million euros on the Paris stock market, that's a market cap about 1000 times smaller than Netflix, which plans to spend up to $8 billion this year on TV shows and movies to fend off rivals such as Amazon Prime. Here's Luc Besson and the logo of his company in the background. (Julien Ponthus) OPENING SNAPSHOT: TOP MOVERS (0817 GMT) Return of the melt-up? European stocks are striding into February with strong gains led by banking and tech stocks. Among notable movers after results, Bic is down 6.7 percent while NEX Group is top of the STOXX, up 7.4 percent after revenues rose. The financial technology firm benefited from markets it said were 'noticeably' more active this year. Meanwhile Shell took a 5 percent dive at the open and is now down 1.8 percent, the worst-performing on the FTSE 100. It seems the cashflow might be what the market's taking issue with. \"Unfortunately, resilient earnings do not appear to have translated into cash generation this quarter,\" write RBC analysts. Dealmaking is still a feature too with Denmark's TDC tumbling 10.7 percent after saying it would buy Swedish Modern Times Group's broadcasting and entertainment business. (Helen Reid) WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EUROPE OPENS (0748 GMT) European shares are expected to open higher on the first day of February with futures up around 0.4-0.5 percent following a weak end of January, which was marked by jitters over rising bond yields and a stronger euro. Earnings will be a key focus with heavyweights such as oil major Royal Dutch Shell and drugmaker Roche having already reported results. Profits at Shell more than doubled, slightly beating analyst expectations, although traders indicated the stock 1-2 percent lower citing weak cash flow. Net income at Roche fell as sales growth was broadly in line with expectations. Consumer goods maker Unilever delivered better than expected fourth-quarter sales growth, a possible relief for a sector which has been hit this year by a rotation back into cyclical stocks. Its shares were indicated 1 percent higher. Overall fourth-quarter earnings for the STOXX 600 are expected to increase by 11.9 percent year on year, the latest Thomson Reuters data showed. In M&A news, traders mentioned as possibly market-moving a Bloomberg report saying BHP is mulling a split of its US shale unit to speed up the sale of the business it values at $10 billion.
