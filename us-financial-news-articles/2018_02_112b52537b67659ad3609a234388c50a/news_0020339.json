(Nasdaq: HOLX) announced today the Company's financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nRevenue of $791.1 million increased 7.7%, or 6.7% in constant currency, compared to the prior year period. Excluding the acquired medical aesthetics and divested blood screening businesses, revenue increased 2.7%, or 1.5% in constant currency. Revenue growth rates in the first quarter were negatively affected by four extra selling days in the prior year period, which Hologic estimates added more than $20 million to revenue a year ago.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.45 increased 383.3% compared to the prior year period. GAAP results include a one-time tax provision net benefit of $329.2 million associated with the recent enactment of tax reform legislation in the U.S. Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.55 increased 5.8% compared to the prior year period.\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter results,\" said Steve MacMillan, Hologic's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We posted solid revenue just above our guidance range, driven by strength in our breast health, molecular diagnostics and international businesses. In addition, U.S. tax reform is helping us increase our earnings guidance for the year, while simultaneously re-investing in the business to drive future growth.\"\nKey financial results for the fiscal first quarter were:\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP\nQ1'18\nQ1'17\nChange\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nQ1'18\nQ1'17\nChange\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nRevenues\n$791.1\n$734.4\n7.7%\n$791.1\n$734.4\n7.7%\nGross Margin\n53.7%\n55.1%\n(140 bps)\n63.8%\n65.2%\n(140 bps)\nOperating Expenses\n$290.4\n$258.8\n12.2%\n$271.8\n$231.1\n17.6%\nOperating Margin\n17.0%\n19.9%\n(290 bps)\n29.4%\n33.7%\n(430 bps)\nNet Margin\n51.4%\n11.8%\n3,960 bps\n19.4%\n20.2%\n(80 bps)\nDiluted EPS\n$1.45\n$0.30\n383.3%\n$0.55\n$0.52\n5.8%\nThroughout this press release, all dollar figures are in millions, except EPS.

Excluding the acquired medical aesthetics and divested blood screening businesses, U.S. revenue decreased (0.8%). International revenue of $193.9 million increased 20.6%, or 15.8% in constant currency. Excluding the acquired medical aesthetics and divested blood screening businesses, international revenue increased 17.6%, or 11.6% in constant currency. In Diagnostics: Molecular diagnostics sales of $148.6 million increased 6.2%, or 5.3% in constant currency, driven primarily by continued strength across Aptima® women's health products globally. Cytology and perinatal sales of $123.4 million increased 2.6%, or 0.9% in constant currency, due primarily to an increase in perinatal sales. Blood screening sales of $12.6 million decreased (80.7%), as this business was divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Breast Health revenue totaled $288.0 million, an increase of 5.4%, or 4.2% in constant currency, driven by strong international sales, new products, and service revenue. Medical Aesthetics revenue was $91.3 million, a 12.2% sequential increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The Cynosure acquisition closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. GYN Surgical revenue of $107.5 million decreased (6.4%), or (7.1%) in constant currency.

Blood and Medical Aesthetics\n(0.8%)\n17.6%\n11.6%\nExpense Detail\nGross margin was 53.7% on a GAAP basis, and 63.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins declined by 140 basis points primarily due to sales mix associated with the divestiture of the higher-margin blood screening business and sales of lower-margin Cynosure products.\nOperating expenses were $290.4 million on a GAAP basis, and $271.8 million on a non-GAAP basis. GAAP operating expenses increased 12.2% and non-GAAP operating expenses increased 17.6%, primarily due to the inclusion of Cynosure expenses.\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"U.S. tax reform\") was enacted into law. As a result of U.S. tax reform and based on currently available information, the Company performed preliminary calculations and recorded a discrete net tax benefit of $329.2 million. This discrete net tax benefit primarily results from the re-measurement of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities at a lower corporate income tax rate, partially offset by tax expense from deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The quarterly effective tax rate was a benefit of (324.5%) on a GAAP basis, and a provision of 23.0% on a non-GAAP basis. The difference in these rates was primarily due to U.S. tax reform, as described above.\nOther Key Financial Results\nGAAP net income for the first quarter was $406.7 million, an increase of 370.2% due primarily to the effects of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the first quarter was $258.1 million, a decrease of (4.1%).\nOperating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $169.1 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $147.3 million.\nDuring the first quarter, Hologic repurchased or redeemed $202 million in principal of its 2013 convertible notes for a total of $244 million. In addition, the Company repurchased $39 million in principal of its 2012 convertible notes for a total of $53 million.\nTotal debt outstanding at the end of the quarter was $3.3 billion. The company ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $0.7 billion, and a net leverage ratio (net debt over adjusted EBITDA) of 2.6 times.\nOn a trailing 12 months basis, adjusted ROIC of 12.4% declined 70 basis points compared to the prior year period.\nFinancial Guidance for Fiscal 2018\n\"We are reiterating our full-year revenue guidance and increasing our EPS forecast based mainly on our solid first-quarter results and the beneficial effects of U.S. tax reform,\" said Bob McMahon, the Company's chief financial officer.\nHologic's financial guidance for fiscal 2018 is shown in the two tables immediately below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 283 million for the full year. As a reminder, percentage changes versus the prior year are affected by the blood screening divestiture and the Cynosure acquisition, both of which closed in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2018 as in fiscal 2017. Current guidance assumes that recent foreign exchange rates persist for all of fiscal 2018.\nGAAP\nRevenue\nEPS\nReported %\nIncrease (Decrease)\nGuidance $\nReported % Increase\n(Decrease)\nGuidance $\nCurrent Guidance for\nFiscal 2018\n4.6% to 7.2%\n$3,200 to $3,280\nmillion\n(10.6%) to (8.7%)\n$2.36 to $2.41\nPrevious Guidance for\nFiscal 2018\n4.6% to 7.2%\n$3,200 to $3,280\nmillion\n(53.8%) to (51.9%)\n$1.22 to $1.27\nNon-GAAP\nRevenue\nEPS\nConstant\nCurrency %\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nReported %\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nGuidance $\nReported %\nIncrease\n(Decrease)\nGuidance $\nCurrent Guidance\nfor Fiscal 2018\n3.9% to 6.5%\n4.6% to 7.2%\n$3,200 to $3,280\nmillion\n9.4% to 11.8%\n$2.22 to $2.27\nPrevious Guidance\nfor Fiscal 2018\n4.0% to 6.6%\n4.6% to 7.2%\n$3,200 to $3,280\nmillion\n3.4% to 5.9%\n$2.10 to $2.15\nHologic's financial guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 is shown in the two tables immediately below.

Constant currency presentations show reported period revenue results as if the foreign exchange rates were the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) additional depreciation expense from acquired fixed assets and accelerated depreciation related to business consolidation and closure of facilities; (iii) additional expense resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount from the equity conversion option of the convertible notes; (v) restructuring and divestiture charges, facility closure and consolidation charges and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services) and separate divested businesses from existing operations; (vi) transaction related expenses for divestitures and acquisitions; (vii) gain on disposal of business; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) the unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of forward foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized (gains) losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impact of tax reform primarily related to remeasuring of net deferred tax liabilities and providing taxes for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results as detailed in our reconciliations of such adjustments; and (xiv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.\nFuture Non-GAAP Adjustments\nFuture GAAP EPS may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which are excluded in the calculation of the Company's non-GAAP EPS guidance as described in this press release.\nConference Call and Webcast\nHologic's management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.
