It would be a way to adjust our public services,” he said.\nUnions and left-wing politicians criticised the plan.\n“This massive public-sector jobs cut plan in disguise does not augur well for a job recovery in a country still mired in mass unemployment,” Luc Farre of the UNSA union said in a statement.\n“PROTECTED FORTRESS”\nThe review is the first attempt to detail how Macron aims to cut public spending by 60 billion euros - or 3 percent of economic output - over the term of his mandate as promised.\nAsked about the redundancy plan during a news conference in Tunisia, Macron said: “You can’t pretend to want to transform the country and say the public sector is some kind of protected fortress which shouldn’t be transformed, which should never be adapted.”\nThe redundancy plan shows how the former investment banker, who also wants to increase the use of merit-based pay for civil servants and put more government workers on private-sector contracts, intends to instil a more corporate culture.\nPrevious governments have preferred to use the bump in baby boomers’ retirements to reduce headcount by not filling every vacancy. But payrolls still account for more than a third of the central government’s total spending.\nPhilippe, the former mayor Macron poached from the ranks of the conservative party, also said the French will be able to fill out 100 percent of official forms online by 2022, while the government would also train employees to act as advisors rather than form fillers.\nThe philosophy behind the government’s plan was to digitalize most technical and repetitive tasks in the different layers of bureaucracy, Philippe said.\nAll companies will be able to bid online for government tenders from Oct. 31 this year.\nBut Philippe and Darmanin provided few details on where the axe would fall.\nLegislation spelling out the plans will be ready by the start of next year, after consultation with civil service unions, Philippe said.\nThe government was warned last month by the independent audit watchdog that it was still a long way from redressing the situation in its public finances and should not wait for the end of its mandate to spell out spending cuts.\nMacron said during his campaign he aimed to cut the number of government employees by 120,000 over five years, including 50,000 for the central government.\nMore than 5.5 million people are on government payroll, including the central government, local authorities and public hospitals.\nAdditional reporting by Myriam Rivet; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T17:01:25.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
