U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the group soon after taking office but he said in January that Washington might yet stay in.\nBishop also said Australia was keen to pursue a bilateral free trade agreement with Britain as soon as it could.\n“I believe that, post Brexit, there will be enormous opportunities to engage more closely in trade and investment,” she said.\n“When the circumstances are right, when the timing is right, Australia would be keen to pursue a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. High quality, comprehensive, gold standard.”\nBishop said Australia would want to secure rights for its citizens to work in Britain as part of any such deal.\nReporting by Andy Bruce; Writing by William Schomberg; editing by Michael Holden\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-19T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:29:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
