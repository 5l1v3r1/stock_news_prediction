I’ll continue to deal with currency market moves with a sense of urgency,” he added.\nA strong yen erodes profits at Japanese manufacturers and could hurt the otherwise buoyant economy, which posted an eighth straight quarter of growth in October-December.\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Eric Meijer\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T12:05:12.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
