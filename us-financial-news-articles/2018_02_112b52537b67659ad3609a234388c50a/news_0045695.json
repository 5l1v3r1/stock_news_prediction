Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations.\nTrump has repeatedly dismissed the Russian cyber threat, and called Mueller’s investigation of possible collusion between his campaign and Moscow a “witch hunt.”\nSessions, who recused himself from overseeing the Mueller probe after failing to disclose meetings with Russian officials, said last October “probably not” when asked by a U.S. senator if enough was being done to tackle Russian interference.\nReporting by Dustin Volz and Eric Walsh; editing by Mary Milliken and Lisa Shumaker\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T02:38:16.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
