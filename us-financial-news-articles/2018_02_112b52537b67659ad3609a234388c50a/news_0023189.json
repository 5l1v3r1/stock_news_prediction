McMaster and Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and had an exchange of views on strengthening bilateral ties and cooperation on international issues, the ministry added, again without giving details. \nYang, a career diplomat, has emerged as one of China’s main conduits for talking to the Trump administration and has deep experience dealing with the United States. \nUnlike Foreign Minister Wang Yi, he is a fluent English speaker, having studied at the London School of Economics in the 1970s before working as a translator for the foreign ministry. \nHe was first posted to the United States from 1983-87, and eventually rose to become ambassador, from 2000-2004.
