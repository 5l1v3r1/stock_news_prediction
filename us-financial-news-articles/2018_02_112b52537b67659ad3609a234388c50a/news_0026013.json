We haven’t performed to our abilities yet but now we look forward to New Zealand.” \nThe visitors were restricted by a disciplined pace bowling performance from Kane Richardson, who finished with 3-33, while Billy Stanlake claimed 2-28. \nEngland fast bowler David Willey had Australia’s stand-in skipper David Warner caught behind with just two runs on the board, giving England a glimmer of hope in the first over but Lynn soon snatched the momentum. \nHe smashed two fours and a six in the next over from Tom Curran and by the time he was dismissed by Chris Jordan in the final over of the powerplay Australia were in control at 51-2. \nShort and Maxwell took charge against England spinners Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson before Aaron Finch confirmed the victory with back-to-back sixes off Willey. \nEngland next face New Zealand in consecutive matches in Wellington (Feb. 13) and Hamilton (Feb. 18) as they attempt to join Australia in the final.
