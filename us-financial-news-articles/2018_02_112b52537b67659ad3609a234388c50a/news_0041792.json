I know what I did. I stand by my word, I reckon my run was pretty badass,” he told reporters of his high-risk but clean second effort.\n“I knew that that 91 is not going to hold. It’s kind of a little secret language between the judges,” he added.\n“I can put my hand on my heart and say that run, totally clean, I definitely could have won. I‘m going to go back and watch the competition, but I was pretty sure I laced that run.”\nWoods, who finished fifth in the event at Sochi four years ago, also suffered a deep gash under his chin after kneeing himself during one of his jumps in the opening run.\nHe just missed out on a second slopestyle medal for Team GB, following Isabel Atkin’s surprise bronze in the women’s event on Saturday, the first British medal in a Winter Olympic skiing discipline.\nIt was still a great experience, said the enthusiastic Woods, and a decent crowd at the venue were treated to a “perfect show”.\n“If people are going to be inspired by skiing, then we couldn’t have put on a better show,” he said.\n“And Izzy (Atkin) came away with some hardware.” (Editing by John O‘Brien)\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-18T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-19T16:54:36.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
