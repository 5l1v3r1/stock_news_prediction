(NASDAQ:BHBK) declared a special dividend of $0.30 and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, payable on March 21, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2018.\nWilliam Parent, President and Chief Executive Officer of Blue Hills Bancorp, said, “Our decision to pay a special dividend in 2018 reflects the continued improvement in our operating performance since becoming a public company in July 2014 and our optimism for what lies ahead in 2018 and beyond. We constantly evaluate all options with respect to managing our significant excess capital position and believe that this special dividend represents the best course of action available to the Company and our shareholders at this time. Taking into account both our regular dividend and special dividend, our stock currently provides an attractive annualized yield of approximately 4.5% to our investors based on our closing stock price on February 21, 2018.
