I hope the BOJ continues to promote bold monetary easing to achieve its 2 percent inflation target,” Abe told parliament on Monday. \nThe dollar rose against the yen on expectations that Kuroda’s reappointment increases the chances the BOJ will maintain its massive stimulus program. \nAnalysts have said, however, that a reappointment will diminish the chance of the BOJ deploying more radical stimulus measures, such as direct BOJ bank-rolling of government debt as advocated by other candidates for the job, including Abe’s former aide Etsuro Honda. \n“There are still big questions as to where policy goes and remember Kuroda has surprised markets in the past. But for now the reappointment suggests policy continuity throughout the year,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets in London. \nKuroda was hand-picked by Abe to take the BOJ’s helm in 2013 to deploy one of the “three arrows” of his stimulus policies - aggressive monetary easing to reflate the economy out of grinding deflation. \nBut three years of aggressive asset purchases under a policy dubbed “quantitative and qualitative easing” (QQE) failed to accelerate inflation to the 2 percent target. \nThat forced the BOJ to revert to a policy targeting interest rates, a shift many analysts saw as a retreat from its radical monetary experiment towards a future withdrawal of crisis-mode stimulus.
