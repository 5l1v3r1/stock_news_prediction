It is not just about divesting assets,” the person said, declining to provide details. \nDepending on the feedback from third parties, it is possible the package could be adjusted, the source said. The Commission is expected to seek comment from industry rivals and customers in the coming days. \nBayer struck a deal with BASF in October last year to sell seed and herbicide businesses for 5.9 billion euros (£5.2 billion) but has said it is prepared to do more to gain EU approval. \nThe Monsanto deal has triggered opposition from some farmers and environmentalists who have sent more than 50,000 petition emails and more than 5,000 letters to the Commission.
