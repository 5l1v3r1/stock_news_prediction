That was dismissed by the three-judge panel on Wednesday.\n“This court has been satisfied as to the validity of the ICO (Interim Custody Order) made by the Minister on behalf of the Secretary of State. Accordingly the court is satisfied that the convictions are safe. The appeal is dismissed,” Justice Ronald Weatherup told the court.\nAdams, who has always denied membership of the IRA, was detained in Belfast’s Maze prison in 1973. On one of his attempts to flee, he switched places with a visitor at the prison who had been abducted while waiting at a bus stop.\nThe court heard that a man who bore a resemblance to Adams had been taken against his will to a house where his hair was dyed and he was given a false beard. The substitution was spotted by prison staff.\nAdams, who took over as leader of Sinn Fein in 1983 when it was at the time the IRA’s political wing, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for attempting to escape.\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; editing by Mark Heinrich\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:28:11.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
