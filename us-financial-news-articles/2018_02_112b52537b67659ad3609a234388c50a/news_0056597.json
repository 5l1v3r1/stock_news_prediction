The money may leverage the building of two to five partial upgrading facilities worth some C$5 billion in private investment, she said.\nThe step is part of a larger strategy by the Alberta government to squeeze more value from energy resources.\nThe move is in line with recommendations from Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), one of the largest industry groups, and may spur construction of new facilities, Ben Brunnen, CAPP’s vice-president of oil sands, said.\n“We could see this move the needle for some companies,” Brunnen said.\nAlberta’s oil producers are under pressure from tight transportation capacity in the landlocked province that has created big price discounts for the heavy crude compared to benchmark West Texas Intermediate light oil.
