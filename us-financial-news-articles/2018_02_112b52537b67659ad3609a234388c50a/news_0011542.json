Let’s go to Mount Kumgang!”, referring to the closed inter-Korean industrial zone and a failed inter-Korean tourist project that sit just inside North Korea.\nKaesong was closed by South Korea in 2016 in protest over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. The inter-Korean Mount Kumgang resort in the coastal province of Kangwon closed after a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean guard in 2008.\nNorth Korea announced last month a new “world-level” tourist project in the divided province that appeared to be aimed at capitalizing on the international attention surrounding the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, a city in the South Korean-controlled half of Kangwon.\nActivists based in South Korea regularly use balloons to send fliers, money and foreign news across the demilitarized zone into North Korea.\nIn response, Pyongyang has also used balloons to send its own anti-South Korean fliers towards Seoul, where the colorful and tattered leaflets can sometimes be found in mountains or scattered in public places.\nReporting by James Pearson; Editing by Paul Tait\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:35:59.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
