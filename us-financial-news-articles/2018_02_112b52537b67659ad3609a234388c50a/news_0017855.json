As a native New Yorker, Holder could be a formidable candidate for a Senate seat in the state, should one of New York's current senators, Kirsten Gillibrand, decide to run for president. \nAttempts to reach Holder on Wednesday were unsuccessful. \nOne thing Holder has working in his favor, politically, is his career in law enforcement, on display Wednesday as he defended the FBI, which has come under attack recently from President Donald Trump . \n\"I would hope that the president would rethink the way in which he has attacked career people at the FBI, career people in the Justice Department, [and] career people in our intelligence community,\" Holder said. \nHolder also defended Trump's attorney general, Jeff Sessions , suggesting the president ought to treat his top law enforcement officer with more respect. Trump, he said, should \"think about the ways in which he's spoken about his attorney general.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-07T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T23:35:33.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
