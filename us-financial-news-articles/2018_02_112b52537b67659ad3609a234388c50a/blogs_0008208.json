If anyone could take on health care monopolies, it's the fearless former first lady. And she has experience. Before joining her husband in the White House, she served as a senior hospital administrator at the University of Chicago Medical Center. In the seven years in her role as executive director at the office of community affairs, she worked on community relations, volunteer recruitment and staff diversity programs, according to a press release announcing her departure. \nWhile in the White House, she's been credited with putting a \"human face\" on the issue of health care reform. And in 2010, Obama got behind an initiative to encourage America's kids to get moving and eat healthier to combat the growing obesity epidemic. \nWhy not? While Obama might have the status and the experience, she's been taking a backseat of late. Last night, she appeared on her first televised interview since leaving the White House a year ago. Karen B. DeSalvo \nDeSalvo is on a mission to bring health care into the 21st-century, making her a wise choice to lead the consortium. \nShe's New Orleans' former commissioner of health and the vice president of health policy at Tulane University School of Medicine. After helping the city's health infrastructure recover after Hurricane Katrina, she joined the federal government as the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology in 2014. She was then named the acting assistant secretary for health, and she was recently appointed to Humana's board. \nWhy not? Recruiting her might present a challenge. She just got a new gig as faculty at Dell Medical School at the University of Texas at Austin. It's a wide-ranging job that involves initiatives ranging from community health to medical research. Toby Cosgrove Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Dr. Toby Cosgrove \nWhy? Well, he's available and he's got decades of health care experience. Cosgrove resigned last year from his role running Cleveland Clinic after growing revenues from $3.7 billion in 2004 to $8.5 billion in 2016. At one point, he was considered a candidate to head up the Department of Veterans Affairs under the current administration, but withdrew in late 2016. \nWhy not? Cosgrove famously gave an interview with New Yorker in which he raved about the groundbreaking potential of a technology called Theranos. Oops. \nAnd the winner... Al Drago | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Andy Slavitt \nWhy? Andy Slavitt has emerged as one of the most influential figures in the health policy landscape, in no small part to his Twitter feed . \nLegendary social media presence aside, Slavitt oversaw health care programs that extended to 140 million Americans under President Obama, including Medicaid, Medicare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Health Insurance Marketplace. He's got the experience, and the guts, to take on some of the most entrenched industry interests in health care, which would be required for the job. \nAll in all, a strong choice Twitter! \nWhy not? Well, we asked Slavitt whether he'd ever take the job, especially considering the cryptic note in his Twitter bio that he's \"launching a health care initiative for the next decade in February.\" His response? Nothing other than, \"thanks, very flattering.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T16:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T16:41:12.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
