The barbs prompted an official complaint from Espanyol, accusing the players of inciting violence. \nThe first leg at Espanyol’s RCDE stadium had been played in a prickly atmosphere and Barca goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen was hit in the face by an object thrown by home supporters. \nLa Liga officials have described this Sunday’s derby as a high-risk event, requiring increased policing, but Espanyol goalkeeper Diego Lopez called on his side’s supporters to ensure there is a good-natured atmosphere and to resist any urges to abuse their opponents. \n“The fans should go to the derby to support the team and not focus on any opposition player,” he told reporters. \n”On Sunday we want Cornella to be a cauldron of noise in our favour without any insults or lack of respect. That’s the best way for them to support us, to show that they are exemplary supporters and then we can focus on our jobs. \n“We behaved like gentlemen in the two cup games and will continue to do so.” \nBarca hold an 11-point lead at the top of the standings, followed by an Atletico side that this Sunday host their main rivals as Spain’s third force behind Barcelona and Real Madrid. \nSunday’s opponents Valencia emerged as unlikely title contenders earlier in the season but are six points behind Atletico after losing five of their past eight games. \nAtletico will be lifted by the return of Diego Costa after two weeks out through injury. They should also be better rested than Valencia, who visit the Spanish capital less than 72 hours after their King’s Cup semi-final first leg away to Barcelona.
