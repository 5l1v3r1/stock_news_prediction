The United States is trying to resolve the dispute.\nQatar denies the charges and says the four Arab countries aim to curtail its sovereignty.\nThe two crown princes, as well as Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, are planning to visit Trump for bilateral meetings in March and April, a senior U.S. official said on Friday.\nThe agenda for the meetings will include setting up a summit of the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, the official said, which Washington hopes will be held later this year, as well as Middle East peace and Iran.\nTrump also discussed enhancing bilateral partnerships on security and economic issues with the Saudi and Abu Dhabi crown princes, the White House said.\nReporting by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Sandra Maler and Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T03:23:08.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
