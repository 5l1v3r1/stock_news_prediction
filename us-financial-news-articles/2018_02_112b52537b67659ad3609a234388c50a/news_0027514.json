Appetite for risk-taking crept back into currency markets, helping higher-yielding emerging market currencies including the Colombian peso, which was up close to 2 percent after shedding more than 3 percent last week. \"Investors see opportunities in some assets including (emerging market) currencies at current prices after the massive selloff last week,\" said FX strategist Juan Carlos Alderete of Banorte. Mexico's peso currency was up nearly 0.5 percent, and stocks rose more than 0.5 percent. Investors are expecting to see lower inflation when the U.S. government releases data on Wednesday, which would bode well for emerging markets, analysts said. \"An inflation reading below the estimate would be positive for risk assets, including currencies,\" Alderete said. In Chile, the central bank is expected within 11 months to raise its benchmark interest rate to 2.75 percent from 2.5 percent currently, according to a monthly poll of 47 analysts surveyed by the bank and published on Monday. The country's peso strengthened about 1 percent, and stocks inched up as well. The markets in Brazil, Latin America's largest, were closed for Carnival celebrations, as were Argentina's.
