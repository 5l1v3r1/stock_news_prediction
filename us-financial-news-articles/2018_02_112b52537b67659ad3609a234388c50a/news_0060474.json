(NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today reported operating results for fourth-quarter and full-year 2017, and provided an update on the Company's commercial products and development programs.\n“Following its April 2017 introduction in the U.S., ZEJULA quickly became the market-leading PARP inhibitor for women with ovarian cancer, and in the second half of 2017, six out of ten ovarian cancer patients who were treated with a PARP inhibitor received ZEJULA,” said Lonnie Moulder, CEO of TESARO. “Additionally, we are expanding the ZEJULA franchise with our ongoing launches in Europe and a focused clinical development program that utilizes both monotherapy and combination approaches to potentially further lengthen the time women with ovarian cancer are free from disease progression. 2018 will be an exciting year for our immuno-oncology portfolio as we anticipate multiple data readouts, including response data for TSR-042, our anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with lung cancer and MSI-high tumors, initial results from the combination of TSR-022, our anti-TIM-3 antibody and TSR-042, and initial data from TSR-033, our anti-LAG-3 antibody.”\nRecent Business Highlights\nZEJULA is the most utilized PARP inhibitor among patients with ovarian cancer in the U.S., with more than 4,000 patients treated in 2017. Following European Commission (E.C.) approval in November 2017, ZEJULA now has marketing authorization in 32 countries and is the first and only PARP inhibitor authorized for marketing in Europe for the maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, regardless of BRCA mutation status. ZEJULA has been launched in Germany and is available in the UK for private pay patients. TESARO has applied to include ZEJULA in the UK’s Cancer Drug Fund (CDF) and will continue to work closely with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and the National Health Service (NHS) England on the ZEJULA CDF submission to make this important medicine available as quickly as possible for a broad population of women in the UK. The unit demand for VARUBI oral tablets increased 43% for Q4 2017 vs. Q4 2016, as the brand continues to penetrate the U.S. oral NK-1 market. In January 2018, the package insert for VARUBI IV was updated to include mention of new adverse events, including anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock and other serious hypersensitivity reactions, which were reported in the post-marketing setting following its introduction in late November 2017. Given these dynamics, TESARO believes the market opportunity is more limited than previously anticipated, and will suspend distribution of VARUBI IV while continuing to support VARUBI oral tablets. The Company is considering strategic alternatives for the product, including out-licensing, and will re-direct Company resources in support of ZEJULA. Clinical trials of niraparib are ongoing to evaluate safety and efficacy in monotherapy and combination therapy for patients with ovarian, breast, and lung cancer: PRIMA: Phase 3 trial for patients with first-line ovarian cancer will complete enrollment in Q2 2018 QUADRA: Registrational trial for patients with ovarian cancer who have received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy; top-line data will be available in Q1 and an abstract has been submitted to ASCO TOPACIO: Phase 2 trial in combination with anti-PD-1 for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (data to be presented at SGO) or triple negative breast cancer (abstracts submitted to ASCO) AVANOVA: Phase 2 trial in combination with bevacizumab for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer; data are anticipated to be available in 2H 2018 to support an abstract submission Niraparib tablet: A study is ongoing to advance development of a tablet formulation of niraparib OVARIO: Phase 2 assessing niraparib in combination with bevacizumab for patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer Janssen continues to advance development of niraparib in prostate cancer in monotherapy and combination therapy. Zai Lab is advancing the development of niraparib in patients with ovarian, breast and lung cancer in China, and Takeda has initiated development of niraparib in Japan. TSR-042 is in a registration trial (GARNET) for MSI-high tumors. An abstract has been submitted to AACR that includes data from patients with lung and metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cancers Data are being generated to support the use of TSR-042 in registration studies in multiple tumor types, including lung, breast and ovarian cancer Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate TSR-022 (anti-TIM-3 antibody) and TSR-033 (anti-LAG-3 antibody) in combination with TSR-042. AMBER: Phase 1 trial of TSR-022 in combination with TSR-042 is enrolling three tumor specific cohorts CITRINO: Phase 1 dose-escalation trial of TSR-033 A retrospective, exploratory analysis of the NOVA trial, presented as part of a Satellite Symposium at the International Meeting of the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) in November 2017 in Austria, identified body weight and baseline platelet counts as the two most significant predictors for grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia. In November, preliminary Phase 1 data presented at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) demonstrated TSR-022 is well tolerated across multiple dose levels, with a safety and efficacy profile expected for checkpoint inhibitors. TESARO entered into a definitive term loan agreement for up to $500 million with Pharmakon Advisors, LP in November 2017, and drew $300 million in December 2017.\n2017 Financial Results\nTESARO reported total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $48.0 million, compared to $4.9 million for the same period in 2016.

In preclinical studies, ZEJULA concentrates in the tumor relative to plasma, delivering greater than 90% durable inhibition of PARP 1/2 and a persistent antitumor effect. Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML), including some fatal cases, was reported in patients treated with ZEJULA. Discontinue ZEJULA if MDS/AML is confirmed. Hematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anemia and neutropenia), as well as cardiovascular effects (hypertension and hypertensive crisis) have been reported in patients treated with ZEJULA. Monitor complete blood counts to detect hematologic adverse reactions, as well as to detect cardiovascular disorders, during treatment. ZEJULA can cause fetal harm and females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception.
