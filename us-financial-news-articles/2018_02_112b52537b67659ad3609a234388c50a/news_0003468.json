(OTC Pink:GOVB) (the “Company”) holding company for Gouverneur Savings and Loan Association (the “Bank”), today announced the results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $66,000 as a result of a half-million dollar, one-time tax expense related to the newly enacted Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe Company recognized an approximate $500,000 in current income tax expense in December to comply with the December 22, 2017 enactment of the Act’s federal income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21%, which resulted in the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nExcluding the additional income tax expense, the first quarter net income remained strong at a positive $437,000, or $0.20 per diluted share and 1.39% above the December 2016 net income of $431,000 and $0.19 per diluted share. The annualized return on average assets increased from 1.24% to 1.30% and the return on average equity increased from 5.74% to 5.78% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and excluding the one-time tax adjustment.\nTotal assets decreased by $1.51 million, or 1.11% from $136.26 million at September 30, 2017 to $134.75 million at December 31, 2017. Net loans decreased $0.43 million, or 0.43%, from $99.65 million to $99.22 million over the same period while securities available for sale decreased by $0.23 million, or 1.29%, from $18.03 million to $17.80 million.\nCommenting on the quarter’s results, Mr. Charles C. Van Vleet, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “As with many financial institutions across the country, the Bank took a hit to its bottom line with the new tax laws enacted in December. However, the loss does not have a remarkable impact on capital and its effect is expected to diminish over the fiscal year in the form of reduced current tax expense, which will be recorded at 21% for the remaining three quarters. The Bank continues to have a strong capital position, allowing it to rank highly within its peer group.”\nNet interest income decreased $62,000, or 4.49%, from $1,382,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 to $1,320,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. Interest income decreased $6,000, or 0.40%, while interest expense increased $56,000, or 42.42% over the same period. Non-interest income increased $99,000, or 29.03% to $440,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $341,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, while non-interest expense increased $24,000 over the same period. A $60,000 increase in unrealized gains on swap agreements and an $18,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits contributed to the fiscal 2018 first quarter net increase.\nNon-performing loans were $1,374,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $1,793,000 at September 30, 2017. There was a $30,000 loan loss provision for the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $850,000 or 0.86% of total gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2017. Foreclosed real estate was $762,000 and $625,000 at December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.\nDeposits decreased $0.75 million or 0.91%, to $82.92 million at December 31, 2017 from $83.67 million at September 30, 2017. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”) decreased 5.97%, from $16.75 million at September 30, 2017 to $15.75 million at December 31, 2017.\nShareholders’ equity was $29.87 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $30,000 over the September 30, 2017 balance of $29.84 million. The book value of Gouverneur Bancorp, Inc. was $13.72 per common share based on 2,176,908 shares outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company, which is headquartered in Gouverneur, New York, is the holding company for Gouverneur Savings and Loan Association.
