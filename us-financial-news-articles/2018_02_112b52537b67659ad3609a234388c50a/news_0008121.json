But few online cases are prosecuted.\nMerkel said the internet was not a legal vacuum and the new law ensured that platform operators were responsible for the content that they disseminated.\nOpposition parties have condemned the law, saying it was wrong for private companies to be making decisions about whether posts are unlawful.\nTop-selling Bild newspaper has also called for it to be scrapped, saying it was stifling free speech and making martyrs out of anti-immigrant politicians whose posts are deleted.\nReporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T14:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T14:53:35.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
