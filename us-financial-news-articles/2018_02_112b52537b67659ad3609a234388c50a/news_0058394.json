(NASDAQ:OFIX) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $116.9 million, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.08 and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.52. For fiscal year 2017, net sales were $433.8 million, earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.39 and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.62.\n“2017 was a very strong year for Orthofix. We exceeded our topline expectations and finished the year with a solid margin improvement trajectory. We also made significant progress in the transformation of our Spine Fixation business and completed our worldwide restructuring initiatives,” said Brad Mason, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“With 2017 in the rear-view mirror, we are now focused fully on executing our 2018 global and business unit strategies. Globally, we expect to drive shareholder value through three pillars, topline organic growth better than market growth rates, margin expansion through operational improvements, and strategic deployment of our capital in ways that we believe will accelerate topline growth in our core businesses. We are well positioned and expect to execute in each of these areas in 2018.”\nFinancial Results Overview\nFourth Quarter\nThe following table provides net sales by strategic business unit (“SBU”):\nThree (Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Constant\nCurrency\nChange\nBioStim $ 49,760 $ 47,803 4.1 % 4.1 % Extremity Fixation 29,103 26,843 8.4 % 2.2 % Spine Fixation 21,175 18,664 13.5 % 13.2 % Biologics 16,858 15,227 10.7 % 10.7 % Net sales $ 116,896 $ 108,537 7.7 % 6.1 % Gross profit increased $8.1 million to $93.3 million. Gross margin increased to 79.8% compared to 78.5% in the prior year period, primarily due to increased revenue from international Extremity Fixation stocking distributors, as well as our domestic and international restructuring initiatives during 2017. Non-GAAP net margin (gross profit less sales and marketing expenses) was $41.5 million, an increase of 13.6% compared to $36.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in non-GAAP net margin was primarily due to the increase in gross margin and a slight decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percent of sales.\nNet income from continuing operations was $1.5 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to net loss of $5.1 million, or ($0.29) per share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $9.7 million, or $0.52 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $7.7 million, or $0.42 per share in the prior year period.\nEBITDA was $21.8 million, compared to $8.6 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $24.3 million or 20.8% of net sales for the fourth quarter, compared to $21.1 million or 19.4% of net sales in the prior year period.\nFiscal Year 2017\nThe following table provides net sales by SBU:\nYear Ended December 31, (U.S. Dollars, in thousands) 2017 2016 Change Constant\nCurrency\nChange\nBioStim $ 185,900 $ 176,561 5.3 % 5.3 % Extremity Fixation 103,242 102,683 0.5 % (0.9 %) Spine Fixation 81,957 72,632 12.8 % 12.7 % Biologics 62,724 57,912 8.3 % 8.3 % Net sales $ 433,823 $ 409,788 5.9 % 5.5 % Driven by the increase in net sales, gross profit increased $18.9 million to $340.8 million, while gross margin was flat at 78.6% compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net margin was $142.4 million, an increase of 1.3% compared to $140.6 million in the prior year period. The increase in Non-GAAP net margin was due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by higher commission expenses from geographic mix in Extremity Fixation and higher commission rates from Biologics and Spine Fixation distributors.\nNet income from continuing operations was $7.3 million, or $0.39 per share, compared to net income of $3.5 million, or $0.19 per share in the prior year. Adjusted net income from continuing operations was $30.1 million, or $1.62 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $27.0 million, or $1.46 per share in the prior year.\nEBITDA was $56.9 million in 2017, compared to $39.1 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $81.6 million or 18.8% of net sales for the year, compared to $79.3 million or 19.4% of net sales in the prior year.\nAdoption of Revenue Recognition Standard ASU 2014-09\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASU 2014-09, as amended, using a cumulative effect adjustment, which resulted in a significant increase in accounts receivable, a decrease in inventories, and a related change to deferred income taxes. These changes were offset by an adjustment to the Company's opening retained earnings of approximately $5 million. One of the primary impacts of this new standard is the timing of revenue recognition for our sales to international Extremity Fixation and Spine Fixation stocking distributors that were historically accounted for using the sell-through method. This revenue will now be recorded on invoiced sales instead of deferring recognition until cash is received. If the Company were to have adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2017, pro-forma net sales for would have been approximately $431 million. Refer to the table under the subheading “2017 Pro-forma Net Sales Under the New Revenue Recognition Standard” for the detail of pro-forma 2017 net sales by quarter as would have been reported under the new revenue recognition standard.\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $81.2 million compared to $39.6 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding indebtedness and borrowing capacity of $125 million. Cash flow from operations increased $8.6 million to $53.3 million, while free cash flow increased $10.0 million to $36.4 million.\nRedomicile\nThe Company is in the final stages of evaluating the impact of moving its parent company’s domicile from Curacao to the United States. Based on the analysis to date, including the assessment of the recent U.S. tax reform, the Company believes that executing this change could provide a number of benefits to Orthofix, including organizational simplification, more efficient cash deployment, a lower tax rate and increased cash flow. Subject to the outcome of final diligence, the Company currently anticipates requesting shareholder approval for this move in conjunction with its annual shareholder meeting later this year. The Company also expects to incur costs this year to complete all of the underlying steps required for this transition. These estimated costs are included in our 2018 guidance.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company expects the following results, assuming exchange rates are the same as those currently prevailing. This guidance reflects the new revenue recognition standard that is required as of January 1, 2018 and discussed above, for which net sales will be recorded on invoiced sales instead of deferring recognition until cash is received.\n2018 Outlook (Unaudited, U.S. Dollars, in millions, except per share data) Low High Net sales $ 450.0 1 $ 455.0 1 Net income from continuing operations $ 28.3 2 $ 30.6 2 Adjusted EBITDA $ 89.0 3 $ 91.0 3 EPS from continuing operations $ 1.50 4 $ 1.62 4 Adjusted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.76 5 $ 1.84 5 1 Represents a year-over-year increase of 3.7% to 4.9% on a reported basis 2 Represents a year-over-year increase of 288.1% to 319.7% 3 Represents a year-over-year decrease of 9.1% to 11.6% 4 Represents a year-over-year increase of 284.6% to 315.4% 5 Represents a year-over-year increase of 8.6% to 13.6% Conference Call\nOrthofix will host a conference call today at 4:30 PM Eastern time to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017.

EBITDA provides management with additional insight to its results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Earnings per Share from Continuing Operations\nThese non-GAAP financial measures provide management with additional insight to its results of operations and are calculated using the following adjustments:\nShare-based compensation – costs related to our share-based compensation plans, which include stock options, restricted stock awards, performance-based restricted stock awards, market-based restricted stock awards and our stock purchase plan; see the share-based compensation footnote in our Form 10-K for for a detail of these costs by income statement line item Foreign exchange impact – gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions, which are recorded as other expense, net; guidance presented does not include the impact of any future foreign exchange fluctuations Strategic investments – costs related to our strategic investments, including costs associated with evaluation of moving the domicile of the Company, which are recorded as general and administrative expenses, and recognized gains and losses on our investment in eNeura, Inc., which are recorded as other expense, net SEC / FCPA matters and related costs – legal and other professional fees associated with the SEC Investigation, Securities Class Action Complaint and Brazil subsidiary compliance review Infrastructure investments – costs associated with our multi-year process and systems improvement effort, \"Bluecore,\" which was completed in 2016 and are recorded as general and administrative expenses Legal judgments/settlements – adverse or favorable legal judgments or negotiated legal settlements, which are recorded as general and administrative expenses Charges related to U.S. Government resolutions – charges related to the settlement with the SEC as further discussed in our Form 10-K for Restructuring – costs related to a planned restructuring, primarily consisting of severance charges and the write-down of certain assets, of which approximately 25% are recorded as cost of sales and 75% are recorded as other operating expenses Succession charges – costs related to the succession of certain of our former named executive officers, which are recorded as general and administrative expenses Long-term income tax rate adjustment – reflects management’s expectation of a long-term normalized effective tax rate of 38% for 2017 results, and 35% going forward in 2018, which is based on current tax law and current expected income; actual reported tax expense will ultimately be based on GAAP earnings and may differ from the expected long-term normalized effective tax rate due to a variety of factors, including the resolutions of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities, the ability to realize deferred tax assets, the tax impact of strategic investments and other non-recurring events\nNon-GAAP Net Margin\nNon-GAAP net margin is an internal non-GAAP metric, which we define as gross profit less sales and marketing expense. Non-GAAP net margin is the primary metric used by our Chief Operating Decision Maker in managing our business.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities. Free cash flow is an important indicator of how much cash is generated or used by our normal business operations, including capital expenditures. Management uses free cash flow as a measure of progress on its capital efficiency and cash flow initiatives.\nUsefulness and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nManagement uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance period-over-period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess performance relative to competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. Management uses these non-GAAP measures as the basis for assessing the ability of the underlying operations to generate cash. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to further its understanding of the performance of our business units.\nMaterial Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe non-GAAP measures used in this press release may have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude items that reflect an economic cost and can have a material effect on cash flows. Similarly, certain non-cash expenses, such as equity compensation, do not directly impact cash flows, but are part of total compensation costs accounted for under GAAP.\nCompensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe compensate for the limitations of our non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of our performance. The GAAP results provide the ability to understand our performance based on a defined set of criteria. The non-GAAP measures reflect the underlying operating results of our businesses, which we believe is an important measure of our overall performance. We provide a detailed reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to our most directly comparable GAAP measures, and encourage investors to review this reconciliation.\nUsefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by senior management in its financial and operational decision-making. Management believes it is important to provide investors with the same non-GAAP metrics it uses to supplement information regarding the performance and underlying trends of our business operations in order to facilitate comparisons to its historical operating results and internally evaluate the effectiveness of our operating strategies. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures also facilitates comparisons of our underlying operating performance with other companies in the industry that also supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006469/en/\nOrthofix International N.V.\nMark Quick, 214-937-2924\nmarkquick@orthofix.com\nSource: Orthofix International N.V.", "external_links": ["http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180226006469/en/", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orthofix.com&esheet=51764602&newsitemid=20180226006469&lan=en-US&anchor=www.orthofix.com&index=1&md5=6806fd0a5c605c4ee14131861c9f8671", "http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.orthofix.com&esheet=51764602&newsitemid=20180226006469&lan=en-US&anchor=www.orthofix.com&index=2&md5=2a4e9675aa3fc3781ae8e78a64ccc285"], "published": "2018-02-27T00:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T00:58:33.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
