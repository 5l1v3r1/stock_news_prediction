Those are encouraging early signs.”\nFormer champions Red Bull won three of 20 races last year and finished third overall, behind world champions Mercedes and Ferrari. They hope the RB14 will enable them to challenge for the championship this time.\nThe Australian also had no problems with the new ‘halo’ head protection device, which rises from a central pillar in front of the driver and is mandatory this season.\n“So far I can see fine with the halo. I’d only done a couple of installs with it before so it was pretty new today but I really didn’t notice it was there, which is pretty good,” he said.\n“Honestly, unless there’s stuff above, I don’t see any issues at all on a flat track.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-20T23:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-21T21:21:02.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
