The older brother remains vice-chairman of Lotte Holdings.\nThe latest development comes after Shin was sentenced last week to two years and six months in prison over an influence-peddling scandal that has rocked the country’s business and political elite.\nHis detention is expected to hamper Lotte’s investment plans and seek new business avenues to stem losses in China.\nShares in its flagship retailer, Lotte Shopping, fell 0.7 percent on Wednesday versus the wider market’s 0.4 percent rise, amid concerns of a leadership vacuum.\nLotte Group declined to comment about the report.
