The Act also includes provisions for selling the tobacco bonds. \nThe authority was initially going to sell the bonds the week of Jan. 28. \nWhile the complaint focuses on the fireworks provision, it asks the court to declare the entire act unconstitutional, investors were warned in the updated offering statement. \nThe supplement said it is possible that the court could declare the state act unconstitutional, which could negatively impact the bonds and may result in the bondholders not being paid. If that happens, the supplement said legislation could be introduced to the state's general assembly to reauthorize the bonds. \nAccording to an opinion from the state's special counsel included in the supplement, \"the Bonds are conclusively presumed to be fully authorized and issued under the laws of the Commonwealth, and any person ... is estopped from questioning their validity, sale, execution or delivery by the Authority.\" \nErin Ortiz, a managing director and municipal analyst at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott, said the opinion is a step forward for the deal. \n\"I just don't know what the outcome is going to be, though it seems there are steps to indicate that this would be a valid bond issuance but there is a lingering question,\" Ortiz said. \nThe revenue bond issue, backed by Pennsylvania's share of a multi-state settlement with U.S. tobacco companies, is aimed at raising money for the current state budget. \nOn Tuesday, Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, presented a $32.9 billion budget for fiscal 2019 that seeks to increase spending 3.1 percent. \nThe proposed budget is \"likely to face headwinds\" from Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled legislature, according to a statement from Fitch Ratings on Thursday. \nWolf's executive budget includes a tax on natural gas extraction that he said would yield $248.7 million to pay for education spending of $225 million. However, the state's Republican-led legislature has rejected Wolf's previous attempts to impose a severance tax on Pennsylvania's gas industry. \n(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly; Editing by Daniel Bases and Chris Reese)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-08T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T08:17:46.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
