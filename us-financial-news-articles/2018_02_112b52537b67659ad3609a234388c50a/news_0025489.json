The government has lost its mandate,” he told a news conference.\nRajapaksa’s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) won control of 231 local councils out of a total 340 while Wickremasinghe’s centre-right United National Party (UNP) took 34 councils and the rest were split among other parties.\nSri Lanka's former President Mahinda Rajapaksa smiles during a news conference after winning the local government election in Colombo, Sri Lanka February 12, 2018.

Sri Lanka’s rupee fell 0.5 percent to hit a record low of 155.00/20 per dollar, surpassing its previous all-time low of 154.60/70 hit last week.\nRajapaksa’s campaign targeted an uptick in inflation, higher taxes imposed by the government and its moves to privatise state assets.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “To overcome this economic crisis, we are urging the government to hold parliamentary elections immediately in order to set up a stable government,” Rajapaksa said.\nAs the surprise results came out over the weekend, political analysts said there was a possibility that some lawmakers from Sirisena’s party, which performed the worst, could defect.\nRajapaksa, who was accused of corruption, nepotism, and mismanagement of the economy during his term, has since rallied his support base of rural Sinhala Buddhists to make a political comeback.\nReporting by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-12T12:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-12T13:20:08.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
