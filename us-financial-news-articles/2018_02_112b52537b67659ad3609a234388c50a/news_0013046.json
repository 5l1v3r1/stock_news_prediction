There’s a reason why whatever action we were going to take is delayed, but we do expect the causes of those delays to go away,” he added.\nDeutsche Bank earlier on Friday posted its third consecutive annual loss in 2017, taking a hit from challenging markets, a drop in investment bank revenue and a U.S. tax reform, after a difficult fourth quarter.\nCryan added that no large divestitures were planned beyond the flagged merger of its retail business with Postbank and the flotation of its asset manager DWS.\n“It’s a lot of tidying up, which we intend to do”, he said.\nIn 2017, Deutsche Bank among other sold its Polish retail business, while plans to pull out of Spain, Portugal and Belgium did not get off the ground.\nReporting by Arno Schuetze; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T17:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:32:37.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
