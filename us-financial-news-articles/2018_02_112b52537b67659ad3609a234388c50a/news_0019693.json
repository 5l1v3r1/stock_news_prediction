I would like to see the sanctions eventually be lifted and have Cambodia being cooperative and taking back their repatriation cases,” he said. \nCambodia stopped accepting Cambodian nationals sent from the United States last year saying it wanted to negotiate an agreement on human rights grounds first.

REUTERS/Samrang Pring \nCambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has criticized the United States over the deportations and has accused Washington of breaking up the families of those deported. \nThe United States has said that the restrictions were applied in accordance with U.S. Homeland Security rules. \nChum Sounry, a spokesman for Cambodia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, declined to comment on Friday. \nHun Sen, a close ally of China, has taken a series of measures against U.S. interests in the last year, from ending joint military exercises to expelling a naval aid unit and forcing a U.S.-funded pro-democracy group to leave.
