Analysts had on average forecast earnings of C$1.99 per share, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data showed.\nRBC reported net income of C$3 billion ($2.4 billion), up 7 percent. That included a writedown of C$178 million as a result of a tax overhaul in the United States.\nThe bank’s core personal and commercial banking division produced a 10 percent rise in net income to C$1.5 billion, benefiting from a 6 percent increase in sales of residential mortgages despite concerns over Canada’s housing markets.\nRBC said it was too early to assess the impact of stricter rules on mortgage lending introduced in January.\nReporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Jane Merriman and Bernadette Baum\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-23T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T13:38:04.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
