February 8, 2018. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Gregory Scruggs Pedestrians are among the most vulnerable road users, accounting for 22 percent of 1.25 million global road deaths per year, the number one killer of people aged between 15 and 29, according to the World Health Organization.\nSome 90 percent of road deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, according to the U.N. agency.\nBut some cities are making progress in creating a more pedestrian-friendly environment, the ITDP found. One key indicator it uses to measure this is the density of blocks.\nJoe Chestnut stands at a crosswalk on February 10 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Thomson Reuters Foundation/Gregory Scruggs Smaller blocks reduce walking distances and the need to make a dangerous mid-block crossing, as well as slowing down cars.\nAmong 22 cities the ITDP has already analyzed, Manila performed best on block density, at 37 per square kilometer. Nairobi had the lowest score, with 5 blocks per square km, while Kuala Lumpur had 17.7 blocks per square km.\n“Kuala Lumpur is like any other big city,” said Neil Khor of Think City, a local government-backed urban regeneration agency. “It has a long way to go.”\nThink City works with Malaysian cities to build pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, but Khor said the car still dominates.\n“That is the mindset we are hoping to address,” he said.\nExamples of urban redevelopment that have improved walkability include Mexico City’s Reforma 222 shopping center, which offers easy access on foot from offices and homes, the ITDP said.\nAnother is Central Saint Giles in London, a high-end retail destination with parking reserved solely for disabled people, encouraging pedestrian access, according to the institute.\nReporting by Gregory Scruggs.
