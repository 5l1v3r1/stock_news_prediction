Net profit in the full year dropped 16 percent to 7.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.76 billion), well short of the 9.625 billion average poll estimate.\n$1 = 0.9275 Swiss francs Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Michael Shields\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T17:14:43.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
