(NYSE: WTS) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\n“We delivered a very good fourth quarter, which built upon the strong execution and results achieved throughout 2017,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert J. Pagano Jr. “As expected, sales in the fourth quarter increased organically, both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by solid performance in the Americas and Europe. We leveraged our incremental sales into higher operating income, while achieving the benefits from our transformation initiatives.”\nSales for the fourth quarter and the full year were $366 million and $1.46 billion, up 7% and 4%, respectively, as compared to the similar periods of 2016. Net loss per diluted share (EPS) for the fourth quarter and net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(0.07) and $2.12, respectively, as compared to $0.51 and $2.44 for the prior-year periods. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.74 and $3.02, respectively, as compared to $0.64 and $2.67 for the prior-year periods. GAAP results were negatively impacted by the estimated charge relating to the Tax Act. Adjusted EPS for the quarter and full year improved due to strong operating performances in the Americas and Europe. A summary of fourth quarter and full year financial results is as follows:\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Summary (In millions, except per share information) Fourth quarter ended December 31, Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Sales $ 366.3 $ 342.0 7 % $ 1,456.7 $ 1,398.4 4 % Net (loss) income (2.3 ) 17.5 73.1 84.2 Diluted net (loss) income per share $ (0.07 ) $ 0.51 $ 2.12 $ 2.44 Special items 0.81 0.13 0.90 0.23 Adjusted earnings per share (2) $ 0.74 $ 0.64 16 % $ 3.02 $ 2.67 13 % (2) Special items and adjusted earnings per share represent non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP\nitems please see the tables attached to this press release.\n“We finished 2017 with some momentum, culminating in double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the fourth quarter and the year, and solid adjusted operating margin expansion,” said Mr. Pagano. “We successfully completed our transformation efforts and realized the expected benefits of portfolio rationalization, footprint optimization and global sourcing, while simultaneously reinvesting for future growth. With these efforts completed, we will continue to focus on reinvigorating growth through new product development, geographic expansion and key account management. These initiatives should drive top-line growth and margin expansion in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights:\nSegment Update\nOrganic sales were up 3% compared to the fourth quarter last year; adjusted operating margin increased 50 basis points. Regionally:\nAmericas: Organic sales increased 3% with growth in plumbing, drains and water quality products partially offset by a slight reduction in heating and hot water products. Adjusted operating margin increased 90 basis points, as benefits from higher volume, productivity and transformation savings were offset in part by anticipated growth investments. Europe: Organic sales were up 5% driven by continued strength in our drains business and solid growth in water and plumbing products. Adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points driven by increased volume and productivity, including benefits from restructuring programs. APMEA: Organic sales decreased 1%, driven by planned product rationalization, which negatively impacted sales by 10%. Our product rationalization efforts represent the exit of low-margin, non-core products. Adjusted operating margin decreased 350 basis points, due to a decline in affiliate volume and higher growth investments. The Company recorded a net tax expense of $25.1 million 1 , or $(0.73) per share, during the fourth quarter related to the Tax Act, which includes a charge for deemed repatriation of cumulative earnings and profits, net of a credit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The Company will continue to finalize its analysis of the tax reform provisions in 2018.\nCash Flow and Capital Allocation\nFor 2017, operating cash flow was $156 million and net capital expenditures were $29 million, resulting in free cash flow of $127 million. In 2016, operating cash flow was $138 million, net capital expenditures were $36 million and free cash flow was $102 million. The Company repurchased approximately 63,000 shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $4.6 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. For 2017, approximately 278,000 shares were purchased at a cost of approximately $18 million, which offset dilution from our stock compensation programs. Approximately $38 million remains available for stock repurchases under the current stock repurchase program, which has no expiration date.\nFor a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items and a statement regarding the usefulness of these measures to investors and management in evaluating our operating performance, please see the tables attached to this press release.\nWatts Water Technologies, Inc. will hold a live webcast of its conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year end results for 2017 on Tuesday, February 13, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. EST.

We believe that these financial measures enhance the overall understanding of our historical financial performance and give insight into our future prospects. Adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margins, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share eliminate certain expenses incurred and gains recognized in the periods presented that relate primarily to our global restructuring programs, deployment costs, other long-lived asset impairment charges, acquisition related costs, gains on acquisition and disposition, debt issuance related costs, the related income tax impacts on these items, the effect of the Tax Act and other tax adjustments. Management then utilizes these adjusted financial measures to assess the run-rate of the Company’s operations against those of comparable periods. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures from period-over-period comparisons. Management believes reporting organic sales growth provides useful information to investors, potential investors and others, and allows for a more complete understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. Free cash flow and the net debt to capitalization ratio, which are adjusted to exclude certain cash inflows and outlays, and include only certain balance sheet accounts from the comparable GAAP measures, are an indication of our performance in cash flow generation and also provide an indication of the Company's relative balance sheet leverage to other industrial manufacturing companies. The cash conversion rate of free cash flow to net income is also a measure of our performance in cash flow generation. These non-GAAP financial measures are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating our cash flow generation and our capitalization structure. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay certain compensation-based incentives. For these reasons, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures can be useful to investors, potential investors and others. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
