Specialty health care includes behavioral, dental, disease and medical management, stop loss and pharmacy-related products and services.\nFinancial Results (dollars in millions, customers in thousands): Year Three Months Ended Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 Premiums and Fees $ 7,326 $ 6,857 $ 7,197 $ 29,041 Adjusted Income from Operations 1 $ 397 $ 406 $ 575 $ 2,173 Adjusted Margin, After-Tax 6 4.8% 5.2% 7.1% 6.7% As of the Periods Ended December 31, September 30, Customers:\n2017 2016 2017 Commercial 15,420 14,631 15,332 Government 487 566 484 Medical 2 15,907 15,197 15,816 Behavioral Care 7 26,849 25,790 26,636 Dental 15,801 14,981 15,776 Pharmacy 8,960 8,461 8,959 Medicare Part D 821 972 812 Global Health Care delivered attractive results in 2017, led by organic growth and strong margins in our Commercial business. The medical customer base 2 at the end of 2017 totaled 15.9 million, an organic increase of more than 700,000 customers during the year, driven by strong growth across our Commercial market segments. Fourth quarter 2017 premiums and fees increased 7% relative to fourth quarter 2016, driven by Commercial customer growth and specialty contributions, partially offset by lower enrollment in our Government business, as expected. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted income from operations 1 and adjusted margin, after-tax 6 reflect strong medical and specialty contributions, continued effective medical cost management, strategic investments for long-term growth, and expected seasonally higher medical costs. Adjusted income from operations 1 for full year 2017 and 2016 included favorable prior year reserve development on an after-tax basis of $112 million and $7 million, respectively. The Total Commercial medical care ratio 8 (“MCR”) of 79.9% for full year 2017 and 84.3% for fourth quarter 2017 reflect strong performance and effective medical cost management in our employer business, the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, and expected seasonally higher fourth quarter medical costs. The Total Government MCR 8 of 84.9% for full year 2017 and 83.4% for fourth quarter 2017 reflect solid performance in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D businesses. The Global Health Care operating expense ratio 8 of 20.9% for full year 2017 and 22.2% for fourth quarter 2017 reflect the impact of the health insurance tax moratorium, business mix changes and continued investments in strategic initiatives. Global Health Care net medical costs payable 9 was approximately $2.45 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.26 billion at December 31, 2016.\nGlobal Supplemental Benefits\nThis segment includes Cigna’s global individual supplemental health, life and accident insurance business, primarily in Asia, and Medicare supplement coverage in the United States.\nFinancial Results (dollars in millions, policies in thousands):\nYear Three Months Ended Ended December 31, September 30, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 Premiums and Fees 10 $ 987 $ 842 $ 937 $ 3,707 Adjusted Income from Operations 1 $ 81 $ 63 $ 109 $ 369 Adjusted Margin, After-Tax 6 7.9% 7.2% 11.1% 9.5% As of the Periods Ended December 31, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 Policies 10 13,138 12,151 13,087 Global Supplemental Benefits delivered outstanding results in 2017, reflecting the value of our differentiated health and life solutions for individual consumers provided through diversified distribution channels. Fourth quarter 2017 premiums and fees 10 grew 17% over fourth quarter 2016, reflecting continued business growth. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted income from operations 1 and adjusted margin, after-tax 6 reflect business growth and favorable claims experience, particularly in South Korea.\nGroup Disability and Life\nThis segment includes Cigna’s group disability, life and accident insurance operations.\nFinancial Results (dollars in millions):\nYear Three Months Ended Ended December 31,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2017 Premiums and Fees $ 1,020 $ 1,035 $ 1,015 $ 4,088 Adjusted Income (Loss) from Operations 1 $ 61 $ 69 $ 73 $ 285 Adjusted Margin, After-Tax 6 5.5% 6.1% 6.6% 6.4% Group Disability and Life results reflect the value created for our customers and clients through differentiated solutions that enhance health, productivity and sense of security.

Actual results may differ materially depending on a number of factors. Investors are urged to read the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included in this release. Management does not assume any obligation to update these estimates.\nThis quarterly earnings release and the Quarterly Financial Supplement are available on Cigna’s website in the Investor Relations section ( http://www.cigna.com/aboutcigna/investors ). Management will be hosting a conference call to review fourth quarter 2017 results and discuss full year 2018 outlook beginning today at 8:30 a.m. EST. A link to the conference call is available in the Investor Relations section of Cigna's website located at http://www.cigna.com/cignadotcom/aboutcigna/investors/events/index.page .\nThe call-in numbers for the conference call are as follows:\nLive Call\n( 888) 324-7575 (Domestic)\n( 210) 234-0013 (International)\nPasscode: 2012018\nReplay\n( 888) 566-0596 (Domestic)\n( 203) 369-3072 (International)\nIt is strongly suggested you dial in to the conference call by 8:15 a.m. EST.\nNotes:\n1.\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations is defined as shareholders’ net income (loss) excluding the following after-tax adjustments: net realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Special items are identified in Exhibit 2 of this earnings release.\nAdjusted income (loss) from operations is a measure of profitability used by Cigna’s management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna’s businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders’ net income. This consolidated measure is not determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders’ net income. See Exhibits 1 and 2 for a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders’ net income.\n2.\nGlobal medical customers include individuals who meet any one of the following criteria: are covered under a medical insurance policy, managed care arrangement, or service agreement issued by Cigna; have access to Cigna's provider network for covered services under their medical plan; or have medical claims and services that are administered by Cigna.\n3.\nManagement is not able to provide a reconciliation to shareholders’ net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders’ net income could vary materially.\n4.\nThe Company’s outlook excludes the potential effects of any share repurchases or business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release. Also, the Company’s outlook reflects the impact of the adoption of the new revenue accounting standard (ASU 2014-09) effective January 1, 2018. The Company’s fourth quarter 2017 financial supplement dated February 1, 2018 includes a comparison of 2017 and 2016 key income statement line items and ratios as reported, and as revised under the new standard. Additional information regarding the Company’s adoption of the standard will be available in the Company’s 10-K expected to filed on February 28, 2018.\n5.\nThe measure “consolidated operating revenues” is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, “total revenues.” We define consolidated operating revenues as total revenues excluding realized investment results. We exclude realized investment results from this measure because our portfolio managers may sell investments based on factors largely unrelated to the underlying business purposes of each segment. As a result, gains or losses created in this process may not be indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated operating revenues to total revenues.\n6.\nAdjusted margin, after-tax, is calculated by dividing adjusted income (loss) from operations by operating revenues for each segment.\n7.\nPrior period behavioral care customers have been revised to conform to current presentation.\n8.\nOperating ratios are defined as follows:\n•\nTotal Commercial medical care ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for all commercial risk products, including medical, pharmacy, dental, stop loss and behavioral products provided through guaranteed cost or experience-rated funding arrangements in both the United States and internationally.\n•\nTotal Government medical care ratio represents medical costs as a percentage of premiums for Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid products.\n•\nGlobal Health Care operating expense ratio represents operating expenses excluding acquisition related amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue in the Global Health Care segment.\n9.\nGlobal Health Care medical costs payable are presented net of reinsurance and other recoverables. The gross Global Health Care medical costs payable balance was $2.72 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $2.53 billion as of December 31, 2016.\n10.\nCigna owns a 50% noncontrolling interest in its China joint venture. Cigna's 50% share of the joint venture’s earnings is reported in Other Revenues using the equity method of accounting under GAAP. As such, the premiums and fees and policy counts for the Global Supplemental Benefits segment do not include the China joint venture.\n11.\nThe measure “consolidated adjusted tax rate” is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, “consolidated effective tax rate.” We define consolidated adjusted tax rate as the income tax rate applicable to the Company’s pre-tax income excluding net realized investment results, net amortization of other acquired intangible assets and special items. Management is not able to provide a reconciliation to the consolidated effective tax rate on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results and (ii) future special items.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release, and oral statements made with respect to information contained in this release, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
