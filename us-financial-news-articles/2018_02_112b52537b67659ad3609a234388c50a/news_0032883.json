It does not own any of the buses but rather works with local and regional partners.\nEngert affirmed plans for FlixBus to expand to the United States this year, where it will compete with companies such as Megabus, operated by Britain’s Stagecoach Group and the famous Greyhound bus line.\n“We believe that the American market offers a lot of potential for FlixBus,” he said.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Biju Dwarakanath\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:47:02.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
