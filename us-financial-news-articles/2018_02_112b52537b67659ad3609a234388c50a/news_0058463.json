Philadelphia captured its sixth straight victory overall. It was the 12th straight game in which the Flyers earned at least one point, a stretch in which they are 10-0-2.\nNeither team generated much offense in a first period that saw the Flyers control most of the offensive play, outshooting the Canadiens 10-3.\nMrazek made a strong save on Paul Byron at 17:33 of the second period to keep the game scoreless when the left winger nearly cashed in on a give-and-go play with Phillip Danault.\nThe Czech goalie sprawled across the crease and made a stick save as Byron’s shot nearly slipped by him in the period’s best scoring chance.\nThe Capitals took their sixth loss in the last nine games with a 5-1 drubbing in Columbus, giving the Flyers the chance to climb into the division’s top spot.\nEarlier in the day, Philadelphia claimed veteran defenseman Johnny Oduya off waivers from the Ottawa Senators, though he was scratched Monday night. Oduya, 36, was a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2013 and 2015.\nMontreal was playing without veteran center Tomas Plekanec, who was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Sunday.\nAlso, the Canadiens dealt defenseman Joe Morrow to the Winnipeg Jets on Monday as the 3 p.m. trade deadline neared.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:43:58.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
