Daily Helsingin Sanomat later reported that some members of the company’s management team had sold options before it went public about the issue.\n“The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) has opened a criminal investigation into suspected securities market offences related to tyres manufactured by Nokian Tyres plc and the tyre test results in different magazines,” the police said in a statement on Friday.\nThe company’s view is that no crime had occurred, a spokesman told Reuters.\n“It is good that the matter will be resolved,” he said.\nNokian shares fell 6.8 percent in early trade on Friday.\nNokian Tyres has said the use of special tyres happened in the past but they have discontinued the practice and that their tests in its main markets have been reliable for years.\nIt had launched an internal investigation into the matter in October 2015, and the reported option trades took place in October and November 2015, before the company went public with the past practices.\nNokian earlier on Friday said its fourth-quarter operating profit rose 13 percent from a year earlier and that it expected growing sales and profits for this year.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl and Tuomas Forsell; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-02T16:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:24:40.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
