(\"GPNC\" or the \"Company\") (OTC: GPNC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Pacific Premier Bancorp (\"PPBO\") (NASDAQ: PPBI). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, GPNC shareholders will be entitled to receive 0.475 of a share of PPBI for each GPNC share they own. According to the acquisition announcement, this represents consideration of $18.57 based upon PPBI's trading price prior to the announcement.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether GPNC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the Company's shares traded for $20.00, or $1.43 above the per-share consideration, on the date the exchange ratio was fixed.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether GPNC shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own GPNC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/grandpoint-capital-inc/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-grandpoint-capital-inc-merger-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-gpnc-shareholders-300600316.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP", "external_links": ["http://www.weisslawllp.com/grandpoint-capital-inc/", "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-grandpoint-capital-inc-merger-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-gpnc-shareholders-300600316.html"], "published": "2018-02-17T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-17T02:01:57.027+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
