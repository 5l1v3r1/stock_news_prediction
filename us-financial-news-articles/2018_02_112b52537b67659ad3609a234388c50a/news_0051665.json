REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo But he said that a debt-fueled “purchasing frenzy” binge by deal-hungry chief executives is making that task very difficult.\n“Price seemed almost irrelevant to an army of optimistic purchasers,” Buffett said. “The ample availability of extraordinarily cheap debt in 2017 further fueled purchase activity.”\nBerkshire on Saturday reported a record quarterly and annual profit, benefiting from a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate.\nFourth-quarter net income increased roughly fivefold to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier.\nReporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Mark Potter and Diane Craft\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T16:22:32.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
