Some of the arguments he invoked were unproved local media allegations of misconduct.\nPresident Klaus Iohannis, who has the final say on the removal of chief prosecutors, said in a statement Toader’s report was unclear and needed analysis.\n“The president has repeatedly said he was satisfied by the activity of DNA and its leadership, an opinion he continues to have,” the statement said. ‘YOU‘RE NOT GETTING AWAY WITH IT’\nDNA has investigated lawmakers, ministers, mayors, magistrates and businessmen in recent years, exposing conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and the award of state contracts in exchange for bribes.\nIt has sent over 70 members of parliament to trial since 2006. The speakers of parliament’s lower house and senate are both currently on trial in separate cases.\nIn a news conference last week, Kovesi defended DNA against attacks by some of those currently on trial, saying she would have no reason to resign if she was asked to.\n“This attack isn’t about Kovesi, it is about the prosecutors who have done their job. It aims to make the Romanian state kneel, humiliate society and the Romanian people,” she said.\nHundreds of protesters gathered outside government headquarters following Toader’s news conference, chanting “You’re not getting away with it”.\nMore were joining them and demonstrations also broke out in at least three other cities, according to social media postings by participants.\n“In case there were people doubting the justice minister was not a political actor, this evening has clarified that,” said Sergiu Miscoiu, political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University.
