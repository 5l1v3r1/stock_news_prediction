It would be 500-feet tall once completed, and will stand as “a symbol for long-term thinking,” the Amazon founder said in a tweet.\nBezos is one of several financial backers of the 10,000 year clock, which is being built by the non-profit cultural institute, the Long Now Foundation. One of the foundation’s objectives is to foster the notion of long-term critical thinking in today’s age of rapid-fire online communications and fast-paced living.\nUnlike conventional clocks, the 10,000 year clock is not designed to keep track of seconds, minutes, or hours. Instead, it’s been designed to tick once a year for approximately 10,000 years.\nInstallation has begun—500 ft tall, all mechanical, powered by day/night thermal cycles, synchronized at solar noon, a symbol for long-term thinking—the #10000YearClock is coming together thx to the genius of Danny Hillis, Zander Rose & the whole Clock team!
