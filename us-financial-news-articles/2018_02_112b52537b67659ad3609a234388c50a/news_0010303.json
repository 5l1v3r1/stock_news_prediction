The 'Hermes' of pot \nBeboe is a California-based luxury cannabis line that some have called the \"Hermes of Marijuana.\" The company was founded by celebrity tattoo artist Scott Campbell and longtime fashion executive Clement Kwan, and feature key pot economy products like designer vaporizer pens, edible pastilles, and other curios expected to roll out this year. Beboe Luxury Cannabis Products : Edible Pastilles \nBeboe products are sold through 65 stockists across California as well as via full-service medical marijuana delivery. The edible pastilles retail for $25, while the pre-filled vaporizers retail for $60 a piece.
