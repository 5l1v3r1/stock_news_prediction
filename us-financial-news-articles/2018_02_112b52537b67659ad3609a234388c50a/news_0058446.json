He suggested AmEx, which has a smaller market share than Visa and Mastercard, doesn’t have the market power necessary to impose anticompetitive terms. He also said AmEx card rewards provided notable benefits to consumers.\n“My question is, do you have any evidence that, on a net basis, consumers pay more” because of the AmEx rules, Justice Gorsuch said. “I don’t believe you have,” he told Ohio State Solicitor Eric Murphy. \nJustice Gorsuch spoke about 30 times during the session.\nThe outcome of the case wasn’t clear, because a majority of justices didn’t signal their views and both sides received tough questions from the court.\nAmEx lawyer Evan Chesler said the fees that merchants pay the company fuel benefits for consumers.\n“Every reward, every seat on a plane to Aruba, every ticket to a Billy Joel concert, every cash-back reward that’s given is a price discount to the consumer,” he said.\nMr. Murphy from Ohio said AmEx’s rules “raised the prices that all four credit-card companies charge merchants.”\nThe Supreme Court’s review comes after a federal appeals court in 2016 ruled for AmEx and threw out the government’s case.\nThe Justice Department and a group of states first sued AmEx in 2010, an early headline case for Obama-era antitrust enforcers. They won a trial court ruling that barred the company’s rules, but then lost at the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nThe department under Trump administration leadership declined to seek Supreme Court review after the appellate loss, but on Monday it supported the states’ position and urged the justices to revive the case.\nThe case has high stakes for AmEx’s business model but also could have broader ramifications for other companies that have multisided business platforms, especially in the tech sector.\nLike AmEx, many leading technology companies have markets in which they do business with end-use consumers on one side of their business and with merchants and advertisers on the other.\nA decision is expected by the end of June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T04:29:29.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
