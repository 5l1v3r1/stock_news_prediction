The 12 had quit Yameen’s ruling party last year, and allowing them to return to the legislature would deprive him of a majority.\nThe crisis poses the biggest threat to Yameen’s control of the Maldives since he took power in 2013, defeating Nasheed in an election that Nasheed’s supporters say was rigged.\nYameen has stopped short of saying he will not obey the court order to free his opponents. He told a party meeting on Saturday he “did not expect the Supreme Court ruling at all”.\n“We’ve started dialogue with the Supreme Court. We’ve sat and started talking about difficulties or concerns the state has,” he said. “We’re working on making sure we can respect the court order in a way that doesn’t cause any difficulties to the people.”\nHe fired the chief of police on Thursday shortly after the court order was handed down, and on Saturday he fired the acting police chief he had chosen to replace him.\nThe director of the Maafushi prison also resigned his post on Saturday amid disagreement among staff over whether to release the opposition leaders, an official at the Maldives Correctional Services (MCS) told Reuters. An MCS spokesman was not immediately available to comment.\nOPPOSITION “DEEPLY FEARFUL”\nHundreds of opposition supporters chanted slogans such as “Enforce the Supreme Court ruling,” and “Defend the constitution,” in a Friday night rally outside the opposition MDP campaign center in Male, the capital.\nThe joint opposition said in a statement it was “deeply fearful that the government’s refusal to implement the Supreme Court order could escalate to unrest and incite violence across the country.”\nThe Maldives, an Indian Ocean island chain of around 400,000 people known to outsiders mainly as a tropical paradise for the tourists that provide most of its foreign exchange income, has experienced political unrest since Yameen took power.\nYameen is the half brother of Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ruled the Maldives for three decades until losing an election to Nasheed in 2008. Yameen and Gayoom have since had a falling out and Gayoom is now aligned with the opposition.\nParliament Secretary General Ahmed Mohamed told Reuters that parliament intended to reinstate the 12 legislators as required by the court. He also said Speaker Abdulla Maseeh Mohamed had asked to cancel this year’s opening session of parliament scheduled for Monday, citing security reasons.\nThe United Nations, the United States, the European Union and India have urged Yameen’s government to follow the court ruling.\n“We understand the situation is extremely tense,” Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters on Friday.\nAdditional reporting and writing by Shihar Aneez; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Peter Graff\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-03T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T06:27:09.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
