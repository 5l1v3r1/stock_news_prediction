The earnings per share for the full year 2017 were $0.98 compared to $1.30 per share for 2016. The enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) resulted in a reduction in diluted earnings per share of $0.27 for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nClarence H. Smith, chairman, president and CEO, said, “Our earnings for the fourth quarter reflect the impact of below plan sales and the Tax Act. Our sales and in-home designer teams have increased our average ticket for the 13 th straight quarter, however generating store traffic remains challenging.\nWe believe the beneficial effects of the Tax Act will begin to be realized by individuals and companies during the next few months. The reduction in corporate tax rates will mean our estimated effective tax rate for 2018 will be 25% compared to 38%. We will be using some of these tax savings to increase Havertys’ match of employee contributions to our 401(k) Plan, enhance employees’ medical flexible reimbursement accounts, and increase starting hourly wages.\nWe ended the year with a strong cash position which allows us flexibility in our capital deployment. The data from recently completed research on our customer is being reviewed and guiding marketing and merchandising plans in key markets. Our teams feel a renewed sense of accountability and energy as we work to drive sales, increase margins, improve execution, and satisfy our customers.”\nFinancial Highlights\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nAs previously reported, net sales decreased 2.6%. On a comparable store basis, sales were down 3.5%. Total written sales were up 0.3% and written comparable store sales decreased 0.7% over the same period last year. Average written ticket increased 2.2% over last year’s quarter and custom upholstery written business rose 11.5%. Gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 54.1%. There was a $0.7 million increase in the LIFO reserve in 2017 versus a $0.8 million decrease in 2016, a negative change of $1.5 million or 69 basis points. Selling, general and administrative costs fell $0.9 million and as a percent of sales increased 90 basis points to 48.2% from 47.3%. Fixed and discretionary expenses decreased $0.6 million. The components of this change include: a $0.9 million increase in advertising and marketing expenses; a $0.7 million increase in depreciation, rent and other occupancy costs; and a $2.0 million decrease in administrative costs primarily from reduced medical benefit costs and incentive compensation. Variable expenses were 18.6% as a percent of sales in 2017 compared to 18.2% in 2016 as delivery costs rose and sales from our in-home design program increased. Other income in 2017 includes $1.9 million in gains from insurance recoveries related to a damaged store in Wichita, KS and claims related to Hurricane Irma. Tax expense was increased by $5.9 million for the enactment of the Tax Act which increased our effective tax rate to 79.2% and reduced diluted earnings per share $0.27.\nTwelve Months ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Same Period of 2016\nAs previously reported, net sales totaled $819.9 million, compared with $821.6 million in 2016, representing a decrease of 0.2%. Comparable store sales decreased 1.3%. Average written ticket was up 2.1 % and custom upholstery written business increased 5.5%. Gross profit margin increased 30 basis points to 54.3% from 54.0%. Our LIFO inventory valuation method generated a $2.7 million or 33 basis points negative impact in 2017. Selling, general and administrative costs as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points to 49.1% from 48.6% as expenses were well controlled but with the decline in sales not as leveraged. Fixed and discretionary expenses increased $3.3 million to $253.2 million. This increase was driven by greater depreciation, rent, and other occupancy costs totaling $3.7 million and greater advertising and marketing expenses of $2.9 million. These were partially offset by $3.0 million lower administrative costs resulting in part from lower medical benefit costs. Other income in 2017 includes $2.9 million in gains from insurance recoveries related to damaged store locations in Lubbock, TX and Wichita, KS and claims related to Hurricane Irma. Tax expense was increased $5.9 million for the enactment of the Tax Act which increased our effective tax rate to 51.2% and reduced diluted earnings per share $0.27. We increased our quarterly cash dividend 25% in the third quarter to $0.15 per common share. Our retail store count remained at 124 as we opened one store in a new market, opened two replacement stores, and closed an underperforming store.\nExpectations and Other\nTotal written sales for the first quarter to date are up approximately 1.7% over the same period last year and written comparable store sales are up 0.9%. Total delivered sales for the first quarter to date are down 1.7% and comparable store sales decreased 2.4% over the same period last year. Our gross profit margin for the full year of 2018 is expected to be 54.7% compared to 54.3% in 2017. First half gross profit margin is projected to be 20 basis points lower than the average for 2018, with the second half running approximately 20 basis points higher. Fixed and discretionary type expenses within SG&A are expected to be in the $258 to $260 million range for 2018, up approximately 2.3% over those same costs in 2017. The increase is largely due to increased marketing expenses, higher occupancy costs from new and relocated stores, increases in employee group medical costs, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and inflation. Fixed and discretionary type expenses in total should average $65.3 million per quarter, excluding the second quarter which is expected to be $2.0 million lower. For 2017 these expenses averaged $64.0 million per quarter in all but the second quarter which was $60.9 million. Variable SG&A expenses for 2018 are anticipated to be 18.5% as a percent of sales, somewhat higher than in 2017 due to increases in personnel costs. Our effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be 25% excluding any changes in our 2017 provision related to the Tax Act and the impact from the vesting of stock-based compensation awards. Planned capital expenditures for 2018 are $20.0 million which include opening a store in a new market in the fourth quarter. We also have store closures planned in the first and second half of the year. Retail square footage is expected to decline 1.4% in 2018. The 150,000 square-foot expansion of our Western Distribution Center is expected to be completed in the second quarter.\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.

Our diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.27 for both the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands - Unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017 2016\nASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 79,491 $ 63,481 Restricted cash and cash equivalents 8,115 8,034 Accounts receivable 2,408 4,244 Inventories 103,437 102,020 Prepaid expenses 11,314 8,836 Other current assets 5,922 7,500 Total current assets 210,687 194,115 Accounts receivable, long-term 254 462 Property and equipment 229,215 233,667 Deferred income tax 12,375 18,376 Other assets 8,798 7,885 Total assets $ 461,329 $ 454,505 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 20,501 $ 25,662 Customer deposits 27,813 24,923 Accrued liabilities 37,582 41,904 Current portion of lease obligations 3,788 3,461 Total current liabilities 89,684 95,950 Lease obligations, less current portion 50,803 52,013 Other liabilities 26,700 24,671 Total liabilities 167,187 172,634 Stockholders’ equity 294,142 281,871 Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 461,329 $ 454,505\nHAVERTY FURNITURE COMPANIES, INC.

The Tax Act’s other major changes applicable to Havertys include the elimination of certain deductions and an enhanced and extended option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property.\nIn December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date.\nWe re-measured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 25%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of some of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. At December 31, 2017, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and recorded additional tax expense of $10.6 million. This provisional amount is primarily related to depreciation deductions and as we complete our analysis of the Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the IRS and other standard-setting bodies, the provisional amount may be adjusted. We expect to complete our analysis no later than the fourth quarter of 2018 which is within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. We also recognized a tax benefit of $4.7 million for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for which our accounting is complete. The total of these adjustments was additional deferred tax expense of $5.9 million and is what we believe is the impact of the Tax Act.\nSG&A Expense Classification\nWe classify our SG&A expenses as either variable or fixed and discretionary. Our variable expenses are comprised of selling and delivery costs. Selling expenses are primarily compensation and related benefits for our commission based sales associates, the discount we pay for third party financing of customer sales and transaction fees for credit card usage. We do not outsource delivery so these costs include personnel, fuel, and other expenses related to this function. Fixed and discretionary expenses are comprised of rent, depreciation and amortization and other occupancy costs for stores, warehouses and offices, and all advertising and administrative costs.\nConference Call Information\nThe company invites interested parties to listen to the live audiocast of the conference call on February 21 at 10:00 a.m. ET at its website, havertys.com under the investor relations section.
