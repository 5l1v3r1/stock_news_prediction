They are scheduled to appear at a court hearing on Friday in Riverside, about 60 miles (97 km) east of Los Angeles.\nThe fundraising drive for the 13 siblings began with an outpouring of donations from local residents, organizers say, after police raided the family’s home on Jan. 14 and disclosed that some of the adult children were so malnourished they appeared to be minors.\nThe family lived in the suburban Riverside County community of Perris, where some neighbors reported they had seen only a few of the 13 siblings, who police say ranged in age from 2 to 29.\nSoon after the police raid, the Riverside University Health System Foundation, which is leading the fundraising campaign, was receiving donations sent by express mail for the children, such as clothing and books, said Nicole Orr, a senior director at the foundation.\n“It is all about this community wanting to show these kids love,” Orr said.\nDonations have come from as far away as Germany and Australia and continue to arrive, she said.\nThe foundation has raised nearly $370,000, Orr said. The Corona Chamber of Commerce, which is also located in Riverside County, has collected another $180,000 for the foundation, said Linda Richards, who handles member services for the chamber.\nThe funds will be used to provide medical and dental care, educational assistance and other services for the siblings, Orr said. The foundation will continue to accept donations indefinitely, she said.\nDavid and Louise Turpin are accused of keeping their 13 children in filthy and fetid conditions, chaining some to their beds and using starvation as a weapon to control them.\nEach parent faces 94 years to life in prison if convicted on more than two dozen charges.\nDavid and Louise Turpin each pleaded not guilty to the charges last month.\nReporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Leslie Adler\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-21T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T00:12:16.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
