Higher costs were a conscience decision to lay the groundwork for long-term growth, he said. \nLow costs have enabled the bank to offer its checking accounts for free, stealing market share from its competitors. \nING-Diba will continue to offer free accounts “as long as possible”, Chief Executive Officer Nick Jue said. “We certainly won’t impose fees this year.” \nThe Frankfurt-based subsidiary now has more than 9 million customers and ranks as the No. 3 retail bank in Germany, behind behemoths Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank CBKG.DE>. \nGermany’s retail banking sector, however, remains fragmented with hundreds of savings banks and cooperatively owned lenders having a combined market share of about 70 percent. \n“We want to become one of the leading universal banks in Germany,” Jue said.
