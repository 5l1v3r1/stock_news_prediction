Let us be very clear,” he said.\nShares of Altice accelerated their fall after his comments and were down by 5.6 percent at 1311 GMT.\nFrance’s telecoms sector, hit by a price war following the entrance of low-cost player Iliad in 2012, has been the subject of takeover speculation in recent years.\nBut Bouygues Telecom has said it can prosper on its own and has responded with a turnaround plan including job cuts and a focus on the rollout of its 4G network and fixed-line broadband, helping it win new customers.\nOn Wednesday, Orange said growth in annual sales helped to lift its operating earnings and convince management to increase the annual dividend for 2018 by five cents.\nOrange boss Stephane Richard has also ruled out leading new talks between French telecom operators, with a view to cutting the number of players from four to three.
