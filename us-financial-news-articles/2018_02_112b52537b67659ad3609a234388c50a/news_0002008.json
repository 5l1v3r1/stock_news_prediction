It is only two rounds so the tournament is not over yet. I want to focus day by day and hole by hole.” \nBertasio grabbed a share of the lead from the last group of the day, making eight birdies to reach 11-under overall. \nEngland’s Chris Paisley, who had held a one-shot lead at the end of the opening round, made sure he built on the strong start with a 69 to join the group in the second spot. \nHeading into the weekend, 22 players were within three shots of the lead, with the cut-line sitting just seven shots behind the leaders.
