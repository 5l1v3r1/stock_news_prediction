We have not come to any conclusion yet but this is something we are looking at very closely,” Eric Schulz told a news conference at the Singapore Airshow. \nIt marked the first public appearance in the new role by Schulz, the replacement for legendary Airbus sales boss John Leahy, who retired last month after a strong end-of-2017 sales push that helped it beat rival Boeing Co in the annual orders race.
