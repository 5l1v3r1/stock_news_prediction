The greenback tumbled as worries over twin deficits in the United States mounted amid a government spending splurge and large corporate tax cuts.\nThe pound gained 0.5 percent to trade at $1.4072 and its best level since Feb. 5.\nAgainst the euro, the pound was up 0.2 percent to 88.79 pence per euro.\n“This is largely a dollar story today,” said Jane Foley, London-based FX strategist at Rabobank.\nFoley said we would need “to see very strong earnings data” next week to push sterling, in the absence of further dollar weakness, much higher and back towards the $1.4346 it hit in January, its highest level since the vote to leave the European Union in June 2016.\nAnalysts at ING said the period leading up to the late March EU leaders’ summit would be noisy for sterling but the pound’s “relative resilience is telling of a different Brexit trading environment to what we saw in 2017”.
