In comparison, the mine produced 23,470 ounces of gold and 5.96 million ounces of silver last year.\nHochschildâ€™s core earnings fell 8.6 percent to $300.8 million in 2017, hurt by higher costs and its continued spending on brownfield exploration projects. Revenue rose about 5 percent to $722.6 million.\nThe company set aside $10 million for greenfield exploration projects in 2018.\nHochschild forecast all-in-sustaining-costs (AISC) of about $960-$990 per gold equivalent ounces, above the $910 it recorded last year.
