I have decided to step aside to allow new leadership to take the organisation forward.” \nRegan came in for criticism and questioning from his colleagues for his handling of the search for a new Scotland manager. Northern Ireland boss Michael O‘Neill was courted but turned down the position last month. \nThe SFA said chief operating officer Andrew McKinlay will manage the day to day business while it searches for a new chief executive. \nFormer Scotland assistant coach Mark McGhee told talkSPORT radio station on Thursday that Strachan should succeed Regan in the role.
