This change in our investment strategy is a vital step on that journey.\"\nThe University of Edinburgh said it had around £1 billion of funds under management, with investments in fossil fuels representing less than 1 percent of that total. Monday's decision marks the institution's latest attempt to burnish its environmental credentials. In 2015, it removed £2.5 million of investment from businesses involved in coal and tar sands.\nIn 2013, it became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment, a United Nations-backed initiative looking to boost the sustainability of the global financial system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T14:07:35.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
