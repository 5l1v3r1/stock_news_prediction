I was in amazing shape, the course was really technical and fun, the sort of course I like,” Schleper said.\n“I skied a little bit cautiously because we decided we wanted to get to the finish.”\nSchleper came 39th in the women’s giant slalom on Thursday, sporting the Mexican Alpine team’s skull-covered uniform which is inspired by the country’s “Day of the Dead” holiday.\n“The financial support isn’t the same with Mexico, but really this still feels almost like a first Olympics for me. We’ve worked so hard for it...,” Schleper added.\n”I’ve been married to my (Mexican) husband for 10 years so I feel legitimately Mexican.\n“I speak Spanish, my kids are Mexican. There’s not as much depth in the Mexican team but it’s a team full of passion, and love, and we just love the sport, and love to be here to represent this beautiful country that I‘m now part of.”\nReporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T11:19:52.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
