Scotch: It’s not for girls. Or at least that’s the trope Diageo is looking to shatter in a new marketing push that will see it create a version of its Johnnie Walker scotch brand— Jane Walker —in the hope of attracting more female drinkers to the traditionally masculine scotch category. I know the perfect accompaniment: Bartender! A bag of your finest Lady Doritos, please. What do you mean you don’t have them in stock ?! (Fun fact: Adweek reports Diageo had initially looked at running a Jane Walker push in 2016 , were Hillary Clinton elected as the first female U.S. president. The March 2018 launch will coincide with Women’s History Month and International Women’s Day.)\nTake To the Sky The upheaval of the media and telecom power players has taken another dramatic twist: Comcast has submitted a tentative £22.1 billion ($30.9 billion) offer for all of Sky , topping 21st Century Fox’s offer to consolidate its ownership of Europe’s biggest pay-TV operator, The Wall Street Journal reports. Acquiring Sky would immediately bolster Comcast’s international presence and distribution, and deny Disney one of the most attractive assets it agreed to acquire as part of a $52.4 billion deal with Fox. There were signs Comcast was unhappy with losing out to Fox on that blockbuster Disney deal: the Journal reported recently that Comcast could revive its pursuit for Fox or go after a particular asset — with Sky as one likely candidate. Comcast CEO Brian Roberts said the addition of Sky would increase the company’s international revenue from 9% to 25% of the total. Now, eyes will be on Fox and Disney and whether a counter-bid is in the offing. Fox has had a tough time getting its bid to acquire the 61% of Sky it doesn’t already own approved by U.K. regulators, which have raised concerns over media plurality. Comcast would probably face fewer regulatory hurdles. (Reminder: 21st Century Fox and WSJ parent News Corp share common ownership.)\nSticking To Their Guns As we mentioned in yesterday’s newsletter, a bunch of companies have ended their affiliations with the National Rifle Association in the past week, amid social media pressure in the wake of the tragic school shooting in Parkland, Fla. Some brands with NRA ties have yet to respond, but on Monday FedEx made an unusually specific statement . FedEx said its positions on gun policy differ from the NRA’s, but the company added it would not discontinue its discounted rate program for the association because it will not “discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.” Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett also weighed in on Monday , saying in an interview that while his company does not invest in any gun manufacturers, it would be “ridiculous” to say it’s not going to do business with people who own guns. Mr. Buffett, a Democrat who sits on the advisory board of Everytown for Gun Safety, added it would be a mistake to try to impose his personal views on an organization and its shareholders. “I’m not their nanny.”\nI Can’t Help Falling in Love With You Ask most media buyers or media partners about their positions on Twitter, and they’ll generally comment about the friendliness of its teams and the company’s willingness to foster good working relationships. Case in point: Business Insider reports “ media companies are falling back in love with Twitter .” That declaration comes after Facebook’s algorithm tweak to de-emphasize “passive” content and its flip-flopping over projects like Facebook Live led media companies to reassess their pivots to video. Twitter may not have the scale of Facebook, nor the type of creative canvas offered by a platform like Snapchat, but it does have a unique position around “live,” which is appealing to news brands like Bloomberg and sports leagues that have signed up to the company’s Amplify commercial video program. What’s more, media execs say the partnership feels genuinely two-way. As one media exec tells BI, “They seem to care if we actually make money.”\nThat’s Meta A little newsletter exclusive : You might remember Snap acquired Metamarkets, an ad-tech startup that provides real-time programmatic analytics, in November. It turns out Snap’s corporate development team has already been meeting with interested parties, looking to take the business off its hands. In buying Metamarkets, Snap gained a group of engineers and some useful intellectual property to help it build its programmatic and its multi-cloud analytics capabilities. Metamarkets, which counts Oath and Twitter among its biggest clients, has also continued to run as an independent operation from Snap in San Francisco and New York City. Oath and Twitter are obviously also big Snap competitors, so you can see why another business might be pitching for the remaining Metamarkets commercial operation. Snap didn’t disclose the price of the Metamarkets deal ( TechCrunch reported “less than $100 million” at the time .) Regulatory filings indicate that acquisitions in Snap’s fourth quarter amounted to less than $40 million in cash and recorded liabilities. But that disclosure doesn’t include the stock grants that people familiar with the deal said were included in the Metamarkets agreement.\nBest of the rest How consumer goods companies are grappling to get themselves heard on voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa.
