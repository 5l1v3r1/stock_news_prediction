However, some EU leaders hope that the SPD may bring Merkel closer to Macron, an independent who was a minister in the previous Socialist government in Paris.\nJuncker aide Selmayr noted that the lengthy coalition agreement included German positions on a range of EU policy areas, including the digital single market, defense cooperation, online privacy, copyright and the environment.\nManfred Weber, who leads Merkel’s center-right allies in the European Parliament, tweeted: “Good signal from Berlin to the people and whole Europe: the future German government is ready to contribute to a stronger and better Europe. This is a clear pro European approach and an answer to populists.”\nReporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Kevin Liffey; @macdonaldrtr\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-07T19:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-07T13:31:19.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
