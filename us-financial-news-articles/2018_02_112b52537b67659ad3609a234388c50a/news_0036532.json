The Nikkei share average has surrendered all of its year-to-date gains and is now down about 5 percent.\n“Investors were spooked by sharp drops in U.S. shares and unloaded risky assets,” said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities. “The excessive risk averse mood may have eased, but they haven’t turned risk on yet.”\nConversely, trust banks, which manage corporate pension trusts and national pension fund trusts, bought a net 194.7 billion yen in Japanese stocks. They were net buyers of Japanese cash stocks for the third consecutive week.\nAs for cash stocks, retail investors bought a net 746.7 billion yen, the highest since October 1987.\nThe Nikkei ended 1.2 percent higher at 21,720.25 on Friday.\n(This story has been refiled to correct word in second paragraph)\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-16T09:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T09:38:01.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
