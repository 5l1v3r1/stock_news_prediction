REUTERS/Axel Schmidt/File Photo Its operations have been carved up among rivals, including Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) and easyJet ( EZJ.L ), but an inventory of objects owned by the airline is being sold in a process organized by the Dechow auction house.\nA 4.8 meter-long model Boeing 737 plane went for 7,800 euros ($9,721), while items such as umbrellas were picked up for around 30-40 euros. The chocolate hearts that Air Berlin used to hand out at the end of each flight went for as much as 352 euros for a box of 100.\nIn three further auctions that run until Feb. 16, fans can pick up retro-style messenger bags, deck chairs and beach balls with the Air Berlin logo, plus more model planes in various sizes.\nIt is not clear whether staff uniforms, including those worn by pilots, can be sold. The auction house is currently in talks with aviation authorities as to whether they can be offered to the public because they have official markings and selling them could contravene security regulations.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Catherine Evans\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T23:53:03.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
