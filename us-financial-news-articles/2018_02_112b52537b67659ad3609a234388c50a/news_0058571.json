Rivals were blocked from launching their own versions of the drug until the patents expired or were invalidated in court.\nIn 2016 Mylan asked the patent board to invalidate the Restasis patents, saying they described obvious ideas.\nMylan also asked a federal judge in Texas to invalidate the patents.\nThe tribe agreed in September to take legal ownership of the patents and license them back to Allergan in exchange for ongoing payments.\nAfter announcing the deal the tribe asked the patent board to dismiss the Mylan challenge, saying entities with sovereign immunity cannot face litigation without their consent.\nAllergan has said the patent board is a flawed and unfair forum. The drug company said it would not object to the patents being reviewed in federal court.\nU.S. lawmakers from both political parties have criticized Allergan’s maneuver, with one U.S. senator introducing a bill to ban attempts to take advantage of tribal sovereignty.\nThe patent board said in Friday’s ruling that tribal immunity does not apply to patent review proceedings.\nThe tribunal also said Allergan had retained an ownership interest in the challenged patents so the proceedings could continue without the tribe’s participation.\nIn October the federal judge in Texas invalidated the Restasis patents instead of waiting for the board to rule, rendering Allergan’s move largely meaningless.\nReporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-26T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-26T20:13:38.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
