Summarizing data from hundreds of scientific studies, that report also said e-cigarettes are likely to be far less harmful than regular tobacco cigarettes.\nPHE called on smokers and health authorities to act now on the evidence reviewed in these latest reports.\nAny smoker who has struggled to quit should try switching to an e-cigarette and get professional help, it said, adding: “The greatest quit success is among those who combine using an e-cigarette with support from a local stop smoking service.”\nIt also called on Britain’s National Health Service to ensure e-cigarettes are available in hospital shops along with other nicotine replacement products such as gum and lozenges.\nThe UK campaign group Action on Smoking and Health welcomed the report, saying it was part of a growing scientific consensus that e-cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco.\n“We hope this reports will...encourage the 40 percent of smokers who’ve failed to quit but never tried vaping to go ahead and switch,” it said in a statement.\nAdditional reporting by Martinne Geller Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T02:15:23.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
