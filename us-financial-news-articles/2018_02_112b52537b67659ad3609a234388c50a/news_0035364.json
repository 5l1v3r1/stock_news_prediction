It will release more detailed results on Feb. 23.\nOn the year, Europe’s biggest economy expanded a calendar-adjusted 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, the data showed. This was weaker than the consensus forecast of 3.0 percent but still the strongest pace of growth since the second quarter of 2011.\nFILE PHOTO: Containers and cars are loaded on freight trains at the railroad shunting yard in Maschen near Hamburg, Germany, September 23, 2012. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer/File Photo The office confirmed an earlier estimate for full-year GDP growth of 2.2 percent in 2017 which translated into a calendar-adjusted rate of 2.5 percent. This was the strongest pace since 2011.\nING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said the economy grew in 33 of the last 36 quarters, at an “impressive” average rate of 0.5 percent on the quarter.\n“Judging from previous cycles, the economy could continue its current pace for at least one or two more years, without showing signs of overheating,” he said.\nSeparate data from the Statistics Office showed that inflation remained subdued despite the solid upswing.\nConsumer prices, harmonized to compare with other European countries, fell by 1.0 percent in January from the previous month and rose by 1.4 percent from the previous year.\nOn a non-harmonized basis, consumer price inflation for January was also confirmed. The national index fell 0.7 from December and rose by 1.6 percent on the previous year.\nThe weak German inflation data is lending support to the European Central Bank’s cautious approach to reducing its unprecedented monetary stimulus.\nReporting by Michael Nienaber; Editing by Paul Carrel and John Stonestreet\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-14T15:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:11:37.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
