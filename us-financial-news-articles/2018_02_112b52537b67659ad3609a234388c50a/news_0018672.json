The company sells almost all of its vertical video ads through a process called programmatic ad buying — in other words, automated software programs that auction off ad spots to the highest bidder. The problem for Snap thus far has been that many of its auctions don't have much competition, meaning that there aren't enough advertisers bidding for the ads, and those that are using the service are getting the ads on the cheap, since few other advertisers (or no other advertisers) are bidding against them.\nMore advertisers would mean more competition, and theoretically, higher ad prices and more revenue for the company. On Snap's last earnings call, when the company reported better-than-expected results, CFO Andrew Vollero called Snapchat's ad auction \"the engine that drove the growth in the fourth quarter.\"\nIt's also impossible to ignore the thinly veiled swipe at Instagram, which is without a doubt Snapchat's biggest competitor. (Remember when Instagram stole Snapchat's Stories idea?) The program is technically open to advertisers who bought vertical video ads anywhere else online, but Instagram is the most likely place Snap will find new targets.\nSnap has offered ad credits to lure in advertisers before. It has a program called Snap Accelerate that gives special deals to VC-backed startups that want to advertise on Snapchat. It also offered ad credits and discounts to advertisers shortly after its IPO.\nSnap is fresh off its best quarter as a publicly traded company. The company claimed more than $285 million in revenue when it reported Q4 earnings this week, up 72 percent on the same quarter last year.\nSnap stock is up more than 50 percent on the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T20:16:33.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
