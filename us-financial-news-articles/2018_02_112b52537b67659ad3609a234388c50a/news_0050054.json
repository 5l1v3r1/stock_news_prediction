FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was largely flat at $1,323.73 an ounce at 0108 GMT, a day after it fell to its lowest in a week at 1,322.20. The precious metal has dropped 1.7 percent so far this week. * U.S. gold futures were down 0.3 percent at $1,328.1 per ounce. * The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.2 percent at 90.156. * The dollar rose to an over one-week peak on Wednesday, extending its recovery from last week, helped by the Fed minutes and by higher short-term Treasury yields. * The more upbeat take on inflation in the minutes of the Jan. 30-31 policy meeting released on Wednesday will likely further cement expectations that new Fed chief Jerome Powell will lead his colleagues in raising interest rates next month. * That led investors to narrow the odds on faster hikes with a host of Fed fund futures hitting contract lows. Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for this year, compared to two as recently as December. * Some U.S. central bankers are sticking to their view that aggressive policy tightening is unnecessary. * The Bank of England could end up needing to raise interest rates faster than investors expect, its chief economist told lawmakers on Wednesday, striking a slightly more hawkish tone than his central bank colleagues. * Euro zone business growth remained robust this month, with companies at their most optimistic in more than five years, a private-sector survey showed, despite indications higher prices and a stronger currency were taking a toll. * Asian shares slipped on Thursday as the risk of faster hikes in U.S interest rates lifted short-term Treasury yields. * Venezuela is preparing a new cryptocurrency called \"petro gold\" that will be backed by precious metals, President Nicolas Maduro said on Wednesday, a day after launching an oil-backed token that has been panned as a pipe dream by blockchain experts.
