The mining fleet uses diesel. Porgera is co-owned by China’s Zijin Mining Group.\nState-owned Ok Tedi said that a landslip blocking roads would likely take several days to clear, but did not comment on any direct impact to operations.\n“Maintenance work on the damaged pipes will begin as soon as road access is restored and spare pipes are transported to the location,” it said in a statement.\nEarly estimates are that it will take at least several days to clear the road to allow for normal traffic flow, with work due to start on Tuesday morning, it said.\nEarthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. Part of PNG’s northern coast was devastated in 1998 by a tsunami, generated by a 7.0 quake, which killed about 2,200 people.\nExxonMobil said on Monday it had shut its Hides gas conditioning plant and that it believed administration buildings, living quarters and a mess hall had been damaged.\nGas is processed at Hides and transported along a 700 km (435 miles) line that feeds a liquefied natural gas plant near Port Moresby for shipping.\nPNG oil and gas explorer Oil Search said in a statement on Monday it had also shut production in the quake-affected area.\nReporting by Melanie Burton and Sonali Paul; editing by Richard Pullin\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T02:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T02:39:31.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
