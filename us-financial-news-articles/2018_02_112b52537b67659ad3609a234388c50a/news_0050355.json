REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo His approach contrasts with that of previous Chinese investors in German technology companies - such as Midea ( 000333.SZ ), which bought Kuka ( KU2G.DE ) or Weichai ( 000338.SZ ), which bought a large stake in Kion ( KGX.DE ) - who have tended to engage in lengthy consultation with stakeholders.\nBerlin said it saw no need to take any action over Geely’s purchase, either in terms of competition rules or of foreign investment rules.\n“It is a company decision,” a government spokesman said. “Due to the character of the investment as a minority stake, there is no need to act.”\nThe government declined to comment on a report in German tabloid Bild am Sonnntag that Li would visit the German chancellery for a “secret meeting” with Angela Merkel’s economic adviser on Tuesday.\nDaimler also declined to comment on any possible meetings with Li.\nGeely said it wants an alliance with Daimler, which is developing electric and self-driving vehicles and is the only German carmaker not to be controlled by a family, to respond to the challenge from new rivals such as Tesla ( TSLA.O ) and Uber.\n($1 = 6.3329 Chinese yuan renminbi)\nReporting by Andreas Rinke; Writing by Madeline Chambers and Georgina Prodhan.
