In its new capacity the company will continue to offer lamp recycling products and services worldwide based on three recycling programs:\nBulb Eater® - Designed and manufactured for facilities that dispose of large quantities of lamps, the Bulb Eater crushes spent fluorescent bulbs into small fragments and compresses the waste into 55-gallon drums. Each Bulb Eater unit is built around a filtration system that ensures both OSHA and EPA compliance, and greatly reduces costs associated with the storage, handling and recycling of the lamps. EasyPak™ Recycling Program – The EasyPak recycling program is an alternative for customers who generate smaller quantities of spent lamps, batteries, and/or ballasts. Available in a variety of sizes, the EasyPak boxes are shipped by customers, through pre-paid UPS Ground transportation services, to recycling centers for processing. National Bulk Recycling – Designed to offer nationwide bulk pick-up and recycling services for companies with large amounts of intact lamps, ballasts, batteries, electronic waste and the crushed lamps generated by the Bulb Eater. Once the waste has been recycled, a Certificate of Recycling confirming the proper handling of the waste will be provided.\n\"Federal EPA regulations on fluorescent and mercury vapor lamps require non-residential facilities to properly dispose of their lamps,\" said Bobby Farris, General Manager of TerraCycle Regulated Waste. \"This acquisition puts the company in a unique position to meet those regulated waste needs, as well as offer our clients a vast range of other voluntary and customized recycling services.\"\nThe timing of this announcement coincides with TerraCycle US Inc. being qualified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue shares in a Regulation A offering to raise up to $25 million. The company will use the proceeds to expand its existing programs and acquire additional companies it believes will thrive within its broad array of recycling and consumer engagement services. With the SEC qualification of the Regulation A offering, now any category of investor can invest in TerraCycle's U.S. operating company and participate in its future.
