The suspect who was killed had entered Turkey illegally and received training from a branch of the Syrian Kurdish PYD group, the governor’s office said.\nTurkey considers the YPG, the armed wing of the PYD, to be an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which has waged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast.\nTurkey’s military launched an incursion into northern Syria’s Afrin region against the U.S.-backed YPG militia two weeks ago.\nAnkara Governor Ercan Topaca said three people had sustained light injuries from flying debris at the scene of Thursday’s explosion.\nImages from the scene showed extensive damage to the building’s facade. Windows of nearby cars were blown out and debris was strewn in the street.\nThe building had been empty except for security personnel at the time of the blast, local media said.\nReporting by Umit Bektas and Tuvan Gumrukcu; editing by Andrew Roche\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-02T19:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T19:41:28.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
