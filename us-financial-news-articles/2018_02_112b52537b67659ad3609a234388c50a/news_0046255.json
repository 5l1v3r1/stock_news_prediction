(NYSE: DPZ), the largest pizza company in the world based on global retail sales, announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, comprised of strong growth in same store sales, global store counts and earnings per share. Domestic same store sales grew 4.2% during the quarter versus the year-ago period, and 7.7% for the full year, continuing the positive sales momentum in the Company's domestic business. The international division also posted positive results, with same store sales growth of 2.5% during the quarter and 3.4% for the full year. The fourth quarter marked the 96 th consecutive quarter – or 24 th year – of positive international same store sales growth and the 27 th consecutive quarter of positive domestic same store sales growth. The Company also had fourth quarter global net store growth of 422 stores, comprised of 96 net new domestic stores and 326 net new international stores. In fiscal 2017, the Company opened 1,045 net new stores, comprised of 216 net new domestic stores and 829 net new international stores.\nFourth quarter diluted EPS was $2.09, up 41.2% over the prior year quarter; fiscal 2017 diluted EPS was $5.83, up 35.6% over the prior year. Fiscal 2017 diluted EPS, as adjusted, was $5.91, up 37.4% over the prior year diluted EPS of $4.30.\nOn February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a 55-cent per share quarterly dividend for shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018 to be paid on March 30, 2018. This represents an increase of approximately 20% over the previous quarterly dividend amount.\n\"Without question, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 performance – with results that continued to outpace the industry,\" said J. Patrick Doyle, President and Chief Executive Officer . \"Our 2017 global retail sales growth and domestic comps outperformed the high-end of our stated three to five-year outlook. This, along with tremendous net store growth and an incredibly low number of closures, helps validate that our long-term fundamental strength is well intact heading into 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2017 Highlights:\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nFourth\nQuarter of\n2017\nFourth\nQuarter of\n2016\nFiscal\n2017\nFiscal\n2016\nNet income\n$\n93.3\n$\n72.7\n$\n277.9\n$\n214.7\nWeighted average diluted shares\n44,593,094\n49,090,074\n47,677,834\n49,923,859\nDiluted earnings per share, as reported (1)\n$\n2.09\n$\n1.48\n$\n5.83\n$\n4.30\nItems affecting comparability (2)\n—\n—\n0.08\n—\nDiluted earnings per share, as adjusted (1) (2)\n$\n2.09\n$\n1.48\n$\n5.91\n$\n4.30\n(1) In the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, (ASU 2016-09), which requires the Company to record excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the income statement, whereas they were previously recognized in equity. See the \"Adoption of New Accounting Guidance\" section on page three for additional information.\n(2) Refer to the Items Affecting Comparability section on page four for additional details. See also the Comments on Regulation G section on page five.\nRevenues were up 8.8% for the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher supply chain revenues from increased volumes. Higher royalties derived from our retail sales in both our international and domestic markets also contributed to the increase in revenues. Consolidated revenues also benefited from the positive impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Net Income increased 28.3% for the fourth quarter versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an increase in global royalty revenues as well as higher supply chain volumes. The adoption of the new equity-based compensation accounting standard also positively impacted net income by approximately $6.8 million. See the \"Adoption of New Accounting Guidance\" section on page three for additional information. Additionally, the pre-tax gain on the sale of certain domestic Company-owned stores to franchisees in the fourth quarter resulted in a $4.0 million decrease to our consolidated general and administrative expenses. These increases were partially offset by a pre-tax $5.3 million increase in net interest expense for the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year as a result of higher net debt levels following our 2017 recapitalization transaction. Diluted EPS was $2.09 for the fourth quarter versus $1.48 in the prior year quarter. This represents a 61-cent or 41.2% increase over the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by higher net income, as well as lower diluted share count, primarily resulting from share repurchases.\nThe table below outlines certain statistical measures utilized by the Company to analyze its performance.

As previously announced, Domino's Pizza, Inc. will hold a conference call today at 10 a.m. (Eastern) to review its fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results. The call can be accessed by dialing (888) 400-9978 (U.S./Canada) or (706) 634-4947 (International). Ask for the Domino's Pizza conference call. The call will also be webcast at biz.dominos.com . The webcast will also be archived for one year on biz.dominos.com .\nAdoption of New Accounting Guidance\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-09 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This standard addresses accounting for income taxes and forfeitures and the cash flow presentation of share-based compensation. The adoption resulted in a $6.8 million decrease in our fourth quarter 2017 provision for income taxes, or a 5.0 percentage point decrease in our fourth quarter 2017 effective tax rate, due primarily to the recognition of excess tax benefits for options exercised. For fiscal 2017, the adoption resulted in a $27.2 million decrease in our provision for income taxes, or a 6.8 percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate. This item positively impacted our diluted EPS by approximately 15 cents and 57 cents in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017, respectively. Refer to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information regarding the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\"). Under this new accounting standard, the Company has determined that there are not separate performance obligations associated with the franchise advertising contributions received by Domino's National Advertising Fund (\"DNAF\") and, as a result, these franchise contributions and the related expenses will be presented gross in the Company's consolidated statement of income. The Company expects this change to have a material impact on its total revenues and expenses beginning in fiscal 2018. However, this impact will generally be an offsetting increase to both revenues and expenses such that the impact on income from operations and net income, if any, is not expected to be material. The Company will also present the activity associated with DNAF on a gross basis in the statement of cash flows beginning in fiscal 2018. Refer to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information regarding the anticipated impact of adoption of ASC 606.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") was enacted. The 2017 Tax Act includes many changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. While the impact of the 2017 Tax Act was not material to the Company's 2017 financial statements, based on preliminary estimates, we anticipate it will significantly lower our effective tax rate in future periods. Refer to the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for additional information regarding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company repurchased and retired 937,026 shares of its common stock under its open market share repurchase program, including 659,807 shares received at final settlement of our previously disclosed $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase program. The remaining 277,219 shares were repurchased and retired during the fourth quarter for approximately $51.5 million at an average price of $185.89 per share. During fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased and retired a total of 5,576,249 shares of its common stock for approximately $1.06 billion at an average price of $190.85 per share. The Company had approximately $198.5 million remaining under its $1.25 billion authorization for share repurchases as of December 31, 2017.\nOn February 14, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program to repurchase up to $750.0 million of the Company's common stock. This repurchase program replaces the remaining availability of approximately $198.5 million under the Company's previously approved $1.25 billion share repurchase program.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nThe Company's reported financial results for fiscal 2017 are not comparable to the reported financial results for the equivalent period in 2016. The table below presents certain items that affect comparability between 2017 and 2016 financial results. Management believes that including such information is critical to the understanding of its financial results for fiscal 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 (see the Comments on Regulation G section on page five for additional details).\nIn addition to the items in the table below, the Company had lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding in 2017 that resulted in an increase in diluted EPS of approximately 18 cents in the fourth quarter of 2017 and approximately 24 cents in fiscal 2017. The Company also incurred higher net interest expense in 2017 primarily as a result of higher net debt levels. The increase in net interest expense resulted in a decrease in diluted EPS of approximately seven cents in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2017\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nPre-tax\nAfter-tax\nDiluted EPS\nImpact\n2017 items affecting comparability:\nRecapitalization expenses:\n expenses (1)\n$\n(622)\n$\n(389)\n$\n(0.01)\nInterest expense (2)\n(264)\n(165)\n(0.00)\nDebt issuance cost write-off (3)\n(5,521)\n(3,450)\n(0.07)\nSubtotal\n(6,407)\n(4,004)\n(0.08)\nTotal of 2017 items\n$\n(6,407)\n$\n(4,004)\n$\n(0.08)\n(1) Represents legal, professional and administrative fees incurred in connection with the Company's 2017 recapitalization.\n(2) Represents interest expense the Company incurred on its 2012 debt subsequent to the closing of the 2017 recapitalization but prior to the repayment of the 2012 debt, resulting in the payment of interest on both the 2012 and 2017 facilities for a short period of time.\n(3) Represents the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of the 2012 debt in connection with the Company's 2017 recapitalization.\nThree to Five-Year Outlook\nThe Company does not provide quarterly or annual earnings estimates. The following outlook does not constitute specific earnings guidance. In January 2018, the Company reaffirmed its three to five-year outlook as follows:\nCurrent\nOutlook\nDomestic same store sales growth\n3% – 6%\nInternational same store sales growth (1)\n3% – 6%\nNet unit growth\n6% – 8%\nGlobal retail sales growth (1)\n8% – 12%\n(1) Excluding foreign currency impact\nLiquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately:\n$35.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents; $3.15 billion in total debt; and $128.3 million of available borrowings under its $175.0 million variable funding notes, net of letters of credit issued of $46.7 million. The Company has collateralized $36.7 million of its letters of credit with restricted cash, and has the ability to access this cash with minimal notice.\nThe Company invested $90.0 million in capital expenditures during fiscal 2017, versus $58.6 million in fiscal 2016. Free cash flow, as reconciled below to net cash provided by operating activities, as determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), was approximately $249.0 million in fiscal 2017.\n(In thousands)\nFiscal 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n339,036\nCapital expenditures\n(90,011)\nFree cash flow\n$\n249,025\nComments on Regulation G\nIn addition to the GAAP financial measures set forth in this press release, the Company has included non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, including free cash flow metrics and measures related to items affecting comparability between fiscal quarters and other fiscal periods. The Company has also included metrics such as global retail sales growth and same store sales growth, which are commonly used statistical measures in the quick-service restaurant industry that are important to understanding Company performance.\nThe Company uses \" Diluted EPS, as adjusted ,\" which is calculated as reported Diluted EPS adjusted for the items that affect comparability to the prior year periods discussed above. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP is Diluted EPS. The Company believes that the Diluted EPS, as adjusted, measure is important and useful to investors and other interested persons and that such persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between reporting periods. The Company uses Diluted EPS, as adjusted, to internally evaluate operating performance, to evaluate itself against its peers and in long-range planning. Additionally, the Company believes that analysts covering the Company's stock performance generally eliminate these items affecting comparability when preparing their financial models, when determining their published EPS estimates and when benchmarking the Company against its competitors.\nThe Company uses \" Global retail sales \" to refer to total worldwide retail sales at Company-owned and franchise stores. The Company believes global retail sales information is useful in analyzing revenues because franchisees pay royalties that are based on a percentage of franchise retail sales. The Company reviews comparable industry global retail sales information to assess business trends and to track the growth of the Domino's Pizza ® brand. In addition, supply chain revenues are directly impacted by changes in franchise retail sales. Retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the Company by its franchisees and are not included in Company revenues.\nThe Company uses \" Same store sales growth ,\" which is calculated by including only sales from stores that also had sales in the comparable period of the prior year. International same store sales growth is calculated similarly to domestic same store sales growth. Changes in international same store sales are reported excluding foreign currency impacts, which reflect changes in international local currency sales.\nThe Company uses \" Free cash flow ,\" which is calculated as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures, both as reported under GAAP. The Company believes that the free cash flow measure is important to investors and other interested persons, and that such persons benefit from having a measure which communicates how much cash flow is available for working capital needs or to be used for repurchasing debt, making acquisitions, repurchasing common stock, paying dividends or other similar uses of cash.\nAbout Domino's Pizza ®\nFounded in 1960, Domino's Pizza is the largest pizza company in the world based on retail sales, with a significant business in both delivery and carryout pizza.
