The South China Morning Post reported that Hong Kong Express said the memo had been issued to provide relevant details about the fleet and operations to its cockpit crew.\nAirbus on Thursday said it was assessing the impact the engine issue would have on 2018 deliveries.\nPratt & Whitney did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The engine maker on Monday said it would discuss the potential affect of the problem on 2018 engine production after regulators respond to its proposed fix.\nReporting by Jamie Freed; Editing by Himani Sarkar and Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-15T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T09:53:09.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
