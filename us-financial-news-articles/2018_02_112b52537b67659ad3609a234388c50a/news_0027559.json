They are under no obligation to do so for tests showing the bacteria in the environment but must provide the results if asked to do so.\nAsked to confirm that positive Lactalis self-checks had not been handed to the authorities, he replied: “That’s it”.\n“What’s unfortunate, is that there was no questioning by the company about the fact that it was still amazing to find a Salmonella Agona several times over the years after it was found in 2005,” Dehaumont said.\nMore than 200 babies in France have been contaminated with Salmonella Agona since 2005, including 38 between mid-August and December last year, as well as 25 between 2006 and 2017 and 141 in 2005, said the Institut Pasteur, a French organization that monitors micro-organisms and diseases.\nReporting by Sybille de La Hamaide and Gus Trompiz, editing by David Evans\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T20:55:53.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
