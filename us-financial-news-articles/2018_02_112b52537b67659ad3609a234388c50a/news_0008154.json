He was freed on bond on Thursday.\nThe government took three private television channels off the air on Tuesday as they began to cover of the opposition ceremony. They remained off the air on Friday despite a court order on Thursday that overturned the government-ordered shutdown.\nThe government was not served with the court order on Thursday afternoon because of a delay at the court registrar’s office, Okiya Omtatah, an activist who filed the High Court case and won the lifting of the suspension, told Reuters.\n“As soon as we serve the order this morning I expect the stations to be back on,” he said. “If not they’ll (the government) be in contempt of court.”\nOdinga says last year’s elections, won by President Uhuru Kenyatta, were rigged.
