The Topix Small dropped 1.2 percent.\nSelling was broad-based, with about three-quarters of about 2,000 shares listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s main board in the red while only about one-fifth made gains.\nThe rise of the yen to a five-month high against the dollar is also clouding the outlook for Japanese exporters’ earnings.
