They said in August that Ivanishvili was suing Credit Suisse.\nProsecutor Yves Bertossa told reporters on Friday he would not comment on the bank’s role in the matter because it was the subject of a parallel procedure.\nLescaudron’s sentence matched what prosecutors had sought.\nVAST FORTUNES Lescaudron amassed personal wealth of 32 million francs, including houses in Switzerland and the Italian seaside resort of Porto Cervo, and a Picasso lithograph.\nHis assets, including the Ferrari, a Rolex watch and jewels that the judge said had been financed by his crimes, were seized among items listed in a seven-page sequestration.\nHe was ordered to make repayments totaling more than $130 million, but was not barred from future work in banking.\nThe Porto Cervo house was seized, but the Lescaudrons were allowed to keep their family home in Arzier, Switzerland.\nLescaudron has already spent two years in pre-trial detention, where the court heard he cooperated on the case and exhibited “exemplary behavior.”\n“The sentence is very harsh,” Lescaudron’s lawyer Simon Ntah said, adding he hoped the sentence would be commuted for good behavior so Lescaudron could be released in April 2019.\n($1 = 0.9389 Swiss francs)\nReporting by Stephanie Nebehay and Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Michael Shields, Catherine Evans and Mark Potter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T11:28:35.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
