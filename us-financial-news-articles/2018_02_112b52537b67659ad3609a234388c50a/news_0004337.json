McMaster, who said there was already evidence of Russian meddling in Mexican elections set for July. \nMcMaster did not give details of the alleged interference. \nTillerson made no reference to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election won by President Donald Trump. That involvement included people in Russia buying 3,000 U.S. political ads and placing 80,000 Facebook posts seen by 126 million Americans over two years, Facebook has said.
