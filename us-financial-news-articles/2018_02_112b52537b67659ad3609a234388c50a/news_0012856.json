However, the New York Stock Exchange listing will only be available to institutional investors . \nIt is still not clear what user metrics Spotify will have to disclose when it floats. Last month the Swedish company said it had 70 million paid subscribers around the world. Apple (aapl) told the Journal it has 36 million. \nHowever, neither company publicly discloses its country-level subscriber numbers. Apple also does not break out its Apple Music-derived earnings from those of its broader services segment.
