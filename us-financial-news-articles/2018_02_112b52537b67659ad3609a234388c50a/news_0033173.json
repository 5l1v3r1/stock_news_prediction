With the addition of cloud and hypervisor agnostic Cloud Workspace ® Suite software, CloudJumper now delivers the most comprehensive and well-integrated WaaS portfolio available to IT service providers with features such as one-click WaaS deployment across private and public clouds (Azure, Google, and AWS). The combined synergy will drive increased margins, efficiency, and revenue opportunities for IT service providers globally.\nBy incorporating the strengths of the CWS platform, CloudJumper is uniquely positioned to expand what is possible in WaaS and cloud-based app enablement for SMBs and the enterprise. Now, IT service providers have complete implementation flexibility and control over how applications and workspaces are configured across a public, private, or hybrid cloud infrastructure to better control the costs of IT management. The expanded capabilities also allow organizations to automatically migrate from third-party VDI, DaaS, or WaaS platforms including Citrix, to the more seamless, easy to manage, and cost-effective CloudJumper solution suite.\n“Businesses today are under pressing demands to deploy IT in ways that optimize agility, productivity, and security,” said JD Helms, president of CloudJumper. “The acquisition will empower CloudJumper to deliver the most complete solution portfolio on the market and address these challenges head-on. With this innovative complement, CloudJumper will provide new perspectives on the digital transformation of business, strengthening and streamlining all aspects of client computing systems and management.”\n“We welcome the entire IIT team to the CloudJumper family as we are committed to driving Cloud Workspace Suite software innovation, enhancements, and leadership forward,” added Helms. “The combined entity provides full workspace and application lifecycle management for IT service providers with everything from initial network discovery and on-boarding, to billing and customer support. The continued evolution of this powerful platform will drive new opportunities for both our partners and the industry at large.”\nCloud Workspace Suite (CWS) software takes a vendor-agnostic approach to cloud infrastructure automation and management, allowing service providers and enterprise IT administrators to more easily execute a multi-cloud strategy while reducing the time and resources required to build and deploy solutions. The advantages in workload scheduling and scaling allow service providers to drive efficiency and margin expansion at the data center layer. The heavy investment in workflow integration and management through API enhancements is a compelling capability for IT administrators looking to unify client computing in the cloud without the limitations of onsite IT.\nCloud Workspace Suite software currently underpins CloudJumper’s Workspace as a Service delivery platform. The software is also used by IT service partners globally to deliver a powerful business-class workspace in the cloud. The solution allows for easy IT migration, scales to any size environment, and is full-featured to provide a complete cloud-based computing environment. In support of cloud-based IT initiatives, CloudJumper’s new technology portfolio will offer partners and their customers better control and access to the applications, data, and computing platforms that drive business. Partners have the ability to select their preferred cloud infrastructure vendor and can customize the service to meet a broad range of business performance, security, and compliance requirements.\n\"The acquisition of IndependenceIT (IIT) seems to be a logical move as CloudJumper continues to augment its capability to support channels seeking entry or expansion into the unified workspace segment,” said Agatha Poon, Research Director, 451 Research. “Adding IIT’s software platform to its product mix also helps the company to further its cloud-first initiative with multiple flavors – on premises, in the cloud, or hybrid model.”\nCWS will be integrated into the my.CloudJumper partner portal, featuring the company’s JumpStart ground-to-cloud onboarding and Customer Management Module (CMM) with centralized customer account oversight for CloudJumper partners. JumpStart eliminates manual onboarding procedures through automation, saving precious staff time and financial resources. CMM allows for complete end-customer account management, including the ability to add/modify accounts, manage CloudJumper’s 2,200+ cloud applications, administer server infrastructure, and much more. The game-changing capabilities are available to partners installing a full turn-key solution, deploying software or implementing in a hybrid environment.\nTweet This: @CloudJumperWaaS Acquires IndependenceIT to Create the Most\nComprehensive Cloud Application and Workspace Platform - http://bit.ly/1Ufno9F #cloud\nResources:\nContact CloudJumper today to schedule a product demonstration at: http://cloudjumper.com/contact/ Follow CloudJumper on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/CloudJumperWaaS Visit CloudJumper at: http://www.cloudjumper.com\nAbout CloudJumper\nCloudJumper is the leading Workspace as a Service (WaaS) platform provider for the agile business.
