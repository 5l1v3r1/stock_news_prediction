U.S. stock futures fell during Asian trade, stoking such fears.\nThe focus remains on U.S. stocks, which were the source of the latest turbulence in global markets and currencies.\nThe recent surge in long-term U.S. bond yields to four-year highs had helped trigger the slide in the equity market, and while yields have pulled back from those peaks, they still remain elevated.\n“The 10-year Treasury yield has nudged back ahead of today’s auction. Depending on how the auction goes, U.S. equities could face renewed pressure,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.\n“Global stocks are expected to remain on a nervous footing going forward,” Noji said.\nFollowing soft demand for a $26 billion three-year sale on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury will auction $24 billion of 10-year government bonds later on Wednesday.\nThe greenback performed slightly better against currencies as investors have sought shelter in the greenback amid the recent rout in global equities, which was triggered by a massive decline in Wall Street shares.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was a shade lower at 89.530, after reaching a two-week peak of 90.034 overnight.\nThe euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2391 after slipping to a two-week low of $1.2314 the previous day.\nWall Street shares bounced about 2 percent on Tuesday after suffering the biggest one-day sell-off in more than six years. S&P mini futures, however, were down 1 percent and pointed to a lower open for U.S. shares later in the day.\nThe Australian dollar, which tends to suffer during risk aversion, was 0.5 percent lower at $0.7868.\nThe pound was flat at $1.3951 after touching a low of $1.3838 overnight, its weakest since Jan. 19.\nThe Swiss franc, a perceived safe haven along with the yen, was 0.1 percent higher at 0.9348 franc per dollar after losing 0.45 percent overnight.
