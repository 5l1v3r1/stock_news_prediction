If suppliers cannot cover their fixed costs, there is the risk that suppliers could demand compensation payments,” Daimler said.\n“Necessary capacity expansion at suppliers’ plants could also require cost-effective participation,” Daimler added.\nDaimler created a risk management committee to oversee its suppliers in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when some smaller companies ran into cash-flow problems, forcing Daimler to step in.\nDaimler said earlier this month that its profit growth would be dampened this year by spending on new technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles.\nIn its annual report, Daimler also said that political crises and uncertainties could lead to supply bottlenecks for specific raw materials, leading to volatile prices.\n“Generally, the ability to pass on the higher costs of commodities and other materials in the form of higher prices for the manufactured vehicles is limited because of strong competitive pressure in the international automotive markets,” the annual report said.\nDaimler’s report, published on Tuesday, showed that provisions stood at 14 billion euros ($17.3 billion) at the end of 2017, 2.1 billion higher than a year earlier.\nThe Stuttgart-based carmaker did not provide a detailed breakdown of the rise but said it was primarily due to increased obligations from sales transactions, provisions for warranty obligations, and provisions relating to legal proceedings.\nDaimler is being sued by owners of diesel-engined Mercedes-Benz vehicles in the United States in a class-action suit which alleges the German carmaker used software to reduce emissions.\nDaimler views the lawsuit as being without merit, but added it could not quantify the legal risks from class-action lawsuits, the annual report showed.\nAmong the legal risks faced by Daimler is a regulatory probe tied to raids at several car manufacturers and suppliers, with regard to steel purchasing. Daimler reiterated in its report that it was cooperating in full with the authorities.\nDaimler also said in its report that Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche’s total remuneration for 2017 amounted to 8.61 million euros, an increase from 7.61 million euros a year earlier.\n($1 = 0.8099 euros)\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Keith Weir\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T17:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T17:47:12.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
