Our presence in Syria, Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon is in coordination with the governments of these countries,” Velayati said.\n“Iran is the heart of international developments ... America wants to tear down the Middle East ... Iran opposes it.”\nHe also criticised slogans such as “Let go of Palestine,” and “Leave Syria, think about us”, which were chanted by tens of thousands of Iranians protesting against Iran’s unelected clerical elite and Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East.\n“Don’t worry about what was instigated by our foreign enemies ... Chants like ‘Not Gaza, not Lebanon’ shows their lack of understanding of international affairs... You cannot remain indifferent when your neighbour’s house is on fire,” he said.\nTrump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Iran’s biggest unrest for nearly a decade which spread to around 80 towns and cities across Iran in early January.\nIranian authorities said 25 people died and over 3,000 people were arrested during the unrest, which lasted for more than a week and then subsided. Most of those arrested have been released but around 300 remain in jail facing charges, Iran’s interior minister said last week.\nIran’s elite Revolutionary Guards put down the protests, which were initially sparked by soaring food prices and high unemployement but then turned political when protesters in several cities called on the clerical rulers to step down.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T10:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T11:31:45.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
