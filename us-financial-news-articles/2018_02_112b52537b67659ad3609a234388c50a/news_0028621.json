Now there is a young leadership in Saudi Arabia and they want to finish this chapter.”\nMost UAE banks owed money had received a final judgment on their claims from UAE courts, which they had submitted for approval by the three-judge tribunal based in Khobar within Saudi’s Eastern Province, he said.\nMashreq, Emirates NBD and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank are the UAE banks with the largest claims against AHAB, according to sources familiar with the process, ranging from 1.25 billion riyals ($333.3 million) for Mashreq to 653.8 million riyals for Abu Dhabi Commercial.\nEmirates Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD’s Islamic arm, has a 76 million dirham claim against Saad Group, the sources said.\nThe banks declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.\nAll the banks had fully provisioned against the debt and any money clawed back will contribute towards bank balance sheets, al-Ghurair said.\nProfit growth for the UAE banking sector in 2018 will be about the same as last year’s 6.5 percent, al-Ghurair said.\nOne potential cloud on the horizon is that problem loans for banks in the region are expected to edge higher in 2018 after sluggish economic activity in 2017, according to forecasts by Moody‘s.\n($1 = 3.7502 riyals)\nEditing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-13T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T12:36:06.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
