The Cboe Volatility index , which is widely considered the best fear gauge on Wall Street, hit its highest levels since August 2015. \nThe expected opening plunge follows two days of steep losses. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,175.21 points to 24,345.75. Friday saw losses of 666 points after reports of rising interest rates. \nThe futures dip follows a rough night for international markets. Japan’s Nikken was off 4.73%, while China’s Hang Seng Index fell more than 5%. \nThe slide is widely seen as the result of traders worrying about future interest rate rises. U.S. jobs data sparked apprehension at the end of last week, with higher-than-expected wage increases triggering inflationary concerns. \nAll this comes after a year in which global stock markets gained 22% .
