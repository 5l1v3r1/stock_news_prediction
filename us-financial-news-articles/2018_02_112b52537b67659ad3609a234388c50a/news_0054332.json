He left the latter last year.\nThe former Soviet KGB investigator made his career under Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan’s first president, who had run the nation of 32 million from 1989 until his death in 2016.\nQodirov was detained on Feb. 23, the prosecutor general’s office said in a statement, without providing further details of the charges against him.\nThe state prosecutors’ press office said it did not know the name of the lawyer representing Qodirov, meaning it was not immediately possible to contact them for comment.\nMirziyoyev, a former prime minister, has embarked on broad economic reforms such as the liberalisation of foreign exchange regulations, and moved to curb the power of security services.\nLast month, Mirziyoyev sacked veteran state security service boss Rustam Inoyatov, completing the removal of Karimov-era officials from top positions.\nReporting by Mukhammadsharif Mamatkulov; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Alexander Smith\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-24T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-24T20:09:56.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
