Of those, 40 involved abuse and/or harassment and were investigated internally.\n“Of these 40 cases, 24 were cases of sexual harassment or abuse,” the group said in a statement.\n“Two of these were situations of sexual abuse or harassment by MSF staff against non-MSF staff (patients or members of the community). In total, out of the 24 cases of sexual harassment or abuse, 19 people were dismissed.”\nThe statement did not provide details of where the harassment or abuse took place, who was dismissed and whether the complaints were also registered with local law enforcement.\nMSF is one of the world’s largest non-governmental organizations, with local and international staff working for long periods in extreme conditions, including war zones and during natural disasters.\nOxfam, which has around 2,500 staff and 31,000 volunteers globally, receives around 32 million pounds ($44 million) of British government funding a year. The European Commission has said it could cut off its funding for Oxfam, which stands at around 68 million euros ($84 million) a year.\nThe scandals are escalating into a broader crisis for Britain’s aid sector by bolstering critics in the ruling Conservative Party who believe the government should reduce spending on aid in favor of domestic priorities.\nWriting by Luke Baker; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T20:31:23.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
