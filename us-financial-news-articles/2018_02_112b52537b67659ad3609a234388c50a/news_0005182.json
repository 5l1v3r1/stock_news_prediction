Aramco plans to raise capacity at the field by 250,000 bpd of Arab light and raise production of associated gas.\nThe construction packages for Marjan and Berri are expected to be awarded next year and both projects are expected to be completed in 2022.\nSaudi Aramco did not immediately have a comment.\nReporting by Reem Shamseddine; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-01T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T19:18:38.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
