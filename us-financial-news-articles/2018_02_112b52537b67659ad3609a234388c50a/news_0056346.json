The short interest on Fitbit’s outstanding shares is 16 percent.\nAnalysts have said the stock price will continue to be under pressure in the near-term.\nFILE PHOTO: The ticker symbol for Fitbit is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 23, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The company said on Monday that its Ionic smartwatch, launched in October and priced at $300, was not selling as expected because it was not a “mass-appeal” smartwatch.\nExecutives tried to reassure investors that the company was focused on selling more smartwatches that would attract a broader user base in 2018.\nFor comparison, Apple’s smartwatches range from $329-$1,399.\n“We would become further negative on the stock if coming smartwatch launches do not sufficiently improve or differentiate the ecosystem,” Morgan Stanley analysts said.\nFitbit Chief Executive James Park also reiterated the company’s focus on healthcare services - using fitness data to connect users with doctors, hospitals and lifestyle coaches. This business is expected to give the company a more predictable stream of revenue.\nEarlier this month, Fitbit acquired startup Twine Health to boost its healthcare services.\nAnalysts, however, remained sceptical about how quickly this business will ramp.\n“The company has an excellent opportunity ahead with medical applications, but it is unlikely that subscription revenue will contribute meaningfully before 2019,” Wedbush’s Reese wrote.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Shariq Khan; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-27T16:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T16:54:41.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
