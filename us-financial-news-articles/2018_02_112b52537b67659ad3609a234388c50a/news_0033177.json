The results for 2017 include a $5.1 million ($0.66 per diluted share) write-down of the net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Cuts and Job Acts of 2017 (Tax Reform Act) enacted in December. Without the write-down of the net deferred tax asset and gains/losses on securities and stock, diluted core earnings per share would have been $1.82 in 2017 compared to $1.52 in 2016.\nTotal assets increased $29 million, or 2%, from $1.84 billion in 2016 to $1.87 billion in 2017. Total loans increased $119 million, or 15%, to $920 million in 2017 compared to $801 million in 2016. Deposits increased $40 million, or 3%, to $1.64 billion in 2017 compared to $1.60 billion in 2016. This resulted in an increase in the loan to deposit ratio from 49% to 55% during the year. At December 31, 2017 non-interest bearing deposits represented 53% of total deposits. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank decreased from $103 million in 2016 to $62 million in 2017.\nAsset quality at the end of the fourth quarter remains excellent with non-performing assets to total assets of 0.05%, $915,000 in non-performing loans, and no Other Real Estate Owned (OREO). At year end, the allowance for loan losses stood at $13.6 million, or 1.48% of total loans. For 2017, the Bank had a net recovery of ($46,000).\nNet Interest Income increased $5,363,000, or 11% to $55,223,000 in 2017 compared to $49,860,000 in 2016 primarily due to the organic loan growth the Bank achieved in 2017. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the cost of deposits was 0.09%.\nNon-Interest Income decreased from $4,366,000 in 2016 to $924,000 in 2017. During the year, the Bank realized securities losses of ($365,000) compared to realized securities gains of $2.4 million in 2016. The reduction of the securities portfolio during the year was related to restructuring and repositioning in response to the Tax Reform Act.\nNon-Interest Expense increased $851,000, or 2%, to $37.4 million in 2017 from $36.5 million in 2016. This increase was in salaries and employee benefits as the full time equivalent employee count rose from 138 to 169 during the year. This increase mainly took place in the fourth quarter with the hiring of additional relationship managers to better penetrate our at large regional markets and create a dedicated SBA department, as well as backoffice personnel to support this growth. Additionally, effective October 31, 2017, Karen Schoenbaum joined the Bank as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\n“With Karen joining the Bank we have strengthened our leadership team to reflect our increasing size and sophistication,” said Leon Blankstein, ABB’s President, CEO and Director. “Her past experiences will assist us as we build on the results of the first twenty years of American Business Bank while being one of the few remaining independent banks serving small to medium sized business clients in the Southern California market.”\n“In this same quarter we have been thrilled to gain seasoned relationship bankers familiar with our business model and an SBA group that will offer new and existing customers a robust menu of SBA offerings.”\nAMERICAN BUSINESS BANK headquartered in downtown Los Angeles offers a wide range of financial services to the business marketplace. Clients include wholesalers, manufacturers, service businesses, professionals and non-profits. The Bank has opened four Loan Production Offices in strategic areas including our Orange County Office in Irvine, our South Bay Office in Torrance, our San Fernando Valley Office in the Warner Center, and our Inland Empire Office in Ontario.\nAmerican Business Bank Figures in $000, except per share amounts CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (unaudited) As of: December December Change 2017 2016 % Assets:\nCash and non-interest earning deposits $ 32,424 $ 37,560 -13.7 % Interest earning deposits at other financial institutions 9,483 697 1260.5 % Investment Securities:\nUS Agencies 584,950 608,695 -3.9 % Mortgage Backed Securities 86,908 77,420 12.3 % State & Municipals 169,803 260,842 -34.9 % Other 13,326 6,466 106.1 % Total Investment Securities 854,987 953,423 -10.3 % Gross Loans:\nCommercial Real Estate 609,411 519,902 17.2 % Commercial & Industrial 207,293 204,634 1.3 % Other Real Estate 91,699 72,035 27.3 % Other 11,990 4,769 151.4 % Total Gross Loans 920,393 801,340 14.9 % Allowance for Loan & Lease Losses (13,639 ) (12,965 ) 5.2 % Net Loans 906,754 788,375 15.0 % Premises & Equipment 1,273 1,442 -11.7 % Other Assets 68,628 62,886 9.1 % Total Assets $ 1,873,549 $ 1,844,383 1.6 % Liabilities:\nDemand Deposits $ 863,409 $ 831,838 3.8 % Money Market 728,402 721,720 0.9 % Time Deposits and Savings 47,925 45,718 4.8 % Total Deposits 1,639,736 1,599,276 2.5 % FHLB Advances / Other Borrowings 62,000 103,000 -39.8 % Other Liabilities 19,010 6,470 193.8 % Total Liabilities $ 1,720,746 $ 1,708,746 0.7 % Shareholders' Equity:\nCommon Stock & Retained Earnings $ 160,880 $ 148,532 8.3 % Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income / (Loss) (8,077 ) (12,895 ) -37.4 % Total Shareholders' Equity $ 152,803 $ 135,637 12.7 % Total Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity $ 1,873,549 $ 1,844,383 1.6 % Capital Adequacy:\nTangible Common Equity / Tangible Assets 8.16 % 7.35 % -- Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio 15.26 % 15.09 % -- Tier 1 Capital Ratio 15.26 % 15.09 % -- Total Capital Ratio 16.51 % 16.35 % -- Tier 1 Leverage Ratio 8.55 % 7.54 % Per Share Information:\nCommon Shares Outstanding 7,539,922 7,441,655 -- Book Value Per Share $ 20.27 $ 18.23 11.19 % Tangible Book Value Per Share $ 20.27 $ 18.23 11.19 % American Business Bank Figures in $000, except per share amounts\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (unaudited) For the 12-month period ended:\nDecember December Change 2017 2016 % Interest Income:\nLoans $ 37,559 $ 31,564 19.0 % Investment Securities 19,377 19,786 -2.1 % Total Interest Income 56,936 51,350 10.9 % Interest Expense:\nMoney Market, Interest Checking & Savings 1,232 1,154 6.8 % Time Deposits 152 180 -15.7 % Repurchase Agreements / Other Borrowings 329 156 110.8 % Total Interest Expense 1,713 1,490 15.0 % Net Interest Income 55,223 49,860 10.8 % Provision for Loan Losses (600 ) (100 ) 500.0 % Net Interest Income After Provision for Loan Losses 54,623 49,760 9.8 % Non-Interest Income:\nDeposit Fees 1,793 1,598 12.2 % Realized Securities Gains (Losses) (365 ) 2,379 -115.3 % Other (504 ) 389 -229.5 % Total Non-Interest Income 924 4,366 -78.8 % Non-Interest Expense:\nCompensation & Benefits 23,919 19,116 25.1 % Occupancy & Equipment 2,669 2,525 5.7 % Other 10,764 14,860 -27.6 % Total Non-Interest Expense 37,352 36,501 2.3 % Earnings before income taxes 18,195 17,625 3.2 % Provision for Income Tax (9,876 ) (4,792 ) 106.1 % NET INCOME $ 8,319 $ 12,833 -35.2 % After-Tax Realized Securities (Gains) / Losses $ 167 $ (1,732 ) After-Tax Cash Value -
