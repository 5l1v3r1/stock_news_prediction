VW’s chief lobbyist was suspended over the affair.\n“All global research activities are to be compared with current ethic and moral principles of the VW group and, in the next step, brought into line,” a VW spokesman said late on Friday.\nCritics said that emissions-related research projects sponsored by automakers are mainly designed to discredit regulation and prove limited environmental damage from diesel engines and related technologies.\nWolfsburg-based VW said it is engaged in nearly 1,300 projects in Germany with universities and research institutes.\nTo prevent a recurrence of experiments such as the diesel fumes tests involving monkeys and humans, VW’s top management has proposed to introduce a set of rules to enable staff to decide whether certain actions are morally and ethically proper, VW said.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by David Goodman\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-24T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-23T22:45:56.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
