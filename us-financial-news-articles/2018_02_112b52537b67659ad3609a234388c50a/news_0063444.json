I believe an 11 percent growth rate could be reached, just to be cautious.”\nAnalysts said this month’s big fourth-quarter upgrades for Europe could be linked to the strong cost-cutting potential of their companies and a booming global economy.\n“The economic growth we’ve seen over 2017 is much greater than anyone had expected, probably including the companies themselves, and that has fallen straight to the bottom line,” said Manulife Asset Management investment analyst Will Hamlyn.\n“Every possible opportunity for savings has been squeezed out of U.S. corporates and that’s not the case in Europe, where there’s still room for companies to be leaner and leaner.”\nSlideshow (2 Images) According to UBS estimates, a net of 13 percent of European companies have beaten earnings expectations -- higher than the second and third quarters and just above the seven-year average.\nThe UBS strategists said that a key driver of the performance was operating leverage, with sectors that have greater cost-cutting potential, such as autos and consumer durables, leading the way.\n“For some time we have argued that operational leverage is a key driver for the European earnings recovery. We are now seeing it come through strongly,” they said.\nMIXED BLESSING In the United States, where earnings season is approaching its end and profit margins are seen at peak levels by Hamlyn and other investors, fourth-quarter earnings are seen rising 15 percent overall, little changed from the 14.8 percent estimated the previous week, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data shows.\nBut to say Europe’s stronger than expected fourth-quarter earnings backdrop justifies a shift from the United States into European equities may be stretching the argument.\nPresident Donald Trump’s sweeping tax cuts are set to keep U.S. earnings growth well ahead of Europe’s in 2018.\nFor 2018, S&P 500 earnings are seen rising by 19.1 percent, up from the 12 percent growth forecast at the start of January, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.\nIfigest's Franchini still expects the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 .SPX to outperform the STOXX this year.\n“Tax cuts first are going to give Wall Street a big boost, but there’s also defense spending picking up and the unprecedented infrastructure plan,” he said, referring to a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package that has yet to be approved.\nEuropean companies with a U.S. presence are likely to receive a lift from the tax cuts, though the impact on bottom lines is expected to be patchy given the variety of corporate structures under which they operate in America.\nThe very strong U.S. earnings momentum and spending plans prompted the world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock ( BLK.N ), to upgrade its view on U.S. stocks this month. At the same time it cut European stocks to neutral.\nReporting by Danilo Masoni and Lewis Krauskopf; Additional reporting by Kit Rees; Editing by Tom Pfeiffer and David Goodman\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T18:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T19:16:33.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
