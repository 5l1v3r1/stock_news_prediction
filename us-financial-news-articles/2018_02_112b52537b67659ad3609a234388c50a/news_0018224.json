For example, users can ask Siri to show a Bloomberg broadcast, which will trigger the live stream, notes TechCrunch . \nBesides now being able to watch live news broadcasts, people can also use the Apple TV app to watch shows or movies they bought or rented via iTunes, or watch certain sports events via a Sports category that features some ESPN broadcasts. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nIn December, Amazon’s Prime video streaming service became available through the Apple TV app, allowing people to search for shows on Amazon Prime within the Apple app. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-09T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T22:40:52.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
