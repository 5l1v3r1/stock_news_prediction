The Knicks called timeout, and Tim Hardaway Jr. missed a 3 as time expired.\nAntetokounmpo hit 10 of 21 shots and went 8-for-12 from the free throw line while adding 11 rebounds for the Bucks, who were playing without point guard Malcolm Brogdon after an MRI revealed a partially torn left quadriceps tendon that will sideline him six to eight weeks.\nKristaps Porzingis and Kanter scored 17 each to lead New York, which shot 40.4 percent and was just 5-for-25 from beyond the arc.\nParker had been sidelined since Feb. 8 of last season when he tore his left ACL for the second time in his brief career. He played his limit of 15 minutes and showed few signs of rust in the opening half, scoring 12 points on 4-of-7 shooting. He got his first true test of the knee in the final minute of the first quarter, driving the length of the court, planting and going up for a dunk.\nHe didn’t make the bucket but did draw contact and split a pair of free throws, tying the game at 27. New York took a one-point lead into the second quarter, and it was a 55-55 game at halftime.\nIt was tied again to open the fourth, but the Knicks pulled ahead with five straight points to open the quarter before Milwaukee responded with a 9-0 run to go up 83-79 on Matthew Dellavedova’s 3-pointer with 8:15 to play.\nMilwaukee still led by three when Eric Bledsoe fouled out with 6:28 to go. The Knicks outscored Milwaukee, 7-2, over the next three minutes to go up a pair with 3:25 left.\nAntetokounmpo converted two free throws a minute later, tying the game at 88, and after Porzingis put the Knicks back in front with a layup, an Antetokounmpo jumper tied the game again with two minutes remaining, setting the stage for his heroics shortly afterward.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-03T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-03T21:36:42.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
