In addition to creating his own project for Skydance, Nathan will lend his expertise providing guidance on projects in our development pipeline.”\n“I’m ecstatic to be joining the burgeoning team of Skydance Media’s animation studio,” added Greno. “From my first meeting with David, Dana, and Bill, I knew Skydance was the creative home I’d been searching for. I feel very much in step with David’s vision of what an animation studio should be.”\nGreno directed Disney’s 2010 animated hit Tangled, which grossed over $590 million worldwide. He has spent the past two decades working at Disney, including serving as creative advisor on Best Animated Feature Oscar winner Big Hero 6. Additional Disney credits include Frozen and Bolt.
