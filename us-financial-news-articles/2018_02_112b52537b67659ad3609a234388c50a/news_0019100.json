Food and Agriculture Organization says a 50 percent jump in global agricultural production is needed to support a projected world population of nearly 10 billion people by 2050.\nIn the world’s most unequal continent, where large swathes of land belong to industrial farms, plantations and ranches, barriers to land ownership make the poorest farmers more vulnerable, Otero said.\nFarmers renting parcels of land for short periods also have little incentive to protect the local environment, he said.\nAncestral techniques such as terracing to prevent soil erosion and drip irrigation to maximize scarce water supplies could be combined with technological solutions to make agriculture more resilient to a changing climate, noted Otero.\nSwitching agricultural chemicals for microbial alternatives could also reduce soil degradation, he said, underlining the need to integrate forest management better with crop and livestock farming.\n“There is a new equilibrium in agriculture that necessarily has to be in better harmony with nature so that we can maintain and hopefully increase high yields but above all, preserve natural resources for future generations,” he said.\nReporting by Sophie Hares; editing by Megan Rowling.
