Later officials said it would start this month but so far it has not.\nIraqi forces launched a security operation along the planned oil transit route this month to clear the area from militants.\nKirkuk crude sales have been halted since Iraqi forces took back control of the oilfields from the Kurds in October.\nKurdish forces took control of Kirkuk in 2014, when the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of Islamic State. The Kurdish move prevented the militants from seizing the region's oilfields.\nIraq and Iran are also planning to build a pipeline to carry oil from Kirkuk. The planned pipeline could replace the existing export route from Kirkuk via Turkey and the Mediterranean.
