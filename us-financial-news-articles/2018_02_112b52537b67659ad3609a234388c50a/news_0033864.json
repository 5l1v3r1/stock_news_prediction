The four largest cable and satellite companies lost 1.5 million pay TV customers in 2017.\nGoogle is betting that its strong sports offering will help win over more subscribers, said Heather Moosnick, director of content partnerships, YouTube TV.\n“Sports is really one of the key offerings that a millennial would be willing to pay for a live TV service,” she said.\nTo that end, Google has targeted sports fans with its TV ads this year. Ninety-six percent of YouTube TV’s ads on television so far this year have appeared during sports programming, including the Super Bowl, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks TV ads.\nWhen Google launched YouTube TV last April it was cautious with how much content it was offering so that it could keep the price low enough to entice cord cutters or people considering cutting the cord, Moosnick said.\nAt launch YouTube TV offered almost 50 channels in five markets. With these additions, YouTube TV will have almost 60 channels, and be in 100 markets, Moosnick said.\nThe new pricing will take effect for new users who sign up after March 13, the company said.
