(Nasdaq: RIOT) (the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that Remo Mancini has been appointed to the Riot Blockchain Board of Directors. Mr. Mancini will serve as Lead Director and will serve as Chairman of the Audit Committee, as a member of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and as a member of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Mancini will serve as an appointed member of the Board until the next annual meeting of shareholders at which directors shall be elected, which is expected to be held on or before May 15, 2018.\nMr. Mancini combines his experience as a former Canadian and U.S. senior corporate executive, corporate director, and former Ontario Cabinet Minister to bring a valuable perspective to business affairs and corporate governance.\nMr. Mancini's diverse, hands-on board leadership experience is extensive. He has served on a number of Boards of companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and Venture Exchange (TSX and TSX-V), along with private company Boards and the Boards of several international business organizations promoting trade, investment and business opportunities.\nIn the business world, Mr. Mancini brought publicly acclaimed leadership to both the Canadian Transit Company and the Detroit International Bridge Company, the private companies that own, manage, and operate the Ambassador Bridge, the world's busiest commercial border crossing, where he served as Executive Vice-President.\nAs a distinguished member of the Ontario Legislature for 18 years, Mr. Mancini was a Member of the Cabinet, serving in both economic and social portfolios (including Minister of Revenue). He also held the notable positions of Parliamentary Assistant to the Premier, Official Opposition Party House Leader, Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.\nMr. Mancini has earned the internationally recognized designation of ICD.D and is a graduate of the Directors Education Program offered by the Institute of Corporate Directors and the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nSeparately, the Company also announced NASDAQ's acceptance of the plan of compliance submitted in order to comply with the requirement to hold its 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, previously adjourned due to the inability to attain the required 50% plus one vote authorized by shareholders at the August 2017 Special Shareholder's Meeting and under the Company's by-laws. The original 2017 Annual meeting was adjourned twice, as votes required to achieve a quorum (approximately 4.2 million votes) fell far short of the required vote by approximately 3 million shares.\nIn its submission, the Company also provided information requested by NASDAQ that the required quorum was increased from 33.3% to 50% plus one vote at the August 2017 Special shareholder meeting and that the Company's outstanding shares increased to approximately 11 million from approximately 4.5 million during 2017, which added to the logistical complexities of achieving a quorum. Further, and contrary to media reports, NASDAQ was advised the Company would have had no difficulty reserving a room at this over 1,000 room hotel on short notice as was the case in August 2017 should the meeting quorum have been reached prior to adjournment.\nAbout Riot Blockchain\nRiot Blockchain, Inc. is leveraging its expertise and a network of professional advisors to build and support blockchain technologies. It is establishing an Advisory Board with technical experience intending to become a leading authority and supporter of blockchain, while providing investment exposure to the rapidly growing Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystems.
