Investment banking revenue rose 4.9 percent, while asset management revenues rose more than 20 percent.\nCredit Agricole has lately restructured shareholding ties with its co-operative parent lender and re-focused the business on France and Italy.\nThis has won the backing of investors, helping it eclipse SocGen as France's second-biggest listed bank.\nCredit Agricole, whose results were published on the company's website, proposed a dividend of 0.63 euros per share versus 0.6 euros a year earlier.\nEarlier this month, SocGen reported forecast-beating fourth quarter results although profits at BNP Paribas - France's biggest listed bank - fell short of market forecasts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-14T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-14T08:54:29.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
