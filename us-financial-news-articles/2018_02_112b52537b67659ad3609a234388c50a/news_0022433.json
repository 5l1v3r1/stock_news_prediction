(the “Company”) today declared its regular quarterly dividend of $0.25 per Common Share payable on March 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 19, 2018.\nThe Company also announced that the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) has approved its normal course issuer bid renewal for a portion of its Common Shares. The normal course issuer bid will be made in accordance with the requirements of the TSX. The Company may begin to purchase Common Shares on February 16, 2018, under this renewal.\nAs of January 31, 2018, 31,234,484 Common Shares were outstanding. Pursuant to the renewed normal course issuer bid, the Company is permitted to acquire a maximum of 2,782,596 Common Shares, being 10% of the public float as of January 31, 2018, in the 12-month period commencing February 16, 2018, and ending on February 15, 2019.
