They have coincidentally done well and it's profit-taking. But I think their fortunes are going to diverge and this correlation won't survive the test of time,\" London Capital Group head of research Jasper Lawler said.\n\"The other factor is that big $70 level in Brent. That is pretty much the top of the range for most forecasts out there. So again, thats a price level that gives some pause for thought. I dont think we should go back to 60 but I think probably 65 seems like a logical area to ... start refocusing on the fundamentals of the market versus general sentiment.\"\nGoldman Sachs raised its three-month forecast for Brent to $75 from $62 and its six-month forecast to $82.50 from $75.\nOil prices are unlikely to advance much above $70 a barrel in 2018, given the tug of war between OPEC and the U.S. shale industry, a Reuters poll showed on Wednesday.\nU.S. crude oil production in November surpassed 10 million bpd for the first time since 1970, and neared the all-time output record, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.\nThe EIA also reported the biggest increase in crude oil stocks since March last year, a rise of 6.8 million barrels.\n\"As oil prices rise, higher shale output is definitely on the market's mind,\" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.\nOutput by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also rose in January from an eight-month low as higher output from Nigeria and Saudi Arabia offset a further decline in Venezuela, a Reuters survey found.\nHowever, adherence by producers included in the deal to curb supply rose to 138 percent from 137 percent in December, suggesting commitment is not wavering even as oil prices hit their highest since 2014.\n(Additional reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Alison Williams)", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T16:46:08.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
