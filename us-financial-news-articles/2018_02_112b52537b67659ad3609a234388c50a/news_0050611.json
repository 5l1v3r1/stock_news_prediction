I am not going to quit until I get that record, that is for sure, no matter how much pain I am in,” Vonn told reporters.\n“But I really hope it only takes one more season because it would be difficult for me to continue on after that,” she added.\nIf Vonn does need a second season to get past Stenmark’s record she might think about extending her career.\nAlpine Skiing - Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics - Women's Alpine Combined - Jeongseon Alpine Centre - Pyeongchang, South Korea - February 22, 2018 - Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. gestures during the Women's Slalom part of the Women's Alpine Combined. REUTERS/Toby Melville “If for some miracle I make it to after next season then maybe I would consider continuing on, it all depends on my health. You can guarantee that I am going to continue fighting until I get that record,” she said.\nBut Vonn, who won Olympic downhill gold in Vancouver in 2010 but missed out in Sochi four years ago due to injury, said she felt emotional that she was probably at her last Olympics.\nSlideshow (2 Images) “I am just sad. I am a racer and I love racing and the Olympics are the pinnacle of our sport and I love it. I love being in the starting gate, it is just a totally different experience, I am going to miss it a lot,” she said.\n”My mind is still telling me I can do things that my body is telling me I can’t. So that is reason why it is frustrating for me because I would love to keep going.\n“I wish I could tell you that I was going to race in four years and be a competitive threat but unfortunately it’s just not the way it is,” Vonn said.\nThe Minnesota-born skier said her performance in the slalom section on Thursday was a stark example of how she can no longer compete in the way she used to.\n“It’s frustrating because in my mind I know what I am capable of but my body just doesn’t follow. When you get to a certain point after a certain amount of injuries you just can’t get back to the level you were at,” she added.\nEditing by Ed Osmond\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-22T11:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T12:13:57.007+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
