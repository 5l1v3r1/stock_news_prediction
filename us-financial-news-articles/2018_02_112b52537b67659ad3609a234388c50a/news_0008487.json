A lack of charging stations is also likely to slow the introduction of EVs.\nReporting by Naomi TajitsuEditing by Christopher Cushing\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-05T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-05T10:46:55.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
