Over 2.5 million of those contracts worth more than 500 million dirhams ($136 million) have changed hands, the exchange said.\nTrading volumes in many of the single-stock futures have been modest. However, Ali described investors’ response to them as encouraging and said futures now existed for 17 UAE-listed companies, up from an original seven, with the number of brokerages involved in the trade rising to nine from four.\nWith the exception of Kuwait, Gulf countries have been slow to introduce equity derivatives, fearing they could destabilise markets.\nBut as low oil prices drain liquidity from the region, several bourses plan derivatives to try to stimulate investment. Saudi Arabia’s securities exchange, the region’s largest, says it expects to introduce stock futures and options in 2020.\nNasdaq Dubai’s website showed Dubai index futures, due to expire on June 21, trading at 3,328 on Sunday while the underlying index was down 0.6 percent at 3,310 points. Abu Dhabi index futures were at 4,560 while the index was up 0.2 percent at 4,586 points.\nNasdaq Dubai said it was in talks with regional and international financial institutions that wished to take part in trading equity futures or clearing them.\nThe exchange added that it planned to create futures covering regional MSCI equity indexes under a licensing agreement announced last October, as well as more single-stock futures and options at a later date.\nWriting by Andrew Torchia; Editing by Toby Chopra\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-18T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-18T12:02:23.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
