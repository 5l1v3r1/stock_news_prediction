The island will host three separate cryptocurrency conferences over the next six weeks.\nSpeaker Brock Pierce, co-founder of Blockchain Capital, a venture capital firm investing in blockchain-enabled technology, said Puerto Rico has the mix of entrepreneurial spirit and tax benefits to make it an attractive launch pad for a what he views as a digital currency revolution.\n“We leave the pilot phase” in 2018, Pierce said. ”We’ve been connecting all the dots, getting all the pieces in place. This is the year when scalability hits, when big ideas become possible.”\nReporting By Nick Brown; Editing by Daniel Bases\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-13T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-13T01:13:48.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
