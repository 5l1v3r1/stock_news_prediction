Only tired, nothing else,” the spokesperson said.\nWhile the 33-year-old Vonn rarely competes in slalom events these days, Mowinckel already has a silver from the giant slalom and will fancy her chances of gold in the combined as she targets a third medal of the Games.\nMikaela Shiffrin came into the event as America’s main hope for gold and despite finishing 1.98 seconds behind Vonn, she will still feel she can make up the time in the slalom leg given her prowess in the technical events.\nShiffrin won gold in giant slalom here to add to her slalom gold from Sochi four years ago.\nWith 25 skiers having run, Switzerland’s Michelle Gisin was third fastest in the downhill leg, 0.77 seconds behind Vonn, while Austria’s Ramona Siebenhofer is well placed in fourth spot 0.97 seconds off the lead.
