Many fear this this issuance is ill-fated, given the recent surge in U.S. yields and Federal Reserve plans to raise interest rates and withdraw liquidity from the market after years of quantitative easing.

February saw the yield on the 10-year treasury bond hit four-year highs. Bond yields move inversely to prices. \nTrepidation over mounting debt is not new; numerous CEOs and finance officials have cited greater leverage across both emerging and advanced economies as among the greatest threats to global economic stability. Goldman Sachs recently described U.S. federal deficit spending as headed into \"uncharted territory.\" \nAnd U.S. National Intelligence Director Dan Coats labeled the nation's debt — up to $20.7 trillion and set to rise thanks to Congress's recently passed fiscal plans — a \"dire threat\" to the nation's security. \n\"We always look at what causes cycles in the debt market; it's always obvious in retrospect, but at the front end we never really know what causes it,\" Kruse said, adding that U.S. political risk and broader geopolitical risk are also factors. \n\"The answer is we have a lot of debt outstanding in the U.S. right now. The market's been very strong for a very long time — when it starts to break down, that's when we can attack.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T18:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T18:26:29.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
