Fire Bureau of Taichung City via REUTERS \nPower was restored to all affected areas in Hualien, although 8,500 homes are still without water. \nThe military will work with local government officials to develop a plan to demolish a hotel, a residential building and other dangerous buildings, it said in its statement. \nThe government vowed to redouble efforts to revise building regulations, aiming to limit damage in any future episodes.
