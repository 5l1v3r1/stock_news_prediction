Competitors can charge 0.112799 peso per minute for mobile calls to their networks, it said.\nRival AT&T Inc calculated that for every peso cent America Movil can charge for interconnection fees, the company’s competitors in Mexico would collectively pay about $20 million per year.\nAmerica Movil declined to comment.\nSlim holds about two-thirds of mobile phone subscriptions in Mexico.\nReporting by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-22T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-22T07:20:49.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
