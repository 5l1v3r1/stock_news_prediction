Bennett, who got his master’s degree in sports management, said those tickets included ones for Boston Red Sox baseball games.\nFormer Georgeson LLC employee Michael Sedlak, (center), and defense attorney David Spears (R) enter the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Nate Raymond Bennett testified as a government witness in the trial of Sedlak and three other ex-Georgeson employees, Donna Ackerly, Charles Garske and Richard Gottcent, who have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and honest services wire fraud charges.\nBennett pleaded guilty in 2015 and was later sentenced to one year of probation, although he acknowledged he did not tell the truth when federal authorities first questioned him about the scheme in 2012.\nFormer Georgeson LLC employee Donna Ackerly, (center), enters the federal courthouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S. February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Nate Raymond “I thought I could talk my way out of it,” he said. “I didn’t think it was that major of an issue, but apparently it is.”\nProsecutors say Bennett, who worked first in Maryland for ISS and later in Boston, from 2007 to 2012, supplied information to Sedlak, who provided it to Ackerly, Garske and Gottcent.\nAckerly and Garske then arranged for clients to be billed for some of the bribes using false descriptions like “courier services,” prosecutors said.\nThe goal, prosecutors said, was to gain an illegal edge in their work helping companies shape strategies that could affect the outcome of shareholder votes.\nThe defendants contend the information was not confidential. Georgeson agreed in November to pay $4.5 million and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve related charges.\nReporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-28T00:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T01:05:10.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
