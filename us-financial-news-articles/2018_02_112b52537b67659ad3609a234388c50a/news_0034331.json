Four years after denying Austrian brothers Andreas and Wolfgang Linger a hat-trick of titles in Sochi, Wendl and Arlt put in two flawless runs at Pyeongchang’s Olympic Sliding Centre to edge out silver-winning Austrian duo Peter Penz and Georg Fischler. The favoured German pair of Toni Eggert and Sascha Benecken, who had won virtually every major trophy over the past two seasons, had to be content with bronze. Germany have now won two out of three of the luge titles at the Pyeongchang Games, following Natalie Geisenberger’s second successive triumph in the women’s singles on Tuesday.

Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt of Germany celebrate winning gold. REUTERS/Edgar Su Wendl and Arlt had been decidedly second best to Eggert and Benecken throughout the season but stunned the world champions with a sizzling opening run of 45.820 seconds to top the timesheets. The Austrian duo of Peter Penz and Georg Fischler also threw down the gauntlet with a blazing first effort to leave Eggert and Benecken third at the interval. Slideshow (3 Images) That was how the podium positions remained as Wendl and Arlt summoned up their Olympic experience to continue Germany’s dominance of the event. German athletes have now won 11 out of 15 of the doubles golds in luge dating back to the 1964 Innsbruck Games. A number of pairs struggled with the tricky ice track, including the Ukraine team of Olesandr Obolonchyk and Roman Zakharkiv, who careered down the course like a pin-ball on their first run, leaving their coach yanking at his long beard in frustration. Despite allowing mixed gender teams since 1994, the doubles event remains male-dominated due to height, weight and strength compatibility issues between athletes of the opposite sex.
