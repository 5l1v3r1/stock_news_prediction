Neither company responded to requests for comment on Tuesday's offer.\nProxy advisory firm Glass Lewis on Tuesday recommended Qualcomm shareholders vote for all six director nominees Broadcom has put forward. Last week, Institutional Shareholder Services had recommended four Broadcom nominees.\nNXP's shares rose 6.2 percent to $125.80 on opening. The stock has traded above the original offer price for nearly seven months, reflecting expectations among investors that the offer would be raised.\nShares of Qualcomm were down more than 3 percent and those of Broadcom were up more than 2 percent in morning trading.\nNew terms\nThe buyout of NXP will help Qualcomm, which provides chips to Android smartphone makers and Apple , to expand in the fast-growing market for chips used in automobiles and reduce its dependence on a cooling smartphone market.\nUnder the new terms agreed with NXP's board, Qualcomm said it needs to buy a minimum 70 percent of NXP's outstanding shares in a tender offer, instead of the 80 percent required in the earlier agreement. The latest offer values NXP at $44 billion.\nIf Qualcomm does buy more than 70 percent in the tender offer, it can force the remaining shareholders to sell out without further negotiations.\nSan Diego-based Qualcomm agreed to buy Netherlands-based NXP for about $38 billion more than a year ago, but some NXP shareholders resisted a sale seeking a better price.\nQualcomm said on Tuesday it had entered into agreements with nine NXP stockholders, who collectively own more than 28 percent of NXP, including top shareholder Soroban Capital Partners LP and second-largest Elliott.\nActivist hedge fund Elliott, which had resisted Qualcomm's previous $110 per share offer saying it undervalued NXP, said it was pleased that NXP's value had been recognized in the revised transaction terms.\nQualcomm has also extended its tender offer for NXP until March 5, a day before the shareholder meeting, when Broadcom's slate of directors will also go to a vote.\nQualcomm, which plans to fund the additional $6 billion with cash on hand and new debt, said approval from China's Ministry of Commerce is the only regulatory nod remaining for the closure of the NXP deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-20T14:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-20T14:37:12.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
