Malloy signed a $41.3 billion, two-year state budget into law in October, nearly four months late.\nSenate Republican President Pro Tempore Len Fasano criticized the governor and his recommendations in a statement on Monday.\n“(Malloy) is living up to the labels that have ruined Connecticut’s image across the country,” Fasano said. “He is going back to what he has always said: ‘Let’s tax more!’ His proposal would move Connecticut backwards.”\nMalloy also recommended ways to protect Connecticut from potential impacts of the new federal tax bill. One proposal would allow municipalities to create charitable organizations supporting town services, according to the presentation.\nThe sweeping Republican tax bill signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump introduced a $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local income and property taxes, known as SALT.\nThe SALT provision will affect many taxpayers in states with high incomes, property values and taxes, including Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and California.\nOn Jan. 26, Malloy, along with the governors of New York and New Jersey, announced that the three states had formed a coalition to sue the federal government, challenging the constitutionality of the federal tax bill. The lawsuit has not yet been filed.\nReporting by Stephanie KellyEditing by Daniel Bases and Matthew Lewis\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-06T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-06T00:22:34.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
