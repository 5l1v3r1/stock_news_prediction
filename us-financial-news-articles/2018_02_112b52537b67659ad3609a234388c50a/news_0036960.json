I felt really confident and good in the start.\n“He has been by far the most inspirational person I’ve met.”\nEditing by Greg Stutchbury\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T14:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:25:46.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
