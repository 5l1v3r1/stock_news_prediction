They also want better safeguards against political influence - a reference to the fact that De Guindos will go to the independent ECB directly from a political role in the Spanish government.\nReporting By Jan Strupczewski; editing by Philip Blenkinsop\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-27T14:02:31.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
