Since 2008, the academy has graduated 20 drivers out of more than four million applicants.\nOn Thursday's episode of CNBC's \" Jay Leno's Garage ,\" the host takes a ride with its first ever champion, Ricardo Sanchez, and Leno does not exactly look comfortable in the passenger seat of the 2017 Nissan GT-R NISMO.\n\"You know, he's awful confident considering he's never been here before,\" he tells viewers as Sanchez whips around the Willow Springs race track. But the gamer-turned-pro is at ease because he has been there, at least virtually. \"It's just the same [as in the game],\" he tells Leno.
