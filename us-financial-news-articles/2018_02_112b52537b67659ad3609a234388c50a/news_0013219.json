Mr. Creighton led the companyâ€™s advertising business, but could be given other roles within the company among other possible outcomes, these people said. \nVice has also been working to fill out its top executive ranks to give more support to its co-founder and Chief Executive Shane Smith, who is focusing on long-term strategy and on making content, according to people familiar with the matter.
