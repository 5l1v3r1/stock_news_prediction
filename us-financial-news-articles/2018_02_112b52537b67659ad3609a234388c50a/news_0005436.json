The Obama administration re-designated Syria’s protected status several times so that waves of Syrians who had arrived in later years of the conflict could qualify.\nThere is no end in sight to the Syria conflict. A peace conference in Russia ended on Tuesday with a call for democratic elections, but key opposition demands were ignored after squabbles and heckling of the Russian foreign minister. [nL8N1PP1Z0]\nThe Trump administration has shown a deep skepticism toward the protected status program, announcing its end for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan since President Donald Trump took office last year. Some of those countries were granted the protections more than a decade ago, and the administration argued that their crises had since been resolved.\nRefugee advocates criticized the Trump administration’s decision not to re-designate Syria’s status, saying it ignored the fact that Syria’s conflict continues to produce new refugees.\n“The Trump administration’s decision means that many Syrians who are already here in the U.S. will not be able to apply for TPS status,” said Lia Lindsey, Oxfam America’s senior humanitarian policy advisor.\nSome groups that favor immigration restrictions had opposed an 18-month extension of the humanitarian benefits for Syrians, saying six months would be more appropriate.\nReporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Sandra Maler and Alistair Bell\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2018-02-01T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-01T03:51:25.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
