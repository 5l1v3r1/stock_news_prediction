But Smith and Stanley Johnson each hit a pair of free throws in the final seconds to seal the win for the Pistons, who snapped a three-game losing streak.\nReggie Bullock scored 15 points, Johnson had 14 points, and Blake Griffin added 13 points for Detroit.\nAndrew White scored 15 points, Taurean Prince added 14 points, and Taylor finished with 13 points for the Hawks.\nDetroit opened the second half with a 17-2 run to pull away from the Hawks, who were without veteran leaders Kent Bazemore and Dennis Schroder. Bazemore was held out for rest, and Schroder didn’t play with a back issue. Without them, the Hawks couldn’t keep up with a Detroit team they beat three days earlier in Atlanta.\nThe Hawks scored the game’s first five points and caused Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy to call an early timeout. The Pistons got going from that point and led 22-14 after the first quarter.\nGriffin hit a 3-pointer as time expired on the first half to give the Pistons a 45-33 lead at halftime. Smith led all scorers with 12 points in the first half. Griffin had 10 points in the first half.\nDetroit took a commanding 82-61 lead into the fourth quarter. The Hawks got back within 12 with 4:36 to play.\nDetroit heads into the All-Star Break in ninth place in the Eastern Conference standings. The Pistons return from the break to host Boston on Feb. 23.\nThe Hawks will play at Indiana on Feb. 23 in their first game back from the break and are in the Eastern Conference cellar.\n--Field Level Media\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-15T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-15T20:32:59.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
