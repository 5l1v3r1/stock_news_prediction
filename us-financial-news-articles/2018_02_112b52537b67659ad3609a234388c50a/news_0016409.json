PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. (CSI) (NASDAQ: CSII), a medical device company developing and commercializing innovative interventional treatment systems for peripheral and coronary artery disease, today reported financial results for its fiscal second quarter, ended December 31, 2017.\nThe company’s second-quarter revenues were $52.6 million, an increase of $2.6 million from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin rose to 81.9% from 81.7%, driven primarily by unit cost reductions. Operating expenses increased $3.6 million to $43.4 million, driven primarily by the expansion of the sales force with additional clinical specialists and increased ECLIPSE clinical study activity.\nSecond-quarter net loss was $(0.4) million, or $(0.01) per basic share, compared to a net income of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA was positive in the quarter at $3.4 million.\nScott Ward, CSI’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said “We are encouraged that the adjustments we made to our sales model last quarter resulted in 6% sequential revenue growth. However, we believe that the ramp in productivity from the recent addition of 45 clinical specialists may take longer than we anticipated in October. As a result, we now forecast fiscal year 2018 revenue to be in a range of $215 million to $219 million.”\nAdded Ward, “During the second half of the fiscal year, we forecast continued attractive sequential quarterly revenue growth, due to improving sales productivity, our commercial launch in Japan, and the limited market release of OrbusNeich angioplasty balloons and ZILIENT™ guidewires.”\nInternational Expansion Begins with Commercial Launch of Coronary Device in Japan\nOn February 1, CSI announced that it had commercially treated the first patient in Japan with its Diamondback 360 ® Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System Micro Crown (Micro Crown).\nCSI received PMDA approval for the Micro Crown in March 2017 and reimbursement approval effective February 2018. Medikit Co., Ltd. is CSI’s exclusive distribution partner in Japan. With a controlled launch now underway, CSI expects to complete an initial Micro Crown stocking order during its third fiscal quarter and open approximately 15 accounts by the end of the fiscal year.\nCommented Ward, “We are excited to bring orbital atherectomy technology to Japan. Of the 280,000 Japanese patients who undergo percutaneous coronary procedures each year, 10-20% have severely calcified coronary lesions. The introduction of Micro Crown gives physicians in Japan a cost-effective treatment option for this difficult-to-treat patient population.”\nRhonda Robb Joins Company as Chief Operating Officer\nOn January 25, CSI announced the appointment of Rhonda Robb as Chief Operating Officer. Robb held leadership positions at Medtronic for 30 years, most recently serving as Vice President and General Manager of the Heart Valve Therapies business. She has strong experience leading complex businesses and growing new markets, extensive commercial experience, and a strong track record of building teams and product portfolios that have improved the quality of care for patients with cardiovascular disease.\n“Rhonda is a dynamic and talented executive with extraordinary experience in driving innovation and growth in medical technology,” said Ward. “She has the leadership ability to further build CSI and help us achieve our ambitious growth goals.”\nCSI Expands Product Portfolio to Further Support Peripheral and Coronary Interventions\nOn January 18, CSI announced two new partnerships broadening the company’s product portfolio. CSI is now the exclusive U.S. distributor of OrbusNeich balloon products. Additionally, the company has signed an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with Integer Holdings Corporation for CSI-branded ZILIENT™ guidewires.\nThe company anticipates OrbusNeich’s full balloon product portfolio will become available throughout 2018 and 2019. The broad market launch of the CSI-branded ZILIENT peripheral guidewires is expected to begin later in the current fiscal year. CSI anticipates that additional ZILIENT guidewires for coronary interventions and radial peripheral interventions will be available in the future.\nWard added, “We’re increasing the value and expertise that we bring to physicians and patients by expanding our product portfolio in the key areas where CSI excels. While we don’t anticipate a material top-line impact in fiscal 2018, we’re excited about the long-term growth potential from these new partnerships.”\nFiscal 2018 Third-Quarter and Full-Year Outlook and Commentary\nWard said, “Second-quarter revenues improved, compared to first quarter, due in part to our decision to flex our sales model. Allocating approximately 20 of our sales reps to our coronary franchise helped restore growth and add new account revenue. However, the productivity ramp from the additional 45 clinical specialists fell short of our expectations. We now anticipate that productivity during the second half of the year will be lower than we forecasted in October. As a result, we now expect Fiscal Year 2018 revenues in the range of $215 million to $219 million.”\nFor the fiscal 2018 third quarter ending March 31, 2018, CSI anticipates:\nRevenue in a range of $55.0 million to $56.5 million; Gross profit as a percentage of revenues of about 81.0%; Operating expenses of approximately $45.5 million; Net (loss) income in the range of $(0.9) million to $0.0 million, or net (loss) earnings per common share ranging from $(0.03) to $0.00, assuming approximately 33.2 million average shares outstanding; and Positive Adjusted EBITDA.\nConference Call Today at 3:45 p.m. CT (4:45 p.m. ET)\nCardiovascular Systems, Inc. will host a live conference call and webcast of its fiscal second-quarter results today, February 7, 2017, at 3:45 p.m. CT (4:45 p.m. ET).

Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the respective periods can be found in tables later in this release immediately following the consolidated statements of operations. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for CSI's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)\nAs many as 18 million Americans, most over age 65, suffer from PAD, which is caused by the accumulation of plaque in peripheral arteries reducing blood flow. Symptoms include leg pain when walking or at rest. Left untreated, PAD can lead to severe pain, immobility, non-healing wounds and eventually limb amputation. With risk factors such as diabetes and obesity on the rise, the prevalence of PAD is growing at double-digit rates.\nMillions of patients with PAD may benefit from treatment with orbital atherectomy utilizing the Stealth 360 ® and Diamondback 360 ® Peripheral Orbital Atherectomy Systems, minimally invasive catheter systems developed and manufactured by CSI. These systems use a diamond-coated crown, attached to an orbiting shaft, which sands away plaque while preserving healthy vessel tissue — a critical factor in preventing reoccurrences. Balloon angioplasty and stents have significant shortcomings in treating hard, calcified lesions. Stents are prone to fractures and high recurrence rates, and treatment of hard, calcified lesions often leads to vessel damage and suboptimal results.\nAbout Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\nCAD is a life-threatening condition and a leading cause of death in men and women in the United States. CAD occurs when a fatty material called plaque builds up on the walls of arteries that supply blood to the heart. The plaque buildup causes the arteries to harden and narrow (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow. The risk of CAD increases if a person has one or more of the following: high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, diabetes, or family history of early heart disease. According to the American Heart Association, 16.3 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with CAD, the most common form of heart disease. Heart disease claims more than 600,000 lives in the United States each year. According to estimates, significant arterial calcium is present in nearly 40% of patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Significant calcium contributes to poor outcomes and higher treatment costs in coronary interventions when traditional therapies are used, including a significantly higher occurrence of death and major adverse cardiac events (MACE).\nAbout Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.\nCardiovascular Systems, Inc., based in St. Paul, Minn., is a medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative solutions for treating vascular and coronary disease. The company’s Orbital Atherectomy Systems treat calcified and fibrotic plaque in arterial vessels throughout the leg and heart in a few minutes of treatment time, and address many of the limitations associated with existing surgical, catheter and pharmacological treatment alternatives. The U.S. FDA granted the first 510(k) clearance for the use of the Orbital Atherectomy System in peripheral arteries in August 2007. In October 2013, the company received FDA approval for the Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System. To date, over 356,000 of CSI’s devices have been sold to leading institutions across the United States.

In addition, an explanation of the manner in which CSI's management uses Adjusted EBITDA to conduct and evaluate its business, the economic substance behind management's decision to use Adjusted EBITDA, the substantive reasons why management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors, the material limitations associated with the use of Adjusted EBITDA and the manner in which management compensates for those limitations is included following the reconciliation table.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n(Dollars in Thousands)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) $ (413 ) $ 1,043 $ (2,390 ) $ (815 ) Less: Other (income) and expense, net 105 15 297 (18 ) Less: Provision for income taxes 33 24 66 48 Income (loss) from operations (275 ) 1,082 (2,027 ) (785 ) Add: Stock-based compensation 2,670 2,483 5,740 5,933 Add: Depreciation and amortization 1,047 1,039 2,090 2,056 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,442 $ 4,604 $ 5,803 $ 7,204 Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by CSI and Usefulness of Such Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors\nCSI uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of performance and believes this measure facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by factoring out potential differences caused by depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash charges such as stock based compensation. CSI's management uses Adjusted EBITDA to analyze the underlying trends in CSI's business, assess the performance of CSI's core operations, establish operational goals and forecasts that are used to allocate resources and evaluate CSI's performance period over period and in relation to its competitors' operating results. Additionally, CSI's management is evaluated on the basis of Adjusted EBITDA when determining achievement of their incentive compensation performance targets.\nCSI believes that presenting Adjusted EBITDA provides investors greater transparency to the information used by CSI's management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see CSI's results \"through the eyes\" of management. CSI also believes that providing this information better enables CSI's investors to understand CSI's operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by CSI's management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the items that management excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and the reasons for excluding each of these individual items:\n-- Stock-based compensation. CSI excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expense, while constituting an ongoing and recurring expense, is not an expense that requires cash settlement. CSI's management also believes that excluding this item from CSI's non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand the application of stock-based compensation guidance and its impact on CSI's operational performance, liquidity and its ability to make additional investments in the company, and it allows for greater transparency to certain line items in CSI's financial statements.\n-- Depreciation and amortization expense. CSI excludes depreciation and amortization expense from its non-GAAP financial measures primarily because such expenses, while constituting ongoing and recurring expenses, are not expenses that require cash settlement and are not used by CSI's management to assess the core profitability of CSI's business operations. CSI's management also believes that excluding these items from CSI's non-GAAP results is useful to investors to understand CSI's operational performance, liquidity and its ability to make additional investments in the company.\nMaterial Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Manner in which CSI Compensates for these Limitations\nNon-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for CSI's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations associated with CSI's use of these non-GAAP financial measures are:\n-- Items such as stock-based compensation do not directly affect CSI's cash flow position; however, such items reflect economic costs to CSI and are not reflected in CSI's \"Adjusted EBITDA\" and therefore these non-GAAP measures do not reflect the full economic effect of these items.\n-- Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than CSI, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n-- CSI's management exercises judgment in determining which types of charges or other items should be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures CSI uses. CSI compensates for these limitations by relying primarily upon its GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
