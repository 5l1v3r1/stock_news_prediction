[nL8N1PS1G6] \n“Overall, these agreements will drive better health outcomes and ... better utilization of our drugs,” said Chief Executive Pascal Soriot. \nThe tech tie-ups come two months after AstraZeneca created a new drug development joint venture with a state-backed private equity fund in China, designed to help get new drugs to market more quickly. [nL8N1NW07Y] \nAstraZeneca is in a strong position in China after recently having had five new products added to the National Reimbursement Drug List - Onglyza for diabetes, cancer drugs Iressa and Faslodex, heart medicine Brilinta and antipsychotic treatment Seroquel.
