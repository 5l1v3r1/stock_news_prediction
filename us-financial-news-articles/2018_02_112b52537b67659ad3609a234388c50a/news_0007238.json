Also, cash zinc was trading at a $55.50 a tonne premium to the three-month price CMZN0-3.\n* COPPER SUPPLY: Glencore said its copper output in 2018 should rise to nearly 1.5 million tonnes as its Kabana mine in Democratic Republic of Congo ramps up.\n* NICKEL SUPPLY: Japan’s Sumitomo Corp said it has resumed production at the Amatory nickel-cobalt project in Madagascar from end-January after halting operations earlier last month due to a cyclone.\n* TIN: Indonesia’s PT Tomah said it was aiming for an 18 percent increase in output this year to around 36,700 tonnes, with prices of the metal expected to be between $20,000 and $22,000 per tonne.\n* ALUMINIUM: Aluminium ended up 0.3 percent at $2,225, having earlier hit a two-week low as rising stockpiles in top producer China reinforce worries that the Chinese market remains in surplus despite capacity cuts.\n* OTHER METALS: Copper ended flat at $7,119, tin ended down 1.3 percent at $21,400 while nickel closed up 2.9 percent at $14,000, near a two year high hit on Monday.\nAdditional reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Alison Williams\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/2wZSAEz", "http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html", "http://tmsnrt.rs/2jvdmXl"], "published": "2018-02-01T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-02T12:55:12.005+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
