It was not clear what the order was seeking, and union and airline officials were not immediately available for comment. \nAnalysts have raised concerns about the pilots’ recent decision to unionize at a time when Canada’s WestJet is adding international flights and launching Swoop. \nSwoop is expected to start service as a separate carrier operated by WestJet in June. \n“Management’s actions are a clear violation of the Canada Labour Code, and we urge the CIRB to order them to cease and desist,” Rob McFadyen, chairman of WestJet’s ALPA Master Executive Council said in a statement. \nWestJet was not immediately available for comment. \nDuring a recent call with analysts, WestJet Chief Executive Officer Gregg Saretsky said the carrier estimated it needs around 200 captains to staff Swoop’s planned fleet of 40 aircraft. The Calgary-based company said it would prefer to hire the majority of the pilots from its existing WestJet pilot list.
