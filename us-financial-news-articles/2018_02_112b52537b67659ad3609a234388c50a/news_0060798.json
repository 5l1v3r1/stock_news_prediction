Many of Latvia’s other banks are funded mainly from deposits by non-residents and have only limited domestic lending operations.\nReporting by Gederts Gelzis; Editing by Simon Johnson and Dale Hudson\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-27T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-28T12:41:36.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
