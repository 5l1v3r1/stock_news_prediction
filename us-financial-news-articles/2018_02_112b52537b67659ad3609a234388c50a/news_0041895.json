Non-resident investors sold a net C$1.97 billion ($1.58 billion) in Canadian securities after acquiring C$19.20 billion in November. For 2017 as a whole, foreigners bought C$188.52 billion in Canadian securities, up from the previous high of C$171.77 billion in 2016. International investors sold C$4.03 billion worth of Canadian bonds, mostly provincial bonds. They bought C$1.66 billion in stocks and $401 million in money market paper. Canadians bought a record $21.99 billion in international securities in December, virtually all in stocks. For 2017 as a whole they bought C$84.66 billion in foreign securities, a new all-time high.
