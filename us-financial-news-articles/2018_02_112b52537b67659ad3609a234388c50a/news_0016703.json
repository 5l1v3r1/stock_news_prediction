Emphasizing that it was a straight road, a straight road. ... the fact that she believed me, and I literally watched this little S curve pop up. And it spins her like a top,” Tarantino said. \n“It was heartbreaking. Beyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it is one of the biggest regrets of my life,” he added. \nTarantino denied ignoring Thurman’s anxiety about driving but acknowledged he had been mistaken about the safety of the road.

She got into it because she trusted me,” he said. \nTarantino said he and Thurman reconciled years ago and had talked since the New York Times story was published.

She never meant this to roll over onto me,” he told Deadline. \nThe Oscar-winning director also said that incidents when he spat on Thurman and choked her with a chain were part of the filming process for “Kill Bill” and were carried out with her consent to make the scenes realistic. \nThurman said on her Instagram account on Monday that she was proud of Tarantino for making the crash video available to her after 15 years, saying he did so “with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm.” \nThurman’s account of the car crash overshadowed her accusations of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, who produced “Kill Bill” and “Pulp Fiction.” \nWeinstein’s lawyer on Saturday acknowledged the producer “making an awkward pass” in 1994 but said Thurman’s accusations of an attempted physical assault were false.
