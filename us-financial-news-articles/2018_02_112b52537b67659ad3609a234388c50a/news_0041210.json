Fifteen more people were injured.\nThe 7.2 magnitude quake left nearly a million homes and businesses without power in Mexico City and the south and damaged at least 50 homes in Oaxaca.\nThe state, along with Mexico City, is still reeling from earthquakes that caused widespread damage in September and killed at least 471 people.
