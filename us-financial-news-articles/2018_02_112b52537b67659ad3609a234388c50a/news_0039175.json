I’ll continue to deal with currency market moves with a sense of urgency,” he added.\nAso did not use the word ‘intervention’ at Friday’s news conference.\nThe recent global market sell-off has increased investor appetite for the safe-haven yen.\nA strong yen erodes profits at Japanese manufacturers and could hurt an otherwise buoyant economy, which posted an eighth straight quarter of growth in October-December.\nReporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Eric Meijer\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-16T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-16T06:02:30.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
