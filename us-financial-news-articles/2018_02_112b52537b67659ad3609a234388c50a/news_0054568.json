PTTGC continues to move ahead with its investment plans for mega projects in Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) and a petrochemical complex in the United States, as well as market expansion for plastics in the high-potential CLMV markets, particularly Myanmar and Vietnam.\nOutstanding operating results in 2017\nMr. Supattanapong Punmeechaow, President and CEO of PTT Global Chemical Public Company Limited (PTTGC), announced the company's dramatically-increased operating results for 2017.
