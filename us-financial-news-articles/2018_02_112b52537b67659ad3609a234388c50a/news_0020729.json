Whether risk assets can withstand rising long-term bond yields will determine the course of the currency markets,” said BTMU’s Uchida.\nU.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hovering at 2.839 percent, just shy of its four-year high of 2.885 percent touched on Monday, as the BoE’s stance added to expectations of reduced central bank stimulus globally.\nEditing by Kim Coghill\n ", "external_links": ["http://thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html"], "published": "2018-02-09T08:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2018-02-09T17:07:22.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
