However, it said there were longer term reasons to be cautious, as central banks around the world end their expansionary monetary policies.\n”As interest rates around world rise towards more normal levels, we expect to see downward pressure on asset prices. Our strategy is designed to allow us to benefit from stronger markets while avoiding excessive risk,” he said.\nThe Future Fund was set up just over a decade ago with contributions of A$60.5 billion from government surpluses and the proceeds of the privatisation of the national telecommunications operator Telstra Corporation Ltd.\nIt seeks to achieve returns of 4 percent to 5 percent above inflation.
